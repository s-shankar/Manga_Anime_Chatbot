Highly lauded by his peers as one of the great young minds that will revolutionize the field, he is blessed with a beautiful fiancée and is on the cusp of a big promotion in the hospital he works at. But all of that is about to change with a grave dilemma that Kenzou faces one night—whether to save the life of a small boy or that of the town's mayor. Despite being pressured by his superiors to perform surgery on the mayor, his morals force him to perform the surgery on the other critical patient, saving his life and forfeiting the mayor's. A doctor is taught to believe that all life is equal; however, when a series of murders occur in the surgeon's vicinity, all of the evidence pointing to the boy he saved, Kenzou's beliefs are shaken. Along his journey to unravel the true identity of his little patient, Kenzou discovers that the fate of the world may be intertwined with the mysterious child. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1098, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster plays out like a macabre game of cat and mouse in a world that is frighteningly similar to real life. Uncomfortable subjects such as coercive human conditioning and the psychology of the sociopath, morality issues regarding the origin of evil and the value of human life, are horrifyingly, yet engagingly, realized. The protagonist, Dr. Tenma, struggles to fix that which is so remorsefully broken in his world. Monster is a chilling tale rooted in reality, a far cry from the superpowers and supernatural forces found in more detached fantasy series.\nStory: 10\nThe writing in Monster is exceptional. The pace is a slow burn that smartly\n          \n        captivates the viewer with moments of shock, awe, and depravity, which are masterfully combined with well executed moments of anticipation and proper denouement. Once the show has established the setting and many of the players, the series begins a thrilling, rollercoaster of action, suspense and character development. Viewer will rarely feel as though they have missed an important piece of information, and will instead find themselves riveted to the screen as the overarching mystery unfurls.\nDialogue is not wasted in frivolity for Monster. The anxious atmosphere is enhanced with carefully crafted lines that provide insight into characters' personalities and cast shadows of suspicion. The intelligent interconnectedness of all the characters, especially towards the climax of the show, speaks volumes about the care given to crafting living individuals in appropriate circumstances.\nAnimation: 9\nThe art both augments tone and adds layers of character to the series. The dynamic use of light and shadow often creates red-herrings, skewing the faces of particular characters into unforgiving masks. Character designs stand out for their realism and attention to facial structure, especially regarding emotions. Variety in body type distinguishes characters, allowing viewers to immediately recognize someone from their visage, or even their silhouette, without hesitation. Characters who are old look old, with age lines harrowed into sagging skin. There are distinct differences given to dissimilar nationalities, so much so that the viewer can easily determine whether a character is of Asian, Slavic, or Middle-Eastern decent.\nThe background art is a feat in and of itself. There is a wonderful variety spreading from pastoral vineyards to dilapidated cities. German towns and districts such as Düsseldorf, Bavaria, and Hamburg are executed to a near photorealistic quality that extends into the Czech Republic and France.\nSound: 9\nEveryone in the voice acting crew does well. They suit their characters perfectly and never falter, even in the more dramatic scenes. Sasaki, Isobe, and Kiuchi (Johan, Lunge, and Tenma respectively), give outstanding performances that express the complexity of the emotions, personalities, and experiences of their characters.\nThe sound effects used throughout the series serve to add an additional layer of realism. As a testament to Monster's focus on being accurate even in minute details, each gunshot correctly reflects the weapon which was used to fire it.\nThe OP gives you a hint of what to expect and the ED, \"For the Love of Life\" by David Sylvian, is one of the spookiest ending themes in anime. The soundtrack should also be commended for its spectacular use of subtlety. It truly fits the idea of \"background music,\" often setting the tone of the scene with a simple phrase. Additionally, whilst the series has a relatively limited tracklist, the music never feels repetitive.\nCharacter: 10\nPerhaps Monster's greatest strength lies in the depth of its characters, with the main cast representing some of the strongest leads in the genre, whilst those in the supporting roles are often defined far better than the regular cast in many other series. The show manages to bring its characters to life with extraordinary clarity, and although viewers will be “dazzled” by the quality of the lead roles, they may often find themselves growing attached to the minor characters over the course of the series.\nThe centrepiece of the series is the complex relationship between the Tenma and Johann. Tenma’s emotional, physical, and psychological transitions lead the audience through a complex maze of issues regarding personal and social morality. This is remarkably achieved without losing Tenma’s basic humanity or resorting to didacticism, and contrasts sharply with Johan’s manipulations and calculations which strike a cold, appallingly realistic note with the audience.\nThe supporting ensemble does a great job of adding intensity and gravity to the relationship between Tenma and Johan. They are all well crafted and executed, and often have their own demons and battles that remind the audience of what precisely lies in the balance between good and evil. Discovering why these people are the way they are and how they relate to each other is half the journey as a viewer.\nEnjoyment: 10\nFrom its brilliant characters with outstanding development, to its well-paced story and realistic setting, Monster will leave you on the edge of your seat. Finding a show like this is a real treat, and whilst 74 episodes may seem daunting, it is utterly worthwhile in light of the great journey taken. The show’s dramatic storyline and intrigue filled atmosphere will keep you guessing, thinking, and feeling. The complex issues and relationships addressed throughout mark this as one of the most unique anime to appear in many years, and the questions it asks should be confronted by everyone at least once.\nMonster is a true rarity in anime. The quality of its story, cast and production have earned it widespread acclaim, even garnering it plaudits from the “hate what’s popular” clique. It is both entertaining and enlightening, and the sheer depth of the series has led to it being widely regarded as a modern classic of anime.\nOverall: 10\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the \"Critics and Connoisseurs\" club.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=591,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    \"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you”--Nietzsche \nThose who have seen Monster can attest collectively (whether they liked it or not) to how incredibly uncomfortable and unconventional this show is. The topic of evil is proactively exploited through revealing the extent of human depravity in conjunction with exploring matters like child abuse, mass murder, collective brainwashing, human experimentation, the value of life, and so much more. These are some themes that most people make a conscious effort to keep as far\n          \n        away from as possible, yet Monster sits those rights next to the viewer, maybe even introduces them. It’s a slow descent into a world consumed by violence, angst, murder, and retribution. Yet for every larger “evil”, there is always a counterbalance, a small ray of love and redemption. Thus, Monster reinvents the classic dichotomy of good and evil and does so masterfully. \nIt doesn’t take very long for this show to become an addiction, a classic, a novelty, that one can’t help but indulge in completely and it’s clear why.\nStory 10/10:\nMonster takes the viewer into a world where the line between good and evil is rapidly dissipating; subsequently creating a dark yet realistic environment that is inexplicably terrifying. The story centralizes around a brilliant neurosurgeon Kenzo Tenma, who practices in a distinguished hospital in Germany. He lives a perfect life, with his ideal fiancé and top-notch position. His utopian world abruptly comes to an end when he makes the decision to save a young boy, Johann Liebert. The story from this point starts to slowly unravel and spans into a riveting 74-episode long journey, in which, Tenma aims to correct the mistake that he made by seemingly saving the young Liebert and in the process exposing a shocking reality that will change the course of his life and those he encounters.\n *74-episodes?* Yes, and by God, every single episode was worth it. Fillers are almost non-existent in this show. The real point to marvel at is the way this anime bitch-slaps the viewer with its unparalleled twists and turns. \nThe structure and pacing of this show is incredible. Much of the show is divided into various character arcs (many that Tenma encounters on his journey), who at first seem unrelated to the overarching plot, but every character and their allocated story plays a role into solving the mystery of the “Monster”. That is precisely what makes this show ingenious. The story-telling and plot are perfect not just structurally but also substantially. Monster is filled with philosophical concepts that pick at the viewer’s brain consistently and these very uncomfortable notions are the fundamental blocks of the show. \nThe pacing is skillfully crafted and although slow, it captures the audience with its invigorating interactions and development. There are instances in the show that display rare moments of hope, altruism, and dare I say “humanism” to balance out the overbearing debauchery and utter hopelessness. Therefore, the extensive span of this show is well justified because of the intricacy of this story, that would not have been nearly as compelling if it was shortened. In essence, DO NOT LET “74” EPS TURN YOU OFF, because at the end of episode 74, you will climax, for hours. \nArt/Animation 9/10\nThe animation compliments the story beautifully. An important component that attributes to the success of any story is the setting. With its accurate and picturesque illustrations, the setting not only enhances the overall anime, but brings the viewer into the story as well. Tenma’s journey takes him on a wild goose chase, landing him in the most obscure of places, but the animation displays each and every place remarkably. \n It is obvious, the time that was spent in creating the physical attributes of each specific character. They are all designed realistically and are quite personable. Therefore, this isn’t the anime to go to for bug-eyed, “watermelon-chested” and disproportional characters. The characters are simple, real, and sympathetic, in the sense that the viewer could step into their shoes. As their individual story progresses, the character evolve visually as well. The characters are blessed with this physical realism that is subtle yet evoking.  \nSound/Music 10/10:\nThe accompanying music and dialogue were nearly flawless in Monster. First, the music was not overbearing, instead it fine-tuned the mood and heightened the senses of the viewer. The OP stays consistently the same throughout the anime and for good reason. It is so goddamn creepy yet alluring, that it’s the perfect opening for this masterpiece (same with the ending song). The music throughout the anime is just as fitting. There isn’t an extensive soundtrack for Monster, just relevant music that fits every situation ideally. Second, the creepy atmosphere is ubiquitous in this show and nothing helps that factor more than the music and dialogue. \nDialogue was a personal favorite in this anime. This is simply because the dialogue was so well-written and nothing was ever “out-of-character”. From the colloquial interactions to some of the most enlightening statements, the dialogue had a mix of everything, but it was never over-the-top. The voices of the respective characters couldn't have been any more appropriate (subbed version). Everyone played their part magnificently and after watching the show, it was apparent just how apt the voice actors were especially in regards to the main cast. \nCharacter 10/10\nWhether one loved a character or hated a character, it can be safely asserted that the characters of Monster are undeniably some of the best and unforgettable. Granted that the two main characters of the series, Tenma and Johann are crafted and developed meticulously well, one must recognize the range of supporting characters that were superb as well. Often times, one will end up admiring them more so, partly because of the effort put into molding all of the characters and making them wholesome, both main and supporting. There are no instances of incomplete characterization. \nTenma’s journey manifests vicariously through Johann; both characters are crucial to one another, for they essentially give each other meaning. Their characters are absolutely vital and the anime does not fall short in delivering that. Tenma and Johann can be considered a dichotomous pair: Every move they make, every sentence they say, every facial expression they make, progresses their character just a little closer to that dichotomy. The overarching themes are personified through these characters and the viewer really gets to immerse themselves in the decisions that these two make. Tenma’s and Johann’s development as characters cannot be simply deconstructed. However, they can be considered almost existential by nature due to the explicitly absurd experiences and the importance that “existence rather than essence” plays in defining their characters. There is no doubt that the amount of hours and work that went through in creating these two characters, they truly transcend the customary.\nThe supporting cast is just as essential because they are the means that help this anime arrive at a successful end. The supporting characters really make one realize that this anime isn’t about the end, rather everything that leads to it. Simply, it’s about the means to the end instead of the end itself. That’s the imperative role that each and every supporting role plays in this anime. None of these characters are half-assed, but constructed carefully and logically, and help not only propel the main characters closer to the truth, but the viewers themselves. The best part of this anime is the familiarity it brings to its viewers in terms of character(s). No one can feel indifferent or nonchalant towards the characters in this anime because of the way each individual’s story and feelings are depicted. The main characters, although some change in major ways throughout the show, remain loyal to their core disposition. The character construction and development in Monster is awe-inspiring and commendable.\nIssues:\nEven with masterpieces I personally find flawless, there are some issues that I can address for the sake of reviewing: \n1.	The abrupt halt in some arcs: Sometimes when a sub-arc within Monster came to an end, it would conclude at a point that would be absolutely frustrating and wouldn’t pick up again. This was only a problem because it left some questions unanswered (not really pertaining to the bigger picture), but it felt a bit incomplete in terms of that specific story. \n2.	Convoluted explanations: Perhaps this was just a contrived adaptation “problem” (maybe it was better executed in the manga), and I use “problem” very loosely. However, at certain crucial points, where certain mysteries are being revealed, there tended to be an intentional veil always hovering over it as to keep the viewer confused. Then a little later, things would get resolved, and the resolution would seem a bit far-fetched. Although, this is something that played in favor for this anime for the most part, it got irritating at times. \nOverall Enjoyment 10/10\nMonster is truly a show that reinvents the normative standards for a “masterpiece”. It is the quintessential mystery. With its superb plot –driven, character-driven story, it enraptures the viewers from the beginning and leaves them insatiable at the end of every episode, while completely satisfying them by the finale. One cannot hope for anything more than the kind of adaption this anime brings to life. \nThat being said, this anime isn't for everyone nor would I recommend it as a must-watch to just anyone. Monster resurrects a horrifying world that is so realistic but feels so surreal to the viewer. It deals with a world that no one would want to deal with and shows experiences that no one would want to experience. Yet, it engages the viewer completely. Therefore, if you crave an original mystery, a thought-provoking story, an unconventional tale that will shake your very core, then I suggest, you get acquainted with “Monster”.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=406,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    If you've heard of Monster, then odds are you've probably heard of the incredible hype surrounding it. For a while, Monster has been the absolute critic's darling of anime, being the poster-boy for lofty intellectual types. Because of this, it can be very easy to imagine Monster as being overhyped.\nBut Monster lives up to every word of the praise it gets.\nThe story of Monster begins fairly simply. A skilled Neurosurgeon named Kenzo Tenma is due to perform an operation on a patient, but is called away to operate on a popular singer instead. The singer's life is saved, but his original patient dies. Dr. Tenma\n          \n        is, soon after, called away from another operation due to the mayor needing his services, but this time, he declines, and instead operates on the patient he was originally supposed to save. The operation is a success, but this time, the mayor instead dies. For his insolence, Tenma is to be demoted and replaced... but at the last second, everyone standing in his way is mysteriously killed.\nYears later, Tenma's career is back on track, and he is enjoying a successful life doing what he does best. But one day, a string of bizarre serial murders winds up leading to one of Tenma's patients. Amidst the investigation surrounding him, the patient disappears... Tenma follows, only to see his patient murdered before his eyes, by the orchestrator of the serial killings... Johan Liebert, the boy whose life he chose to save those years ago.\nWhat follows is 70+ episodes of Tenma's frantic search to find the boy he saved, and fix his mistake. Along the way, we meet some of the most unique and interesting, yet believably human characters in the history of anime, matched with amazing, compelling subplots, with all of these both answering mysteries regarding, and yet at the same time, furthering the question: Who is Johan Liebert, and what is he trying to do?\nWhile the 70 episode runtime can be daunting, Monster is a worthy investment of time. While it is driven by compelling mysteries that make you want to watch more, Monster is just as much about enjoying the journey as it is reaching the destination. To hold the viewer's attention for 74 episodes is a feat in of itself, but Monster goes beyond that... it's a show that, once you start watching, you'll never want to stop. Monster is in the master class of suspense. It keeps a constant stream of new twists and developments that, while plentiful, never feel contrived. The characters are both strong and numerous, but while there are countless cast members, unlike many shows where there are large amounts of characters that are completely useless and contribute nothing to the plot, every character in Monster brings something to the mix. Not only that, but they are rarely left open-ended, as Urasawa makes sure to bring back characters from previous arcs, using each one to their fullest extent.\nThe brilliance of Monster also extends past the plot to the production. While Naoki Urasawa's art style is better suited to pen and paper than it is to animation, it doesn't take long to get used to, and the detail is quite noticeable. The genius in Urasawa's distinctive style is in the way he draws faces. The cartoony, yet detailed features have a strange level of warmth to them, but they can also be used to create truly intimidating expressions, ranging from death glares to blank, glassy-eyed gazes. The directing is also top-notch, cutting no corners to create a perfect adaptation to the manga.\nAlso of note is the soundtrack. Every song on it is a fantastic piece of music, beautifully married to the scene it accompanies. Many pieces are subtle, yet brilliant... The Seeds of Time, for example, rather than going for full-on, orchestral bombastics, eases in with quiet, yet tension-ridden power that gradually rises, making for several of the most stunning scenes in the entire series. The opening and ending themes are also very strong... the opening theme, Grain, would have to be, as it is the opening for the entire course of the 74 episode series. The ending themes, For The Love of Life and Make It Home, are strange, ethereal, haunting songs, and match the \"Monster With No Name\" theme of the series that is used in the ending credits perfectly.\nAs for the voice acting, both languages have a very strong cast. In terms of acting quality, the Japanese is the better of the two, if not by a wide margin, featuring several great performances, the highlight of which is Nozomu Sasaki's dead-on, creepy take on Johan. However, while the acting is slightly inferior in the dub, the casting is considerably better. Richard Epcar is perfect for the role of Detective Lunge, and Patrick Seitz' deep tones and off-kilter performance are a great match for the eerily poker-faced Wolfgang Grimmer. The only actor who seems off in the dub is Keith Silverstein's work as Johan, which feels rather unnatural, and overshadowed by his superior Japanese counterpart. Overall, I would recommend the dub, but it's hard to go wrong with either language.\nNow, as much as I hate to say it, Monster isn't quite perfect. It's probably as close as you're likely to find, but it does have one problem. Whilst not so much a fault as a double-edged sword, Urasawa's storytelling technique of switching off to another location whenever the plot starts to get tired can be somewhat problematic. Don't get me wrong... as a storytelling technique, it's a very good one. It helps to keep the viewer's interest and stop the plot from getting stale, and also features prominently in Urasawa's later works, 20th Century Boys and Pluto. The problem is that on some occasions, it gets overused. While Monster is nowhere near as big an offender for this as 20th Century Boys is, it goes off on new plot threads that, while enjoyable, don't really lend anything to the plot. While they often develop into full-fledged and brilliant story arcs, they sometimes end up going nowhere, and in a series where the viewer is dying to find out more, this can be somewhat distracting.\nHowever, any complaints against this series are completely and utterly silenced by the ending. The final six episodes are probably the best in the entire series. The remaining cast members are all given a triumphant finale, as the tension reaches its absolute peak, and it is thoroughly clear that this is what the entire series was leading to. With the exception of one small Deus ex Machina that I shall not name due to spoilers, everything about it is a flawlessly executed conclusion.\nMonster probably isn't something that beginners to anime would enjoy. If you enjoy the medium for the abundant exaggeration, then this probably isn't up your alley. This is more of a classic, cat and mouse detective series than anything you regularly see in anime, and if that sounds like your sort of thing then Monster is an absolute must-watch.\nFinal Words: Exemplary in every single aspect, from the story, to the characters, to the writing, to the directing.\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nMusic/Background: 10/10\nEnglish Dub: 9/10\nOverall: 10/10\nFor Fans Of: Pluto, Gankutsuou.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=319,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    Monster is an anime that I used to scoff at every time I saw high ratings for it. I was never really into long plot driven anime and I couldn't understand how so many people loved it, but seeing the ratings, I couldn't help but be interested. I downloaded this anime over a year ago and burned it on to 3 DVDs, never really intending to watch it. Maybe I did it because of the hype, decided that a highly acclaimed series like this was something every anime fan needed in his/her collection. Or maybe I just did it so I would have something to\n          \n        watch on a rainy day. I don't even remember.\nAnyhow, curiosity and boredom got the better of me one day and I plopped it into my dvd drive to check it out. The story was promising: A brilliant neurosurgeon with everything to gain, loses it all for doing the right thing. I was entranced by the complexity of the story and the moral debate presented by it: are lives equal? It was interesting, but I began to lose interest as my life got busy. This probably (based on my experience) isn't a series you'll want to watch in one go, especially if your new to this type of mystery / thriller genre in anime. It's a good series I recommend for watching a few episodes here and there in the beginning, and eventually, you'll fall for it. It'll work its magic and you'll be lost in the unravelling plot of Dr.Tenma and his journey.\nStory: Monster is focused on telling a story, a story that presents many, many themes to its viewers, insights into the world and the way people work. It takes a good look at the human condition, particularly on the subject of the Monster that every individual carries within. It strongly portrays through Tenma and other characters, human nature to be consumed by hate and resorting to succumbing our savage brutalities, or inner Monsters, only to end up committing horrific acts that we can't take back, acts and emotions that often consume us. It presents to us, the need for identity, and the need for love, trust and equality. These themes are all woven together into a complex story that kept me on the edge of my seat as I progressed through the series, and unlike most long series, Monster didn't get too repetitive. It managed to continue strong through its 74 episodes and finally hand us an ending that - will disappoint some and make others love the series even more. Another thing I would like to take note of, was the children's stories found in the anime, the stories written by the character Franz Bonaparta. I don't know if they are real or not, but they geniusly (is that a word?) complimented the story. They were masterpieces in themselves, and conveyed moods of unease through the almost disturbing feel of the way the such dark and mature themes were represented in children's books for the use of brainwashing. Its things like this that makes Monster great. Its plot is deep, complex, interesting and to some, a masterpiece.\nCharacters: The characters were developed very, very well, and this is one of Monster's strongest points. A change occurs in every character you'll see in this anime, every major character overcomes some sort of trial in their lives and adapts. I could give examples, but like I said, I would be listing every character, from Eva who starts off as a selfish, idiotic *#$%@ to someone a little more proper by the end of the series, and Nina and Dieter who overcome their dark pasts. Tenma's change throughout the series is also quite interesting; its difficult to say whether or not he really changed. We know for certain that he stayed true to his morals and managed to suppress the monster within, but he does have difficulty with accepting his decision at the beginning of the series, and goes so far as to call it his sin. He goes from a happy individual into a depressing one, bent on tracking down Johan and attempting to kill him as his single goal in life. Johan too, was an interesting character, with a troubled and complicated past, it was difficult to judge him as a villain. It's this complexity that's found in every main character of Monster that makes this series such a success; the characters are real, and they change. \nArt / Animation: I found the art quite unique; it was one of the things that drew my attention to this anime. The faces aren't your typical anime faces with the huge eyes and characters with multicoloured eyes. Instead, the characters are quite realistically drawn, which adds to the seriousness of this anime. They also did a good job with the backgrounds, the cities and scenery generally looked very good. In terms of animation, it wasn't something I can really comment on, there are few scenes involving rapid action, explosions and the like, and most of the time the characters are simply walking and talking. But the animation is quite nicely done in the few gun fights seen in the anime, and I never really came across choppy panning or anything really badly animated. The art and animations is consistently well done throughout the anime.\nSound: I really enjoyed the first opening; it set the mood for this anime beautifully. The endings aren't really songs you would like to listen to, but they fit the anime well, the lyrics represented major themes and the storyline of Monster. BG music wasn't too notable at times, but they had a few tracks that complimented the mood very well. Voice acting was also done very well, a lot of the crying sounded very realistic, and the voices matched the characters well, especially Johan's kind of quiet but calm, smooth and charismatic voice. \nOverall: I don't think Monster is a series for everyone, but for those who try it, don't toss it away if the first few episodes failed to please you. The pacing may seem somewhat slow at times, but I can truly say that this anime isn't overrated as I first thought. It's a realistic series with an excellent plot, complimented by its unique art and soundtracks. There is a Monster within us all. I urge you to learn about it - before you are consumed by it. (Lame I know I was trying to think of a witty way to end this long review =p)\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=145,  ["text"]="                          \n    Don't trust this review. Most viewers think this show is a masterpiece, thus by probability you will most likely think the same thing. I'm going to say some harsh things in this review, but even if you think my word is the gospel, you should still watch the first few episodes of the show. And remember, a 6 is not a bad score. I did not dislike this anime at all. \nFirst, on to the good stuff. This has a premise where a man is punished for doing the right thing. It starts off excellently, following his torment and the bizarre chain of consequences following\n          \n        his decision. The art is in a striking style that seems perfectly wed to the story at the beginning. From these first episodes, I had the feeling that this show was going to be a masterpiece. \nHowever, this show slowly collapsed in to its own cage. What was interesting became repetitive, the novelty of the art style wore off, predictable patterns began emerging, and pet peeves that wouldn't make a difference in a 26 episode season became more and more grating. \nI almost don't want to reveal what predictable things become annoying, because maybe the reader wouldn't have noticed it before I said anything. An example, we have a standoff. Two important characters, high suspense, one character pulls the trigger. GUNSHOT sound, cuts away to outside of building, leaving what happens a mystery. Hey, it's suspense! Another one; a character is talking, he will say \"blah blah blah, *pause* no, *pause* blah blah blah\". Why? Its all in the tension, Mr. Smith, no, Mr. Revealed! I know all about you know! It's an effective enough line that if one character had it, as a sort of signature line, it would have been amazing. However, when everyone has the same distinctive signature line, it gets rather silly. A fun little game to play with this anime is to try saying \"iie\" (\"no\") in unison with the character. Another quirky thing that many characters do verbally is repeat a word over and over again, as a sort of dramatic buildup. Often, this will lead up to a scream.  I commented to my friends that the dialogue seemed like it came from a comic book, and they couldn't help but agree. Here's another one: as a character is having a flashback, about to remember something important, something will always cut off the memory (unitl the end of course, when all the beans are spilled). Maybe an interruption, or else maybe she won't want to continue remembering. What we end up with are a gadzillion flashbacks. As another reviewer put it, these are \"shameless efforts to create nail-biters”.  \nSome details in this anime also just don't make sense. Like, nobody even alters their appearance (except Johan). Dr. Tenma is wanted, his face has been all over the news, and he just walks around in broad daylight and is surprised when he is caught. I mean, really? In many cases, he's behaving quite suspiciously too, just begging for attention to be drawn to him. An amusing example of a detail that didn't make sense was when a character walked into a room, she was perfectly composed. She pulls out a gun, and *suddenly* she is completely out of breath, as if she had just run a marathon. Yes, I know pulling a gun on someone is exciting, but it was completely ridiculous. A detail that more amused me than bothered me was the way they used guns in this show. A detective walks into a room, points a gun randomly in one direction, suddenly swerves to point randomly in another direction, and then suddenly swerves once again to point randomly at the camera, before putting the gun down and looking around. If a bad guy was actually where the camera was at, he would have shot the detective as soon as he walked in, but hey, pointing the gun in random directions is exciting! \nA lot of reviewers will place this anime on a pedestal and claim that it is a mature anime, as if somehow those of us who didn't love it are childish. Don't fall for that nonsense, you'll see it in reviewers whenever an anime tries to be deep. It isn't really all that deep. It's a good show still, I enjoyed it myself for all that I've been bashing it, 6 is still above 5, which represents average. \n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=120,  ["text"]="                          \n    Monster is an anime that has lofty aspirations and does not come close to fulfilling them. It starts out fairly exciting, but it turns into an endless menagerie of typical psychological anime bullshitting that pretends to be meaningful and significant, yet ultimately says patently obvious things and never imparts any meaning at all. I cannot stress strongly enough that from about episode 40 on this anime is horrendously slow (it is probably a 7-8 level for the first 24-26 episodes, which is why I kept watching, hoping it could somehow salvage itself).\nThe story is pretty interesting at first, and were this an anime that ended\n          \n        itself in 24-26 episodes, it would have been just fine. However, the story NEVER evolves after this despite going on for an entire fifty episodes more. I will say that the overarching theme of the orphanage is delightful, but other than that, nothing redeems any of the last 40 episodes. The ending is so terrible. I cannot stress this enough.\nThe characters are definitely the worst part of this anime. If you read 'it is an anime about a doctor it cannot possibly be interesting,' then you are sort of correct. Not to 'spoil' anything, but this storyline gets repeated ENDLESSLY: 1) Dr. Tenma is acting very solemn and some awful music will play to indicate just how psychologically tormented he is. 2) Tenma will get thrust into some situation in which someone else is dealing with their psychological issues. 3) Tenma will save their lives (usually a criminal), because he is the super best damn doctor in history. 4) Tenma will be pulled out of his dredge of despair slightly, having learned anew that there is some hope to be had after all..but then 5) He will remember that it is his and only his job to commit murder and lapse back into his solemn, oh so poignant solitude of desolate sobriety. His wife is the most annoyed I have been by a woman since Milly in an anime. Her entire role is to be a shrew who grapples with her hatred and love for Tenma and complains a lot. I mean A LOT. Except for Grimmer, every other 'good' character pretty much is a weak character who is 'strong in spirit' or whatever and despite their weakness show how powerful they can be despite being powerless! It is absolute tripe.\nThe art is pretty typically mediocre. I say this from the stance of judging anime against other anime, and this one is a lot worse than you can find in other animes. Good art is not a reason to watch this anime. It is not terrible either though.\nThis is not the worst anime ever, it is not something I hate, it is just something that I would advise not watching when you can watch three seasons of other better animes instead.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=99,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Note: Quick Review on bottom of this review\nTheres so many things that can be said about this show. Especially the overall plot, story setting, and theme. Theres so many things that can be taken or understood differently based on the viewer its pointless to point out here but, I'll first start out by saying... \nI hate this show\n\nWith that being said, I'm sure all of you are all saying in unison 'But you rated it a 9!' For all those saying that, I commend you Cpt. Obvious. Please allow me to explain myself. \nAs I have previously stated, so many situations can be taken different\n          \n        ways... Is the victim at fault? or are the criminals the victim? What are their motives? Do they have no choice? How does the 'monster' play into it? These are all vague examples to various issues the viewer is faced with. And how you take it will pretty much consider your outlook on most episodes. Such aforementioned situations pretty much start off the bat from episode 1. Thats what makes this show so intriguing to watch. They even manage to illicit specific emotions from the viewer almost at will, which amazed the hell out of me. The plot twists story arcs leave just enough for you to want to keep watching more. That is, untill they start doing the same thing over and over. The show will eventually evolves around the following equation: investigation --&gt; discovery --&gt; death --&gt; revenge --&gt; investigation. \nNow if you're a big fan of crime dramas, this wont bother you one bit. But I must admit it started getting annoying me so much that i started hating it, but like any good book i just couldn't put it down. The overall situation my be annoying but its all the little details that keep you at the edge of your seat every time. But there is another issue that I hated about this show, the main character Dr. Kenzo Tenma.\nNow I don't have a problem following his journey to the end of the series, but I do have a problem on how they constructed this character. I mean how can a prodigy brain surgeon turn into a crime detective into an action hero into a prolific priest all in one show? After watching all 74 episodes, I just can't fathom that this doctor can manage to find all these connections and happenstance meetings with friends so easily and quickly. And don't get me started on his pacifist action skills (yes thats an oxymoron) which waste a good portion of the show. \nBut despite having a pacifist main character, there is a gracious amount of blood and violence. Another reason why I couldn't put this show down. The violence on screen accompanied by amazing sound effects was a big draw to this show especially early on in the series. The gory details can sometimes even give you goosebumps. But since the setting of the whole series is dark, you'll be faced with A LOT of dark animations. As in, you probably haven't seen so many dark colors in one anime in your life. There are some sunny settings but that gets quickly overshadowed a lot by dark tones and death. One thing that caught my eye is how they managed to draw so many mid-90's model vehicles into one show. The realistic details even surprised me. But another draw back thats a hit or miss with this show is how the characters look. \nIt's pretty interesting on how Naoki Urasawa views how westerners should look like in anime. One big thing you'll notice are their eyes and their overall 'realistic' features like a nose, eye depth, wrinkles, stray hairs, and even the shape of the bone structure behind the eyebrows. It can be hard on the eyes after being used to the general look of anime. But you'll realize that it also adds depth and realism and almost a live action crime drama feel to it. So don't be trying to look for a cute little Tsukasa or Kamgami to pop around the corner because there isn't any. As a matter of fact, quite the opposite can be said. There are some characters so ugly you just want to punch them for being so ugly, \nAnother snag of the show is how hard it was for me to actually have 'feelings' for these characters. Not only do all of them do stupid things sometimes but you don't know how long these people are going to last considering they'll introduce over a 100 characters. With such elaborate stories, it's sometimes hard to see who will live and who dies. But I'll be damned to admit that without these ugly characters, this story would not work at all. Needless to say the title, 'Monster' is very fitting for this show. Not only in an external sense, but internal as well. Watch to see why so many people get hooked.  \nTo me, the whole experience, made me hate myself for watching the whole show. Kind of like going to a brothel, you know they're whores but they're clean and entertaining but it still makes you feel dirty and thats why you keep coming back for more. There are people enjoy things they hate... Thats called an addiction ^_^ Monster is one hell of an addiction. \n\n::Quick Review::\nStory: 10 (Best plot twists in the industry)\nArt: 8 (dark themes ...dark settings ...just plain dark)\nSound: 10 (essential for film noir)\nCharacter: 7 (100 characters, no substance in about 80 of em [est])\nEnjoyment: 10 (I said I hate it, I didn't say I didn't enjoy it. )\nOverall: 44/50 = 8.8 = ~9.0 (Power word: REVENGE)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=82,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Monster is a compelling Psychological, Mystery, Drama that is heavily driven by its thrilling story. Some who watch this may not be able to get into it but the rest will enjoy the experience.\nSet in Germany, the story is about a very promising surgeon Dr. Tenma who ends up being betrayed, just for doing what he believed was right. However what he thought that he did was right ended up coming back to him later, for the better and worse. In the first couple episodes the series keeps on alternating from slowly developing its story to going into a time skip. However the story soon\n          \n        finds itself as it develops at a steady pace. At this point though you wouldn’t know where the story is heading or what to expect next, so you’re just forced sit tight and experience whatever the story gives. \nThe characters are what make this story. With numerous anime series out there revolving around kids and young adolescence; it is refreshing to see one that revolves around a variety of characters from adults to children. Dr. Tenma is very interesting himself as he is realistically portrayed, in the way that he acts and interacts and what’s more is that he goes through major developments throughout the story. Also a lot of the other characters are portrayed incredibly well, including the ones that only appear for 1 or 2 episodes.\nMonster truly deserves credit for its animation because at the time it initially aired, it would be one of the best looking dramas. Superb environments with German aesthetics, plus everything has completely fluid movements and the characters even have Naoki Urasawa’s design. The music also suits the eerily, dramatic, atmosphere of this series well and if it wasn’t for the numerous silent moments I would have thought the music was perfect. \nOverall Monster isn’t just an anime series; it is something to be experienced, for its intriguing and suspenseful premise. The way, in which the mood can quickly change, from slow paced character building to sheer horror, using various devices is an amazing feat in itself. Some people who watch this may not be able to get into it, due to the lack of excitement but for those who are patient will certainly enjoy this anime for its dark theme and compelling story.\n^_^\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=77,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    ~Story~\nOh Boy. Monster is really something else. People are thrown off when they hear that this anime has 74 episodes. Quite a few people say that that it's too slow, but to those I say: \"Go watch childish anime, and when you grow up, watch Monster\"\nWell then, to begin. This anime has an insanely high production value. It should also be said Monster has no filler episodes(they are all connected). The story follows a brain surgeon called Doctor Kenzo Tenma. The very first few episodes set the plot. But as simple as it may look when you start watching it, you will think: \"this is\n          \n        gonna last 74 episodes?\". The story is WAY deeper then it seams. The anime is very, how should I say...gray(I'll be using this term a lot). It really shows the grayness of humanity at it's worst, but also gives a message of hope. This anime is so well made, that it looks so real, as if wasn't an anime at all. The anime and manga are like a best selling novel. The anime is filled with much emotion and characters. And the best part is that all of the character's stories are connected one way or the other. As the anime went on further it became even more gray then before. The final 2 episodes are culmination of everything. Things don't end up as you thought it ever would. Overall, the story never went the way you thought it would. The interesting part is that the ED for the anime that changes from time to time, has quite a lot to do with the story which I didn't believe. The end of this great anime is really gray too, and the final scene chilled me to the bone.\n~Animation~\nWell, you might find it to be old school, but the style of drawing actually adds to the mood of the anime. Because this is the most reality-based anime I've ever seen, the style of drawing is made to resemble real life characters. A very good thing about this is that because it is so detailed, the expressions and emotions are well developed and shown. Animation is quite fluid. Who would have ever thought that an animation of someone putting a finger on his head could be so epic.\n~Sound~\nThe soundtrack for this anime is nothing short of amazing. When hope is needed, the music gives hope. When there is no hope, the music takes away all hope. When there is absolute despair, the music will show you true despair. Character theme songs are so fitting that, only by listening to the song you can tell everything about the character. The FX sounds are great and add to the thrill and shock to an already OMG scene.\nMost notable songs are \"Angel Hand\", \"Seeds of time\", \"For the love of life\" and \"Cannot Hear\". \"Cannot Hear\" is one of the characters theme songs and every time I hear the song I feel so down. It's like all the sins and sorrow of mankind put into one song. As for \"For the love of life\", it really has a deeper message to it.\n~Characters~\nNow this is where it is really amazing. I'm not gonna go naming characters, I want to keep this spoiler free. The anime never stops bringing in new characters. You might think that these are filler episodes, but all the characters are connected one way or the other. All the characters are very well developed. You will come to love even the most irrelevant characters. It is amazing how they showed his transformation over time. Because of the drawing style and the gray nature of the anime all the character seem as if they were people in real life. Honestly, I wouldn't compare this to other anime, because it's above anime, it really is something else. Trust me when I say, the supporting cast is so great that if the main character wasn't in 30 episodes, you wouldn't mind. The cast is so great that most characters can have their own spin-offs. The voice acting is also superb.\n~Enjoyment~\nWhat can I say. For all the 74 episodes I never skipped the OP. This got me so hooked that I didn't eat until like 4-5 in the morning. I was marathoning this because I got so hooked. I enjoyed every single moment of this anime. I was never bored. The final arc is the climax you deserve as a viewer. Tho it is a very gray anime showing the grayness of humanity it really is great to watch because there is no bullshit. It shows us humans for what we really are. I mean, I watched 19 episodes in a row once, that's how much I was hooked.\nI leave this review with these final words: dochi?! dochi?!\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="                          \n    I never write reviews for anime that I watch, but given the ludicrously high weighted average score for Monster I feel obligated.\nI know that most people on this site seem to love Monster, if that is the case then I would advise you not to read this review. I don't think that my exposing a series of plot holes and poor writing will assist you in anyway.\nHOWEVER, if you are watching this show (as I did) under the preconception that the show must be good because it was well received then perhaps you should read this.\nThe first 30% of Monster is not bad. It seems\n          \n        like it is setting up a journey that will teach Tenma about the truth behind the kid he saved like 10 years ago or so, who has implicated tenma as being a murderer. This is where the trouble begins. \nTenma is a disgraced doctor, it isn't that suprising as far as story development that he would chase the one who was actually responsible for the murders Tenma is blamed for commiting. I don't believe it spoils anything to say that early on the audience learns Tenma is not motivated by exhonerating himself, but he feels responsible for the murders that yohan commits, even though Tenma was not aware that the 10 year old boy he saved was a 'monster'. I hope that this point illustrates to you just how silly the underlying mentality of this show is. In essence Tenma's character is an emo guy who self loathes and forces misplaced guilt on himself for a situation that occured as a result of him being a selfless person in additiion to fulfilling his hypocratic oath as a doctor.\nTenma represents true and selfless good, whereas Yohan represents true evil. I cannot stress just how overplayed this is in Monster. Many episodes that barely advance the plot involve tenma being somewhere, someone is sick or injured (usually a criminal of some sort) and Tenma selflessley saves them. Contrasting with this are many instances where yohan does sinister things with no reason except to appear sinister. I feel that Monster had the potential for a decent story but it got lost by attempting to be deep with symbolism and imagery, which as I mentioned is terribly overplayed.\nYohan is a pointless character. He is referred to as The Devil many times throughout the show and is also likened to Hitler but with the ability to unite the world instead of Germany. The reality is that whilst Yohan may be at the heart of most of the shows murders, he rarely ciommits any himself. He is constantly referred to as amazingly intelligent, yet from the viewers perspective this is never demonstrated. At one point it is mentioned that he became exceedingly rich through a certain bank scheme, yet it is never elaborated on and doesn't effect the story. The absolute worst part of this entire show is that Yohan appears to know everything about all characters in Monster. This may sound bizarre, as I have just stated that he never displays any examples of higher intellect, but the truth is there is never a reason given as to why he knows these things. The show just shoves this nonsense down the viewers throat with the impression that \"nah, he's so smart you just don't get it and therefore we don't have to explain it\". At absolutely no point does Yohan display any problem solving ability, which is more indicative of intelligence to me than having ESP. This horrifically flawed logic is exhibited all through Monster. One character shows a psychiatrist a photo asking \"do you think this man could have killed himself\" the psychiatrist replies \"how should I know, I am not a mind reader or a fortune teller\", the first guy then says \"yeh but just have a look and tell me what you think\", *shows the psychiatrist a photo of the dead guy*, the psyciatrist responds \"No, this man did not kill himself. People that have faces like this do not kill themselves\". Yeah, I can see how you're not a fortune teller doc...\nThe method of which Yohan inspires followers to commit murder is so foolishly simple; \"your favourite color is red, and yet when you were younger you preferred blue. I wonder what the reason for this could be. The truth is you hated your mother and now you will kill a person that I nominate without question\". This literally accounts for all events involving Yohan in Monster. This irritating and reoccuring theme is ment to reflect Yohans charisma. Often the viewer is given the impression that Yohan shares Lelouche's Geass from Code Geass, and honestly if Yohan actually possessed this ability it would dectract from much of the stupidity of Monster. Actually, Yohan is more like the unltimate antagonist from gun x sword, where he just has this ability that you do as he says, but it is never actually discussed or even mentioned to the viewer.\nBy the 70th episode, I was actually skipping segments, Dr Tenma when he gets predictably sad and gloomy, some tedious manipulative device that serves the story in no way (a child spending 50% of 4 consecutive episodes being harshly bullied and being sad about being harshly bullied, where I am yelling at the tv \"JUST GET ON WITH THE STORY\"), Nina having the same flash back for the 500th time and then screaming in fear for 5 minutes straight, Roberto doing his annoying con man thing for no reason or objective and finally the introduction of a character who develops the story in no way who is merely employed as a device to manufacture tension (I cannot begin to tell you how many times this happens with new random characters that then dissappear and don't come back).\nMonster has one of the most poorly developed endings in existence. I can't expand on this without providing spoilers, which pains me because all I want is to discuss how immature and illconceived the ending is.\nTHe plot of Monster runs in circles, instead of developing I would actually argue that from about episode 30 the plot regresses to episode 10 with the same face but a different name. This occurs all throughout Monster. Tenma and Nina will every 10 or so episodes say some cliche like \"I need to end this now, it can only be me\", they will then get an opportunity to resolve matters and then get all emotional; cry, yell and hesitate, resulting in them missing the chance to \"end it all\" . It gets to the point that whenever Nina / Tenma hold a gun to someone, I found myself thinking, 'oh my god, just have a cry already, put the gun down, miss your chance and then do your best to convince the viewer that you'll actually display some conviction next time'. \nThe amount of times that suspense is fakely manufactured with no substance cannot be understated. Someone talks about how there is a devil and then goes on to tell the same story that all the other characters who mentioned the devil previously have told, but as the viewer the show expects that you will not notice that very few new events actually occur in Monster.\n\n"},

I believe there is much unjustified hype of certain titles, but Monster is definitely an exception to that assumption. \nThe weaving of subplots. It is not simply a story of one man searching another. It is the story of many developments. This is what makes its story so intricate and perhaps slow. The developments of multiple parts of the story takes time, and while it does, it does not fail to connect them all to the main story line. \nThe atmosphere is fantastic. I am no expert of the uses of colors, shades,\n          \n        and art styles, but I was very much immersed in the story. Due to such ambiance, I was not distracted. Nothing seemed out of place, nothing seemed \"edgy\", and nothing seemed entirely flawed. It was a masterful use of the atmosphere and art. When used correctly, the story and judgement of, all fall in line. Monster is that.\nCharacters are the pinnacle facet of Monster. To recall, the development of its multitude of characters is phenomenal, as by the ending the characters you watched throughout have completely changed. The best part is its tendency not to entirely neglect side characters, bringing them back to further their purpose. To address the relationships with the main cast, I would argue that there is not a single issue worth noting. The interactions were sound. And the development of the characters progressed accurately and realistically alongside the story. As the story is certainly inseparable from their alterations, they drive the story forward more than the events and mysteries.\nThe theme is fucking drawn the fuck out. To put it precisely, one does not know the true intentions of the 74 episodes, till episode 73. The build up to that episode draws all attention away from any possible moral conclusions of the theme. This technique of story telling is rare, brilliant, and when I see it, I love it in its entirety. It caught me off guard, and I would say the conclusion is fairly well thought out.\nWant to have a great time watching a show? Look no further. This is entertaining, captivating, and a great experience. Wow, those words were horrid. Don't take it from me, try it yourself.\nTo conclude, Monster is a long title. I think the best way to watch it is to abandon all other titles for it. Do not give up due to its length. It's not a title for the less intellectually seeking people, but I still recommend it. It is a gate way to the best of the medium. And Monster is TRULY a colossal titan of anime. \nAll Lives Are Equal\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=68,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    \"Monster\" may not be the most popular of anime - unlike say, \"Death Note\" or \"Full Metal Alchemist\", there are still plenty of people who haven't seen it - but it has attained this almost mythical status as one of the anime that's come closest to being flawless. Could this really be the Holy Grail of anime? Now, being the opinionated jackass that I am, I've never shied away from obnoxiously airing my unwanted views loudly and with extreme prejudice, however controversial they may be, and a fair share of popular anime (\"FLCL\", \"Elfen Lied\" and \"Clannad\" to name a few) have felt the wrath\n          \n        of my uncompromising rants over the years... but if you're looking for one of those ludicrously rare negative opinions on *this* anime, then I'm afraid to say that you won't be getting it from me. This is because, like virtually everyone else - the harshest of critics included - I found myself reduced to fanboyish gushing upon finishing \"Monster\", having been totally stupefied by the mind-blowing awesomeness of this magnificent series (see what I mean about the gushing? :P). Just like its main villain, \"Monster\" comes off as almost glowing with the aura of perfection - without a doubt, this epic is one of the all time greats.\n\"Monster\" tells the tale of a Japanese doctor named Kenzou Tenma, who starts off in the series as the young and talented star neurosurgeon at a highly reputable hospital in Germany. His working environment is a highly political one, and one day he has to make a decision between saving a boy with a bullet wound in the head, and a major benefactor of the hospital who was rushed there in an emergency just as Dr. Tenma was about to operate on the boy. Little did Dr. Tenma know that the choice he make would have such extraordinary consequences. Soon, mysterious deaths starts to occur around Dr. Tenma... and the prime suspect is him. Having found out that these events aren't completely unrelated to him, he starts tracking an elusive figure who he believes to be the one responsible for the deaths. His investigations take him across Europe, uncovering countless mysteries and dark secrets along the way, all the while being pursued by the police. The strength of the story and the plot development of this gripping series are nothing short of phenomenal, and easily surpasses any anime that I've watched previously. Usually, something this long would get dull and/or repetitive, but \"Monster\" not only successfully avoids this, it miraculously manages to pace itself far better than most 26 episode series. I found myself on the edge of my seat with eyes glued to the screen for the duration of its 74 episodes. There are a huge number of plot twists - every episode seems to end with on a cliff-hanger, and it's fiendishly difficult to find good places to stop watching and do overrated sensible activities such as eat. And maybe sleep.\nFirst and foremost, \"Monster\" is a suspenseful, psychological thriller... and it more than delivers as one with its overwhelmingly powerful and dark atmosphere. What struck me immediately while watching it is its great use of sound. If I just listen to the \"Monster\" soundtrack by itself, I'd most likely find it to be rather unfulfilling. However, within the context of the anime it's nothing short of amazing. And I'm not just talking about the music alone - the use of sound is not limited to the background music, and \"Monster\" successfully demonstrates this by putting to good use an astonishingly wide array of ambient sounds. A lot of it can be more accurately described as noise rather than music, and the unsettling atmosphere created through the skillful use of these noises, combined with sheer ruthlessness with which \"Monster\" frequently kills off its characters, ended up inducing a kind of paranoia in me while I was watching it. I found myself jumping at every background sound and every change in the tone of the music, and nervously chewing my nails whenever a character is left alone, wondering whether that character would be the next one to meet an unfortunate end.\nThe artwork also suits the gloomy atmosphere. Instead of the typical, huge-eyed kawai type character designs that you often find in anime, \"Monster\" strives for a much more realistic visual style. A lot of people have said they don't like it, but I personally love it. With the exception of some slightly off walking motions, the animation is really good. Just like with the sound, small details are manipulated with a deft touch that can nevertheless bring about significant tonal changes. A great example is the facial features of one of the characters Eva Heinemann, who comes across in the beginning as one of the bitchiest characters you're ever likely to meet. But with the simple unarching of her eyebrows, Eva's face can suddenly soften and the usual trace of bitchiness across her features just melts away. These kind of subtle touches and great attention to detail are used to brilliant effect within the anime. What's more, everything about \"Monster\" clicks together, and preciously little screen time is wasted. Even the ending credits is utilised to tell an intensely creepy, macabre fairy tale. It isn't just any fairy tale - as the story progress, you'll come to realise that it's a fairy tale that not only plays a significant role in the plot, it also reflects some of the underlying themes that underpins the main story. If you skip all the ending credits, you'll be missing out on some details that, though not quite crucial, certainly serve their purpose in making the series a richer viewing experience.\n\"Monster\" isn't all about the presentation and the production values though - it's a series backed up by solid substance and it provides more than enough material to mentally chew on after watching an episode. It easily lives up to its its title. The monstrosities that can be witnessed (a lot of which are committed on innocent children) in the anime come across as both shocking and horrifying. Thinking back on it, it's kind of ironic that what initially kicked off the chain of events in the series is a choice made on the moral grounds that doctors should treat all lives as equals. In fact, there are many strong underlying moral themes in \"Monster\", and it thoughtfully explores many questions such as whether someone deserves forgiveness, however much atrocity he has committed. Parallels can be drawn between the paths taken by \"Trigun\" and \"Monster\", but the latter presents a far more convincing case than the former. In both cases I don't fully agree with the answers provided, but in \"Trigun\" I find myself siding with the villain as the hero (Vash) came off as more stupidly naive than anything else, whereas in \"Monster\", the hero (Dr. Tenma) cuts a much more mature, saintly figure. One of the things that makes Dr. Tenma's case more convincing is that, even though he might seem too much of a perfect goody goody, he doesn't start off this way - he is initially introduced as a snivelling coward, a pawn in the political games played at his hospital. His moral stance evolves along with the strength of his character as he perseveres through the harsh trials that's thrown at him in the duration of the series, and this makes it difficult argue against the views he eventually settles on and the decisions he eventually makes because you know that he did not reach them lightly.\nA lot of intelligent anime can often come off as a little cold and aloof, just look at \"Boogiepop Phantom\", an anime that is similar to \"Monster\" insofar as it's also very dark, very clever and has a lot of substance to go with its ostentatious presentation. But unlike these kind of anime, \"Monster\" is by no means souless, and this is because the characters. Dr. Tenma may be a fantastic character, but he is actually made to look rather ordinary by the the rest of a very stella cast. It should be noted that the size of the cast of \"Monster\" is rather large. Now in most cases, large casts tends to spell trouble, and any anime that attempts to cram in a lot of characters usually end up with an extremely dull selection that are underdeveloped and forgettable. But \"Monster\" is not just any anime. Despite having so many characters, it's hard to recall a single bad character in the entire series, and in fact most of them are nothing short of fascinating. Who can forget the likes of that detective with an alcohol problem, or the constantly smiling Wolfgang Grimmer? A lot of these characters only appear for a short while, but it's more than enough for them to make a big impact. As for the re-occurring ones, virtually all of them undergo superb character development. One such character is Eva Heinemann. She stands out for having one of the most dynamically developed personalities, and also for changing from a character I loathed to a character I came to like very much. The main villain too, is one of the most charismatic, sophisticated and terrifying villain ever to grace the medium. Instead of scaring people outright with brute force, he induces a psychological fear by getting into people's minds, psyching out their darkest secrets and manipulating them using soft power. And this makes him far more compelling than your average mass produced brawn-over-brains \"final boss\" style villain, who usually comes fully equipped with a single digit IQ, some basic, primitive cunning, and the ability to manically laugh for an hour or so. \nDespite the quirky and distinctive traits that a lot of the characters have (for instance Runge with his constantly typing hands), most of them come across as genuine, real people caught up in crazy situations. Virtually all the characters are much more than what meets the eye, and many of them are burdened by dark pasts that they are trying to put behind them. The characters are fleshed out through their backstories and, as the plot often takes turns to unfold through their different perspectives, it's really easy to connect to and sympathise with these troubled characters. \"Monster\" is a series with plenty of heart and warmth because it makes you care about its characters for all their very human flaws: it makes you smile with them through the good times, tighten up nervously when they are in danger, and it makes you want to weep in frustration and anguish when they are killed off, often just as you're growing fond of them.\nAdmittedly, I'm not too keen on the ending of the series, and I still have a few lingering questions about certain plot points, especially ones concerning the villain, and the almost supernatural way he seems to be able to always get what he wants. But aside from these very minor complaints, I honestly can't find any aspect of \"Monster\" that isn't outstanding. With its masterfully told plot, unforgettable characters, paranoia-inducing dark atmosphere and profound depth, \"Monster\" is a colossal masterpiece in *every* sense of the word. "},

It was written by Naoki Urasawa and many praise it as the better Death note. I had the pleasure of watching this anime and here are my thoughts.\n\nMonster is all about atmosphere and how it reaches to the viewer. Note, i did not read the source material, the manga, so i can't comment how better it is compared to it, but let's just say it is very good. Honestly, before watching Monster, i had a completly different expectation. I thought it would rely on difficult choises and their outcomes, like how the\n          \n        main character, Kenzo Tenma, would sacrifice one thing for another and that eventually would make him a ''Monster''. That is not the case, although the first episodes kinda show that, but let's not spoil. So the premise is simple, Kenzo Tenma is a surgeon, a very skilled one, who wants to become the head physician of a hospital. He soon enters a dilemma where he either needs to save a rich man which will ensure his future or sacrifice everything, but save a poor kid that was shot right in the head. Kenzo makes a crucial decision and saves the kid, from where the rise of a Monster begins.\nNow here is the main flaw with Monster's story. When i first read the description, i saw that it has 74 episodes. Now, don't get me wrong, i can easily watch a 100 episode series, if it is not boring. Monster doesn't deserve to be called boring and it actually isn't. It's just that it has a lot of fillers that don't add anything new and are more of the same. For example, the first 10 episodes are outstanding. They focus on the main character and actually move the story. After that, the series chooses to introduce a bunch of characters and for the majority of episodes, it focuses on them rather on the main character, Kenzo Tenma. This just stagnates the further story development for atleast 5 episodes, then it gets back to Tenma, then again centers for another 5 episodes to someone else and so on. If it would only center around Kenzo Tenma and his road, not only this would create more questions and make the series more interesting, it would also be like 30 episodes long.\nBut even with it's flaw, i still can't give Monster a lower score than 10, because there are almost no similarities. Monster is a rare type of anime and if not perfect, it still manages to keep your attention.\n"},

A few hours later you find yourself in her room, making out with her. You start to reach for a boob when.... \"I don't want to take it any farther than this.\" Just when you thought you were about to get something, you get shut down, cockteased. \nThis is monster. The greatest cocktease of all time.\nDon't get me wrong, it is a great show. I enjoyed it. It would have to be reasonably good for me to make it through 74 episodes of it while generally enjoying myself, but it never quite lived\n          \n        up the hype it received before I watched it.\nMonster is a mystery/drama show. Early on, the show sets up a number of compelling mysteries and questions. The kind that generally keep you watching a show until you discover the answers. Unfortunately, Monster takes these mysteries, then continues to tease you and tease you, usually, by the time the answers are revealed, I was kind of apathetic towards those questions. The plot revelations never had the impact they could have because of how long they take to reveal them. There are dozens of almost laughable occurences where a character is about to recall an old memory, or where someone is about to \"tell all\", when they suddenly get cut off right at the good part, or decide they don't want to talk anymore. It becomes laughably predictable. If it wasn't for all the stalling to reveal answers, I think I would have liked this show a lot more.\nAnother example of almost amusing attempts to create faux tension comes in the action scenes. Throughout the show, a character will point a gun at another character. It looks like death will finally catch up with one of the character's in these standoffs. Finally GUNSHOT, from there, the show almost always cuts to outside the building. You hear the gunshot, but you don't see what happens. This literally happens at least 10 times over the course of the show, probably more. Their desperate attempts to have you \"wondering what happened next\" become almost sad. In the final ten episodes of the show, when the action really picks up, it becomes completely expected, and loses any effect it may have had. Monster's shameless efforts to create nail-biters is one of the main pitfalls of the show, as it becomes quite blatant and annoying near the end.\nI may be coming across as hating the show, but it's more frustration to be honest. I feel like Monster could have been a 10/10 show for me, but the above aspects really ruined it for me. Despite these flaws, I still managed to enjoy the show quite a bit.\nThe best part about Monster is the characters. Over the course of 74 episodes, the show introduces you to a lot of characters, and does its best to develop them all as much as they can. I can quite vivdly remember some characters that only had face time in a few episodes. I felt like most of the characters were pretty realistic, which was a nice touch. Even the most badass characters in the show aren't over the top badasses. They are the kind of badasses you could actually picture existing in real-life which is a great touch. One of the main characters of the show, Dr. Tenma, quickly become one of my favorites, and I envision him being on my top 10 for a long time to come. There is one character that gets a little annoying and over-dramatic by the end of the show (Nina Fortner), but other than that, I can safely say I liked every character in the show for the most part.\nAlso, when Monster decides to actually reveal things about the past, they were really interesting and often shocking. In the last ten episodes or so, Monster really goes all out to show you everything about each character's past, and it's no coincidence that these ten episodes are the best of the show. \nMonster also has surprisingly intense action scenes, when they aren't using cheap techniques to build drama and suspense. Perhaps it's because of how attached you get to a lot of characters in the show, but I found myself practically wanting to cheer when the good guys won, which is pretty rare for me with TV shows. I was definitely on the edge of my seat during a lot of fist and gun fights, the only time I wasn't was when the dreaded GUNSHOT, CUT TO DIFFERENT SCENE happens. '\nThe art is mostly eye-pleasing. I liked the character designs, although, I felt like a lot of characters looked WAY too much alike, but this was a minor flaw. The action scenes are also quite crisp, and there is some pretty beautiful scenery at several points. The music was also generally perfect for any scenes it was used for. For as dark as Monster can be, a few of the happy/peaceful tracks really stood out for me, and I would probably be willing to listen to them outside the show, which isn't something I would usually say about a show's soundtrack.\nBy the time Monster gets into the late 60's, it truly goes into a new level. These episodes are truly \"masterpiece\" level, so it's unfortunate that the show languished around the \"good\" level for so long. Basically, it's like after casually dating the girl you met at that party for months, you FINALLY end up getting some. You're extremely glad you got some, but damn, couldn't it have happened sooner?\n        "},

In the mean time instead, we have\n          \n        useless main characters yell at each other not to shoot, be hypocritical, and apparently teach some profound meaning of life, while trying to kill someone, while also being introduced to a massive amount of side characters who you'll probably never remember but some how, they all connect. Literally, like every single one of them all in completely different locations, know each other in some unknown profound way.\nCharacter 5/10\nAnd that's the biggest problem with Monster, it's characters. People  claim that they are all just so realistic, yet they make the most idiotic choices that gets them no where. Really though, why on earth Tenma was walking around without changing his appearance or even his name even though he was wanted every where for serial murders blows my mind. Besides dealing with that, we have to constantly listen to Nina and Tenma lecture each other and others about not killing people while they're chasing down someone TO KILL THEM. I got so sick of stare downs between Tenma and some random person in which you hear a shot, only for it to be from someone who's not Tenma's, instead he's still sitting there, in the same pose, with the same face saying he's going to shoot.Then the side characters they created.  Each one appeared at the perfect time with the perfect piece of information that someone needed to advance the plot of the story *cough cough Lotte much*. With all that though, there were some really good characters... I hated Runge, but loved him at the same time. His stubbornness made my body cringe, but he's still amazing. Then there's all the other billions of characters in this show, that you'll rarely see all better than Tenma.\nStory 9/10\nThe story is great with multiple shocking twist and turns that will leave you guessing and have you wondering whats really going on, so on that side, the show succeeded, except that the ending sucks due to the fact it only creating more questions, and not even answering some of the main ones they forced us to think about.\nSound 6/10\nThe sound is ordinary, it didn't make much an impact on me since I literally just finished the show and I don't even remember any of the background sounds, or music, only the ending and that's only because of the picture book drawings.\nArt 7/10\nThe art fitted the series, very mature like. Personally I didn't like it, but it grows on you as you watch the show and since you have to sit through 74 episodes, it'll grow on you too.\nEnjoyment 7/10\nI liked the show, but I was extremely annoyed most of the time I watched it due to Tenma alone, let alone all the other characters that actually annoyed me as well, and the idiot choices they made, and the moronic plot devices, and some very predictable scenes. \nOverall 7/10\nEven though I mass criticized this show, I still think it's a good show that should be watched if you have the time and are into the type of genre, especially if you have a lot of patience. \n        "},

It wasn't my usual type of anime, since I'm not a big mystery/detective fan and I doubted I would like it at first...  Another note I would like to mention is that the anime and manga of Monster are very close and true to each other.\nSTORY (10/10):\nThe story is incredibly intriguing.  Avoiding being redundant and giving a plot synopsis, I'll say this: Every story development pulls the watcher further in, without resorting\n          \n        to real 'cliff hangers'.  The first few episodes, though very important, felt somewhat dry, however once those are over and the real plot begins to move, the intensity of each episode builds.\nART (10/10):\nThe art of the Monster anime is very unlike the art in the manga.  The manga harkens heavily back to the Astro-boy days of manga.  The anime is somewhat modernized, but somewhat more realistic than a lot of anime currently.  I found the art to be very endearing and used well to enhance the atmosphere of the anime.\nSOUND (8/10):\nThe sound got a somewhat lower rating not because it's *bad*.  The music and voices are well done, but simply unexceptional.  Mostly the music, though good, quickly passes from memory.  The opening and closing themes are incredibly generic.  Luckily, the voice actors used were incredibly talented.\nCHARACTERS (9/10):\nThe characters are really what make Monster so great.  Their interactions and personal motivations are so incredibly *human*.  Each has their own set of faults and strong points.  The only reason I did not give the characters section a 10 was because after becoming attached to a character, the character might disappear for a few episodes simply due to the fact the cast is so large and each has such depth.\nENJOYMENT (10/10):\nMonster is by no means perfect, but it is an incredibly well-thought out anime that  kept me eager for the next episode.  The faults, in this case, can be overlooked.  I enjoyed this anime enough to give it a 10.\nOVERALL (9.4/10)\n- Spiffyish\nNOTE ABOUT THIS REVIEW: Also, if you find this review unhelpful in anyway, send me a private message saying why (please) so that I can improve it for future readers! :D\n        "},

And because the writer does not get sidetracked with filler episodes or arcs, a single, coherent storyline runs through. This gives the impression of watching a an excellent graphic novel. Though the story itself is impossibly intricate, a web of intrigue and conflicting motives to tantalize the viewer, Monster manages to conclude dramatically, memorably and without the use of such cheap and overused plot devices as deus ex machina. \nUrasawa Naoki clearly left nothing to chance or improvisation in\n          \n        the creation of Monster. His meticulously conceived and astoundingly immersive plot is certainly the result of countless hours of historical, geographical and cultural research. Monster is set against the backdrop of a Germany reeling from its internal division by the Berlin Wall, all the while struggling to cope with the conflicting ideals of democracy and authoritarianism within the same country. This dichotomy between the East and West German governments, along with the long-term consequences for the citizens on each side of the Wall are subtly referenced throughout the plot. Realism on this level is something that no author can fake. The actual plot idea behind Monster is one we have all heard before. A doctor is under suspicion for murder and flees the authorities to find the villain and clear his name. But with Monster, it is not so much the originality of the plot, as it is the masterful storytelling which puts Monster in a category of its own. \nUrasawa's style is one of sublime efficiency - not a single scene is wasted and every piece of information revealed to the audience is ultimately significant. A single glance, a dark shadow, the sound of a footstep - these are the precise and parsimonious tools Urasawa uses to tell the story of Monster. His narration is immersive and gripping, but never once does it feels heavy-handed. The flow from scene to scene always feels completely natural, and deftfully avoids any appearance that the writer is forcing the plot in order to create drama or suspense. \nIf anything, it is just the opposite: the main story is advanced through the exposition of tangential subplots. As a result, the hero is constantly hot on the trail of the antagonist, but only ever able to gain information from indirect witnesses, friends of friends, people only remotely related to the search at hand. Consequently, the antagonist's screen time is so rare that each appearance might even be considered a cameo. And yet, Urasawa's villain is easily the best characterised and most memorable in all the anime I have seen to date. I stand in awe of Monster, for this is storytelling at its finest.\nANIMATION\nThe visual quality in Monster is both superb and unique. Through the creative use of cinematic techniques, Monster is made to feel very much like a movie, because the \"camera\" viewpoint is often used to focus in on significant moments or details or even facial expressions. In this fashion, the audience's attention is skillfully drawn towards such ominous things as shadows, dark corners and footsteps in order to intensify the atmosphere. \nThe artwork in Monster carries strong influences from film noir. Even from the first few episodes, the use of darker hues and greyed out tones give the anime a bleak and foreboding feeling. As the story progresses, the anime becomes a showcase for the animator's sublime mastery over the use of shadow and lighting. \nDetail levels are quite decent, although exterior scenery is rare, given the dark nature of the story. The few scenic moments I do remember in the anime were well-drawn. I know the following will seem odd for a mystery and suspense thriller, but the food shown in Monster is extremely appetizing; I distinctly recall feeling hungry several times while watching the characters eat. Prior to viewing Monster, I had never craved German food, but I must admit that the anime actually convinced me to seek out a place where I could eat some the things I saw.\nSOUND\nObviously, in a suspense/thriller anime, you would not expect to find highly memorable or catchy tunes. This is the case with Monster, the anime relying more heavily on silence, foreboding sounds, and the occasional eerie music to set the mood. And since sustaining mood is of paramount importance in this genre, the sound selection was appropriate and well-considered. The audio track always complemented the scenes of the anime, and never detracted from the tension of the moment. \nDespite being 74 episodes long, Monster had only one opening and two ending themes. From a vocal standpoint, both singers featured in the ending music are quite mediocre. However, the suitability of these two pieces for the overall atmosphere of Monster is ideal. Both pieces are only very lightly orchestrated, with contrasting emphasis on echo and proximity of voice to the microphone, resulting in an altogether unsettling and haunting feeling which is completely appropriate for the series. \nIt is the voice acting, though, which gives Monster its unforgettable immersiveness. The seiyuu cast succeeds brilliantly in adding to the overall atmosphere. Though the anime involves a wide spectrum of emotion, the seiyuu convincingly convey each emotion to perfection. Sasaki Nozomu in particular deserves special commendation for so vividly bringing to life the role of the main antagonist. It is no easy task to credibly portray the voice of a person who commits brutal murder without a trace of emotion, and yet possesses the gentle charm and seductive charisma to beguile and manipulate countless others.\nCHARACTERS\nUrasawa Naoki's indirect storytelling style has a very apparent benefit: it allows him to richly develop the entire cast of characters, including those with secondary roles. I would be hard-pressed to name a single character in Monster with whom I did not feel intimately acquainted and whose motivations I did not understand by the end of the series. Considering that each episode almost certainly introduces at least one new character, it is mind-blowing that Urasawa manages to achieve this level of familiarity among the audience with all of his numerous and colourful characters. \nUrasawa pushes the envelope with the characterisation of his main cast and manages to completely blur the lines between fictional character and real person. He recognises that people do not only change as a result of momentous plot events - sometimes, people also gradually change over time. The timeline of Monster spans over forty years, so this slow self-evolution of the characters' motivations, aspirations and values provides a much deeper level of authenticity that I would love to see in other anime. \nI also admire the fact that Monster's characters are shown to have a life outside their role within plot. This is a dimension which adds a great deal to the believability of the characters. Often it takes no more than only the subtlest of details, like a family picture in the background, or a quick \"in-passing\" reference during dialogue, but such are the minutiae which distinguish excellence from mediocrity.\nOVERALL\nMonster possesses a polish shared by too few other anime. It is truly a finished product, completed and produced with pride. As a viewer, I distinctly felt that every scene was contemplated with care, every detail meticulously reviewed. One would be hard-pressed to find an inconsistency in the story, let alone an unexplained or forgotten plotline. Monster is a lengthy 74-episode anime with no fillers. This alone should speak volumes as to the quality of this anime.\nFor the lack of a better place to mention this, the ending sequence is well worth the time to watch, in detail, after every episode. The graphical content for the outro is almost never identical, though often the changes from episode to episode are almost imperceptible. Yet, those who have the patience to sort through these small differences are richly rewarded with an additional dose of ingenious foreshadowing and symbolism.\nWithout a doubt, because of its all-around excellence, and its superb attention to quality and detail, Monster has become the definitive benchmark by which I have judged all other anime. To all lovers of quality anime, if you have yet to see Monster, then you are most assuredly missing out on one of the very best.\n"},

The last eps. were great despite being half predictable, i didn't like the ending, the last min. was like a cliffhanger, what happens next? anyways, the story was great and the main reason it wasn't perfect it's because it was predictable to me and the last min. of the final ep. bothered me, if that wasn't shown it would be better.\n[b][u]Art & Animation[/u][/b]\nThe animation is very good for the time but a lot of side characters have the same design and sometimes it was confusing thinking at the moment they were the same person and why they have big noses? and the art style didn't have the same quality at times.\n[b][u]Sound[/u][/b]\nThe VA was good but some characters were emotionless like Nina, the motion of her character didn't match the voice she should use at the moment, specially one ep. in which she seems she's gonna scream but she doesn't, it was funny and bad that those eps. should show emotions but didn't have an effect. The music was ok, i think there are only a few songs, the same ones and the silence plays a part too. The OP is very good and the first ED song was great, i never lost the opportunity to hear that song everytime untill it changed to a bad one but overall the sound was very good.\n[b][u]Character[/u][/b]\nThe best from the anime are the characters, they are outstanding, it's what i like the most about Monster, a lot of likeable characters and despicable ones (or one) and i'm not talking about Johan but the disgusting Roberto. I won't write much about them because i can write only little without spoiling them as you know about them slowly watching the anime.\n-Doc. Tenma has to struggle with not only the person he saved but with himself, what will he do to stop him, will he really finish the things off the way he says he will or his morals will clash with what he says, while he struggles to think about it he will keep saving people no matter what, a great person kind with everyone, always doing the right things even in difficult situations.\n-Johan is one of the greatest villains/psychos/sociopaths manipulators in anime, he's charismatic in any way, coming off as a perfect human, a lot more is known about him in a slow pace, so i shouldn't be writing more.\n-Nina Fotner is the twin sister of Johan, she was living a normal life (after what happened) untill her birthday number 20, where everything will change for her.\n-Roberto is one disgusting and despicable character, and he's like terminator in a way that can be unbelievable and absurd.\n-Eva Heinemann was Tenma's fiance and a total bitch, but for some reason you don't want to hate her later, even when she still is a bitch.\n-Jan Suk will find himself in almost the same situation as Tenma, he is a good character.\n-Inspector Lunge is one of the best characters in the anime, he might be obsessive because he thinks he's never wrong because he wants to believe his brain will never commit a mistake remembering evidence, interviews and whatnot, he's one of the most intelligent and if he started to be serious since the beginning, there wouldn't be even 30 eps. he is that fast to tie the loose ends, one of the best characters.\n-Wolfgang Grimmer is another one of the greatest characters in Monster, he appears little but somehow everything he does and says will move you in some way, he has struggled a lot, he has his burden to carry and when he tries to fix it, it will make you want to cry, i resisted a lot but eventually always dropped a tear, he did that only with words, he said some powerful quotes.\nAnd a lot more key characters like Dieter, Doc. Reichwein, Karl, Schuwald, General Wolf, Martin and there's something weird, the guy called Baby can't be considered to be a superior race, obviously for his appearence going by the standars of the nazis in real life, so i don't know how he's one of the superiors of the organizations that wants another leader like Hitler, makes no sense.\n[b][u]Enjoyment[/u][/b]\nFor being a predictable anime (for me) and sometimes really slow and boring at times, i had a very good enjoyment, i think i didn't gave the anime in general a perfect score because it was predictable and i didn't enjoy it that much and for what i pointed about the ending.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    “If you don’t want to be betrayed anymore… then start doubting the person you want to doubt the least.”\nMonster is a fierce, gripping show that grabs you by the arm and transports you through 74 episodes of mind-bending plot, engaging characters and possibly the best villain in anime history.  I had to wait about a week after finishing this series before making my attempt at a review due to the sheer amount of things I wanted to say at its conclusion.  \nIt’s quite difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed Monster’s unique storyline.  Not only is it realistic, but it\n          \n        keeps a steady pace for the entire 74 episodes while focusing entirely on a single story arc.  It’s an incredible feat to see in an anime.  Adapted from the highly revered manga by Naoki Urasawa, viewers follow the main protagonist, Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a prodigal Japanese neurosurgeon.  Dr. Tenma is working abroad in post segregated Germany, engaged to the daughter of the hospital’s director and is genuinely living the “good life”.  That is, until a certain patient arrives in his care.  Dr. Tenma is faced with a difficult decision when he has to choose between performing an operation on the mayor or a young boy shot in the head that he was already in surgery with.  With a strong sense of morality on his side, he chooses the boy and his life literally comes crashing down around him.  He is stripped of his head neurosurgeon title, accused of murder on several accounts and left by his fiancée, and this is within the first five episodes!\nThe rest of the series follows Tenma as he is on the run, trying to track down the Monster that ruined his life.  It’s a constant game of cat and mouse, filled with death and drama, and focusing strongly on character development and well paced plotlines.  The writing in Monster is absolutely fantastic.  It is both medically and geographically accurate, and the dialogue between the characters is top notch.  There are almost no filler episodes, and each chapter is meticulously laid out to aid the viewer in solving the mystery of the “monster” for themselves.  I mostly enjoyed the sequences between Tenma and the infamous BKA Inspector Lunge, as well as the interactions Tenma has with the Monster himself.  The action sequences were also well orchestrated, leaving that appropriate amount of suspense when you knew the killer was right around the corner, or Tenma himself was just moments from being caught.  It’s moments like that which are missing from most animes in the genre, and Monster executed them perfectly.\nSocial issues and corruption are prominent throughout the series as well, buffing the realism factor exponentially.  There are gangs, exposed destitute orphanages, and red light districts in post-segregated Germany which showcase the disparities that still exist even today.  All the side stories are interwoven into one infernal beast of a storyline.  No characters are disposed for the sake of fan service, no dialogues is squandered and most of all, the feeling you get at the end of this series is pure satisfaction.  \nThe cast of this anime is just too damn good.  Plenty of characters to love, and those you love to hate.  Tenma is the moral pillar inside all of us.  He is an honest and logical man who is trying to right the wrongs that have occurred within his life.  His decisions are always calculated, never rash, and if it comes down to saving someone’s life over his own personal gain… he will always make the right choice.  His friends along the way could always sense his genuinely good character, and would stick by Tenma’s side, come what may.  The “Monster” was brilliantly sinister throughout the series, and I often found myself somewhat scared when he appeared on screen.  His elusiveness and charisma added to his complexity as a character and made it all the more terrifying.  He will go down as perhaps the greatest villain in anime history.\nThe comparison of the main antagonist to Hitler is also interesting.  The way that the “Monster” manipulates the minds of the individuals he befriends is frighteningly realistic.  He brings them to the lowest point, lower than death, and when the suffering appears to be too much he offers them a hand in return for performing his dirty work.  I can imagine people like that existing in the world today, and the fact that the government and certain masochistic individuals were attempting to recreate Hitler using experiments done on children was appalling in nature.\nThe rest of the supporting characters were great in their own rights.  I enjoyed the background of Wolfgang Grimmer, the prior orphan turned freelance journalist, who was trying to uncover his own past while helping to unravel pieces of the overarching mystery.  I quickly grew attached to his side arch and how he intertwined with Tenma.  Deiter and Nina were also great aids to Tenma, as well as Dr. Reichwein and Gillen.  But perhaps my favorite character of all was that of Inspector Lunge.  He was a brilliant detective who grew obsessed with the cases he couldn’t solve.  Even at the cost of his own family and career.  The way he was so systematic in filing information into his “hard drive” screamed OCD and reminded me loosely of L from Deathnote.\nFor what it is, I love the animation style from the early to mid 2000’s.  Monster especially made realistic looking characters, and did a great job of illustrating Germany and the Czech Republic’s land/cityscapes.  None of the characters seemed dull, and even maintained a highly detailed level of animation through long dialogue sequences.  The transformation of Tenma over the series is also evident in the character model; going from young and clean cut to tattered and worn.  The soundtrack was suspenseful at the necessary times, and I never found it to be overused or tacky.  The opening didn’t change over the course of the show, which was great.  Sometimes I feel that anime openings have become less and less to do with the anime itself and more about showcasing artists that make them.  The ending song was the creepiest I’ve ever seen, and fit so well with the ominous vibe the series was trying to convey.  The English voice acting was extremely good, and I actually found that I liked it more than the Japanese. \nThere isn’t any logical way I can give anything but a 10 to this anime.  Not just based on average score, but the overall effect that Monster had on me was tremendous.  It is a show that I will not soon forget, and certainly one I could recommend to any suspense/thriller fan… even those who don’t enjoy anime.  It has been rumored that legendary horror director Guillermo Del Toro has worked with HBO to bring us a live action iteration of this masterpiece, so I hope to continue my love for the series in the future.  Monster is a hard hitting, life changing anime that will go down in history as one of my all time favorites.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    74 episodes long. I looked at those little words on the left hand column of MAL's page dedicated to Monster, and I said to myself \"74 episodes?\" *cower* \"I've heard this anime is really good...bu...but...that is a lot of episodes\". So it took me a few months to finally get up the motivation to actually sit down and watch the first episode of this series. And once I did, there was no turning back.  Deciding that this anime was too long to be worth my time was totally futile, I had been drawn in by one of the greatest series (anime or not) ever\n          \n        created.\n I. Was. Hooked.\nStory\nForgive the pun… but you must know this: Monster is one monster of a story. It will have you sitting and pondering and digesting every little piece of the story in order to piece everything together and make sense of it all. It’s frustrating in a way. Some people don't get it because they don't put in the time to.You have to analyze it and look at it at different angles to get it. But in the end, it is so worth it. Monster has so many layers and nuances and themes and twists and arcs that you can’t really sum it up in a review. I’ll try to give you the gist (spoiler free fear not). Basic premise: Doctor saves a kid…BUT oops. This kid is a monster (pretty much a living, breathing, embodiment of all things monstrous and evil). Doctor says to himself “oh shoot. I let this monster live when I could have let him die. I need to make this right” *Sets off on epic journey to fix things*. And that’s just the tippy tippity top of the iceberg. The story progresses from there, the characters develop and morph , the mystery builds, and the twists reveal little by little the true nature and origins of the “monster” that is the central piece of this series. But despite my best efforts, I can't even think up the words to adequately describe how great of a story Monster is. It is so well written. So well developed. So original. So DEEP. I can’t remember the last time I’ve witnessed writing this good. \nArt\nThe art of Monster is really good and reflects the kind of eerie unsettling tone of the series. It’s quite muted and VERY realistic in its portrayal of settings and in its character designs. This is one of the only series I’ve seen that has characters that actually look like REAL PEOPLE!!! The detail of the art is absolutely breathtaking. The backgrounds of the settings are so realistic and so accurately portrayed.  The animation itself is pretty consistently good too. The animators definitely could have slacked more on such a long series. Overall, the art is top notch.\nSound\nThe music of this series, like the art, goes well with the tone. Although this was probably the only area of the anime that didn't absolutely blow my mind, it wasn't half bad. I really liked the OP. It got stuck in my head a lot but it was awesome and edgy :D the ED was so dissettling and disturbing and crazy...it really added to the series. The VAs did an incredible job. Goodness. I wish they had anime Oscars. The voices fit the characters perfectly...it's creepy...especially Johan *shivers*. So yeah. Though my mind wasn't blown, I was not disappointed with sound at all.\nCharacters\nMonster is intricately woven with a relatively large cast of characters to carry out the complex series of events. But each character has a role. A purpose. A distinct personality. You see every supporting character develop and change as the story progresses. And the character development of the leads…Dr. Tenma, Nina, Eva and even the third person perspective we’re given of the development of Johan are all spectacular. SO THOROUGH. These characters are so complex and fleshed out… they seem real. We see their strengths, their flaws, their beliefs all play out. Every character is multi dimensional….we’re given views of each little facet of their personalities as the story goes on.  Ah. Monster is a rare example of characterization done perfectly.\nEnjoyment/ Overall\nIn the end, all I can really say is \"..........w..o..w\"\nIt will remain to this day the best damn anime I have ever seen.\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Upon concluding Monster I immediately considered it a masterpiece. The show explores the effects of making a decision based on morals regardless of whether the decision will ruin the life of the person that makes it. Other themes within Monster include the value of life and what separates good and evil.\nThe story structure of protagonist versus antagonist was perfectly constructed in Tenma and Johan, both characters have opposing ideologies but don't carry any hatred towards eachother which makes the question of if Tenma will eventually kill Johan that much more intriguing considering Tenma's view that all life is equal. \nJohan's construction is especially frightening, as\n          \n        a handsome Aryan man with a feminine voice he is the exact opposite of what a serial killer would be visually represented as. The show employs a technique where we know Johan's actions but we never see Johan commit any murders (except for one which is to prove his murderous nature to Tenma) This disconnect between who we see and what we know about Johan adds to his intrigue.\n Johan's development being the result of a choice between someone living and someone potentially dying parallels Tenma's decision that starts the story - implying that true evil is not a \"monstrous person\" but rather the thing that enables them to become evil.\nWhile Monster features a story that is engaging and philosophical, it's visuals and sound are nothing special. It's character designs are grounded in reality & while I've never been to Germany it looked like the depiction of the country was faithful. \nThe soundtrack re-used songs often, they fit the mood of the scenes but a standout music score clearly wasn't the priority when making this anime."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Yesterday, after quite an industrious few days' watching, I finished Monster. It is, to keep it as simple as possible, brilliant.\nWhen speaking to anime sceptics, I tend to point out that it's only here in the west that animation (animatedness?) is considered the defining quality of animated films/series. In Japan, it's film first and animation second. Sometimes, though, it can be difficult to illustrate this point; even the most gritty historical epics, such as Bakumatsu, contain elements of magic, psychic powers or the supernatural. From now on, I need not fear - Monster is the perfect example. Set in present day Germany (well, the mid\n          \n        1990s, but close enough), focusing entirely on drama, tension, plot and psychology, Monster features little in the way of anime staples. It is free of fan service, there are no big eyes or disproportionately large heads in sight, and everything that occurs is actually possible (like most film and TV drama, the events of the series are improbable but possible). In fact, Monster actually takes more care with realism than most 'real' TV: when the neurosurgeon, Dr Tenma, starts using a gun, his ability to do so is actually explained - in this case, by means of him having spent five months taking marksmanship lessons from a retired mercenary. The same happens with other characters too. Everything is justified, explained and accounted for.\nOn top of the attention to detail and effort to maintain realism, Monster is laden with carefully nurtured tension. The various protagonists all make so many mistakes and struggle so hard to achieve anything that the threat of failure is tangible in each pivotal scene. Additionally, there is so much misdirection and layering in the plot of the series that the viewer never really has a handle on the truth - and every time something is resolved, it just reveals another layer of horror and mystery beneath. All of this dramatic goodness is rounded off by good acting. To the best of my knowledge, Monster has yet to be dubbed into English, so I watched it subtitled, and I usually don't have any opinion on Japanese voice actors unless one has a particularly annoying voice (Merle in Escaflowne is a prime example). I simply - and inevitably - don't pick up the same nuances of tone and expression in Japanese as I do in English. In this case, though, some of the performances actually struck me as exceptionally good - which, presumably, means that if I understood the language they'd be superb.\nI have only three criticisms of Monster. The first is the very complexity that makes it a compelling watch across 74 episodes; at times, the convoluted plot can be difficult to follow, and more than once I found myself in the position of knowing I've seen a particular character before, but being unable to remember where or why. This is, I suspect, an inevitable side effect of having a complex plot, as is my second complaint: the pacing. On the whole, the pacing is perfectly appropriate, but it's hardly fast. A story of this type requires a slow, careful pace, so I can't complain - but it does result in the series being more difficult to watch than others of similar length. My third and final criticism is of the main character, Dr Tenma. It troubled me only infrequently, so it's a minor gripe, but Tenma is something of a Mary Sue (or whatever the male version is...Gary Stu, I think). Though he often makes mistakes - indeed, the whole premise of the series is based on Tenma's atonement for a grave error - he is nonetheless one of those characters who improve the lives of everyone they come into contact with, by imparting some grain of personal philosophy or restoring a cynic's faith in humanity. In general, the plot was sufficiently dark, and Tenma's suffering sufficiently intense, that this element of his character went unnoticed, but it did catch my attention at times, particularly around the mid-point of the series.\nIn all, then, Monster is one of the best anime there is, in my opinion. It's dark, gritty, complex, compelling and occasionally disturbing - all the things sceptics don't associate with anime. This maturity and realism is reflected in the artwork, and continues to the very last moment of the very last episode, without even once succumbing to anime's tendency to incorporate magic or psychic powers. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Overview: \nWhat happens when the world's nicest doctor accidentally saves the life of the world's most evil man? We get an amazing 70+ episode anime of course!\nStory: 10/10\nThe story begins in 1980s West Germany with a brilliant young neurosurgeon named Kenzo Tenma. One day Kenzo is about to operate on a Turkish construction worker, but is pulled out of surgery at the last minute to operate on an opera singer instead. The opera singer survives and the Turkish construction worker dies, because everyone in this hospital besides Tenma is criminally inept. The wife of the construction worker berates Tenma for not operating on her husband,\n          \n        when he arrived first at the ER. Although this isn't very realistic, it provides the series' first of many moral dillemas for our hero Tenma. A few days later a similar situation occurs with a young boy coming into the ER with a bullet wound to the head at the same time that an important mayor needs an operation. Tenma decides to follow his morals this time and operates on the boy that came in first. As a result, the mayor dies and Kenzo's career at the hospital comes to a grinding halt thanks to his scum sucking boss. Kenzo's career rebounds when all of his enemy's mysteriously die in a single night and the boy disappears. Years later Kenzo learns that he saved an absolute monster and ridden with guilt decides to hunt down this man and right this wrong. Much like my other favorite Elfen Lied, Monster's plot often contains unrealistic coincidences, cliche' devices like convenient amnesia, and other elements that make it fodder for snarky pseudo intellectuals to rip on. What makes it good is that it builds suspense in the style of a classic Hitchcock movie. It is thought provoking and emotionally rewarding. When the protagonist must make a difficult moral decision, we the audience share his suffering. It is true that it is not very realistic, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. This is the writing style of Victor Hugo, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, and the majority of classic literature. You can go ahead and laugh at it if you want to, but you are missing a great story.\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe main character is Kenzo Tenma, who is an almost Christ like figure that must navigate an often cruel and cold world. He is relentlessly hunted by the well meaning but narrow sighted Inspector Lunge, who believes Kenzo is guilty of murder. This relation is pretty much lifted directly from Hugo's Les Misrables, but I'm not going to dock points for an anime having literary allusions that are actually well done. Tenma's nemesis is the anarcho-nihilist maniac Johan Liebert. Johan wishes to cause the maximum amount of suffering and destruction simply because he can. He has no fear of death and can't be persuaded with offers of money or power. He is not going to swear and sweat bullets if one of his plans is threatened. This guy simply doesn't give a FUCK. He is going to remind readers inevitably of Allen Moore's Joker from The Killing Joke, which was used as the basis for The Dark Knight. However, Johan's pure level of frightening evil and frequent targeting of children with his hypnotic charisma reminded me even more of literature's original anarcho-nihilist monster: Nikolay Vsevelodovich Stavrogin from Dostoevsky's The Demons. The characters in Monster are larger than life and often far from realistic. I have already explained why I don't consider that a cardinal sin of writing. These are great characters and the viewer will get to know all of them very intimately. \nArt: 8/10\nI actually don't have that much to say about the art. It is quite good, but not the best I have ever seen. Interestingly the art does the opposite of the writing and follows a highly realistic style. There is no moe silliness, giant sweat drops, or fountains of blood coming out of people's noses. Asian characters actually look Asian and can be told apart from the European characters. This is a lengthy anime, but the art doesn't degrade in quality as the series goes on and it didn't blow its budget halfway through the series leaving us with a complete lack of animation at the end (cough Evangelion cough). Overall an 8/10.\nMusic: 8/10\nThe Music is often haunting and does a great job of building suspense. It doesn't have many catchy themes that you will be whistling in the shower, but it gets the job done nicely.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nLet me just warn you that Monster can be quite slow at times. In order to not get ahead of the original manga and not have to create a truckload of bullshit filler, Monster can sometimes move at a snail's pace. It is also very dialogue heavy and tends to lack action, that is when the Magnificent Steiner isn't there to grace us with his badassery! None of my friends made it past episode 5 of Monster, due to its very slow start. However, if you can make it past the first few episodes and have a little patience, it is quite the ride.\nOverall 10/10\nI absolutely adored this series despite its flaws. The manga is my favorite manga of all time, and this anime is a spectacular adaptation. Supposedly Monster is scheduled to become a live action HBO show directed by Del Toro. I am eagerly awaiting new developments on this since rumors started a few years ago. I recommend Monster from the bottom of my heart.\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="                          \n    In short “”””””From masterpiece to ruins””””\nFrom such a headline, you might wonder why I would still give it a 6 ? Well, I've thought about it a lot, as on my personal page it is a 7, and I won't change it, but it is an incredibly biaised note. Normally I’d have given it a 4-5, because of the second part of the anime, but I couldn't bring myself to give that note for the review either. So iin the end I decided to take the middle path for this review and give it a 6 instead (as the show isn't bad from begining to\n          \n        end, on the contrary). It won't stop me, however, to say what is wrong with it. But I’ll try to not spoil it too much.\n\nArt :\nFirst of all, the art, because it is the first thing you encounter. It reminded me a lot of the 80th-90th and it is to be expected considering the manga started in 1994. Some people are going to be repelled by it, personally, it just brings in nostalgia of my childhood. But all in all, if you need \"pretty drawing\" in the more modern \"standards\" the chances are high you'll have issues with this at first. Not that it is bad, but just different. \nWhat's less subjective though, is the drop in animation. I cannot exactly say when, but at one point the proportions and animation just start dropping drastically from frame to frame, as though the budget was starting to run out. Though for the last arc it gets better again.\nStill in the con, some drawings are convenient. !!!SPOILERS!!! For example, Johan dressing as Nina. Dressed as her, his features change, not because he's good with make-up, no, no, at one point he's taking off his wig and he has his own features back whereas the second before, with a wig, it was Nina's face. Same can be said about his general body who is conveniently exactly like Nina, but only for that part because when he's Johan his frame somehow changes to be more masculine (which is rather inconsistent). I can understand they didn't want to give away that it was a fraud - even if it was obvious - but they just went with the easy and lazy way to deliver it. Just by showing he used make-up, or that even in his manly clothes his frame has changed or by \"hiding\" the fake Nina's frame, that would have been more coherent. Oh and lastly, once it is given he's crossdressing, the fake Nina has Johan's features or expressions most of the time. Just way too easy for me. !!!END SPOILERS!!! Also, I don't care if it is like that as well in the manga, I'm speaking about the anime here and that is what matters. An adaptation's responsibility is also to solve the original's work issues, not to simply copy past it.\nOn a lighter tone. When the anime was still a masterpiece, roughly 1/4 of the Anime (the second quarter was good, even if issues started to pop up, the third quarter was harder to get through and the last one was just an utter mess), I really liked how they used the image to convey the story or the emotions rather than through words. It's something that I feel is lost more and more, so having seen it felt really good. Sadly, through the episodes and more specifically toward the two last quarters they abandoned that and spent a lot of time holding your hand (aka, they explain everything, not trusting the people to get it on their own) which is really saddening and sometimes kind of clash with the general mood of the show. But well, that's not really about the art anymore.\nOn the same level though, their way to portray the emotional and mental states of the various cast was really well done. They don’t hold back when it comes to distort the “facial traits” to achieve it. \n\nOpening/Ending :\nTo keep with the visually artistic aspect, I'm gonna brush the opening and ending a little. Both really were good surprises. I'm not really into them, usually, and I'm quite fond of skipping them (between the fanservice and flashy, flashy one, my low tolerance is quick to quit), these however....man, I'll definitely miss them. Especially the opening. Now, it is definitely subjective, of course. What I enjoyed is that they tell stories on their own, they do a \"job\" whereas I often have the impression those two are there for \"decoration\" lately (which isn't negative and not exactly accurate, they try to introduce you to the world of the anime as well, but I don't feel as though they bring much to the anime itself and that the “decoration” aspect is more important than the “introduction”). In a way...my nostalgia is partly talking too.\n\nSound & Soundtrack :\nAnd since I brushed opening and ending, I might as well speak of the soundtrack and the sound design in general. \nAbout the sound I don't have much to say, it was more worked on when they went for telling through images than through words, so kudo that, but for the rest it wasn't ground-breaking.\nAs for the soundtrack, even if it isn't one of those that will stay with me forever, it remains really good and does its job pretty well (it isn't about \"being beautiful\" but about bringing the right ambiance and atmosphere, they can be really different from one to another to fit various mood and situations ; some really are memorable but they are a minority out of the close to 1 hour and a half long soundtrack). It has that \"different\" touch that I really liked too. \n\nStory & Characters\nWell, I've been turning around the bulk for a while, so it may be time I touch that. The story is slow paced ; there aren't thousand ways, you'll either have issue with it or you won't. I, for one, enjoy slow paced stories if they use it well. In this case, it was at first. It was mainly used to develop characters, to show their complexity, to show psychology through images and sound rather than text. Really, I was enticed. As long as it was used properly. But yeah, after one point, the anime started to drag unnecessarily. To build tension for the sake of it. It even starts turning in circles without any real progression, yes, things happen to make you believe it goes farther and farther, but they look more like a “mask” to justify length (and, to cross a bit with the chara part, they keep going back and forth their evolution, losing any consistency, another good way to drag an anime or a manga). \nIn the same type of ideas, a lot of arcs or doors are opened to be abandoned midway. Lunge, for example, suffers a lot from it the most, though close to every charas do. To keep on Lunge, his \"unique trait\" is underused, feeling more as a gimmick rather than an important point, which is really sad. Samewise, Johan’s “impressive ability to manipulate others” appears to be pure magic in the end : “do this !” “ok” “do that !” “ok”. That’s….not convincing…and it was supposedly something amazing.\nMore about the charas, a bunch of them play major roles at first, then completely disappear for no reason, even though they are presented and implemented in the story as mattering factors. Some never reappear again, others do...out of thin air. As though they suddenly were remembered and for what ? To be killed, to be forgotten again or for secondary events that won't even have a vital importance in the end.\nAnd then you have the free exposition. If at first the exposition of the various cast were done nicely, revealing just what is needed, time by time, you eventually have characters whose entire screentime literally consist on their exposition.... Now, it is always good to give depth to your charas, but having a chara telling his life for 5 min and then disappear for the rest of the show is forced and unnecessary. Not to mention that doing it with the subtlety of a tsunami isn't exactly what can be considered proper delivery. Sometimes the exposition also occur in the most inappropriate moments. Like Tenma aiming a certain chara with his gun, said chara, at first afraid, will then suddenly start telling this entire life and...oh and then they are at his home and he invites Tenma inside as though they became some sort of allies, because, errr, well, there's no reason....it's just offscreen ? Maybe... I guess.... Yeah, no, ok....\nAbout the characters development. Issues eventually shows up as well. From Tenma, to Nina, to Johan, to Lunge, to Eva, they lose consistency. For a moment they'll say \"X\", the one just after they'll say \"Y\" then back again to \"X\", then to \"Z\". It turns into a mess of inconsistency. Inconsistent because those changes aren't motivated. A good character development is a \"justified\" development. But like everything, it is really well done and portrayed at first, slowly (maybe too slowly for certain people), sure, but efficient. And then starts crumbling. And some scenes just don’t make sense when knowing the various aims of the charas. Yes, let’s aim at each other while repeatedly shouting the other’s name and letting the third person go away….because ! and third person apparently wasn’t in the mood to accomplish his aim just yet for ignoring one of us so sorely, yeah…not very convincing… They can also not make any sense on their own…for example having a long inner dialogue for several minutes about how you’re going to die and the guy which is about to kill you taking 5 min to shoot because he’s too scared…. Yeah, there was absolutely no way you could have done something in such a long timespan… It’s suicide, hu ? Yeah, I think you can call it suicide….\nIn the same order of ideas, the abuse of twists (just for the sake to pretend to be \"smart\", adding incoherence and losing credibility).Grimmer is a good embodiment of issues. Apart from the various incoherencies, the inability to convey/deliver the chara properly, he has way too many twists in a way too short amount of time to be credible. And after the 3-4 twists from a single chara, newly introduced charas will also start getting on a twist train. Twists are good, they are fun, but they should not be abused. They should not come out of nowhere and bring in incoherencies with the previous material. Though even without twists and character inconsistency you have a good amount of incoherencies, like getting fired but going normally to your job the next day and everyone acting as though your firing never happened or let’s speak about my son and it is for said son I’m doing this, but next time I talk to the same chara I’m saying the polar opposite and we both act as though we never discussed about it ; or no ! I know ! let’s threat someone’s life, kidnap that person and, and, and….errrrr…..we abandoned that arc, sorry, we have no idea what happened after that, but both charas are well and fine ! they…just….took different pathes….somehow…\nOn another level, the mood and tonality will also suffer shifts. As though the targeted demographic changed through the episodes. From a more mature audience to a younger one. It is particularly notable in the ending arc where charas will be “cool”…and OOC, as though it completely accepted to have turned into Shounen. On a more positive note, I do enjoy the parallel between ending and beginning, but the light-mooded epilogue feels really off.\nOverall, I have the feeling that after a certain amount of episodes they had no idea what to do to fill in every episodes so they just had to find ways to drag it : abandoned arcs, abandoned charas, free exposition, twist for twist, charas' inconsistency, etc. they can all be \"justified\" by the need to \"fill\" the episodes (and no, I don’t know how it is in the manga and it still doesn’t matter).\nI liked the various \"main\" cast (I must really give credits to Eva – well…before she loses consistency – to be that hateable character who is portrayed like a human being rather than a simple duality or Manichaeism, she even grew on me). Despite, my issues with them, and I do find one of the main subject : \"alienation\", really fascinating. Each of them represent a different type of alienation, and how hard it is to get out of it. I really just wished the quality wouldn't have dropped. \n\nRecommendation :\nOverall…yes, this review is rather sore…. I do have deep regrets concerning this show… I said it already the first part of the Anime is still a masterpiece, the second part is good ; it’s only the two last parts, half of the show, that has issues, too many issues for it to be considered average. Or maybe I’m just so hard on the second half due to the ruined potential… But well, despite all that, Monster is still one of my favourite Anime, or to be more precise, the first half is. I’ll buy both DVDs and mangas for sure.\nI wouldn’t recommend this show for people having issues with slow pacing or needing exaggerated characterization, this Anime probably won’t satisfy you. If you need “pretty art” – modern standard – to appreciate an anime, you may turn your back to this as well. If you expect a show to take you by the hand, the second half of the show is pretty much for you.\nAs for the others, it might be wise to abandon the anime midthrough, when you start realizing the anime is going down, because, no, it won’t get back up, sadly ; however, if you want to continue you might consider lowering your expectations or turn of your brain for a while ; even if theoretically, it shouldn’t be the type of show for that (and I have nothing against those shows, I always watch them when I just want to relax and nothing else).\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I liked this show so  much, that I decided that it would be one of the few that I'd review, so let's go, shall we?\nStory: Well I have to give this one a full score, for the simple reason that it KNOWS what it wants. What I mean by that is that this is not an action show, or a thriller that has a lot of, well, action. It's very slow paced, which can be a huge turnoff for some, and a refreshing take on storytelling for others. Now you have probably figured it out, but I belong in the latter group, and for\n          \n        good reason. There is none of that \"cute\" look that is oh so common in anime nowadays. Rather, this anime asks the question \"What IS a monster?\". I would write more on this specific part, however I feel like I might end up spoiling something, so I will leave it at this for now.\nArt: The reason that I gave the art a 9/10 is simply because, while great, it does not  do anything special. Normally, I would have lowered the score even more, maybe to a 7 or an 8, I decided on a 9 as the weakness in this art style is also used as a strength, as it perfectly reflects the style and grittyness(?) of the show, without distracting us with things such as odd colour schemes, or bizzare hair colours.\nSound: Once again, the soundtrack isn't really memorable, however, the reason I am giving it a 10/10, is simply because of the way it's used. In this anime, they manage to use the soundtrack at exactly the right times, so much so, that you barely even notice it being there, simply because of how naturally it fits.\nCharacters: Once again, 10/10. This section, however, is the shows greatest strength. The series length gives an opportunity to even develop the smallest of side characters, and as the story progresses, you really get to know our main cast, and the way they change  and develop throughout their journey. This means that if a character leaves, or dies, you can feel geniuenly sad, and when  something good happens, geniuenly happy. You also get to see Tenmas journey, and the people he interacts with in a very organic way. Quite literally nothing in this anime is actually filler, as it all is related to the story somehow. Except for seeing just Tenma, you actually get whole episodes, and even arcs, about the side characters. \n\nWell, other than the very vague review I wrote above, I only have 2 questions:\nHow is this anime not more famous and why are you still reading my review instead of watching this anime?\nSo all in all, 9.9/10, it is a must watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="                          \n    Monster: \nAn anime which is constantly being referred to as \"similar to Death Note\" and is ranked among top #30... WHYYYY???!!?! OH GOD WHY DO THEY GIVE FALSE INFORMATION?!!!!?!!\nStory 5 : \nThe plot seems to be ok. You've all read the summary I presume so I won't repeat it. Tenma chose to save Johan, one of two blond twins and later on he found out that the boy killed his superiors and is in fact a serial killer. \nYears pass, more deaths start to occur, police gets involved, and Tenma is on the run and is searching for Johan to end the monsters life. He\n          \n        finds out there was an experiment held at the foster home where Johan grew up.\nPlot seems good enough and fairly interesting. But the execution however is horrible. So it plays out like this:\nTenma is in this town, Johan is in another, you meet Nina, Johans twin sister who can't remember her childhood, Deiter, a kid who's abused by a man involved with the main plot but not so involved that he has an actual purpose,  there's a gangster called The Baby who's a racist, the Turkish part of the town is set on fire, Tenma's former fiance Eva went from an upper class woman to a drunk,  inspector who is either crazy or has a computer inside his head is chasing after Tenma, Schuwald who has a son but doesn't know where and who he is and many pose as his son just to get to his inheritance, letters sent out from every part of Europe to another, Martin, a bodyguard who fell in love with Eva, Grimmer a man who grew up in the same foster home as Johan, Tenma's childhood friend dr.Gillen wants to sell out Tenma to the police  and much much more..\nSeems like a lot is happening and that it's interesting right? Well...IT ISN'T! Everything is dragged on and massacred with unimportant things, flashbacks, side characters and everything else you can think of. The important things are so butchered, dragged on forever and the unimportant things too that you pray for a good ending! Don't have high hopes for a good ending..\nArt 7 : \nArt is mostly good. On some parts it's horrible and it feels like someone else has drawn it, on others it's good. If you don't like it, you can get used to it. All in all, nothing special.\nSound 3 : \nThe Sound is pretty monotonic and manages to slow down the episodes more if that's humanly possible!!!!\nand now for the Characters 3 :\nKenzo Tenma - a miracle surgeon of japanese origin who's on the run and chasing after a man who made his life miserable and killed a lot of people. He is a positive figure. Sadly, there's nothing else to say about him even though he IS the main character.\nJohan - he was described as \"perfect\" from people who met him and who he didn't kill. A serial killer who was involved in an experiment when he was a young boy. He doesn't actually have a name, but one of his foster parents named him Johan. \nInteresting right? Read on: \nJohan has a \"plan\" throughout the anime..at the end you'll find out what the plan is and see how retarded, meaningless everything that happened was and that the anime itself has no meaning at all.\nNina - Johan's twin sister. She doesn't have memories of her childhood. Johan killed her foster parents when she's 20 years old and she finds out about him from Tenma. She starts chasing after her memories and him. \nAll she can say is basically: \"I REMEBERED!!\" in one episode,\"I wish I could remember..\" in the next one. How does that even make any sense??! \nIt's a closed circle sadly. When she finally does remember something, it's always the same thing: \"I'm scared..\"welcome back\"..Three frogs\".\nDeiter - a kid that's saved from an abusive parent. His only purpose is to make the anime longer. Wouldn't mention him,but he appears in every episode after Tenma saves him.\nSchuwald - same as Deiter, but he's an old, rich, blind man in search for his son.I'm surprised you don't hear about his childhood too.\nWolfgang Grimmer - though he has no purpose, he's the only character that's not boring so I'll write about him despite that fact. \nHe was also a part of the experiment that took place when Johan was a kid. \nWhen he gets angry, \"scared\", tense he blacks out and wakes up covered in blood. Series \"The Amazing Steiner\" are the only thing he can remember from his childhood. \nHe doesn't have any emotions; he learned how to smile, cry, express shock, pain and everything else so he could fit in the society. When his son died he didn't feel a thing; he wasn't sure if he should have cried or not. (Grimmer, the sole reason I gave the Character section a 3, otherwise I'd give it a 1)\nRoberto - an obnoxious lackey of Johan. He just refuses to die in the anime, no matter how many times he gets shot or beaten up. Really annoying.\nEva - Tenma's former fiance who's bitter cause he wouldn't date her again after she dumped him. She became a drunk and wants to put him behind bars but ends up helping him. One of the few people that can prove Johans existence and is a target because of it.\nJan Suk - a young, eager detective. He was framed like Tenma by Johan. Other than the same circumstances he has no significant part to play.\nWould be meaningless to start naming the rest of the characters that showed up for 5 episodes straight because they're all unimportant. There are a few other \"main\" characters but they're just too bland so I can't write anything about them. It's like the writer put every ounce of focus he had to the insignificant parts of the anime and side characters instead of improving the main characters and the plots execution.\nEnjoyment 3 : \nI started to watch Monster cause of the reviews and because everyone keeps comparing it to Death Note. At around 10th episode when I realized it's boring, long and exhausting to watch I kept going just for the sake of completing it.\nOverall 3 : \nLike I've said, the only reason I gave it a 3 was because of Wolfgang Grimmer, otherwise I would give it a 1.\nI had high hopes for it, but I'm not judging the anime based on that. I read all the reviews, ratings and everyone gave it a 10! I have no idea why though.\nI have no idea how this anime came to be associated with Death Note nor how it got among top 30 because it's pathetic, it drags on forever and on top of that, after all torment, you get a stupid ending.  \nMy advice is, if you plan on watching it and it becomes boring for you at any time, shut it down and watch something else. \nOr, if you're not sure if it suits you or not, watch Night Head Genesis (it has fewer episodes and is the same basically) first and then decide.\nHope you found it helpful :) and that those positive reviewers won't find it \"not helpful\" just because I disagree and say it's horrible\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Never in a million years did I think I would enjoy a series in terms of it being about a doctor on a journey to solve a mystery, I thought for me I would of been bored within the first two episodes. How wrong I was, from the moment the first episode started and we have the religious text come up I knew I was in for something special and this became more apparent when I saw just how much was set up without having to be said. Monster is one of those series that grips you and never let's go.\nStory\nThe story of Monster follows\n          \n        Dr Tenma who is working in German for a very high regarded hospital and once he learns about the corrupt dealings he chooses to save the life of a young boy over the mayor and as soon as the mayor dies he is shunned by the people in charge, but when those people die he is flung right back to the top but is labelled the prime suspect in the murders. Years later and Dr Tenma finds out who the killer is and it's a discovery he wish he had never found out. Now Tenma must go on the run and find out more about the monster who is causing German to turn into a country of chaos and who is turning into the next Hitler. \nTo say more about the story of Monster would ruin it, it is a series that has to be seen to believe. At 74 episodes it may seem a bit long and a bit boring to some people but overall this series is meant to reflect a very realistic style of story telling and there are times in life where it is boring and long winded but that makes all the more exciting moments more exciting and when action happens it gives you a sense of rush that when the slow moments come in again after that rush it feels like it fits as you will need at times to take a break from all of the intense moments that happen in the story. So for me I felt that the slower moments were needed in order to keep the audience from getting an over rushed feel of emotion and it helps for the audience to let these emotions sink in.\nOverall when it comes to story, this story is complex always moving, always having the right balance of exciting action but slowly and quiet moments and just allowing the audience to see the characters as characters and allow the audience to grow an attachment to them.\n10/10.\nCharacters\nWhen it comes to characters, again never have I had more attachment to a cast of characters like the cast of Monster, what I find most exciting is that every character is used in just the right amount, not too little and not too much and there are times in the narrative where certain main characters (Tenma included) will disappear from the story but this also gives us a chance to catch up with other major players and see the role that they are playing in the mystery, this I feel is a smart move as it gives the story as sense of an ensemble world and makes the audience excited for seeing these characters again rather then overexposing them. What really makes this cast so wonderful is all there different personalities and interactions with everyone and how everything ties back into the main theme of the story of what is the monster. \nSpeaking of which the most amazing thing for me is that every character in the story that we see is influence by the two main characters those Being Tenma and Johan and how everything and everybody always comes back to these two characters and makes everyone connected however remote which helps make the story that much more grand and epic in own way. Even though some characters don't appear till later in the story they still come in a feel like they belong and their characters help to drive the story to it's final epic climax. All the characters really get their chances to shine and even the minor characters allow themselves to be memorable thanks to them being written well and having larger then life personalities.\nHowever to talk about each and every character in great detail would take me as long as a dissertation at university which is a shame as I would of loved to have done a dissertation \"which in a sense is a book\" on this fantastic series. So I will be brief in talking about the six main players of this story, those being Tenma, Johan, Nina, Lunge, Eva and Dieter. I'll start with Dieter.\nDieter starts off as a young man who is being treated in a similar way to many of the children of the past and when Tenma sees this he helps him escape this hell in his in. Afterwards he becomes a companion and a sidekick to Tenma, even though Tenma wants him not to follow him and for a large portion he doesn't follow Tenma but it's this companionship that helps Dieter help other children who were like him to see Tenma's view and without Dieter I think Tenma would be a completely different person.\nEva starts off as engaged to Tenma however when her father is killed and she blames Tenma for it she drops of the wagon and becomes a hateful woman who can't see anything good in the world and just drinks herself to death. Once she realizes Tenma's innocence she starts to pull her act together and seeing how some people will help her regardless of what she thinks of them really helps her to turn her life around and become a much better person. When I started watching Monster she was my least favorite character mostly because she just wined and moaned about everything yet thanks to the story and how she changed over the course of the series she became a much better character and one that I didn't end up hating in the end.\nLunge is an inspector for the Bka and the man who becomes a rival to Tenma thinking that he is responsible for the murders that are happening in Germany and how he created Johan through a split personality. Lunge is cold and calculating and can accurately pin point information and details into his brain or hard drive as he calls it. He lives for his work so much that eh doesn't even care when his family leaves him. He works like a computer to the point that he tries to convince himself his word is final and no matter what, even if the truth is starring him in the face he will never accept that his word is wrong. However when it becomes apparent of who is really behind the chaos in Germany he is force to accept for the first time in properly his career that he is wrong and sets about to bring about an end to the chaos in his own way.\nNina Foritner is Johan Libert's twin sister and is one of the main protagonists after Tenma, I won't say why they have different names as that will spoil one of the major plot points of the series. Nina starts off as an average girl living with her parents, however when memories of her past start to catch up with her she along with Tenma go to try and solve the mystery of her past and what happened and through her interaction with Tenma becomes a more stronger person and through her interaction with Dieter is able to stay grounded in who she truly is. She eventually with Tenma's help is able to confront her brother about their past, again what makes it so amazing is how the story can take these characters and through them in certain situations and how they change and Nina is no different, seeing the horrors of what her brother does is what truly inspires her to dig into her past and find her brother so that she can put an end to his reign of terror. Nina is probably my second favorite female protagonist and probably in my top three characters in Monster. Now we get to talk about my two favorite characters. Tenma and Johan.\nTenma is the main character and in my opinion the greatest anime character of all time. The reason being is that he is confronted with ideals and beliefs that are out of his element yet he still always tries to do the right thing yet even then he is still human and never lets the fact that certain people do horrible things keep him from making them suffer a little yet despite that he will try and help them as best he can. Throughout the series he always has the mandate that all life is equal and no one no matter how bad they have become deserve to die as he always believes that it's never to late to start over and make a fresh start and this mandate of his is what truly made me excited about following him and seeing him grow because he does see the corruptions around him and he is forced to do things that in the past he wouldn't of done but that's what makes him truly a hero the fact that he still holds on to his believe that no one deserves to die but he does have to do things that go against that sometimes and he isn't a perfect person but he is never the less still a person and a good person who will try to pull through impossible odds and when he is being told he is going to be arrested or told that nobody wants his help he still helps them and tries his best to save people and always show them a different way of life and throughout the story I always felt he made the right choice and even after seeing Johan do unspeakable things he still treats Johan like a person and chooses to save him yet again because he can't bring himself to end another person's life no matter what and that is inspirational to me that fact that he becomes a hero starting off as a simple man and to give me that belief that everyone shouldn't be treated any differently even if they are considered evil. But above all I feel his greatest strength comes in his desire to simple never give up on anyone. I love Tenma because of how he holds on to his humanity through the story and how he shows me the true value of sticking to what you believe in even though others around you are telling you otherwise and how you can't just give up on someone.\nAnd now we get to talk about the main villain and the reason why this manga/anime is here Johan Libert. If you want to talk terrifying complex and damaged characters look no further. Johan really is a true psychopath in every sense of the word and this comes down to the fact that he is so harmless on the surface but that is all a disguise for a heart that is as black as a black hole in space and a mind which is even sharper then Guts's sword from Berserk. Johan makes people trust him and then kills them in certain ways depending on how he is feeling, Johan's overall goal is to kill as many people as possible to become the last person at the end of the world and see the world unfold into a rave of chaos and destruction. He tries to get Tenma and others to shot him so that the monster in him will turn to them and they will become monsters themselves. Johan simply can be considered the one character that you would never suspect of doing anything wrong which makes it all the more shocking when things are damaged by his hands. Johan kills for himself and nothing more and sees it as just a part of his life and let's face it when people are calling you the monster, the devil and the next Hitler all at the same time, you know you are not to be messed with under any circumstances. Johan is one truly terrifying character and that fact that even at the end we still don't know much about him makes it even more scary. Plus because he hardly appears in the story makes it even more shocking when he does pop up and the way people talk about him and how every murder is orchestrated by him and the longer he is around the more people die makes him a psychopath on a grand scale. Tenma sees life as equal, Johan sees life as nothing, perfect definition of two sides of the the same coin and really makes for a battle of the minds and every time he appeared in the story or even when a event was brought up because of him I got a sense of dread and despair which I have never felt before. Johan is truly the greatest anime villain and possibly the best villain of all time from his actions and shadowy presence throughout the story.\nWith a rich cast that will have at least one character anybody will fall in love with Monster makes great use of an ensemble a rich complex cast that is of epic nature. \n10/10.\nNow when it comes to sound, the music fits really well with the intense moments and the nice quieter moments and that's all I can say, plus the opening song is one of the best ever. My personal favorite tracks are the one used in the final episode for when the articles about Tenma are being read for it's triumphant nature and Johan's theme for reason I don't need to example. The music fits well with a lot of stand out tracks that give the series a very real sense of the situations that go on. When it comes to voice acting I feel that Monster's dub gives a much better listen then the Japanese version. I know many people might think differently but I feel this dub falls with Cowboy bebop and Full metal Alchemist. Primarily because of the main cast, Lunge sounds more robotic in the English which is true of the character and Johan in the dub sounds much more colder and sinister then the Japaneses voice actor, plus at the end of the series I feel like the voice for Tenma really feels like he has gone on this long epic journey. The Japanese cast is great don't get me wrong and the sub is a fantastic listen I just feel the dub captures the impact of the manga much more.\nSo sound wise the music and voice acting once again is top notch. \n10/10.\nNow we come to the last parts, the arts style really gives off some memorable moments and makes great use of it's setting. Being set in Germany it allows for the use of a lot of great areas to explore ranging from the hospital at the beginning of the series to the vast open landscape. Each setting allows the artwork to expand and become a character itself, when we enter a new setting it is drawn differently and gives off it's over unique feel which allows the audience to not be bulked down on repeated usage of scenery and allows us to connect to each of the location and give a sense that this a huge story. Also when it comes to the characters the art style allows them to act as normal people and be expressed like normal people which helps with the realistic nature of the story. \nWith some memorable locations that are capture on a drawing and very realistic characters the artwork is a treat for the eyes and never let's your eyes see two locations that are drawn the same.\n10/10\nWhen it comes to enjoyment of the series for me personally as you've probably figured out, Monster is my favorite anime/manga/any tv show ever. My reason I have already explained and every time I watch it I get this sense that I have always been on a experience to a place with a vast landscape and it makes me want to visit that place and travel around it and being set in the real world I can do that. Monster helps me to see the best in humanity as well as the worst and makes me satisfied when i do see the best in humanity win the day without the use of violence all the time. \nOverall Monster is a series that just gets me filled with so many emotions. I maybe a little long winded for some people but I am not one of those people and it allows me to feel like I am there sharing these experience with the characters as they are going through the experience too. With powerful characters an epic storyline and a great enjoyable experience. Monster is my favorite all time series period. Nothing has and nothing will again grip me like this epic series did.\n10/10 for a masterpiece in animation and anime history.\n        "},

Why do bad things have to happen to good people, people who have such good intentions? This is a question you will think about a lot throughout the series.\nMonster tells the story of an innocent doctor who is trying to find the person who ruined his life, while at the same time, being chased by an obsessed detective. The beliefs of certain characters in this anime are very deranged, and show how ugly humans can be. The anime does a very good job at portraying this, mainly\n          \n        through the use of facial expressions.\nThe style in which the story is carried out is certainly effective in gaining the attention of the viewers. The story starts off at a fairly slow pace. As you continue to watch, however, you'll find yourself being drawn in by it. Monster is the kind of series where you just have to know what happens next. There are 74 episodes, but as I am nearly finished, there really hasn't been a boring moment yet. It just keeps getting better and better. You will see many different characters, and at first, their connection to the story may be unknown. Then, out of nowhere, they might run into one of the main characters. There are also times when the main focus will switch between the main characters, allowing you to get a glimpse as to what the others have been up to.\nAll of the characters are well developed, and you really learn a lot about them, even the ones who only appear for a short period of time. The background of a few characters, including the villain, are mostly unknown. This is another way in which Monster grabs your attention. You are learning at practically same pace as the main characters, and whenever they discover something, you share the same expression as they do.\nDespite the number of episodes, none of them are filler; in fact, this anime is one of the few in which every scene is taken directly from the manga. The music fits the anime very well, but it isn't all that memorable for the most part. The ending is pretty creepy, but that's a good thing considering the nature of the anime. I like the opening a lot, especially the choir part at the beginning, mostly because it reminds me of Death Note. (In fact, if I could make a comparison between this and another anime, I would say it is like Death Note without the supernatural powers.) The animation isn't anything special, and the character design may take some time getting used to it, but the story is where this anime truly shines. Monster has already taken its place as one of my favorite anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    **THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**\nI think that there is nothing in this world that can be truly perfect because there will always be flaws there to see. I see masterpieces as a thing that has the least amount of flaws and finding an anime that is a masterpiece is a really hard thing to find but I can confirm that Monster is definitely a masterpiece.\nStory: (10/10)\nThe story in Monster begins in the 1980s West Germany with an amazing neurosurgeon named Kenzou Tenma who after doing surgery on a young boy who has taken a bullet to the head his life begins to fall\n          \n        apart. The town mayor that he was supposed to operate on instead of the young boy dies making everybody who he works with hate him, his boss doesn't give him a promotion, and his fiancee leaves him which then makes him fall into depression. One day all of Kenzou's enemies die mysteriously and the boy that he operated on disappears. After a few years, Kenzou discovers that the boy he saved was a complete monster and thus causing Kenzou to go find him and stop all the madness. The story for this anime is amazing, it uses symbolism at the best times, the suspense that builds up during the whole anime is amazing, and the different moral decisions that the characters have to go through in situations leave the viewer also feeling the same way as the characters. All that happens in the anime is very thought provoking and gets rid of any anime tropes. The main problem I hear people have with the anime's story is that it uses pointless filler but thing is is that the pointless filler that they talk about is actually not filler at all, it all helps the story with the stories that the characters tell and even come up in later parts in the anime.\nArt and Animation: (9/10)\nThe art in this anime is amazing. The realistic art style the anime uses all helps the scenes look very creepy and sets the mood. The backgrounds look all great because they all show how Germany would look. The animation is also fantastic because it also adds to all the intensity that the scenes have.\nSound: (9/10)\nThe soundtrack is great. It adds to the eeriness and the suspense of the anime. The OP and EDs are great and the voice actors all did a fantastic job with the characters, probably some of the best voice acting in anime. The sound effects that are used all make the scenes more intense.\nCharacters: (10/10)\nThe best thing about the anime definitely goes to the characters. The main character of the anime is Kenzou Tenma but will often switch to different characters and they will give us their perspective of things which I think is fantastic. Tenma is at first is a man that is usually happy most of the time because of which direction his life going in which was up, but as the story progressed into the later part of the anime he turned into a more complex character due to everything he was going through and how much more he views life. His morality always gets challenged with every situation he is in which definitely helps the viewer relate to him. The main antagonist in the anime is also a great character. He is much more different and complex than any other anime villain I have ever seen. His main objective is to cause as much chaos as he possibly can because he just finds it fun even if he is put in severe danger but it doesn't even matter to him. He doesn't feel any fear and cannot be swayed from his plan of causing destruction. An interesting thing that I found about him is that he rarely uses combat against his enemies, the thing he mostly does to kill his enemies is to psychologically attack them in a way that only that specific character can understand which I think is amazing because we rarely see this type of method used in anime. I could go on and on about how every character in this anime is amazing but that would take way too much time so I will just say that you will have to see the anime so it wouldn't ruin the fun of experiencing every character.\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\nI cannot express how much I love this anime. It is one of the best anime I have ever seen!!\nOverall: (10/10)\nMonster is such a great anime. Again, I cannot how express much I love this anime. You will get fully immersed in the characters and the story, it is a MUST watch for any anime viewer.            \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="                          \n    Monster is a series which gets almost universal praise. And for a good reason - it is a very good show and I enjoyed thoroughly almost every episode of it. But unfortunately it is sort of a failed masterpiece - and as such it may ultimately be not as rewarding as its ratings suggest or even worse, may leave the viewer with a (very) strong sense of disappointment. \nAnd because watching it is potentially disappointing, all the more the series is 74 episodes long  -  three times the normal show's length, mind you - please treat this review as a warning (as non-spoiler-ish\n          \n        as possible). \nThe show around the middle seems almost perfect. It has a great premise which constantly evolves when a protagonist uncovers new layers of what he is destined to confront. The series evolves simultaneously by expanding its cast of characters and by narrating its story through different conventions - Monster starts as a kind of fugitive on the run crime revenge story, but in its run it touches many different (though related) genres - there are elements (or even entire arcs) of road movie, detective story, horror, conspiracy drama, psychological thriller, medical drama, soap opera and film-noir. This variety of means of story narrating (and variety of spotlight's characters) keeps attention of the viewer and make her overlook quite a few clichéd events. The ensemble cast is also a very strong point of the show - obviously some of them are walking archetypes, but some of them are very much not and even when they are, they're designed in an interesting way.\nWhat is worth noting, Monster is almost entirely non-animesque both in characters' design, in its setting and also in its choice of themes and plot devices. There are almost no distinctively Japanese tropes present - the show much more resembles the HBO live-action series that its anime counterparts. Art style and soundtrack fit the show very well and emphasize its grim atmosphere - from the opening to the end credits. Bleak colors and ominous sounds serve the show very well. The world of Monster is stylishly sketched and sound-tracked in a way which helps the viewer to immerse in it. Designs of the streets, buildings, \"the city out of fairy tale\" and a certain unique children book cannot be easily forgotten. \nUntil the very last arc there are minor flaws here and there - several, though very rare, bland individual episodes, maybe one arc not on the par with the others. But for so long a series it's hard to find anything to sincerely criticize. Yes, the anime relies too heavily on suspense - even while doing it masterfully (and it really does it masterfully), the constant cuts of the scene in the heat of the moment could grow old on the impatient after 50+ episodes. The constant use of cuts in most thrilling moments also prevents the anime from showing most of the action sequences it could have had. I wouldn't mind this in the shorter series, but in the longer one, even more variety than it already has would be welcome. And sometimes there is a little too much melodrama, and one or two cheap tricks too many. \nBut it is all forgivable. My only real gripe through series run was a growing uneasy feeling that there is a significant inconsistency between individual characters' actions, the way story treats them and the show's dark setting - on the one hand the unfolding events are rather creepy and disturbing, on the other some characters tend to behave like pre-modern Disney movie heroes.  The show during many episodes lands surprisingly often in territory of a very clear-cut version of black and white morality. What's more, it tends to resolve conflicts in favor of the white side by plot conveniences. It contrasts starkly with the overall grim mood. This tonal dissonance fluctuates - it is not always prominent, sometimes it is abandoned for good. \nUp to the last part the series weaves skillfully its premise and subsequent multiple parallel threads, interconnecting and twisting them. It's worth repeating that individually most of them are stellar. But as they unravel they don't conclude the main story and leave much of the mystery concealed to the very end. The build-up is so enormous that it promises the viewer not only a satisfactory ending, but rather catharsis in its most refined form. The problem is the series fails to deliver on that promise. The conclusion comes and it's not cathartic. It isn't even satisfactory. It isn't bad, by any stretch of imagination, and it isn't one of the usual anime endings which doesn't resolve anything. Still by the series own standards it isn't satisfactory enough - all of these threads don't connect neatly, some of them are left hanging in the air, few are connected in an unconvincing way and quite a few plot-holes are created. \nAnd it happens apparently not only because creators wrote themselves into corner by sheer complexity of their story and by setting the viewers' expectations unbelievably high. Their story not only seems to rush last arc, not only doesn't fully connect its multiple threads, but ultimately it doesn't wholly abandon the aforementioned tonal dissonance. It refuses to draw serious consequences from itself. It's unbelievably infuriating because almost all the pieces needed to make a better ending are there, yet the creators choose the unsatisfactory way. I understand the reasons for that, they have much to do with the ethical message the writer tries to convey and a little with cultural differences between Japan and West in terms of a certain public morality issue (I don't want to spoil here exactly what issue). Yet I find such reasons and such a way of concluding story fundamentally outdated. And hypocritical.\nFor some it won't be a problem at all. Some may even like the ending - I repeat, it's not bad, it's only dishearteningly inadequate. So bear in mind that you might be heavily disappointed by it - if you are the person who could live with a 74 episodes long fascinating journey which doesn't necessarily lead anywhere you definitely should watch this. If you are not, seriously reconsider committing yourself to such a long anime, it may be not worth it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    Let's get one thing out of the way first: I REALLY liked Monster! But, I wouldn't watch it again...\nMonster is a down-to-Earth psychological crime drama. At first, it might appear to have supernatural elements, but I won't spoil it for you. After watching the entire thing, I would say Monster would've been great as a live-action TV series, which couldn't be said for any other anime I watched so far (and I watched quite a lot). It has everything a great series needs, a cast of characters that the audience can care about, action-packed scenes to liven up the pretty in-depth crime drama, great character\n          \n        development, a good story full of twists and turns that will keep you coming back for more, and an astonishing and realistic art-style to wrap it all together. During it's epic 74 episode run time, it brings up many hard questions about the human psyche, morality and human connections, relationships. How far are we willing to go to accomplish our goals? How much of your humanity are you willing to trade in for them? What is \"humanity\" anyway? Some of the episodes are frighteningly realistic in describing the human condition and it doesn't back down from touching really hard social and historical taboos either. No, it grabs you by the hair and slams your face in them saying \"Look! That's what you are!\". I can safely say Monster was one of the most unique and thought-provoking experiences I've ever had.\nBut, (and yes, here comes the \"but\") Monster is anything but perfect. While it's action-packed and suspenseful story would stand great on it's own, it's sadly spread too thin and too long. The story needlessly drags on for 74 full-length episodes and the ending feels more like a coup de grace than closure. The cast of main characters is huge, and while they are really well made and fleshed out, we are continuously introduced to a slew of new side-characters that have barely any relevance to the main story (if at all). The writers regularly go off on tangents just to demonstrate a small plot point or tidbits of (mostly irrelevant) character backstory, bringing in and taking out characters on a whim after they \"served their purpose\". In the end, they were seemingly just struggling to give enough individual screen-time to their monstrously bloated cast (pun intended), and it only makes the audience lose interest in them and lose count on who is who why they are even there.\nThe story itself is mostly delivered in (sometimes painfully dragged out) exposition. The series lurches forward in needlessly detailed investigation sequences, flooded with meaningless trivia and extra character backstory that have little to no bearing on the main story itself. The story paths regularly branch off into dead-ends and meaningless side-plots that fill entire episodes, yet don't bring anything new or interesting to the table. The sheer amount of dialogue and narration in Monster would fill entire volumes of books. Even the exposition itself is riddled by double-takes, needlessly repeated flashback segments, and a ton of redundant, rephrased information. You can seriously skip entire dozens of episodes and still understand everything because of mind-blowing number of flashback scenes, and the characters even keep repeating themselves over and over. The whole series could've been distilled down to a neat 30-40 episodes without losing any of the story.\nMy third (entirely personal) beef with this series is with the setting itself. Unlike most anime, the entire story of Monster takes place in 80's and 90's Europe (mostly Germany and the former Czechoslovakia). See, I was born and still living in Europe, I lived in the time and place the show takes place. Monster being a work of fiction, I chalked up most of the factual, cultural and historical errors and inconsistencies to \"writer's freedom\" and \"suspension of disbelief\" and such. While the creators of the anime obviously did their homework and got most of the general things right, there were some details that bugged me more than they should've. Little, insignificant things that most people from other parts of the world would miss, were just screaming at me from the screen. Getting used to the obviously Japanese idiosyncrasies, mannerisms, phrases and behaviors forced upon the allegedly fully European characters is one thing. But small details like choice of words, custom, type of foods/drinks, fashion, architecture or even music in some places were just flat our wrong and felt so out of place that it shoved me right out of the immersion. The whole thing felt like someone went to the library and read a whole bunch of books and travel guides about Europe, but never actually been there. I know it sounds lame, but since I did live here at the time of the anime, and the creators obviously tried to recreate the European setting realistically, I just couldn't help it.\nI know I spent most of this review pandering on what's wrong with Monster, but the truth is, I really liked it, and I stand by my score of 8/10. It's really worth watching for everyone who desires something other than the run-of-mill anime, something unique. If you can overlook the droll exposition and sometimes aimlessly branching and dragged out storytelling, you'll find a really suspenseful and interesting story of crime and punishment, dark secrets, interesting characters, huge plot twists, thrilling psychological expeditions into the human mind and soul and much more.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    Monster could really have been a good show, but like so many works it tried to put too much stuff in one packet to really deliver anything.\nThe premise was very interesting, and if compressed into 20-30 episodes could have made a great series. However, it went the another way, putting Tenma through many many sidequests that had nothing to do with the main plot, and the wangst resulting all his encounters had not much to do with his character's development. In classical terms, we would call these 'fillers'.\nIf these were quickly over their existence would not ruin the overall enjoyment. However, they are treated as\n          \n        equally important with the main story, and the pacing which is on par with The Bold and the Beautiful totally killed the enjoyment.

The Beatles asked this question four dozen years ago - yet the answer remains deficient. Suffice it to say that MONSTER is not the type of series that will deliver us - the viewers - an easy answer. To first understand WHY we're lonely, we must explore the true nature of us humans.\nDr. Tenma is a gifted (yet naive) Japanese neurosurgeon working in Düsseldorf during the mid '80th. The politically-unstable era saw the sparkle of unity among German youth, though Dr. Tenma does not get to witness this rising tide; He's about to get married to sought-after\n          \n        daughter of his hospital director, with the position of Head-Surgeon right beneath his feet. Away from his homeland, the illusion of wealth blinds the conversant Doctor. \nIt only takes a few gunshots - Fired many miles away from the Hospital - to change his false perception of reality. \nIn a way, Johan Liebert did Dr. Tenma a favor. By having his position, fiancé and respect taken away from him, Dr. Tenma starts to see the world as it truly is. The journey which he embarks upon years later (while hiding from the police) forces him to deal with his inner demons. \nThough that's not the case for Anna, a cheerful and a good-hearted college student whose loving environment is taken away from her as her gruesome past begins to resurface. These two lonely souls must change their inner beliefs in order to subsist.\nJohan Liebert's part in the series resembles that of a Vole operating underground; we mostly get to hear about him as a legend rather than witness him in action. The scariest monsters are the ones we cannot see, and little by little Johan establishes himself as the scariest motherfucker in any room. Neither before nor after watching MONSTER have I encountered a ghastlier nemesis. By the time he was 18, Johan's name became a fearsome legend spread faster than that of DEATH NOTE's \"KIRA\".\nSimilarly to THE FUGITIVE (1993), MONSTER pit two characters with superior intelligences against one another. While on the run, inspector Heinrich Lunge takes a nearly obsessive agenda to capture Dr. Tenma. In a Hitchcock-esque way, we're not easily able to choose sides. The Inspector's character is too compelling for us to hate, making their cat-and-mouse game intriguing not any less than Johan's manhunt. \nWhile not the best looking anime of its era, MONSTER excels at adapting 99.9% of Naoki Urusawa's original manga, to the point of preserving frames as well as the art style. Germany's (and later the Czech Republic's) big cities and countrysides are well detailed and umbrageous - keeping the shady mood of revolution constantly in the background. \nNot many thriller anime series can be proud of getting some closure, yet MONSTER will give the middling viewer a satisfying conclusion by its endpoint. More peevish viewers will be glad to hear about the series half point which is as intense as a season finale.\nMONSTER is Urusawa's magnum opus: The 74-episodes journey manages to balance the right amount of suspense and drama. All of the main characters overgrow their inner problems during the course of the series, while having their lives at risk (and keeping every viewer on the edge of his seat).\nI can proudly announce it as one of my top 3 anime series of all time, not wrecked by the wheel of time. It may not give us the answer to The Beatles' song, merely a speculation, yet MONSTER explores the nature of humanity enough for us to ask the right question: What can individuals do to never be lonely again?\n        "},

It really is him. Its doctor teenma. It REALLY IS! DR TEENMA SAVED ME TOO.\nARE YOU FKING KIDDING ME. \nExample of how this convo. would go IRL: Character A: shit its DR. Tenma. \nThere is absolutely no development in this anime. Although all the characters cling to their past, what I want to get at is how the same shit happens over and over again and the results are always the same AND they take forever to get there. Dieter must have been told 6 or 7 times to stay behind because he is too young for this type of life, yet every damn time, he back talks into tagging along. What i'm saying is, why is there so much screen time placed into these damn scenes (each time is like 3 minutes). There are many other ways to show his stubbornness.. Little things like this take up more than half of the 74 episode screen time. (totally irrelevant). \nAnother example, Tenmas most spoken phrases:\n1:“only me, only I can do it, no, I must do it, I have to do it. Because I was the one. The one who saved ……a monster... I must kill him to prevent more deaths.\" \n2: \"NO I CANT DO IT, I JUST CANT, I cant shoot him\"\n3. ANNA, You mustn’t kill him!. Because I have to do it. \n4. Repeat. (Anna does the exact same thing too. In the end, after all that screen time of retarded indecisiveness, nothing happened).\nRetarded dialogue.. literally every chance the script writer had, he did the following:\nA: It is ….it is…. HIM\nB: WHO???\nA: the man who… Who… he is… He is… he is… none other than…. A MONSTER (TERROR)\nIRL (A): \"He is Johan.\"\nIRL (B): \"OH\" *shocked*\n\n5. Enjoyment (2/10)\nI honestly really enjoyed the first 20 episodes. Then I got fed up with how ridiculous the dialogue was and how extremely long this anime was. I don’t appreciate how the creators put in so much repeats and recaps when there were 74 fucking episodes (it's like how i use write my middle school essays). Every detective repeated the entire case every damn time they got a chance to and the story book was read from beginning to end like 5 TIMES. This anime would've been so much better with 24 episodes.\n\n6. Overall (4/10)\nLike all media, the negative always has a heavier impact than the positive. A great story just doesn’t cut it for me if the characters are not practical. I do not recommend this anime, I actually skimmed threw episodes 64-74 but really had no idea what went on since all i could read was Johan's retarded riddle-like words, repeated scenes and the words HIM and MONSTER.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Monster, really an underrated anime on this site. Naoki Urusawa, the writer of masterpieces such as 20th Century Boys, and Master Keaton has once again proven his meticulous and ingenious writing with Monster. Now, talking about what makes Monster such an ingenious piece of writing is very difficult without delving into spoilers, so although I'll try my best to avoid any spoilers, there may be a tiny one here and there. I hope that you read my review, and whether or not you liked my review, I really hope that you give the anime a watch. \n\"It's not given to people to judge what's right\n          \n        or wrong. People have eternally been mistaken and will be mistaken, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\"\nThis is another anime where the story delves into deeper concepts about reality. The anime has universal questions similar to other great anime such as Death Note. How can you tell right apart from wrong? What is the \"right\" thing to do? What is life, what's our role in life, and what does it mean to be dead? Is everyone's life equal? What is justice, and what's the right way to carry it out?Is the death penalty a fair punishment to those who are evil? What is considered evil? How do we find our identity? What made us, humans such cruel, and repulsive creatures... Were we just born that way? Furthermore, how we do we repent upon our sins?\nA lot of questions to think about, I know but truly consider all of them while watching Monster.\nStory: 10/10 - I must begin by saying that the plot is VERY realistic and it relates to our real world (Very tragic). We start out with our protagonist, Doctor Kenzo Tenma, a young, genius neurosurgeon living in Germany, whose life-path has been laid out for him, thanks to his unrivaled talents. However Dr. Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients (inequity in our world), and decides to change things around... So, after a massacre brings fraternal twins Johan and Anna Liebert into the hospital, Dr. Tenma going against his orders, decides to operate on Johan who arrived before the Mayor of Düsseldorf instead of waiting and operating on the Mayor of Düsseldorf. Johan is saved, but the Mayor of Düsseldorf dies. Receiving all the blame, Dr. Tenma loses his social standing (and his fiance) as a result, but he doesn't regret it because he continuously reminds himself that he did the right thing in saving fatally wounded kids even though it cost the life of a mayor. Was it the right thing to do? To save kids who have no home, no money, no status, and most importantly, nobody knows anything about, over a Mayor who is higher up than the kids in the social hierarchy that exists in this world, even today? Moving on... After Johan and Anna Liebert are saved and Dr. Tenma loses his position, the other doctors that Dr. Tenma worked with are mysteriously murdered, and Dr. Tenma becomes the prime suspect, but due to lack of evidence is only questioned and later released by the police. Nine years later, Dr. Tenma worked his way back up, and is now the Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial Hospital. All seemed to be peaceful and right in Dr. Tenma's life until one day, his patient was murdered in front of his eyes, and the murderer, being the boy he saved and lost his status for nine years ago, Johan Liebert. Dr. Tenma reports Johan Liebert to the police, but the police unable to locate a Johan Liebert, suspect Dr. Tenma of yet again another murder. Distraught that what he believed was the right thing has actually led to so much misery, Dr. Tenma begins to track down Johan, wanting to hunt the Monster down as atonement for his fatal mistake. Dr. Tenma believes that killing is never the answer, all human lives are equal, everyone has the freedom to live, and that he would save as many people as he could. \nSo can Dr. Tenma truly \"hunt/kill\" someone even if they're a \"monster\"? Dr. Tenma's hunt for Johan brings him face to face with the repulsive, and disturbing underbelly of the world, from corrupt politics to organized crime, from serial killers to innocent orphans, a showcasing of how a man can turn himself into a force of evil, of how easy it is to destroy the fragile balance of life, and how tragic the world we live in is. And so, the deep psychological mystery begins. The anime is 74 episodes long. \"Oh gosh it's so long, it probably drags on with useless filler.\" If you think that then you utterly, absolutely, definitely couldn't be more WRONG. Each one of those 74 episodes constantly keeps the viewer engaged. Everything in Monster has a cause and is perfectly executed. You just have to pay attention, and Monster will be ruthless and not let your eyes leave the screen for a second.\nCharacters: 10+/10 - Monster is the masterpiece with the greatest character deepness, diversity, and development I've ever seen. Each character played a big part in the main plot. Each character symbolized a significant part of Human Nature, and are connected to crime/justice in reality. Off the top of my head I'll list characters that Monster went into thorough detail developing their character: Dr. Tenma, Johan Liebert (ESPECIALLY THIS GUY), Anna (Nina Fortner) Liebert, Wolfgang Grimmer, Franz Bonaparta, Director Udo Heinemann, Eva Heinemann, Inspector Heinrich Lunge, and a young boy named Dieter. Dr. Tenma being the \"I'll save everyone because everyone has the right to live\" doctor. Throughout the series, Kenzo kept meeting all sorts of people like Grimmer, Anna, Rudy GillenDieter and many more, are people of the real world that kept changing his notion of what good and what bad is left in this world (diverse morality views).  Anna Liebert (Nina Fortner) the \"scar-filled, broken but tries her best to stay upbeat\" twin-sister of Johan Liebert. Wolfgang Grimmer, a survivor of Kinderheim 511 who is a spy disguised as reporter... Grimmer is trying to unravel and reveal the truth behind Kinderheim 511, and why it had happened (truly tragic). Franz Bonaparta a neurosurgeon, and psychologist who was a German-born Czech born After World War II. Bonaparta was arguably the \"monster\" in this anime because he had the whole plan of creating a superior human using eugenics and forcing the Liebert twin's mother to choose between her kids. In addition, the fact that he poisoned the people at the red mansion and killed the mother's lover only added to his willingness to do whatever he had to do to achieve his goal. 74 episodes of non-stop character development/twists. Truly amazing.\nJohan Liebert is a character I must dedicate an entire paragraph to, for, he is the ultimate villain yet non-villain (stay with me here). How much do you think the surrounding environment affects a person's behavior/development? Johan Liebert is truly an Anti-Christ figure. Johan Liebert (along with his twin sister, Anna Liebert) were \"created\" as a result of the eugenics experiment orchestrated by Franz Bonaparta in Kinderheim 511. The primary goal of the experiment was to create a child who not only had an exceptionally high level of intellect but could also \"lead\" the human race to it's greatest evolution stage. After escaping Kinderheim 511, Johan Liebert was saved by Dr. Tenma and as a result, Johan Liebert thanks Dr. Tenma and thinks of Dr. Tenma as a father and hero that Johan Liebert never had. Johan Liebert enduring all those hardships, suffering and torturing he received as a kid truly changed his thoughts and feelings about society, and the world we live in, in general. Johan Liebert seemed like he had no emotion, and he killed people one by one ruthlessly. But were those people deserving of living? Are they the bad guys that Johan Liebert killed or are they the innocent and Johan Liebert just the psychopathic murderer? Johan Liebert is the most tragic character in anime history (in my opinion). He was never meant to be born, and when he was born all he went through was suffering and until the very end he never had an identity. The entire plot was designed to make the viewer decide for himself/herself whether or not Johan Liebert even existed in reality never mind be the monster in Monster. Johan Liebert never had a true identity, in fact Johan Liebert isn't even his real name and his name is never revealed throughout the entire story. Johan Liebert watched over the world as though he was not a part of it. As if he did not belong in the world. Johan Liebert keeps stating that he's seen the \"end\" over and over again but he constantly asks Anna, \"What is the end?\" And in the end of the story Johan's own new vision of the end was perhaps _________ (I won't spoil anything actually). But throughout the entire story, think... Is Johan Liebert real? Is he actually the Monster?\n\"There’s nothing special about being born. Not a thing. Most of the universe is just death, nothing more. In this universe of ours, the birth of a new life on some corner of our planet is nothing but a tiny, insignificant flash. Death is a normal thing. So why live?\"\n- Johan Liebert\nArt: 9/10 - Monster's art is VERY old-fashioned, it's art is blurry and faded. But then why did I give it a 9/10? Because the classic, old art adds onto the realism of the anime. Unlike most anime, you can actually tell ethnics apart from eachother, American/German/Japanese characters! Monster is such a realistic story (and realitsically drawn up) that it blows my mind that it was an anime, they should make it into a TV series with real people too!!  The \"light\" and \"shadows\" used in the anime were shining/dimmed so magnificently that every time I watched the show I couldn't help but think of symbolical means. Like all other masterpieces, Monster adds on to the graphics with color symbolism. A blue eyeball watching stories unfold, as Dr. Tenma holds his gun out to shoot something (hmmmm think).\nSound: 9/10 - Lots of mysterious, breath-taking, frightening pieces of music in this anime. Really adds onto the suspension and darkness of the anime. The opening \"Grain\" was very similar to Low of Solipsism of Death Note, both fitting perfectly into their anime respectively. The endings of Monster fitting in perfectly with the ominous feeling the anime gives off after each episode. The voicing of the cast, fitting in very realistically, there's no girl with a guy's voice, no German with a Chinese accent, and Johan Liebert's voice was just perfect for his role (as in creepy and scary!)\nFurthermore the gun shot sound, the sound of agony, the sound of crying, the sound of crows chirping, perhaps the \"sound of death\"... The anime executes very well, just watch the anime and you'll see for yourself.\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - I luxuriated in this anime. Enough said. Watch it now.\nSymbolism: \n- Logo of Monster: Note that the ‘t’ is replaced with a sword. The sword (a symbol of justice through bloodshed) can kill the \"Monster\".\n- Scenery of a Doomsday: Johan Liebert repetitively says “I’ve seen the end over and over again”, but then contradicts himself when he asked Anna “The End.  What is the End?”.  Then the end... I won't spoil.\n- The shattered glass with Tenma’s reflection on it: This is Tenma’s unbelief in a thing such as perfect evil.  There is no affective/emotional component present on every murder Johan does, but in one supposedly related middle aged couple murder case however, the true perpetrator leaves a mark of existence—the regret of having to take a life when a person can see himself doing the heinous act.\n- Blood spatters with Anna, Dieter, Eva and Lunge relief - Murder does not stop with taking a life, it starts a chain of events that leads to \"interconnectedness\"  of human lives. Lives are forever changed when a person dies.\n- The staircase at Three Frogs: Stairs are symbolic of ascent and descent, often times from one to another.  We know Anna and Johan remember the Three Frogs stairs very well, because one of them was dragged down there crying.  Therefore, the stairs should mean descent from innocence to knowing the horrors of living in this world.  At the same time, it could also mean ascent from the chasms of doom to salvation through love and forgiveness (End). \nNo this anime is not only for elitist... If you haven't watched this anime, give it a try. It's definitely worth watching. \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster sets a masterful benchmark for storytelling, character writing, and atmosphere in the medium. A few minor flaws aside, the series is a captivating ride for those who are willing to devote the more than 24 hours to see the drama fully to completion.\nStory: 10\n+ well-written, gripping\n+ thoughtful themes\n- plot can become labyrinthine, particularly during the latter quarter of the series\n- the finale is slightly anticlimatic and relatively weak compared to the rest of the story\nLong, non episodic series such as Monster risk dragging out, becoming exercises in drudgery as one plods to the finish. That this does not happen in the 74 episodes of\n          \n        Monster is a testament to the thrilling and tightly-written story. Monster does not waste your 24 minutes with needless recap episodes or vignettes-every scene is shown to drive the story forward. Long series with complex plots also run the risk of creating a Gordian knot that wreaks havoc with the pacing and logic of the story. Monster avoids this pitfall by tightly structuring the story as both a mystery and a pursuit thriller, unveiling new plot points and twists at appropriate times to keep the story gripping. That story is grounded in a real, believable setting, with obvious attention to detail done by the writer into research to create a realistic world. This makes the story even more effective-there are no supernatural elements to play deus ex machina-everything is completely human, and thus ever more chilling.\nAt certain points however, (such as the unraveling of the origin of the main characters) the plot points become a bit too tangled, and require a bit of extra mental effort to straighten out, a problem that might be exacerbated if one watches Monster in smaller segments over a long period of time (and thus forgetting plot points) rather than in large chunks (and can retain facts in memory). On balance though, this is a relatively minor quibble.\nThe weakest part of the story, if one is to be found, is in the ending. I found to be comparatively weak and anticlimactic, particularly given the build-up. However, it is still well-written and does not ruin the finished product.  \nMonster's themes are dark, disturbing, and thought-provoking. At the core of the story is the battle against the \"monster\" inside of humanity- both in the form of the protagonist's battle against the titular \"monster\" as well as his own battle to prevent himself from falling into that same monstrous path. Weaving into this are the equally important themes of the value of life (are all lives created equal? Can a doctor take as well as give life?) and identity, both internally and externally construed. These themes are explored through the protagonist's choices and the histories of physical and sexual abuse, mental reconditioning, racism, and totalitarian brutality uncovered as Monster progresses. Those who are familiar with Judeo-Christian imagery will also find familiar themes of the Devil and of doomsday- references to Saint George and his battle with the Dragon, of the beast with seven heads, and demons are peppered throughout.\nArt: 8\n+appropriate realistic style\n+distinguishable main characters\n+fantastic backgrounds\n+tone of scenes masterfully done\n- tertiary character designs sometimes feel recycled \nAs befitting the serious story and it's realistic setting, the art is realistic, helping to really ground the series as something that very well could have happened in our world. The towns cities and countryside are fantastically done and evoke a real sense of character-at least one scene gave me an overwhelming sense of looking at an animated version of the travel show Rick Steve's Europe.\nOverall character designs complement this realism, including stubble and age lines.Significant characters' designs-particularly faces- are done very well, creating just enough individuality to be easily distinguishable without resorting to exaggeration. They also match the character's behavior and personalities extremely well. However, tertiary characters (those whose importance are just under the supporting cast but above background characters) occasionally feel recycled, and there were two notable instances where the designs were so similar as to cause me confusion.\nThe overall tone of Monster is dark, and the series has many scenes which rely on the animation and score to appropriately set that tone up. This is done masterfully, especially in the way the shadows on character's faces during close ups convey a sinister feeling. The use of weather and the landscape is also done very well.\nParticularly worthy of note is the use of children's picture books as a key plot and thematic element. The atmosphere of those books when they are being \"read\" to the viewer encapsulates the sense of foreboding darkness of the series perfectly.\nSound:9\n+ Superb voice-acting on the English dub, especially that of the main antagonist\n+OP and ED are perfect for the tone and theme of the series\n+OP song absolutely perfect\n- certain moments where the happy score seemed out-of-place\nPlease take note that this a review of the English dub of Monster.\nThe voice acting in the English dub is superb, and do nearly as good a job of establishing characters as their visual design. In the case of the main antagonist Johan, I would argue the voice acting makes the character, much in the way Sir Anthony Hopkins' tone of voice and speech patterns made the Hannibal Lecter character in Silence of the Lambs. Aside from the bit parts of some throwaway background characters, none of the characters are over or under-acted. \nThe \"soundtrack\" so to speak of is all orchestral. I did not find myself noticing the score, and in fact, I would sum it up pithily as \"appropriate but unremarkable\". However, Monster is more than sufficiently gripping even without memorable scoring. The only detraction I would make is that the more \"uplifting\" orchestral scores threw overall tone off.\nWhat really earns high marks in sound for Monster are its bookends. The OP sequence very aptly highlights the isolation of the protagonist, darkness pervading the series, and the sinister shadow of the antagonist. This is perfected with the actual OP theme, \"Grain,\" which is without doubt the most appropriate of any anime series I've seen. Completely lyric-less, the theme opens and closes with haunting choral vocalizations (evoking Christian church services and thus priming the viewer for the \"devil\" theme running prominently through Monster) interspersed with echoing drums, guitars and vocalizations further evoking the open space within a Church. The overall effect is haunting, and for lack of a better word, perfect.\nMonster's ED sequence shines more for its visuals than the ending theme, \"For the Love of Life.\" It consists simply of the song played over rolling credits and images taken from children's storybooks, the significance of which becomes clear nearly halfway through the series. However, the two put together, even without knowledge of the significance is enough to convey a sense of wistfulness, sorrow, and isolation-again aptly conveying the protagonist's feelings.\nCharacter: 10\n+large cast of believable, realistic, multi-dimensional characters\n+realistic, sympathetic character development\n+excellent foils to the main character and main antagonist\n+excellent main protagonist and antagonist\n-a few too many non-essential or redundant supporting characters\n-tidiness of some characters' connections tests credulity\nWhat really makes Monster a truly notable work, more so than the story, is its characters.\nMonster shines in its consistent portrayal of believable, sympathetic, and fleshed out characters, all the more impressive given its large cast. Barring one offending character in the form of Otto the comedic relief, nearly all characters of at least secondary importance are given some degree of fleshing out. There are very few instances of one-dimensional archetypes, with Otto the thief being of particular note because of his overtly comedic character (very inappropriate given the overall tone of the series) and complete lack of character development.\nWhile the primary protagonist and antagonists take top billing, their main foils are also stars of the show. Several characters share parallels with either of the two, and they play upon each other magnificently. Of particular note is Anna Liebert, who in addition to being a main in her own right, also serves as a foil to contrast against the main protagonist in their pursuit of the same goal, and Inspector Lunge, who like Javert from Les Miserables is a fearsome and tireless automaton whose own pursuit of the protagonist is a thrilling chase. \nThe enigmatic namesake \"monster\" of the series, Johan can be described as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Damien (the titular Antichrist from the film series of the same name). He is charming, intelligent, and beautifully handsome, while being manipulative, sociopathic, and on multiple occasions is referred to as \"the devil.\" However, while the character description may seem derivative on paper at first glance, by the end of the series, the character's portrayal establishes Johan as a distinct and terrifying in his own right, and whose actions are so convincingly sinister-so chilling-that his soft, level voice is enough to make you fear him as much as his victims do. \nGiven the wonderful writing of these other characters, I found the main protagonist Dr. Kenzo Tenma surprisingly comparatively unremarkable. Of course he is very well written, completely believable, and an excellent vessel for the show's themes. As his obsession with righting his and Johan's wrongs grows, I found his character to become more and more flat, defined only through a singular task. This might be intentional however, as a way of showing how the pursuit is hollowing out Dr. Tenma and stripping him of his past and his own identity- major themes of the series. But on balance, his character's plot description of \"will he or will he not (be caught, succeed, etc)\" is just less compelling than unraveling the mystery of Johan or of other characters. \nWhere Monster does fall short in characters are in the tertiary and supporting  roster of characters, of which there some who serve arguably unnecessary or redundant roles that can be filled by existent characters, particularly among the antagonists. One quibble i did have is the tidiness with which some of the secondary characters are connected to the main cast-a few too many of the characters happen to have histories or backgrounds that tie them directly into the history behind the mystery of Johan, even when they are introduced through simple coincidence and serendipity. However, these are easily forgivable quibbles, and don't dent the overall exceptional character writing.\nEnjoyment:9\nI personally place a great deal of weight on the atmosphere of an anime series, particularly for more thematically complex ones such as Monster. Monster's atmosphere is at its best dark, chilling, sinister, and at times even unforgiving. Given the prevalence of an overall dark, gloomy feel to the series, the few points of actual happiness in the series feel particularly jarring and even inappropriate. I don't know if this is a deliberate choice to emphasize the dichotomy between the darkness and the light, but I personally found that it tended to detract from the overall feel and consistency of tone that I would have liked.\nThat being said, Monster is still a masterpiece of story and character writing, and is absolutely worth watching. Its length and slower, methodical pacing may be uncommon, and require more from it's audience, but before you realize it, you become hooked to a compelling drama that looks unflinchingly at the monster inside humanity.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Though a very lengthy anime by my standards, Monster has managed to become one of the few that have left a real, lasting impression. The events that unfold are often brutal and shocking, depicting the extremes of human depravity, yet are simultaneously balanced by a recognition of the potential for humanity to courageously acknowledge fault and act accordingly, more often than not for the benefit of others. It is this fundamental ambiguity that makes Monster seem real, as the narrative successfully utilises all 74 episodes to demonstrate its eerie applicability to the real world.  \nSTORY - 9.5/10 (10/10 here) \nThis is definitely one of\n          \n        Monster's many strong points. The explored themes, which include the value of life, human conditioning, and fundamentally, the complex nature of morality, are credibly developed in a manner that is engaging, compelling and deeply confronting. The pacing is exceptional, and the use of flashbacks and atmospheric tension is incredibly effective, propelling the narrative forward while constantly keeping me on the edge of my seat. Initially competing story lines are eventually shown to be interconnected, and virtually everything depicted contributed to the overarching narrative to some capacity. The only real issue I had with the story is that, while relevant, some sections felt prolonged to the point where they almost felt like 'filler'. Overall, exceptional story line \nCHARACTER - 10/10 (Also 10/10 here) \nAnother one of Monster's strong points is definitely to be found within its diverse range of characters. Many of the characters are crippled by fatal yet scarily familiar flaws, ultimately enhancing their credibility. This allowed me to quickly become invested in the fates of many of the characters, perpetually concerned and aware of the fact that every action taken may result in unforeseen and potentially fatal consequences. Furthermore, character development is excellent and, in the case of some characters, is well integrated as a central aspect of the overarching narrative. By extension, the portrayal of moral ambiguity through character was very well-executed. Overall, it is clear that Monster doesn't generally try to make you 'like' the characters. Instead, it strives to make you 'understand' the characters, and it manages to pull off this effect exceptionally well \nART - 8/10 (8/10 here, but I would normally score art/sound together)\nSince Monster isn't a particularly recent anime, I tried to be a bit more lenient in grading the animation quality. Overall, the art was to a more than acceptable quality, though not much of it really stands out and the ED, though appropriate, was a bit simplistic\nSOUND - 8/10 \nOverall, music was used appropriately in many situations as part of the OST, while the OP and ED themes nailed the 'eerie-ness effect' rather well. However, as with the Art, the sound here struggles to make itself stand out. Moreover, while it was a nice touch hearing the motifs in the OP/ED playing throughout the episodes as part of the soundtrack (or bar/restaurant music!), the associated lack of original OST's was slightly concerning. Finally, voice acting was mostly good, and I can confidently say this is the only anime I've watched so far (haven't exactly watched many though!) where I preferred the dubbed version to the subbed version, for reasons I would struggle to articulate. \nENJOYMENT - 9/10 (Wouldn't normally score enjoyment separately)\nIt would be remiss of me to say that Monster was a completely enjoyable experience. It isn't, nor does it aim to be. However, to say that I didn't enjoy it would be equally unfair, as watching it was a deeply compelling and engaging experience. \nAs a whole, watching Monster provided for an exceptional personal viewing experience. Though I'd most recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers, I believe that virtually anyone can enjoy the series simply because of the uniquely encompassing nature of the narrative\nOVERALL: 9/10 \n*Notes - Not intended to reflect the entirety of my thoughts. This is more like an abridged, formal version of the reviews I normally write for myself\n        "},

Years later, Johan’s reappearance in front of Tenma reveals him to be a callous murderer which sparks Tenma’s own journey to discover Johan’s true identity and right the wrong of saving him years ago.\n[Characters]:\nIt should immediately speak to the strength of Monster’s many attributes that it is hard to say which one of them is truly the most beneficial or compelling given how powerful each of the show’s components are. The cast of the show is terrific and expansive and while the main group of characters is highly engaging, the supporting cast is captivating in its own right. The show hits upon a means of instantly humanizing certain characters, often through their relationships with others and this leads to majority of the cast feeling overwhelmingly familiar and understandable.\nThough at times Tenma fades in and out of the story in favor of exploring the current events from other perspectives and gaining insight elsewhere in the world, he is doubtlessly the protagonist and an important person to highlight. He is well characterized from the beginning – more than simply a meek doctor under the thumb of the hospital director, he is frustrated and conflicted, concerned and at a times full of regret. One can clearly see why he behaves the way he does and his sense of morality both influences his character heavily as well as the themes of the show. His development is as subtle as it is substantial and over the course of 74 episodes he is tasked with continuously reevaluating what he believes in and what he must do to continue moving forward.\nGiven the nature of the story, the other character of greatest import to elaborate upon is Johan, though the main cast of characters features highly compelling and interesting characters across the board. The titular ‘Monster’ of the series, he is certainly characterized as such though it is not purely his mercilessness and cold intelligence that sets him up as such but rather also his charisma and frightening ability to bring out the worst in people and manipulate them to his will. Johan is treated much like a horror monster, rarely seen but effectively ever-present though sometimes far away with many layers between him and the events transpiring. Though he himself is only intermittently seen, he is utterly core to the narrative and learning about his past – what drives him and what made him the way he is, is the focus of much of the show. His relationship with Tenma is endlessly engaging and through each horrific action and tragedy he seems to ask of Tenma whether or not he still believes that all human lives are truly equal.\nThough characters such as Anna and Lunge are wonderfully complex and fascinating, the supporting cast deserves special attention here. Monster employs an immense number of people to tell its story, many of whom are surprisingly deep and memorable. A news reporter is more than simply an exasperated man with deadlines – he has a wife that left him and he wants to get back together but can’t figure out how. The gun instructor is more than a gruff, military man – he raises a daughter whose mother he killed in Myanmar during the war. Everybody is interconnected though it rarely if ever feels overly coincidental. Johan’s presence has warped these people together for better or worse and watching how they interact is like observing the ominous wake of a monster as it passes. Though the cast exhibits a myriad of personalities, a propensity for development, and a complicated parallelism that binds them together, it is the way their experiences and the events that transpire inform their identities that is the true masterwork of the show.\n[Art/Animation]:\nFollowing the character discussion, it is pertinent to highlight the many varying character designs featured. Not only are the designs distinct and set apart each member of the massive cast from one another but their variety in facial structure, body-type, and mannerisms complicate the cast on a visual level immensely. Characters aside, the show goes a long way in establishing the atmosphere of each scene and a great deal of Monster’s intensity and anxiety can be attributed to it’s darker and more brooding tones. The countless environments and townscapes are beautiful and distinct as the story travels to each location.\n[Story]:\nJust as Monster’s characters are endlessly compelling and interesting to watch, so too is its narrative which exhibits numerous strengths and relatively no weaknesses. The first episode is quite gripping – it begins with the introduction of Dr. Tenma and his position within the hospital and one gets an immediate sense of it’s hierarchical nature and the politics at play as well as the source of his frustration and conflicted feelings. The subject matter of the first episode ties very well into the theme it introduces – the equality or inequality of human lives and it ends on a cliffhanger involving the murder of Johan’s adoptive parents. The second episode doubles down on the thematic ideas expressed in the first and its events really draw the viewer into a haunting and unfair world. The first several episodes serve as a great hook into the series yet can hardly anticipate the epic and sprawling story to follow.\nOf all of Monster’s qualities it is perhaps its pacing that will be what challenges most viewers. The story moves at a very methodical and deliberate pace and while the subject matter of each episode is usually quite thrilling it has a tendency to hint and prod at many realizations and future scenes rather than rushing into them quickly and this slower pace may detract from the show for some viewers. There are no real filler episodes and effectively everything that happens has a place within the overarching narrative. After the show gets rolling, it does pan away from Tenma for periods at a time to investigate and develop other characters and plots which are equally if not more interesting. The latter half of the show is, if possible, even more exciting and the revelations roll in one after another in a way that makes Monster very hard to put down.\nThe story is positively fascinating but it would not share in the success it does without its pervasive and intelligent use of themes to tie everything together. The list of themes is extensive and includes such ideas as the equality of human life, the implication of names and identities, amnesia and memories, good and evil, and whether or not the titular ‘Monsters’ exist. These themes form an ongoing dialogue with the events of the show and its characters and enliven each development hugely. The interconnected nature of the cast and the parallelism shared between them is further complicated by these overarching ideas which make Monster both assertive and engrossing.\nThe last thing to touch upon is the show’s use of allegory which, in juxtaposition to its themes as well as the backstories of its characters, provides uniquely thrilling and mysterious insight into its cast. Through the presence of picture books and certain repeated phrases and stories, Monster continuously creates intelligent, narrative implications and foreshadows future events which are a major factor in the overall strength of the show. Monster exhibited some of the most pertinent and well organized allegory I have seen.\n[Music]:\nThough Monster’s visuals were electrifying and gripping, the presentation wouldn’t have been nearly as strong had they not been set against such a strong soundtrack. The music was wonderfully dramatic and very tonally focused, sometimes slow and brooding but at other times swelling to a climax alongside the visuals and subject matter. As a whole the sound design was excellent and on top of the soundtrack, the use of certain techniques like a progressively faster beating heartbeat and the downpour of rain slowly becoming deafening as the scene builds added an unexpected grandeur to the scenes. The creak of a door, the sound of scuffling footsteps, and the like were very atmospheric elements and when combined with the music were integral to the success of Monster’s presentation.\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \nMonster represents a show that was engaging and gripping on all levels and the intelligence of its design shone through in each scene and development. Though the initially slower episodes that followed the story’s lengthy introduction unfolded rather leisurely, the majority of the show and particularly its latter half were incredibly captivating and increasingly hard to put down.\nRating: 10\nI gave Monster a 10 because it was intelligent, insightful, provocative, complicated, and a myriad other things that augmented its tenacious story and brilliant characters. The way in which people were shaped by their experiences, the thematic implications layered across scenes and events, the atmospheric presentation, the compelling supporting cast of characters, and the inventive use of allegory all coalesced to make for an incredibly captivating show.\n[Recommendations]:\nMonster occupies a variety of different genres and features some of the best content of each. Those looking for a fantastic, psychological drama will be thrilled with the manner in which the show operates. The mystery and horror elements are executed to perfection as well and will likely keep fans of those genres captivated practically all throughout. The only concern I would voice is that the length of the show and its pacing require some patience from the viewer and on a case by case basis the show may be too long-winded for some people.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    We all know \"those\" anime fans, right? The ones who are so consumed with maintaining an aura of posh cognizance that they refuse to actually enjoy anime that are entertaining? The ones that get off by watching Evangelion reruns? Well, Monster has long been a critic's sweetheart of an anime, one that, to me at least, had a vibe strangely homologous to those anime that are supposedly chock-full of symbolism and that are constantly overrated by the \"intellectuals\" of the community.\nAnd I am here to say that Monster, unlike many critical reverences, actually deserves all of its intense hype.\nMonster is a morbid tale rooted in\n          \n        a reality that is all too grim and frighteningly realistic. The terrors seen in this world do not revolve around supervillains or magic. What begins as a series about a bright, upstart neurosurgeon with a seemingly impeccable life quickly resolves into a chilling narrative regarding the origin of evil, the value of human life, human experimentation, the morality of revenge, the possibility of redemption, the existence of true evil, and whether or not death is deserving for anyone. Yeah, a lot of heavy stuff, so I don't recommend Monster if you're planning to watch it halfheartedly.\nBut now, let's begin the actual review.\nSTORY:\nThe first thing of note is how complex the story of Monster really is. There is a multitude of layers to the narrative, and no layer is straightforward, but actually rather twisted and veering into many directions based on the motives and actions of the character roster. This is partially why the story has 74 episodes; typically only unnecessarily long Shonen anime are that lengthy, but here we are. Do not fear, though: the intricacy of the fiction is vastly entertaining and well-written.\nUrasawa is a master of playing with the emotions of the audience to create immense sadness, unabashed terror, joyous happiness, and everything in between. And so, being a dark anime, one of the most enticing aspects of the anime is the almost Hitchcock-esque level of suspense created by the writing staff. Despite the nasty habit of switching to the outside of a building right as a gunshot is fired only to come back and find that nothing important happened, Urasawa carefully crafts a creeping fear that sneaks up on the audience. Something that aids in this tremendously is the fact that there is just enough substance to back up these moments of suspense, but many times it is a red herring of sorts. It constantly keeps you guessing and entertained to see what happens next.\nOf course, the story isn't without its flaws. Despite its rather well-formed plot and lack of plot holes, there are a LOT of plot coincidences, and while they don't drive the story, they do compensate as lazy writing in order to connect all of the different clues and story points because there are just so damn many of them. Characters also sometimes display some... questionable logic (you're on the run, so it might be best to change your appearance/name), but overall the issues do not come close to overriding the brilliance in the narration.\nThe pacing of Monster is best described as a gradual (VERY gradual) blaze that eventually engulfs the audience as the story comes to a close. By no means is the slowness a negative, however; it allows the suspense to properly build while granting time for character and plot development at a high rate. As a disclaimer of sorts, if you have a short attention span, then this might be an adverse thing for you.\nTo close out the plot analysis, I want to talk about the very thing that I claimed pretentious cavaliers of anime fans loved the most: good old symbolism and themes! Well, as stated earlier in the review, Monster has a plethora of thematic statements (essentially the reasoning behind the story in the first place for those who are unfamiliar), and the majority of them are executed very well. I wasn't quite fond of one of them for nearly the entire story, but at the end I had an epiphany and I'd be happy to discuss further details by some other means, but a review is not the time or place for such a discussion as I have to keep this spoiler-free.\nCHARACTERS:\nIn my humble opinion, Monster's most exceptional trait lies in the quality of its characters. \nBecause of the ample catalogue of characters, it would be quite simple to imagine that Urasawa, much like Tite Kubo of Bleach, would simply forget about some of them and thus make their importance to the overarching tale meaningless. However, that does not happen. Every character has a distinct role, and these roles both aid in the development/characterization of other characters as well as the deepness of the plot, and the end result is marvelous. \nJohan Liebert is candidly my favorite character in any form of entertainment ever. EVER. I could go  on for hours analyzing his characterization but, again, this is not the time or place. Kenzo Tenma, Heinrich Lunge, Nina Fortner, Wolfgang Grimmer, and the rest of the cast are distinctly behind him in my opinion (even putting my fanboy bias aside), but they are all written quite well and their interactions as a whole are impressive in their own right. \nThe minor characters are also something to be revered as they all have audible traits and flaws, many of which bring light to the fact that this world is very real and these characters could exist in our own world. Almost every character's inner motivations/demons/ideals and connectedness with others are something of admiration to be sure.\nBut the fact remains that great characters can only be great if the author knows how to treat them. Luckily for you all, Urasawa (for the most part) is phenomenal at giving his characters roles that fit their personalities and that fully take advantage of the characterizations he created. ESPECIALLY for the main villain, but elaborating further might create unnecessary spoilers. \nThe only thing that I don't particularly care for is that one of the characters is a Gary Stu. Now, there are reasons in the narrative behind this, but it is a bit off-putting. \nANIMATION:\nDespite the fact that this anime is over ten years old, the quality of the animation is surprisingly high. The characters in particular are all uniquely designed and look wonderful; they fit their nationalities, age, and more and they all have distinct differences. Urasawa put much care into his designs. The way they react to situations, whether it be in happiness, sadness, fear, shock, etc all are reflected in gorgeous artwork.\nThe backgrounds deserve praise as well because they look absolutely magnificent. It is clear that this world has been designed with meticulous care and it really pays off in the end product.\nSOUND:\nThe opening is a bit boring after a while (and it never changes), but it fits the tone of the story very well, and the ending (especially the full version) is quite eerie and is actually incredibly symbolic, which I thought was a nice touch. The soundtrack is somewhat small, but the vast majority of the songs are well-made and add to the \"feel\" and quality of the story. It is a very powerful score, particularly in tense moments and scenes of raw emotion.\nThe dub (which I watched) is one of the best that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. In particular Heinrich Lunge, Johan Liebert, Kenzo Tenma, and Eva Heinemann are all played beautifully, and the dialogue is very well-acted. \nOVERALL:\nMonster is truly an oddity in anime, one that consistently lives up to the haughty expectations set by the critical populace. While it isn't perfect, I would not argue with anyone claiming that it is truly the magnum opus of Japanese animation. \nMonster is my favorite anime of all time, and I recommend it to anyone. "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Monster is listed as a psychological anime, but it's more akin to a very well-written adventure show. It's not really much of an anime either. It's just a story. There's no kawaii characters or fan service or deus ex machina or exaggerated intense scenes where the characters are facing away from each other or a ton of exposition, there are no exaggerated \"genius\" characters but all of the main characters are very smart, there's no ecchi, there's no boob humor, or any of the things you'd usually expect in an anime, for better or for worse. There's not even a love interest until the very\n          \n        end. The love-factor is probably the best illustration of how Monster is not really like an anime at all but more like a western show, where relationships only begin after a very long period of time, when the character's missions are completed. There's no love at first sight. And like western shows, it doesn't tell you what happens after the happily ever after.\nWhere Monster really excels is putting you in the shoes of Dr. Tenma, a fugitive trying to correct a past mistake and reconcile his own conflicted ideologies on human worth. It's all very philosophical. Anyways, like I said, it's really good at putting you in Dr. Tenma's shoes. Throughout the entire adventure you get a very clear picture of what Tenma thinks and feels, and how the people around him affect him, and alternatively, how he affects others. There is a sense of urgency that he brings to the show, as well as a very respectable sense of right and wrong. Tenma's only real flaw is that he's too much of a goody two-shoes. Despite his resolution to kill the few to save the many, time and time again, he loses sight of his primary goal for the sake of those around him. But one of the driving forces behind the show is the fact that Tenma is such a goody goody. And in that sense there's an element of descent into darkness to this show that really pulls the viewers in. And for that matter, this is a show that knows how to end an episode with a cliff hanger.\nAs for the other characters, Monster strays away from anime convention yet again - opting for a small but detailed cast rather than a large ensemble of superficial archetypes. You can tell that the writer really put a lot of love into his characters. From Grimmer to Tenma to Anna to Johann to the Inspector to Tenma's ex - all 5 of these main characters are very unique and develop throughout the story into even more complex people. Oh, and since I mentioned it earlier, there's another thing I wanted to address about the characters. There technically is a genius character - the main antagonist. But if you watch closely, the thing that draws evildoers to him isn't that he's a genius, but that he's so evil, essentially. This story takes place in Germany. After the fall of Hitler's regime. And what this evil genius character does for the sum of the antagonists is essentially fill the gap that Hitler left. And as for his genius. He is definitely a very smart character, but he's merely just a guy who learned from his past, not someone like L or Light who comes up with random ideas to attack each other. That's why I said there isn't an exaggerated genius. As a writer, I can tell you that Death Note was written backwards. The writer began with what ending he wanted and what type of psychological battles would take place, then worked backwards to create the rules of the Death Note. And moving chronologically, it makes the writer look like a genius when really the ends created the means (make sense?). But Monster is a story that is written forwards. That's why you have this very smart, but tedious adventure. The author of Monster is the real genius.\nThe pacing of the show is extremely slow. It doesn't run in circles like a sitcom, but what I mean is that it basically goes back to what I was talking about earlier - it puts you in Dr. Tenma shoes. Tenma spends several years of his life trying to accomplish his goal. And watching Monster can be just as tedious at times, but never unnecessary. Tracking someone down is tedious work, and to portray it as something else would not be true to the story. And like I already said, there are no deus ex machinas. There's no random special ability or traveling angel who comes into to save you when you're in trouble. Everything that happens in this story makes perfect sense. The plot in general is very logical.\nStory: 10\nCharacters: 10\nAnimation: 6\nMusic: 7\nEnjoyability: 8\nOverall: 8.2\nThis is not a show for any random 12 year old looking for just another anime to watch. This is a show for smart young adults who love thrillers and detective shows. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    When i started Monster i dident have any high hopes. I first heard that if you liked Death Note you love monster. now i enjoyed death note a loot so i picked up Monster. I started by reading a few mangas volumes. But it was to much talking so i moved to the anime instead. Now that i`m finished with it i can say that i have a hard time breathing. \nStory: \nThe story focuses on Kenzo Tenma a young Japanese doctor working at the Eisler Memorial Hospital in D&uuml;sseldorf during the 80s. He is a very skilled highly brain surgeon.However, Tenma grows increasingly dissatisfied\n          \n        with the political bias of the hospital for treating patients, and seizes his chance to change things after a strange massacre brings the twins Johan and Anna Liebert into his hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to the head and Anna keeps muttering about killing, and Tenma decides to operate on Johan instead of a prominent politician who arrived afterwards. Johan is saved, but the politician dies. After this Kenzo loses hes social standing. He lost his promotion, further fianc&eacute;e and not soon after that the twins escape. The tree top heads of the hospital are found dead the same night the twins escape. Tenma is then promoted to chef of surgeon. After that the story advances to nine years later.A known criminal is found on the street, hit by a car. He comes under the care of Dr. Tenma, who observes him muttering about a 'Monster'. Tenma extends kindness to that criminal, and thus the criminal begins to open up for Tenma. \nFollowing his trail to the construction site of a half finished building near the hospital, he finds the man. The man, who has developed a sort of doctor-patient friendship with Dr. Tenma, warns him against coming closer, and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, however, and the identity of the man holding the gun pointed at the criminal in the abandoned parking garage is revealed to be the boy whose life Tenma had saved nine years ago - Johan Liebert. Johan shoots the criminal, tells Tenma that he could never kill the man who had saved his life, and then walks off into the night while Tenma is still too shocked to stop him. Im not going to say anything more due too the story is so good damn awesome\nAnimation: I had some problems with the animations. Yes everything looks nice and all but i felt that there was some problems with the light and shadows at some places \nSound: The soundtrack is on the same level as Schindler`s List fore me. It has the right tone fore the right moment that makes the hair in your neck raise. My favorite is the opening that just sounds beautifully. \nCharacter: After the story the character are the best part of this anime. They all seems so human. Like Ikari in Neon Genesis Evangelion. We got Kenzo the doctor who`s must fix hes past mistake. Runge( Lunge in english) is a BKA( German FBI) agent who&acute;s scary with his hand yet very interesting. Johan is the most interesting yet evil character i ever seen in anything. This is not a joke if you want evil here you got it. The perfect villain he has the looks, evil and intelligence. (there are more character but belive me you keep watching the show fore just these 3) \nEnjoyment: Some people might not enjoy this anime. If you want a dark story set in a realistic world with no supernatural what so ever you will enjoy this too 100% . If you dont want what i just mention see it anyway. This is a anime that you just have to see. i fell sorry fore people who wont watch this anime and the 4 last explosive episodes.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    You never really know what you expect from an anime you've never seen. Especially if you've never heard of it, went for it on a whim, or where bored out of your mind at the time. Monster blew away all my previous expectations of what an anime was like, and what an anime should be like. Let it be known that this isn't your usual anime shtick with robots, maids and the ilk as this is a disturbing look of how men can be transformed into monsters.\nThe term 'monster' originates from the ancient Latin monstrum, meaning 'omen' from the root monere 'to warn'. A person\n          \n        referred to as a monster can be seen as evil, sadistic, unusually cruel, a biological sport (in a very strong sense of the word), unwaveringly strict or psychologically ugly. In this anime, all of this is shown within the main villain/victim. The character development is first-rate, the music suits the mood and the plot is dynamite, shocking the avid watcher acts of surreal cruelty. The anime sheds light on what made the villain a monster, and follows Dr Tenma's attempts to track him down, and the surrounding circumstances of people involved in the story as well.\nI'm not one to name characters in my reviews or whatever, because I may place a spoiler in here. Just take my word for it, as this is truly one of the most essential animes that has ever been created. It is well worth your time.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Simply amazing. I'm very much compelled to just advise you to immediately open up a new tab and start watching this anime, but something this good demands thorough praise.\nSTORY: Original, thought-provoking without huge philosophical pretensions, complex without being misleading, excellently executed. The morality of everything that occurs is left to the viewer's discretion. It is extremely tight and well-wrought, with not a single plot hole that I can think of. And, more importantly, everything makes sense. I must also commend the ending - a lot of anime ends on an ambiguous, too-open-ended (sequel cash cow), ultimately disappointing note. Monster ties up its loose ends, and\n          \n        you are given a proper sense of closure.\nCHARACTERS: The characterization in this anime is fantastic. There is an extensive cast, so it is only natural that some characters are going to be more developed than others, but not one person feels one-dimensional, no matter how small the role.\nI've read some reviews that describe the protagonist as too good to be true, but all his actions are consistent with his personality. Moreover, his tendency to do good even at his own expense is not romanticized by any means. In any case, he makes for one of the best, most interesting, and most well-rounded leads I have seen - not just in anime, but in any medium.\nART: 10000/10. Detailed, realistic, proportional, no chibi whatsoever. People *gasp* look very different from one another. The characters are wonderfully expressive, the scenery is NEVER a group of hazy, lazy lines, and it all wraps up into something very aesthetically pleasing.\nLENGTH/PACING: 74 episodes might seem intimidating, especially if you have a busy schedule, but it's actually very easy to squeeze into a week or so. The pace changes often, but it is done reasonably and seamlessly so that there is no disjointedness felt.\nFANSERVICE: Discounting Tenma's propensity to communicate in sighs and grunts, which can be very sexy in its own way, there is no gratuity here. Even the violence is minimized, leaving the more gruesome scenes to the imagination.\nPRODUCT PLACEMENT: Doctors Without Borders. The mangaka must be a saint.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster anime.. Some says it is overrated, some says it is overhyped, but I don't give a damn.\n==WARNING; POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD==\nThis anime is strong, maybe the best atmosphere in any pyschological anime/movie I've ever watched. Call me funny, but everytime Johann monologue or dialouge appears, it gives me the cold and thrilling feels. Yes, for me, it's that good.\nStory 9/10\nI didn't give the story 10 points because I think the weakest point is on the ending. Maybe some of you think that the ending is very genius, but trust me, it isn't. Or maybe I've put my expectations too high (Comparing to HBO serials like\n          \n        Breaking Bad, or hollywood movies that are highly rated because of it's ending). But else than that, it's really amazing. I told all of my friends that this is an \"HBO series in Anime\". The story is slow paced, which I really like, it develop the Kenzo Tenma characters and others (Johann, Anna, Lunge) even wider. It will never stop to amaze you, at least before the last episode of this series.\nP.S. : Guillermo del Toro, which is known as a director of HBO has submitted the live action HBO series based on Naoki Urasawa's Monster. Yes, it is that good.\nArt 9/10\nThe art is really outstanding! Well, I realized that when it's the scene of Anna Liebert as child says \"Kill him, kill him.\" Wow! the face really frightening me. Or even the scene when a kid forced to walks on a local prostitution site, you don't need to imagine more, because the art already gives you more than what you expect.\nBasically, if I can compare the arts in atmospherical ways to top dark psychological thriller anime nowadays (Death Note, Pyscho Pass) I will give Death Note an 8 score, Pyscho Pass getting a 7, and Monster getting a 9. Watching Death Note and Psycho Pass or even NGE didnt give me that thrilling feels, or only disgusting feels because how much gore shown in it.\nSound 10/10\nNow this is the part that I love the most about this anime. The soundworks is so amazing, supporting every aspect of the movie. Peaceful town? Yes. Frightening atmosphere? Absolutely. Opening and Ending? Both of them are good, especially the ending one. I still remember the ending music, and I can't get it out of my head. It really match the \"Nameless Monster\" theme. Perfect.\nCharacter 10/10\nSince there is so many characters in it, I will point out only the Important ones.\n- Kenzo Tenma is a well developed character, you can really the way he thinks. A neurosurgery doctor, to a depressed adult young man who maybe wanted to end his own life, you can really feel what he really feels.\n- Johann Liebert is a top class made character. Well maybe you can feel and know what Tenma thinks, but what's better than that? An unpredictable ruthless monster who done his job with mindblowing ways. This character is #1 for my all time favorite characters.\n- Anna Liebert. I hate to say this, maybe she is the weakest part of the characters section. I know she is weak and strong in a way, but his presence did not give me any new ways to see the series. Her point of view is just somewhat mediocre.\n- Inspector Lunge, he is listed as my 3rd favorite characters on this anime. He stands to what he believes, he is a strong and realistic minded character. You can hate him, or love him, it's just the matter of your point of view.\n- Eva Heinemann is a supporting characters for me. Rather than main as what MAL shows on the page, I think she gives an impact to the show, but not that much. She's just like a bridge and connects things and scenes up.\nEnjoyment 9/10\nWhy do I only give it a 9 out of 10? Because the unimportant part of the series that really gives little impacts, or almost none which takes 5-10 episodes. I think it should add more Important stories, more like Johann's raising from his dead with his sister, rather than old couple that have trouble back at the farm.\nOverall 9.5/10\nI give it a 9.5 because nothing is perfect. For me, masterpiece is a 9, and this show is beyond it. One of the best \"Dark Psychological Thriller\" anime I've ever watch, or maybe it's the best. But I remind you, that this show is not a casual show like Psycho Pass (Which I think is overrated, sorry though). This is how Dark Psychological Thriller anime should be made, call me a fanboy, maybe I'm just a bit overrated it, but hey, it's my opinion. \nI put a 10 scores so much on MAL not because I think its perfect, it's just because I just like to do so, if I enjoyed it, why don't give it a free click to raise its popularity? :)\nP.S. This is my first review, please comment me on my profile :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    When I first announced to some of my friends that I was watching Monster, I usually said something like, “Monster is a 74 episode animated television series. It is a series about a monster, and the monster is man.” I mostly said this as a joke because it sounded very clichéd, like one of the things you’d read on the back of the DVD case. But now that I have watched the entire series and have had ample time to really think about it, I realize that while that statement might be dumb, it is a accurate statement about the series so if that line\n          \n        didn’t make you completely disinterested, I’d personally recommend you to keep reading and hear what I have to say about Monster. \n	Now before I go on I should warn you all that this review spoils the first five or so episodes of the series. Considering that these episodes don’t even make up 10% of the series, I really wouldn’t consider any of these major plot spoilers. Preferably I would not spoil these episodes but the central plot of the series isn’t really revealed to the viewer until he or she has made it five episodes or so into the series and if I plan to really discuss this series, I need to summarize some of the events of those episodes so that those of you who are not familiar with the show will able to understand at least some of my statements. \n	Monster is based on the manga of the same name, which was written and illustrated by Naoki Urasawa. It is a Japanese animated television series that began airing on April 6th, 2004 and ended on September 27th, 2005. The anime series is directed by Masayuki Kojima and animated by the animation studio Madhouse. The series primarily follows Kenzo Tenma, a benevolent and talented Japanese brain surgeon who works at a hospital in Düsseldorf and seems to have a very bright future ahead of him at the start of the series. He is on the doorstep of a very successful medical career and is happily engaged to the hospital director’s daughter. But things turn sour as Tenma soon realizes that the hospital’s bias of treating politicians over others has led to the deaths of some unlucky common folk. One night Tenma is ordered by the hospital director to stop operating on a young boy, who got shot in the head, so that he can operate on a politician. But instead of following orders and leaving the boy’s life in the hands of a less competent doctor, Tenma decides to continue the operation and saves the boy’s life. This decision ultimately leads to the death of the politician. Soon after this the director tells Tenma that he will do all in his power to make sure that Tenma will never advance in his medical career. This however soon ceases to be a problem as the director is mysteriously murdered one night and the boy who Tenma saved goes missing. There is an investigation done on the murder and while some suspect that Tenma might have been the murderer, as he was the only one who would have a believable motive, no decisive evidence is found, causing the case to be left unsolved. \n	Nine years later Tenma has reached the occupation of chief of surgery. One night, when he is checking up on a patient who is connected to a series of serial murders, he discovers that the patient is mysteriously missing from the hospital. Tenma goes out and eventually finds him with a beautiful young man who is the one behind all the murders. But that’s not all, as Tenma also discovers that this young man, who goes by the name of Johan, is actually the boy who he had saved nine years ago. Once Tenma knows this he is troubled by feelings of guilt and decides that he will leave the hospital in order to find and kill the monster he resurrected all those years ago. \n	One thing that I really appreciated about this show was the way it handled Johan. Considering that the show is called Monster one would expect the primary antagonist to be one who is not only able to commit atrocious crimes but one who is also terrifying. Luckily Monster is a show that manages to create such an antagonist, primarily through two means. The first of which is the actual look of Johan. \n	While Monster is far from an eyesore, the overall character design for the series is a bit more realistic and therefore more ugly than the majority of mainstream animation. Most of morally good characters aren’t particularly attractive and almost all of the morally bad characters are pretty ugly. But Johan is special as he is arguably the most evil character in the show and yet is also the most attractive male of the whole cast. Johan is a young, beautiful, blue eyed, and blonde haired boy and the dissonance between his appearance and the atrocities that he commits was something that was always unsettling. \n	The other, and arguably more important, way that the show is able to make Johan intimidating is the fact that he is a character shrouded in mystery. While a fair amount of the series is spent slowly revealing little bits and pieces of Johan’s past, the truth of the matter is that by the end of the series you have probably seen him for less than 10% of the entire series’ runtime. This was very surprising to me as he is the primary villain of the show and is introduced very early on in the series. At first I viewed this as a bad things since it meant that he doesn’t have much in the way of character development. But after thinking about it a lot I realized I actually really appreciated the lack of exposure to Johan. Unlike a lot of villains, he doesn’t get any opportunities to make any long, dramatic, and drawn out speeches where he explains his plans and motivations, which keeps him from becoming a over the top James Bond villain. Not only that but the lack of time you spend with Johan helps him keep this mysterious vibe that makes him feel more like a spooky legend rather than just some attractive guy who likes to kill people. By the end of the series Johan is responsible for countless deaths but you almost never see him take the steps to actually murder someone and while that might seem lazy, it makes it so that he never becomes predictable, which makes him seem all the more intimidating. While almost all the characters constantly talk about Johan, people are very rarely aware of his location or actions even though he is never that far away from any of the characters at any given point and is often subtly guiding them. Because of this Johan always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else and is a sort of a puppet master who can subtly change the plot with invisible strings. While Johan isn’t in much of the show, he undoubtedly leaves a creepy and ominous impression that lasts from his introduction to the very last frame and because of that he is one of the best villains that I have ever seen in a television show. \n	In fact one area that this series definitely excels in its the characters. With 74 episodes, the cast of Monster becomes extremely big and it is truly impressive how high of a many of them are fleshed out. Most characters, even those who are only appear for one episode, are memorable and given some sort of back-story or clear motivation for their actions. Even now, I can still remember some characters that were only present for 10 minutes or less at the very beginning of the series. I can mostly attribute this to the fact that many of them were so well realized that they felt like real people and thus I could easily imagine them in their lives outside of the events of the show. And this praise can be extended to the central characters of the show. By the end of the series you get such a clear understanding of what kind makes characters like Tenma tick that they become almost like family. This all not only makes the show interesting but also serves to make all the suspense and drama that unfolds extremely engrossing since these two dimensional drawings in some ways feel like actual three-dimensional people. \n	One thing that should be noted about Monster is that the pacing is fairly slow. Now this is not to say that there are long periods where not much is happening, in fact I felt the show does a good job of doing something interesting frequently enough that my interest was always peaked. It’s just that the show meanders a lot, at least during the first half. There are a lot of episodes in the beginning where Tenma takes time out of his epic quest in order to help out random people. While these episodes are well made as they can be quite emotional and also serve to develop Tenma’s character, I can’t deny that it was annoying how frequently the show seemed to get side tracked just so Tenma could help an old lady cross the street. There are even a few stretches of 3 to 5 episodes where Tenma isn’t even present. While what transpires does end up being very important to the plot of the series, it can sometimes feel like you’re watching a completely different show when these stretches occur. On the one hand I sometimes enjoyed these breaks from the central plot. The characters focused on during these sequences are genuinely entertaining to watch and some of these elongated breaks gave me time to breathe in between the very suspenseful and sometimes extremely dark events of the plot. I however also do have to admit that the inclusion of these scenes is part of the reason why the series is so long and can sometimes feel drawn out. While I do feel that the show’s length makes the whole story seem grander, I can’t help but wonder how much tighter the series could’ve been if some of the fat was trimmed. \n	But while the show might seem to take breaks, you definitely shouldn’t. As I have stated before this show’s cast is incredibly large and sometimes important characters will be introduced in an episode and then disappear for twenty or so episodes. Even though the characters are well written enough that they are easy to remember and keep track of, I do not think it is outside the realm of possibility for some viewers to get confused if they take a particularly long time to make their way through the series. Plus the story does get fairly complicated in the latter half of the series. \n	Speaking of confusion that is a feeling that I felt all too often as I was approaching the conclusion of this series. Now for the majority of the series the plot is fairly easy to follow. But around half way through the series, characters begin to uncover a conspiracy that is related to Johan’s past and around the time the last ten episodes rolled around I got completely lost within this subplot. This probably occurred because a lot of information needed to be crammed into a limited amount of time, meaning that in order for the writers to keep a solid pace, a lot of info needed to be included in a lot of short conversations. While this was executed fairly well in terms of keeping the show entertaining, it did mean that it was easy to miss some details when ten fairly complex things are being covered in one 3-minute conversation. Fortunately most of the series, including the conclusion, can be enjoyed and understood even if this part of the story isn’t fully understood. Its just unfortunate that a section of the series that the writers obviously put a lot of time into was not able to leave that much of an impact. \n	Another thing that I felt didn’t really live up to its full potential is the exploration of morals in the series. Very early on, many characters express a fear that Tenma may end up going down the wrong path if he decides to kill Johan. Also, there are a lot of scenes throughout the series where Tenma will see someone injured and either take them to a hospital, or treat them in some way right then and there. While it sometimes got repetitive to hear Tenma constantly yelling, “We need to get him/her to a hospital!” these scenes do showcase the irony that a man who has a deep conviction to save lives, is now spending an elongated period of his life tracking down someone to potentially kill them. Both of these elements seem to hint at the fact that the writers wanted to put in some deep moral conflict into the series but unfortunately the discussion of morals only really goes skin deep. Characters express their fear to Tenma that he will become that which he hates if he goes through with his mission but they never go any farther than just saying things like, “you shouldn’t kill Johan because killing is bad.” I realize that one of the reasons this ended up happening was because Tenma often goes out on his mission alone, leaving his friends behind. While this serves to make some scenes more intense, as Tenma is not often able to rely on the kindness of others, this also extremely limits his interactions with other characters and thus gives the writers fewer opportunities for characters to discuss morality. I got especially annoyed during one part where Tenma befriends a man who has a goal that very closely parallels his own to stop Johan. At first I got excited because I thought that the show could include some interesting conversations between the two where might start to see their own moral flaws or shortcomings in the other. Unfortunately this character left before anything thematically interesting could really transpire. Also, without spoiling anything, the episodes leading up to the end felt somewhat cheap since events transpired in a way that allowed a conclusion for Tenma’s story to be met without him having to make any of the tough moral decisions which had been hinted at since very early on in the series. While, I do realize that the discussion of morals could’ve slowed down the series even more, I can’t help but feel that the show just ended up dropping the ball when it came to this aspect of the show.   \n	And while I’m addressing pet peeves I should talk about the soundtrack. Now let me start of by saying that I love this soundtrack in terms of the actual music. While it is not exactly music that I would listen to by itself, it is truly amazing how effective a lot of the music can be in accentuating feelings during certain scenes. But while I did love the music I can’t ignore the fact that the way in which some of the soundtrack was used did knock my experience down a notch. On the soundtrack there is a particular track entitled “The Seeds of Time”. Now I actually really like this track. It starts of with strings giving off a very soft and sinister vibe. Then after a while it proceeds to become increasingly more loud and bombastic. It is a great piece of background music for any scene where tension slowly builds up to a thrilling climax. Unfortunately, the people working on Monster also realized this so every time anything vaguely intense happens, this track plays. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem for a two-hour film or a 13 episode miniseries. Monster however is 74 episodes long and the characters are about as good at staying out danger as I am at walking on water. This means that you better get used to hearing that track if you watch Monster as by the end of the series it is probably played for at least 30 minutes of the total runtime. While this is probably just a personal a nitpick, I can’t deny that around the time I got to episode 50 or so I started to notice just how often it was being played and that unfortunately made some scenes loose their punch, at least for me. \n	But don’t let these complaints fool you into thinking that Monster is a deeply flawed series. In truth when I first finished watching the series I got a warm and tingly feeling that only occurs when I have finished watching something I thought was very good.  Although I will admit that the moments leading up to that were making me worried that the conclusion would prove to be a disappointment. \n	Now I’ll be completely honest here and say that I was not pleased with how the last two episodes were playing out while I was first watching them. As I have stated before I felt that certain aspects of the conclusion of events felt cheap and while I found it adorable how the show tried to give some sort of resolution to all the little threads that were created throughout the series, I wouldn’t exactly call the execution graceful. Plus one half of the very last episode seemed to be devoted to tying up a loose thread that I’m pretty sure didn’t exist up until that point. I was however able to forgive all this once I began to experience the final five minutes of the show. Within that short time one final conversation took place, which not only managed to provide some final closure to the story, but also manages to raise some final haunting questions about some of the more mysterious characters of the series as well as human nature in general. In this sense it is almost like a twist ending as it allows the viewer to think about many of the events that took place over the course of the series in a completely new context. Monster’s ending might have been more like a whimper than a bang, but it is a whimper that managed to be more impactful than most of the bangs that I have experienced.\n	When I look back at my viewing of the series, I feel that one of the best things I can say about Monster is that I sometimes completely forgot that it was an animated show. In America animation is treated more like a genre than a medium. Usually if a show or film is animated, it means that it is either very juvenile or very crude. While there are exceptions, Americans don’t seem to believe that animation is medium that can be used to tell mature, serious stories. But Monster, to me at least, is the perfect proof that this belief is wrong. Even though the series is animated it is a long-winded and dark crime thriller that wouldn’t feel too out of place next to a show like Breaking Bad. There is really no reason why the show needed to be in animated form and while it may not gain much from being animated, it is a prime example of how animation can tell a mature story without resorting to some brutal violence or sexual activity.\n	Even though Monster doesn’t reach its full potential in terms of exploring its themes, I do believe it does a good job of commenting on human nature. A lot of stories that try to touch upon the darker side of humanity and society usually resort to depicting worlds that are dark and edgy where the strong prey on the weak in gruesome ways. While these stories don’t always miss their mark, they often go so over the top in their brutality that their worlds end up becoming unbelievable. But Monster’s world is one of balance. For every atrocity that takes place there is a heart-warming miracle. For every brutal serial killer there is a loving mother and child. For every dark and disgusting alleyway there is a breathtakingly beautiful countryside. While this balance does ensure that Monster is not a show that ever becomes too dark nor too nice, it is also one that manages to make all the bad in its world seem worse by juxtaposition. It’s one thing to see savages blow each other’s heads off with magnums, but when the same thing is being done between a savage and a well to do doctor who just wants to make the world a better place, it really drives home how horrible humans can be. Every display of human kindness in the show makes every bit of human depravity in the show seem all the more unexplainable and detestable. Wild animals may kill each other in the wild but that is usually done in self-defense or because of a need for food. Humans however are the only animals, at least to my knowledge, that will kill and torture members of its own species for seemingly no reason and that is a fact that Monster reminds the viewer countless times throughout its 74 episodes. And it is through this that the Monster is able to show that the man is truly the world’s most monstrous animal.\n"},

I found that it did everything right, but still managed fail as entertainment. Not to say that Monster is a bad anime, but it was a sore disappointment to me after all the hype. I'm going to take a somewhat critical view of it in this review, but it has many positive qualities too. If you want to know what these are, you can look above me at all the people who rated it 9 and 10.\nStory: If one thing can be said about the story, it's deep. It deals with a lot of\n          \n        moral and ethical questions and explores psychology. One thing it isn't is entertaining. There are a few cool plot twists here and there, but they don't manage to overcome the fact that this anime is *slow*. The plot is well-written, but could have been told a lot better if the series had 48 fewer episodes. The story itself is good, but not mind-blowing. It also fails at creating horror and suspense.\nArt: The art is very unique. It aspires to be more realistic than other anime and along the way falls into the same trap so many first-person shooters succumb to: it just isn't nice to look at. The art makes everything feel drab and lifeless, like you're looking at a cardboard cutout. The color pallette is limited to muted tones and browns. Some may say it fits with the series, I agree. It's boring and not something I want to watch for 74 episodes.\nSound: The music for the show is fairly good. Not rush-to-download good, but reasonably fitting to the scenes, with a few tunes (particularly the show's main theme) that stand out and really add emotional impact. The two EDs are some of the most unpleasant music I've ever heard, although I suppose that could be by design too.\nCharacter: The characters in monster are similar to the rest of the show, boring. OK, I'll admit I liked Runge a lot. Other than that, they really didn't do much to grab me, they're just too...normal. You also really don't get to see them react to that many different situations, so don't really know them that well. There are way too many characters on top of that. Of the 100+ character cast, only Tenma, Anna, Johan, and Runge recieve any real development, and the show continues to throw more and more characters at you right up until the very end, none of which you can really care about.\nEnjoyment: As you can probably tell by now, I didn't really enjoy this anime. I rate it a 7 because objectively, it's a pretty good piece of work. I had to quit watching twice for long periods of time to get through all 74 episodes. It just didn't grab me. I didn't want to watch it. I kepy waiting for 'the good part', but it never came. The last 5 episodes are fairly entertaining however. Overall, a decent anime, but not worth the 37 hours of your life required to watch it.\n        "},

It was also a tad slow at times, and the plot will leave you dizzy trying to keep up, but most of all this is a masterpiece of human observation and a hauntingly beautiful tale of tragedy and deception. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    The anime 'Monste'r is rightfully acclaimed for being a masterpiece in Anime history. Watching Monster was a bit of a pilgrimage for me. I use the word 'pilgrimage' in a metaphorical sense. Lately, I have been increasingly jaded towards the recent developments of the Anime industry as it has been quite a while since they have produced a work of great merit. These sentiments lead me to the following questions: What is the point of all of this? Am I wasting time? Am I being escapist? What is the opportunity cost that I pay for watching Anime? So, I decided to direct my fading interest\n          \n        towards 'Monster', and here's what I thought of it.\nStory (9/10):\n(While this is not a summary, it may contain spoilers)\n'Monster' is a story that can be treated from many different angles. It can be given the superficial look of an age old good vs. evil tale or it can be interpreted as being Faustian (this harmonizes with many of the characters feelings on how the main antagonist is a devil-like character) or treated as something like the Maltese Falcon, a detective story that shows the grisly reality of an investigator's job.\nIn any case, 'Monster' captures the local culture of many of the presented settings with surprising fluency. From mannerisms to even food, Germany and the Czech Republic are given an amazing degree of attention to detail. This is further bolstered by the art, but that comes later.\nWhat is most fascinating about 'Monster' is the investigative side of it. I often hear how this is similiar to the anime 'Death Note' and frankly, I think they are very different.\n'Monster' uses different perspectives and their individual discoveries to eventually lead to a conclusion. Dr. Tenma (the primary protagonist) is not the only one getting the information and making connections. The multitude of cases embroil a large cast of characters who all provide to its eventual resolution...even then many mysteries remain unsolved.\nThe story is one that is multifaceted. Ranging from topics of historical significance (the Berlin Wall, East Germany, Neo-Nazis etc.) to those concerning familial relationships, the story of 'Monster' is a unique brew that I have yet to taste even outside anime. Although, I must say some aspects are similiar to the movie Citizen Kane...or perhaps its just me.\nArt (9/10):\nThere is a difference between art and animation, so I'll speak of them separately.\nThe art of 'Monster' is interesting. This is in the sense that it can be some of the most simplistic yet attain a level of detail close to that of photorealism. \nThe characters are designed, interestingly enough, like ordinary people. There is almost no beautification of the characters. The facial features seem simple enough (somewhat reminiscent of Osamu Tezuka, are the two authors related?) and yet they are able to warp in response to many possible emotions. \nThe scenery is the real deal. They are depicted beautifully with no architectural flaws, when it comes to buildings. The use of perspective is noticeable in many cases, giving the settings depth and a sense of reality. The use of lighting and contrast is amazingly effective and changes in accord to the tone of the scene.\nThe animation is almost equally a spectacle. What surprised was the consistency of the animation throughout the series, which is rather long, by my standards anyway. The character movement is natural and there are few repetitions of sequences (except in flashbacks, which this anime is full of). Where the animation fails is in the action sequences. This is understandable as 'Monster' is largely devoid of action-packed plot (this is not an adaptation of some infamous shonen battle manga). Nonetheless, this is a well done area of the series.\nSound (7/10):\nAlright, I have difficulty with reviewing the sound of an anime because it has a good deal of focus on the vocals, which I don't give too much stock to. If this were a production featuring, say Yoko Kanno, then perhaps I would actively watch out for soundtracks. So, consider this part of the bias of the score.\nFor its length, I was surprised that the same OP was used. The OP 'Grain' is a fitting piece to the tone of the anime. The two ED pieces, however, somehow didn't work with the flow.\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, there weren't many that stood out as being exceptional. Due to the length of the series, one will become familiar with the pieces and the appropriate situations where they are used.\nAs for vocals, I mentioned earlier my lack of attention to them. Yet, in comparison to all other anime I watched, the vocals were quite good. I particularly liked Runge's rather stoic tone and Dr. Tenma's, particularly how it subtly changes during the course of the story.\nCharacter (10/10):\nThe strongest aspect of the series are its characters. Monster has a large cast of characters if one should include all the secondary characters. I find it particularly intriguing how humane a large number of the characters are. By humane, I mean how closely they reflect different walks of life from which they come from.\nThis brings me to the contrasting point, which is the main antagonist, Johan. Johan is perhaps one of the more unique villains I have encountered in anime. The anime does an excellent job of documenting his interaction and influence to the plot. Johan at times doesn't seem to be a villain at all, yet there's always this unpleasant feeling that can at times truly terrify you and make you question: What on earth is he?\nCharacter development is a key aspect to consider when evaluating the characters. While, yes, the characters do change it is interesting to notice how they change and what ethical implications now apply. A lot of the time, it feels that it is the role rather than the character that is developing. \nAnother particularly interesting part of this is how the two main characters, Johan and Tenma, affect the secondary characters around them as they do their respective deeds. There are times where if one thinks deeply about these interactions, the implications can be almost harrowing or even enlightening.\nThe characters are definitely worthy of praise as many are unique and all have a feeling of humanity that makes them worth more than just being plot devices coordinated by the author to get the plot moving.\nEnjoyment (8/10):\nMonster is the type of anime that grabs you and doesn't let you go for a long time. The riveting storyline and the case of colorful characters will place you in the world of Monster almost as if you are one of them. By the end of it, even the most superficial of us may want to think and consider the chilling possibility that people like Johan may just exist (they probably do).\nThe length is daunting, so there is nothing like a summer vacation to finish it. The plot is clearly presented so there is not much of chance of getting lost in it. It is in many ways a good investment of your time. \nHowever, the clarity of the plot can work against it. Perhaps it is a bad habit of mine, but I have the tendency of solving the cases before they are even solved on the television screen. You may also feel that the plot is unnecessarily redundant at times in leading the clues to the incident and appropriate suspect. On the overall, I enjoyed the series very much and it easily surpassed many other anime that I held in high regard. \nSo, back to the deal with 'Monster' and my jaded nature. While Monster did rekindle my faith in the possible excellence of the anime medium, it did not rekindle it to the point where I could trust the Anime industry once again. I feel that Monster is an appropriate end to my anime career as I have learned quite a few lessons from it. Lessons that even real life experiences can't teach. Anyway, thank you for reading and hope you enjoy the anime as much as I did. It is truly an experience to be reckoned with.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    “We stopped looking for monsters under our bed when we realized that they were inside us.\"-- Charles Darwin\nThe best stories are those that leave such a big impact on you that it makes you rethink your values and beliefs. Those that shatter your very inner core. Those that look you dead in the eye and force you to face tough subjects most anime choose not to tread near, such as the value of human life, nature vs. nurture and their roles in society, brainwashing, human experimentation, and even that of the self. Monster is one of the few shows that does all of these things,\n          \n        which is why it is praised so highly as a classic. \nThe story of Monster is set in post-Cold War Germany and revolves around a highly respected Japanese neurosurgeon named Kenzo Tenma who seems to have everything going for him. His world takes a complete turn for the worse when he chooses to save the life of a boy who ends up becoming a sociopathic Monster. Tenma then feels that it is his responsibility to fix what he did wrong, but in the process it could mean going against his beliefs and his very nature.\nMonster is a psychological mystery with a lot of pieces and questions floating around that builds up suspense in each episode. The plot is meticulously handled. It follows Dr. Tenma but then branches out into multiple supporting character arcs who are all vital to the story in unraveling the main mystery of the “Monster.” The show forces viewers right into these characters’ shoes, as the events unfold in multiple perspectives, which results in some truly strong character building. This is a drastic difference to the story structure of most mainstream anime, but it really works. By going into each character’s story, it gives them an immense amount of depth but also creates a much more layered and complex plot. Through each character, the pieces start to come together and by the end of the show, each character is affected greatly in some way or another. No character comes out as the same person in the end. \nThe main protagonist, Kenzo Tenma is a representation of the good in people. He holds to his belief that all lives are equal and deserve to be saved regardless of the corruptness of their souls. This is what drives him to do what he thinks is the right thing to do; to save the boy out of the decency of his heart. This decision is the turning point of his life. On his mission to fix what he thinks he is responsible for, Tenma affects those that come into his life and saves anyone that needs saving. He shows us that there is good in humanity and that it is worth saving. His internal struggle is felt deeply as we see how much of a sacrifice it has on his career and happiness, while he is forced to face the monster that he believes he is responsible for.  \nI think something should be said about what stands as one of the best and most memorable, complex antagonists in anime history. What’s so interesting about the villain in this show is that he doesn’t use extreme weapons or super powers to invoke fear in his adversaries; he uses something very simple yet effective, and that is his mind. He digs deep into people’s fears and insecurities and turns them into monsters using charisma, manipulation, and psychological warfare. He acts as a ghost behind the scenes and watches the mayhem unfold before him. There’s so much more to him than meets the eye however and as more is revealed about him, he becomes an immensely interesting and multifaceted character who is hard not to sympathize with. His appearances are not all too often, and are saved for some of the most intense moments in the show, but when he does appear he completely grabs your attention and you can’t help but feel literal chills down your spine.\nMonster not only has thrilling edge-of-your-seat suspense and great character development, but also raises important questions and themes seen in life. What is the role that nurture plays in human lives? How does human conditioning affect people? What creates a monster? Are all lives equal? Are we ultimately responsible for the kind of people we turn out to be? It also delves into the self and what happens when you strip away any sense of identity from a person. Moreover, Monster shows us that the journey is more important than the resolution. It shows that the choices we make ultimately affect those around us, and it is up to us how we choose to act upon them. Even though humans go through so much suffering and trauma, they can either let those negative experiences rule their lives and devour them from the inside out or they can grow through the adversity and come out a stronger person in the end. Everyone has their own inner monster but not everyone gives the monster life. \nMonster isn’t your typical anime. It doesn’t have exaggerated characters and over-the-top battle scenes.  It’s a superb psychological mystery that relies on its humanist heart to tell a gripping story. If you are engrossed by philosophical topics and appreciate a solid psychological thriller with compelling characters and twists at every turn, then Monster is right up your alley.  "},

The culprit of modern stress. Most of us find ourselves holding on to things and NOT wanting to let go. But you must because that is your helper. Take breathing for instance. You\n          \n        can only hold on for so long. And the protagonist Dr Kenzou Tenma teaches us that in the first few episodes. His struggle to full fill ideas that are essentially not his own drive him to madness. But when he exhales and lets go, he wakes up to his true calling leaving behind a life of false dreams. But that does not last long as he finds himself having to inhale once again. This time holding on to a past he cannot escape. \nMONSTER is an amazing performance from realistic memorable characters. Each unique individual is full of life. Embodying a vast array of human emotions ranging from anxiety, envy, fear, frustration, jealousy and loneliness. Everything you look for in a drama both comic and tragic. Very bald and honest in revealing the goodness and evil that coexists \"harmoniously\" in the universe we live in. And I use the word harmonious because let us interpret..... The world is an exploding monster. And the only way it can sustain itself is to devour itself up, (hence the story of the monster shown at the end of every episode). \nThis animation is all about human nature or shall I say the study of human psychology and its relationship to the external world. What people don't realise is that you cannot study a human being in and of itself as is usually assumed in modern psychology. To study anything one must also take into consideration the behaviour of the environment. One must build a network of information. To weave together a complex matrix of relationships. But even that would not be enough, for the amount of data one would have to take into consideration is infinite. In the end you can never truly define anything; and we see this notion being illustrated in many aspects. Like the eccentric machine-like detective Heinrich Lunge, who embodies this process of perfection yet is so blind and far from the truth.\nWe are all chasing something we will never be able to catch.........\n--------------------------------------------------------\nMemorable quotes Ep44.\n「わからない、この数日間いろんな人に裏切られた。 僕にはもう分からない、何を信じればいいのか。」- ヤン・スーク\n\"I don't know, during these past few days I have been betrayed by so many people.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The anime masterpiece \"Monster\" is most interesting for its psychological components, often eerily close to reality, and its amazing characters, such as the enigmatic, charismatic, and utterly unforgettable Johan Leibert. If you like dark series, mystery, mindgames, creepy children, historical dramas, and/or debates about ethics, conditioning, children's rights, psychology, crime, killing, and justice, you will thoroughly enjoy \"Monster\" for having all of these motifs. Without a doubt it's one of the most psychological anime in existence.\n There's no need to be put off by the length of the series either, because even the slightly less consequential arcs can be thrilling, the characters are always well\n          \n        developed, and the various arcs all tie in neatly with the central story. Since new twists are revealed right up to the very last episode, be sure to watch the whole series if you watch any of it. Otherwise you may not be able to appreciate the depth of \"Monster\" 's story or its notable characters. \nWithout a doubt, my favorite thing about \"Monster\" is the unique relationship between Johan and his sister Anna/Nina. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. I also love this show's portrayal of what society now largely considers mental illness. The illnesses portrayed include Sociopathy and/or Antisocial Personality Disorder, Dissociative Amnesia, Dissociative Identity Disorder, Addiction/Substance Abuse, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. If you or someone you know suffers from any of these disorders, like me, you may appreciate \"Monster\" all the more for it. \nThe only downsides I might mention is that, for better or worse, not everything in \"Monster\" is explained. Much is open to interpretation. This bothers some anime fans, but to me it's a positive aspect of the series. I also would warn potential viewers that this is a very dark anime, so don't go into it blindly. In addition to murders, debates of justice, and discussion of dark psychology, this series includes characters suffering from child abuse, identity confusion, the aftereffects of war, and various other types of trauma. I recommend viewers  to be cautious of any triggers, and I personally do not recommend the show for people under sixteen. As long as you are fully prepared, however, then by all means check out \"Monster\"! It just may be the most psychologically interesting series you ever watch. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    First off I'd like to say this is an amazing piece of artwork both with the manga and anime. Urasawa shows us his genius and ingenuity when creating mangas. I've never been able to find anything else  out there which has as much complex plot weaving and carefully crafted characters who never lose your interest. \nWhatever you do don't be discouraged by the lenghtyness of monster. Its 74 episodes may be something which would scare away most thinking the show might be filled with fillers, fan service, and horrible bland characters. The sheer brilliance of this manga/anime is what allows it be hailed as\n          \n        one of the best in the suspense/thriller genre. Urasawa gives us a masterpiece which clearly shows he has spent time trying to craft a piece of art. Now to be honest the review I will be giving is coming from a fan of Urasawa but for the sake of objectivity I'm trying my best to not have you go through and try and decipher the points which may hold true. \nMonster begins with the protagonist Kenzou Tenma who is faced with a stark choice. He is haunted by a moral dilemma which eventually has him abandon his occupation, ideals, and status in order to fulfill what he believes to be his purpose. His choice is what propels the viewer into a complex and suspenseful chain of events which keeps the viewer begging for more. You are given a multitude of various intelligently crafted characters which have multidimensional personalities which are fitted neatly in the complex plotline that is developed in this story. There is currently a nice big character web out there which shows how every single character is given an importance purpose throughout the series which makes the anime feel complete.\nThe setting of the anime was a superb choice by Urasawa and it stems from his fascination with Germany. Another important point that must be made is those that have a pretty good understanding of the politics and history of Germany will appreciate this anime for Urasawa staying true to important events and bringing about the realism factor. The animes animation isn't something that could be done any better to be honest. The characters in the anime usually stay true to Urasawa's design and they are all unique. The sound I admit isn't very spectacular but the anime doesn't go wrong in important key points in the manga.\n\nI'd also like to mention that this anime has important themes which give light to important philosophical lessons concerning life. They are important because they are the lifeblood of the character design and they serve to convey philosophical messages which the viewers will appreciate. You will be impressed by the qualities of some characters particularly Kenzou Tenma for his humane and loving nature. He is the honorable protagonist who is left thinking he has no other choice but to make a decision which will change his life forever. The antagonist of the story truly is deserving of the nametag Monster. The villain is not simply another carbon copy type that you very well see in other types of storys. He is also a fascinating and intricately created character which throughout the anime will both frighten viewers and leave you in sheer awe because of his greatness.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    - Summary (TL:DR) -\nThe show started strong and slow meanders it's way to the finish line. The characters were very much defined from the get go and changes very little throughout the story. personally, I didn't find as deep and complex as the fans of the show claimed it to be, but I didn't find it to be as much of a snooze fest as it's haters claimed.\nSo what do I think about Naoki Urasawa's Monster? Ehh, it's fine, I don't find it particularly offensive but I doubt I would be recommending it to anyone. If you're thinking of watching the show, watch the first\n          \n        4 episodes, and then continue watching but thinking of the episodes after episode 4 as its own separate series.\n- Story -\nI remembered when I had first seen the first few episodes of the show, it was perhaps the most compelling first episodes I had ever seen in all my years of watching anime. I began recommending this series left and right. I thought to myself \"could this be the one? Had I found the one true masterpiece? Is there where my anime watching career will end?\" No. Unfortunately, it was not to be. \nAs I continued forwards through the 72 episodes, never again did the series ever grab me as much as it did in the first few episodes. The story began to drag on, the mysteries became obvious,  disposable side characters were introduced and all the tension that had been built up through the first few episodes has vanished by the half way point.\nWhile the story still remained complex, it was not for the reasons one might hope as the plot began to tangle around bland uninteresting side characters forming arcs which barely connected to the main storyline. The beginnings and ends of each arc were very obvious and disjointed which isn't necessarily a negative, but the conclusion of every \"filler arc\" did serve to remind me of just how much of my time that this show has wasted. There was no reason (apart from the manga source material) that this show could not have been half its length.\nAs for the end, I will not spoil it. I will, however, say it was obvious that Urasawa had planned this ending from the very beginning as the ending reflected an ongoing theme within the show. But by the time we got to the there, I felt that the theme in question had already been reinforced soo many times throughout, that by the time we arrived at the ending, it had no real impact.\n\n- Art & Sound -\nI found both the art and sound to be serviceable, it didn't add anything to the show but it also did not detract from it. It fitted nicely with the mood and atmosphere the show was trying to achieve.\n- Characters -\nThe characters were by far the weakest point of the series, while not your traditional archetypes, the characters lacked complexity and dimensions. The main characters were defined very early and received very little development despite the long runtime.\nTake Dr Tenma for example, our protagonist, you'd think with 74 episodes mostly following one man's journey of redemption, that we'd at least see multi-facets of that characters but nope, Dr Gary Stu can do no wrong, not only does he never doubt his actions, he is infallible, omnibenevolent and to top it off, his hands had healing abilities which would have made Jesus jealous. (I totally forgot to mention Nina, AKA female Tenma)\nAs previously mentioned, as the story dragged on, many shallow side-characters were introduced, all with their own problems for Dr Tenma to solve. In fact, most of the main characters in the show could be summarised in one short sentence. I will refrain from making examples as I do believe the first few episodes are very much worth your time. \nThe characters in Monster lacked humanity, making them appear robotic and soulless. Which would explain why the most compelling character by far is the main antagonist of the story, but as the story dragged on. even he became more and more like a force of nature character, rather than a true character. It's as if Urasawa had written the plot points rather than characters.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n     SPOILER FREE REVIEW\nMonster. An Anime that has a cliffhanger at the end of every episode and when the story is closer to its ending, you feel like it is actually getting more distant. \nStory\nThere is no way this story deserves less than 10/10. Everything connects, something that may not make sense in the beginning, will make sense later on. Although I don´t want to give a description of the plot (as you can already read on MAL), I would like to say that the story is something that we don´t see in anime a lot, which is that it is completely realistic. Everything that\n          \n        happens in Monster, is 100% possible of happening in real-life. Aside from that, the audience can relate to many characters on a personal level, because as the story progresses, our main character (Doctor Tenma) goes through a whole journey of meeting people that he may stay with until the end of the series, or they might just be there for 1-2 episodes. But, don´t be mistaken, one of the strongest points of this series, is that the author does a fantastic job on developing the characters and giving them meaning. Now, my personal favourite villain of all time, Johan. Johan is a villain that I have never seen before, as his ideals and \"way of living\" are topics rarely explored. I don´t want to spoil, so, I´ll just say that he is FAR from an ordinary murderer. Monster also explores many philosophies, as well as how your philosophy of life can change due to something tragic or something good. The philosophy it explores a lot though, is nihilism, which is why I love the show so much. Nihilism is a difficult philosophy to grasp, not because it is really complicated (although it is in some forms), but because believing in it seems irrational. Nonetheless, Naoki Urasawa is an outstanding writter. \nArt\nThis anime was made in 2004, so while many people complain about the animation, I honestly thought it was great and Madhouse did a fantastic job. And I might add that I don´t really know about animation, but, I will say that it sooth´s the anime perfectly  \nSound\nThe sound in Monster is amazing. In fact, the opening song was so great that I watched it every single time from episode 1-74. Plus, the soundtrack has a variety of songs and each of them sooth the specific moment that they are put on perfectly. \nCharacter\nAs I said before, characters are one of the main reasons this show is so enjoyable. The author explored a lot of different personalities and showed how you may never achieve your dreams in life, or how you might have to become independent at a young age or maybe just how boring life is...¯\_(ツ)_/¯ \nAlthough some people complain that the show if not realistic as some actions made by the characters don´t make sense, if you at any point think that while watching, I recommend you do what I did, putting yourself in the characters shoes. \nEnjoyment\nI mean, my review says it all. Trust me, MONSTER IS DEFINITELY A SHOW YOU WANNA WATCH BEFORE DYING!"},

I didn't feel the work of a master, yes, the characters interweave for 74 episodes, but I didn't care about any of them, I became completely apathetic to every aspect of this story.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Dr Kenzo Tenma is a genius surgeon working in post-Cold War Germany who has a bright future ahead of him. He is admired by his colleagues, loved by his patients, and due to marry his boss' daughter, the beautiful Eva Heinemann. One day, when two patients in desperate need of emergency surgery are wheeled into his hospital, Tenma faces a terrible choice of saving the orphaned boy who came first or the mayor of Düsseldorf, whose recovery would raise the hospital's profile and boost his own career. Against the demands of his superior, Tenma does what he believes is right and saves the child. However,\n          \n        his decision not only damages his prospects, but unleashes a chain of events so horrific that it might have come from the depths of his worst nightmares. Laden with guilt, Tenma begins a journey across Germany in search of a formidable young man who will challenge his morals, his love for life, and his very sanity.\nStory (10/10)\nMonster is a true gem and a rare anime masterpiece.\nDespite its daunting length, an exceedingly high standard of quality is consistently maintained in all 74 episodes. And because the writer does not get sidetracked with filler episodes or arcs, a single, coherent storyline runs through. This gives the impression of watching a an excellent graphic novel. Though the story itself is impossibly intricate, a web of intrigue and conflicting motives to tantalize the viewer, Monster manages to conclude dramatically, memorably and without the use of such cheap and overused plot devices as deus ex machina.\nUrasawa Naoki clearly left nothing to chance or improvisation in the creation of Monster. His meticulously conceived and astoundingly immersive plot is certainly the result of countless hours of historical, geographical and cultural research. Monster is set against the backdrop of a Germany reeling from its internal division by the Berlin Wall, all the while struggling to cope with the conflicting ideals of democracy and authoritarianism within the same country. This dichotomy between the East and West German governments, along with the long-term consequences for the citizens on each side of the Wall are subtly referenced throughout the plot. Realism on this level is something that no author can fake. The actual plot idea behind Monster is one we have all heard before. A doctor is under suspicion for murder and flees the authorities to find the villain and clear his name. But with Monster, it is not so much the originality of the plot, as it is the masterful storytelling which puts Monster in a category of its own.\nUrasawa's style is one of sublime efficiency - not a single scene is wasted and every piece of information revealed to the audience is ultimately significant. A single glance, a dark shadow, the sound of a footstep - these are the precise and parsimonious tools Urasawa uses to tell the story of Monster. His narration is immersive and gripping, but never once does it feels heavy-handed. The flow from scene to scene always feels completely natural, and deftfully avoids any appearance that the writer is forcing the plot in order to create drama or suspense.\nIf anything, it is just the opposite: the main story is advanced through the exposition of tangential subplots. As a result, the hero is constantly hot on the trail of the antagonist, but only ever able to gain information from indirect witnesses, friends of friends, people only remotely related to the search at hand. Consequently, the antagonist's screen time is so rare that each appearance might even be considered a cameo. And yet, Urasawa's villain is easily the best characterised and most memorable in all the anime I have seen to date. I stand in awe of Monster, for this is storytelling at its finest.\nI extend my sincere congratulations to Madhouse, the studio which produced Monster, for not letting commercial interest ruin this wonderful work of art and for keeping a strict vigil over the quality of the series during the 18 months it aired. The result speaks for itself: one would find it extremely challenging to find another anime of this length which tells its story in such compelling fashion, and with such style, ingenuity and dignity.\nArt (8/10)\nThe visual quality in Monster is both superb and unique. Through the creative use of cinematic techniques, Monster is made to feel very much like a movie, because the \"camera\" viewpoint is often used to focus in on significant moments or details or even facial expressions. In this fashion, the audience's attention is skillfully drawn towards such ominous things as shadows, dark corners and footsteps in order to intensify the atmosphere.\nThe artwork in Monster carries strong influences from film noir. Even from the first few episodes, the use of darker hues and greyed out tones give the anime a bleak and foreboding feeling. As the story progresses, the anime becomes a showcase for the animator's sublime mastery over the use of shadow and lighting.\nDetail levels are quite decent, although exterior scenery is rare, given the dark nature of the story. The few scenic moments I do remember in the anime were well-drawn. I know the following will seem odd for a mystery and suspense thriller, but the food shown in Monster is extremely appetizing; I distinctly recall feeling hungry several times while watching the characters eat. Prior to viewing Monster, I had never craved German food, but I must admit that the anime actually convinced me to seek out a place where I could eat some the things I saw.\nSound (8/10)\nObviously, in a suspense/thriller anime, you would not expect to find highly memorable or catchy tunes. This is the case with Monster, the anime relying more heavily on silence, foreboding sounds, and the occasional eerie music to set the mood. And since sustaining mood is of paramount importance in this genre, the sound selection was appropriate and well-considered. The audio track always complemented the scenes of the anime, and never detracted from the tension of the moment.\nDespite being 74 episodes long, Monster had only one opening and two ending themes. From a vocal standpoint, both singers featured in the ending music are quite mediocre. However, the suitability of these two pieces for the overall atmosphere of Monster is ideal. Both pieces are only very lightly orchestrated, with contrasting emphasis on echo and proximity of voice to the microphone, resulting in an altogether unsettling and haunting feeling which is completely appropriate for the series.\nIt is the voice acting, though, which gives Monster its unforgettable immersiveness. The seiyuu cast succeeds brilliantly in adding to the overall atmosphere. Though the anime involves a wide spectrum of emotion, the seiyuu convincingly convey each emotion to perfection. Sasaki Nozomu in particular deserves special commendation for so vividly bringing to life the role of the main antagonist. It is no easy task to credibly portray the voice of a person who commits brutal murder without a trace of emotion, and yet possesses the gentle charm and seductive charisma to beguile and manipulate countless others.\nCharacters (9/10)\nUrasawa Naoki's indirect storytelling style has a very apparent benefit: it allows him to richly develop the entire cast of characters, including those with secondary roles. I would be hard-pressed to name a single character in Monster with whom I did not feel intimately acquainted and whose motivations I did not understand by the end of the series. Considering that each episode almost certainly introduces at least one new character, it is mind-blowing that Urasawa manages to achieve this level of familiarity among the audience with all of his numerous and colourful characters.\nUrasawa pushes the envelope with the characterisation of his main cast and manages to completely blur the lines between fictional character and real person. He recognises that people do not only change as a result of momentous plot events - sometimes, people also gradually change over time. The timeline of Monster spans over forty years, so this slow self-evolution of the characters' motivations, aspirations and values provides a much deeper level of authenticity that I would love to see in other anime.\nI also admire the fact that Monster's characters are shown to have a life outside their role within plot. This is a dimension which adds a great deal to the believability of the characters. Often it takes no more than only the subtlest of details, like a family picture in the background, or a quick \"in-passing\" reference during dialogue, but such are the minutiae which distinguish excellence from mediocrity.\nOverall (9/10)\nMonster possesses a polish shared by too few other anime. It is truly a finished product, completed and produced with pride. As a viewer, I distinctly felt that every scene was contemplated with care, every detail meticulously reviewed. One would be hard-pressed to find an inconsistency in the story, let alone an unexplained or forgotten plotline. Monster is a lengthy 74-episode anime with no fillers. This alone should speak volumes as to the quality of this anime.\nFor the lack of a better place to mention this, the ending sequence is well worth the time to watch, in detail, after every episode. The graphical content for the outro is almost never identical, though often the changes from episode to episode are almost imperceptible. Yet, those who have the patience to sort through these small differences are richly rewarded with an additional dose of ingenious foreshadowing and symbolism.\nWithout a doubt, because of its all-around excellence, and its superb attention to quality and detail, Monster has become the definitive benchmark by which I have judged all other anime. To all lovers of quality anime, if you have yet to see Monster, then you are most assuredly missing out on one of the very best.\n        "},

Throughout the whole series the anime deals with alot of issues such as racism, psychology, and goes through the details of both good and evil.\nStory: 10\nThe story-line follows the doctor, doctor Tenma as he tries to save lives and bring a murder Johan Liebert. But as the story progressed, even if i personally wasn't entirely into it i still personally couldn't help but keep going. I soon found myself engrossed. The Viewer will very rarely find themselves board or annoyed with it. It is a very beautiful\n          \n        story and you can't help but keep going till the very end. \nThe dialogue was never a waste of time and kept the story-line going and at times was soothing and somewhat made you feel anxious.\nAnimation: 9\nSure while it looks like a old form of style if you compare it to other anime out there. Also the way the eyes are designed to show intent, be it of the sinister intent like the story suggests, the use of colour makes it stand out from some of the others. Even the imagery at the end that showed a story  of a monster without a name was very good and useful, it kept to the story and made us want to watch more to see more of the said story, which appears some time in the series. Overall it has the best animation that was used no doubt in its time. Thing i still don't understand is why no-one else has given this anime a go.\nSound: 9\nEveryone's voice actor does his or her part to suit the role, and they do it in such a precise way, causing each voice actor to stand out. And while i do prefer an Original Soundtrack to have more life, this one does it's best and each track that is played causes the viewer to either jump out of their skin when they see danger right behind a character that not even the character in question has realised. Overall i think it achieved the goal it originally set out to do.\nCharacter: 10\nThe greatest strength i noticed when watching this is each character was convincing, strong and did what he or she set out to do even if for some of them it meant meeting their demise. Each character, good or evil did their part. I in-particular rather liked Heinrich Lunge, Doctor Tenma and Johan Liebert. Why, well i can't exactly pick a exact thing about them i like. But Lunge was unlike any other character i had ever seen in a anime, be it his tapping as though he was always on a computer typing away or how he always tried to figure out how the murder killed. He was really one character for me that standed out from the crowd. Doctor Tenma was also very interesting going from a surgeon to 'a man on a mission' so to speak. Fact of the matter is these three characters will always stand out to me no matter what anime i personally watch next.\nEnjoyment: 10\nMonster is one of those anime you think at first \"OMG, this anime looks boring as hell' but once you get started you can't help but keep going. Be it the tittle or otherwise, you feel drawn to it and soon end up watching. Sure it seems slow but with episodes that only go for 23:55 each roughly, but once you finish each episode you are left wanting more and more, till finally before you even realize it your 3 quarters of the way through. If anything i feel like this anime will be one i, myself won't be forgetting anytime soon; that much i can say for certain.\nOverall: 10\nThe story will have you wrapped and have most of you second guessing some characters or trying to figure out who is the guilty party. The opening is fairly simple being more music than word or lyrics unlike many predecessors that came before it, it does the job of getting us ready for each episode without the power instruments such as Electric guitars, drums or normal guitars. It brings the message across and is a easy watch. \nGetting ready for bed and want something which is easy to understand? Monster is the anime for you. It will have you at the edge of your seat and wondering what will happen to each of the characters as the story progresses. Please give this anime a go, you might find yourself hooked. Give it ago, who knows you might like it.\n        "},

It starts out simple but the farther you go into it the more confused you will get. Don't get me wrong the show is a masterpiece but it is a dark, disturbing and confusing masterpiece that took me about a year to watch and another year to completely understand!\nStory-\nThe story is great with more plot twists then you can count. I would even go far enough to say that it has the best story in the whole entire anime world! The story is a realistic psychological one and will\n          \n        have you on the edge of your seat asking yourself time and time again what just happened. But the story is a very dark one and many viewers may be turned away by that but if you can deal with the dark tones then give the show a try. \nArt-\nThe art for this show was outstanding, everyone had that realistic look to them which added to the beauty of the show. The details were intricate and at times I forgot that I was watching anime and began to look at the show as an actual TV show with human actors. Everything here is drawn very nicely even the characters who only show up for a few episodes.\nSound-\nThe sound was enjoyable and definately went along with the tone of this anime but I didn't like the intro or the two endings. They were all really bad and just made my ears hurt especially the second ending. That was just terrible and I have absolutely no idea why the creators of the show would pick such a vile song.\nCharacter- \nThe character devolopment in this show is outstanding. Every single character in this show changes in a realistic and big way even the characters who only show up for one or two episodes.\nEnjoyment- I loved almost every minute of this show. I loved the way all the episodes weaved together near the end. I loved the characters. I loved the pace of the show which was not too fast and not too slow and I even loved the filler episodes which were beautiful and well crafted masterpieces of there own. The only problem I had in with it was the length, It was abnormally long and at times I felt like it was never going to end. And when it finaly did end I spent an entire year trying to figure out what I just watched. \nOverall- The show was amazing with few mistakes and the greatest storyline every created. Naoki Urasawa is a genius and hopefully creates another masterpiece like monster. \n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Monster manages to be predictable, cliché, uninspiring, and boring all at the same time.\nSo you see quite a few people rating this show called Monster highly but no one ever really talks about it. Eventually you figure you might as well give it a watch, heck you're in the mood for something different. The premise is unique, you reckon, especially for an anime. You prepare yourself for a 74 episode slog, thinking to yourself you're gonna have a good time.\nNope. I had a bad time. I was super disappointed by Monster.\nWhat's the opposite of subverting tropes? Because Monster does exactly that at every opportunity. It\n          \n        felt like I knew what was going to happen at all times, because the plot and cast are so stereotypical. The moment I predicted a character's line word for word in episode 5, when he was introduced not 2 minutes ago, I had to turn it off there and then.\nThe stiff animation doesn't do it any favors. It makes the characters seem very one dimensional, which they are, but at least it could have been hidden a little bit with quality animation. No such luck. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, either.\nOverall, I can't recommend Monster with a straight face. I'm unable to recall a single redeemable moment in the 5 episodes that I managed to watch before giving up. It's storytelling at its worst.\n        "},

And when I walked away, I held hands with my other self. To me, it seemed like we were the only two people in the whole world. Neither one of us possessed a real name.﻿\" -Johan Liebert\nOkay, so here we go. This is my favorite anime, for so many reasons. This anime is infamous for its villain, who is considered to be the greatest villain in any anime. But it isn't just Johan Liebert who is a great villain, but this anime is riddled with monsters. Some of\n          \n        which will deeply unnerve you. But nothing compared to Johan. Johan will make your skin crawl with fear.\nStory: 10\nIf I were to describe Monster, I would say that it is deeper and more psychological than Death Note, has an element that reminds me of The Babadook (a horror film), but doesn't have any supernatural elements in it whatsoever. And it only has one small example of science fiction. But the show follows the pursuits of Dr. Kenzo Tenma, and his struggle to do what he believes is right. \"How can the right thing be so wrong?\"\nThe main criticism of the show is its pacing, which I really enjoy. Some think that it's slow, but I feel like that's the whole point. And even in the slow points of the show, it's NEVER boring because of how interesting and intricate everything is. The villain doesn't reveal himself for a long time, so expect a bunch of character development for Tenma without seeing Johan for a while.\nThe setting of the show takes place in Germany around 1989, so that is also very unique. It really just goes to show how far Naoki Urasawa was willing to go with his extensive research in both medicine and history. I can't even imagine how long this took him. Also, there aren't any plot-holes, continuity errors, and it shies away from any and all clichés that one might expect.\nArt: 9\nThe art has a very serious and melancholy feel, which is perfect for this anime. The anime is also really old, so the animation style is pretty simplistic. It's surely not the BEST or PRETTIEST to look at, but it's perfect for the show, and it's nice to look at. Also, it has a 4:3 aspect ratio, but that personally doesn't really bother me.\nSound: 10\nDub: I personally prefer dubs, and this has such an incredible dub. All the characters sound great; even the minor ones. In addition, there is an awesome echo effect in a very important moment that is left out in the sub. Even if you don't like dubs, I'd give it a shot. Worst case scenario, you can always switch over and watch the sub.\nSub: I have seen people react to Monster subbed on YouTube, and the sub sounds nice. There is only one moment that I prefer in the sub than in the dub, and it's when one of the main characters is panicking (and the noises that they make sounds awesome and filled with emotion).\nIntro and Outros: Let's first talk about the intro. It's one of my favorite anime intros. I get chills every time the Monster logo pops up, and I love how the intro has a lot of syncopated rhythms. The intro is called Grain, and that's the perfect title for it. The first outro is called \"For the Love of Life,\" and it is instrumental in the dub, and plays on every single episode. In addition, the instrumental version has an added haunting sound in it that makes me prefer it more. The full version of the song is on YouTube, and it is beautiful, and it easily makes my favorite outro in anime, especially since the scenes in the outro are from \"The Nameless Monster.\" It gives me chills. The other outro in the sub plays during episode 33 and is called \"Make It Home.\" It is also very pretty, but doesn't have the same effect as the other one in my opinion.\nOST: The rest of the music in the anime is also gorgeous. The music that plays during scenes with Johan are horrifying. There is one in particular, however, called \"Angel Hand\" that is graceful, and not scary. It fits Johan so perfectly. It has the same melody as \"For the Love of Life.\" Everything about the soundtrack is great.\nCharacter: 10\nFor spoiler sake, I'm not going to discuss the characters that much. Just know that they are absolutely realistic. That's part of what makes the villain so terrifying. There are actually people like that out there! And Johan's story in general is just... Sad. I actually feel bad for one of the most evil characters in anime. He's my favorite anime character, too. And all the other characters, including minor ones, are EXTREMELY deep. Expect lots of beautiful and sad backstories that may even drive you to tears. This is possibly the strongest part in the show. It is how lovable and amazing the characters are.\nEnjoyment: 10\nI've only said good things about this anime in this review, so no surprises here. Every twist, turn, and emotion that this show throws at you will make you FEEL something. It's bizarre for me to think about how a fictional story can be so moving, and actually affect REAL people who view it! That's just the kind of show that this is. Very thought-provoking, especially since there is a moral gray for our main character throughout the show. Because although Tenma is a hero, there are events that make him question what really IS the right thing to do.\nOverall: 10\nAn absolute masterpiece. Watch it. It's worth spending time to watch 74 episodes. It really doesn't feel that long, considering how amazing it is. I actually didn't even want it to end. But the ending is just as beautiful and perfect as everything else in this show. This anime is so strange, because it feels so real. It's like I'm actually living through what Tenma is going through. Also, the more and more I think about this anime, the more and more I like it. This anime truly never gets old. The witches in the outro of the show remind me a LOT of Halloween, which is my favorite holiday, and also, it reminds me of Scooby Doo, which is something else I love. This anime really is timeless. I highly doubt I will ever encounter an anime that I like more than Monster. Which is sad in a way, but also relieving. Thanks to everybody for praising this anime as it deserves to be, or else I would have never known about it...\nConclusion: Humans can become whatever they want to be.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Just looking at the series of perfect tens this anime has got makes me wary to share my opinion of this show. I tried so hard to find it the perfect gem that others see it as. I really tried. \nAlso I should also preface this and say that this took me over two years to finish. I dropped it around episode 32 and picked it up again for ten episodes before dropping it once again. Now I want to say that I rarely if ever drop a show. I persevere and hope things will get better but with this show I couldn't do that.\n          \n        Over the course of this review I will try to explain why.\n'kay. A lot of you are most likely angry with me already for not engulfing this show in a three day stint so now lets see how you handle my personal opinion. Right, so, how do I say say this. The writing is bad. So bad at points I would  have to go do something else before even attempting to watch the rest of the episode.\nThe show assumes too little of the viewer. It spoon feeds the plot to us and honestly left me sighing at how some of the character reacted in certain situations. I want to say, I like the characters. They're good characters but sometimes they don't act like people. \nFor example I will use a scene from the later parts of the show. (Skip this paragraph to avoid spoilers) Man and wife enter a forest and find a dead body. Man [who has a gun] stumbles on the body first. Wife approaches and seeing the body assumes it was her hubbie who shot the man even though she was there with him the entire time and he didn't even shoot his gun. He continues to tell her it wasn't him and they ramble for a few seconds of unnecessary dialogue. It's just bad writing. There were many and more instances like this but I forced myself to tune them out.\nThe second issue I have with this show is the character Johann. From the beginning of this show they tell us how terribly evil and monstrous Johann is  and yes, while he is evil and has killed a damn lot of people, his evil nature just seems a little forced. I mean every character describes him as a monster or devil and just glimpsing him makes people quiver for no reason whatsoever. It's a little heavy handed and honestly some subtlety would have done him wonders.\nWith that said this show is still really good and with a little editing and nip tucking this show could be something truly special. This is what I am hoping the HBO adaption will do.  SO is it worth your time? It's pretty good although at times it may leave you feeling a bored.\n        "},

From the very beginning the story greatly intrigued me. I was fascinated by the corruption of Eisler Memorial Hospital and the darkness of humanity in general. It goes with a theme from \"Parasyte\", another masterpiece, that humans do things that only benefit themselves. \n     Monster is about a brilliant Japanese doctor living Germany, Kenzo Tenma. Dr. Tenma has it all: incredible skill at his work, a rich and beautiful fiancee, and a promising career at his hospital.\n     All of that is about\n          \n        to change with one critical decision that Dr. Tenma faces one night—whether to save the life of a young child or that of the town's mayor. Despite being pressured by his superiors to perform surgery on the mayor, his morals force him to perform the surgery on the young child, saving his life and forfeiting the mayor's. \n     All of a sudden, Dr. Tenma's world is turned upside down by his decision leading to the loss of everything he previously had. A doctor is taught to believe that all life is equal; however, when a series of murders occur in the vicinity of Dr. Tenma, all of the evidence pointing to the young child who he saved, Tenma's beliefs are shaken. As chief suspect of the murders, Tenma did not get an easy life. As a matter of fact, it seems that the boy he saved was much more than he had appeared to be… Now to clear his name and to correct his past mistake, Tenma must get to the bottom of these and other murders, and investigate the truth of the Monster who is behind all of this.\n     From the start, Monster intrigued millions. The series has very dark undertones, and the series is almost completely void of anything lighthearted. All of the characters have relevance in the series. The villain is absolutely terrifying. To this day, this is the only anime series that has ever given me a sense of fear because of the realism of the series as a whole. Most of the characters are developed very well, but some more than others. One can see Dr. Tenma's development from the first 3-5 episodes as he changes from the doctor he was in the first series. \n     The author is very knowledgable on everything; he really did a lot of medical research and historical research on Germany while the country was divided. \n     However, a series this good cannot be without flaws. Monster suffers from incredibly slow pacing at times, with 2-3 episodes slowing down the narrative as it removes our \"protagonist\" Tenma from the episodes completely and focuses on other characters. However, as I said previously, the characters are all very interesting, and the narrative picks up after masterfully developing them in a handful of episodes.\n"},

I feared there could be fillers or anything that could just take up the time, yet, I started watching it and the anime tiself proved me wrong.\nI watched it in one go because the story took me in immediately. It is a story connected to the people of the previous century and that includes me too. As much as I haven't lived through the reality of the time depicted in the anime, it is really nostalgic, in the good way.\nWhat I first took note\n          \n        of in the anime was the art. It gave a strong impression. The chracters are really well drawn that you can judge by their looks and facial looks what kind of people they are. That is really something difficult to achieve in animation.\nAs for the sounding, I give it a ten because it is well picked and submerges your senses completely into the story and places you right where the story takes place.\nAs for the story and characters, I give them a 9. The script, as much as there is a center figure in the plot, some episodes highlight other characters, making them the main ones for that time. I really enjoyed that because it builts the story itself and gets you into it, thus clears the picture more and more. So, as the story is mainly built by revealing the characters, I have marked them both the same. The reason I don't give them a 10 out of 10 is because even after finishing the anime, I had some questions left answered and noticed there are some events not answering to the facts. Maybe I have dismissed some facts from the plot itself or, as it is an anime made after a manga, some things have not been managed to be included in the animation.\nNevertheless, donnot let the last paragraph let your spirits down. 'Monster' is one of my favourite animes ever since, and I would reccommend it to anyone because it is worth the watch no matter what!\n        "},

I didn't like this series at all should be how I phrase it.\nThe first time it came on was on Sy-fy. Don't get me wrong.. I was glad that there was a new anime showing but I was not thrilled with it.\nI decided to give it a try, and the moment the opening came on I dropped it. I couldn't watch.

Of course I should be able to give you a good opinion on the anime by just the opening alone.\n          \n        No. I can't. I decided to watch one episode after nearly three months of it being on.. and I must say I regretted it.\nThe plot.. I had to read up on it but I can basically give you a discription.. It was boring... and un interesting. Sometimes I didn't even know why the anime was doing half the time.. and the unnecessary scenes.. Really.. this was painful. And I never thought I would hear myself say this but.. Twilight is better than this. Oh.. that was painful. The story took way to long to actually developed and dragged a great deal in places. It was like running the series in slow mo. \n I couldn't get into it no matter how hard I tried.\nThe next set was the art.

Completely unimpressed.\nThe voice actors were descent.. as far as I can tell.. but I really don't want to go into them seeing as I couldn't pay much attention with how hard I was trying to keep my nerve to watch that episode.\nThe characters.. again I rather not go into this. I found them dull.. uninteresting.. and pathetic in development. But they deserve a three for keep the series a float for others.. as for me they sunk.. and I couldn't enjoy them.\nSpeaking of my enjoyment.. as I have said.. it was like trying to read a book you couldn't stand.

Never again.. and the reason for why I dropped it. \nOverall I rate this a two. Even though I hated it to the point of saying Twilight was better, I have to remember to give a fair rating for the series.. and that is a two. I didn't like the story.. it wasn't very well developed and dragged way to many times in places.. the characters were completely uninteresting and though they provided to keep the story a float I couldn't get into them either.. the sound was descent yet I couldn't stand it sometimes.. and the art just sucked. \nI think it deserves a two.\n        "},

You will be hard pressed to find a show with such mystery and as much dark emotion as this one, it’s definitely one of those shows which just make you feel as if you’re part of the action, it’s not just something on your screen but the action is all around you. When you watch this show, you really are in a world of your own, in the world of the monster…\nMonster aired from April 2004 to September 2005\n          \n        and was produced by Madhouse. There are many themes that this show can fall under, mystery, drama, horror and physiological thriller are just a few that could be used to describe this show. As a general rule of thumb, this is a very dark show, no matter which episode you happen to be on, the darkness that overhangs the entire show will always be present and as a result you will always be expecting something major to happen during every single episode.\nAs a heads up whatever you are about to read aren’t really spoilers but just a description of how the show is set up in the first few episodes, however if you are the type of person who wishes to watch it all without knowing anything beforehand then skip ahead.\nFor the story, let’s take it from the top, the following is a brief summary of the beginning of the first few episodes and then we can take it from there. We have the main character, Dr. Tenma, a young, cheerful and very skilled neurosurgeon who is working his up the career ladder in a hospital. The hospital director notices his talent and usually gets Dr. Tenma to write his reports for him and has his own daughter engaged to him. Tenma’s skills earn him the respect of most of his colleagues, while there are still a few who are understandably jealous of his talents. One day when Tenma is on his way to operate on a Turkish man when he is called to attend to another operation on a more political figure. Tenma leaves his operation and as instructed, he attends to the politician. Afterwards, the politician survives, however the Turkish man dies and the family of the Turkish man stop Tenma in the hall and cry while saying that he could have saved the man. Tenma knows that this was true and when he asks himself why he left the operation, he is overcome by guilt. Later on in the show, the same situation crops up again. A boy shot in the head is brought in and just when Tenma is about to attend to him, he is told that the town mayor has had a heart problem. Here is the conundrum, the mayor is the man who funds the hospital and the director demands Tenma to leave the boy and operate on the mayor instead, concerned that he will not receive the funding if the mayor were to die. This time round however, Tenma decides to save the boy and while the operation to save the boy is a success, the mayor dies. All the blame is put on Tenma and he has a falling out with the director who makes it very clear Tenma can kiss his dreams goodbye since the director would no longer publish any of his reports, books or other work. Even the engagement with the director’s daughter is broken.\nLet’s stop at that for now, the big twist is to come on afterwards but for now we will analyse what has already occurred and its links with the rest of the show. Already we have seen how more mature themes of life and death, what is the right thing to do and even politics have been thrown together. The first few episodes will make you question yourself and really think about what is the right thing to do, of course it’s never easy to do the right thing and making that choice can often be a hard one. The way that all these very thick themes are mixed up and thrown right at you can be overwhelming but very pleasing. They never go overboard with it nor do they have too little excitement, the opening of monster is probably the best of any show I have seen till date. Over the course of the show, the choices the characters will make will decide what you may think of them and in some situations the right answer is not always clear. It’s worth mentioning that there are a lot of characters in this show, some come in for little cameos and most a vital to the smooth running of the show, however they all share a common trait, every single character has emotional value and you really will be able to understand them well, no matter how briefly they appear. They are all important cogs in the mystery churning machine that is monster. There are a range of feelings you will have for characters, they will range from extreme hatred and attachment to more mellow emotions such as empathy, but it’s all in a much richer sense.\nSince this anime had first been aired during 2004, the animation isn’t amazing but it’s not bad either- although sometimes when characters didn’t blink for prolonged periods of time, it certainly was disconcerting. The backgrounds were certainly detailed and since it’s mainly set in Germany, it makes for some impressive scenes. In ways the mellowness and soft undertones really help give it an old tale sort of feeling, just a personal feeling.\nMonster feels like a piece of art, the characters, the music, the animation, the story, the overarching themes- it’s all intricately pieced together and the end product is stellar. There isn’t really a very obvious soundtrack during the show since a lot of the show is driven by speech and interaction however the few sound effects spread across the show do well to build tension-which is something you can never have enough of in this show. There EDs and OP were both pretty interesting-they are nothing like what you might expect, in fact I would go as far as saying it’s an acquired taste.\nAs a final word on the story, there is never a dull moment. New characters, back stories, they are all introduced at the right time and nothing ever really feels forced. In the end, the story is really what makes you value the show, they took 74 episodes to cover everything, but every episode serves its purpose.\nNow, you still really don’t know what the twist is yet, why is this show so amazing? Again, if you don’t want to know about the first 5 or so eps then skip ahead.\nThe writers must have loved this twist. Carrying on from where we left off, the boy with a bullet in his head it turns out was brought in with his sister who has gone into shock. Their parents had been shot dead however both the children survived-the boy owes his thanks to Tenma. However when Tenma has been told he will not be the head of doctors due to the directors continued anger, he angrily goes to talk to the boy who had been shot while he lays in bed unconscious. This makes Tenma feel better and he leaves the room happy to have gotten things off his chest. Later that evening, the boy and girl have disappeared and the hospital director along with two other hospital higher ups have been killed. Tenma is suspected however there is no definitive proof to prosecute him and since he is such a kind hearted individual as many testify, he carries on life as normal. 10 years pass and then we start with Tenma, now an even more established doctor, taking a walk with one of his patients. However later on, this patient goes paranoid and makes a dash for it to escape from the hospital while he is meant to be in his room. Tenma gives chase and when he reaches him, they find themselves in a construction site. The patient seems to be scared and while Tenma tries to calm him a third character appears. At the sight of this new character, the patient gets extremely scared referencing him as a monster. Eventually, the new character shoots the man through the head, much to Tenma’s horror. It is revealed that this cold blooded serial killer is no other than the boy that Tenma had saved years ago. After the police get involved, they re-open the case with Tenma from years ago and as events transpire, Tenma finds himself a wanted man on the run, in a fight for survival. As the story progresses we really start to understand who the so called monster is and every arc has its own beauty.\nTenma had unknowingly saved the monster as a child, now will the monster come back to bite…\nWelcome to the wonderful tale that is “Monster”.\nTukky12\n        "},

I thought the same thing, but even more crazy is that it's still a good show of interesting characters and idea. Let me tell you about this monster of a long show, \nThe story is about the kind Christian Dr Tenma in his life where nothing goes right and he ends up medically revive a very evil person by accident, the devil Yohan Liebert. Yohan goes around committing murders and manipulating people, framing Tenma for them. Tenma must chase him down and find out just what\n          \n        the heck is going on. Along the way he finds a guy who thinks he's the Incredulous Hulk, the twin sister of Yohan who can never hit anything because she's a girl, and a little kid nobody likes because this show isn't four kids anyway. Sorry but it is true!\nIts a good story because Tenma and Yohan are such opposits in character, but there are parts buried in both of them that make you question. You see many sides of everybody. Where things go wrong is that this show is long and takes long to focus on people you do not need to know or care about. Nothing really happens for about 30 episodes. They just make scared faces when something evil happens, and never ever shoot Yohan or Tenma. The Incredulous Hulk is not one of them, I really liked seeing him in this show! The kid just plays with a ball, maybe good part of the show for weirdos. Also, there is a fat doctor who shouldn't be a doctor and sends the wrong message about doctors. Its them police that are fat not doctors!\nThe art in this show is not very good. Everyone has weird, small eyes and strange looking nose. There are more ugly people in this show than in even the most incest parts of the world! Everyone is out of shape or strange looking, except Yohan. I guess the makers watched the Adam Sandler movie You Don't Mess With The Yohan! I am kidding, but they really dont mess with his looks.\nThe sound is forgettable except that opening is gorgis and I cant get enough of it. Its beautiful and haunting. Really gets you into the time for a psycho mistery thriller!\nOverall if you dont mind putting time into it and looking at ugly characters this show is a great ride filled with a lot of turns, just not so many twists! It's crazy how much both Tenma and Yohan grow and its so dark I just can't spoil anything here!\n\n"},

I'm not a slow watcher either. But it took me roughly 5 months to finish this show.  While it may be a long show with 74 episodes, there are still plenty of animes that surpass that number far into the triple digits. So I definitely think there is a disconnect between quality vs. quantity when comparing Monster to other long animes. The problem with long animes is that they\n          \n        lose themselves. They become too complicated, too drawn out, or even looses its plot direction. For whatever reason, long animes are usually not considered the \"cream of the crop\" so to say. Although, there are exceptions to this rule and Monster happens to be one of them.\nMonster is complicated. It toys with your morals. It tests your intelligence. It appeals to your emotions then rips those attachments away. It's not afraid to show you a shitty world.  \nAnd it's not afraid to do all of these things because it respects the viewers as being capable to accept all that. Which honestly, makes me respect this show a whole damn lot. \nI read somewhere once that questioned \"who was the monster?\"\nMy immediate answer is Johan. But the more I watched the show the more my answer became unclear. Maybe everyone is a monster in their own right? who knows?\nBut this anime expressed this statement, this question, in such a way that was thrilling, and climactic. The story telling is absolutely phenomenal.\nMonster is truly Ursawa's magnum opus. "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Monster is truly a masterpiece of the highest caliber. One of the great things that this show is able to accomplish is delivering such a complicated and fantastic story through its daunting 74 episodes. Don't be put off by its length Monster is beautiful, frightening, and it makes you think. If your idea of anime is the \"flavor of the month\" or typical MOE bullshit with cute girls being so perfect and adorable this show is not for you. Monster deals with heavy themes like frightening aspects of humanity, the meaning of life, and nature vs nurture.  \nIn the meaning of life aspect Monster\n          \n        heavily discusses throughout the series \"Are all lives created equal?\" Dr. Tenma (lead character) abides by the Hippocratic Oath (as all good doctors should). He is not interested in personal wealth or financial gain as the hospital director is which brings upon his (director) downfall early on in the series. Dr. Tenma is and always will be focused on operating on the patient in most need first rather than the wealthiest or most influential patient, which the director of the hospital does not like. The director wants to save whoever will bring the best reputation to the hospital and who will bring them the most prestige. Dr. Tenma says all lives are created equal to Johan in their first personal encounter in Episode 4 while Johan thinks humans are weak and pathetic he claims, \"Most of this universe is 'death' anyway,\" and that to the universe, \"most lives are just specks in a corner of the earth, gone in a flash.\" This is where the terms \"Are all lives really equal?\" \"Does life have meaning?\" are brought up in the series many times throughout.\nIn nature vs nurture theme it is believed that Johan's experiences in 511 Kinderheim (Spoiler Alert Skip ahead to next paragraph if you don’t want to be spoiled!!!) and seeing the children and staff kill each other while he watched made him evil and empty to the core. He lost his human side and only witnessed evil in the world, never has he witnessed love. He also experienced the one person he loved (his sister Nina) being taken away from him for a long time to the red rose mansion while his mother dressed him up as his sister to hide them from the authorities. The mother’s tricks were eventually found out by the authorities. It is believed the mother did not like Johan and only liked Nina. After Nina was taken away Johan was abandoned as a child by his mother and left to rot all by himself at the three frogs building. All his life he felt unloved and when his sister tried to kill him he lost it. While his sister experienced horrific things in the Red Rose Mansion as well she turned out normal. So the question is was Johan evil by nature or was he nurtured to be evil?\nThe story is sublime and its premise is amazing. What follows in the story is 74 episodes of Dr. Tenma's search to find the boy he saved, and to fix his mistake. Dr. Tenma meets some of the most interesting characters you could find in any show. These characters feel and act incredibly human, they display human faults, they act on impulse rather than thought, and their subplots with all their faults and emotions truly make this universe of Monster memorable and unforgettable. Dr. Tenma's journey throughout to bring Johan to justice and search for him furthers the question: Who is Johan Liebert, and what are his plans? Johan and Dr. Tenma are some of the most memorable characters in my opinion at least. While every other character has their flaws Johan seems flawless throughout the series. He’s beautiful, he’s smart, meticulous, ingenious, secretive, and does evil deeds without lifting a finger. He’s not Freddy, he’s not Jason, and he’s real. That’s what makes him scarier than many other anime villains. A man in the series describes him as a “Beast with seven heads” and Hans Georg Schuwald envisioned Johan as a demon from hell when he trapped dozens of people in a burning library at Schuwald’s book donation ceremony.\n Johan also can look at a person and exploit their weakness just by looking at them and driving themselves mad or into suicide. Johan possesses many psychopathic traits. There is also Inspector Lunge with his ignorance to Johan’s existence and to just lock up Dr. Tenma for all this because it seems like the easiest answer to solve the crimes going on in Germany and his extreme devotion to crime solving. He also likes to arrive at a crime scene and reenact it like the killer would step by step, that’s what makes him such a great detective his ability to think like a killer, and his devotion to his job. Is he obsessed to the point of unhealthiness? Possibly, but his flaws make him an incredibly realistic detective, smart, cunning, arrogant, but with flaws within and in his personal life. Grimmer and Roberto two childhood friends who survived 511 Kinderheim and both turned out completely different. Hence brings back the theme of Nature vs Nurture. There are many other memorable characters which I did not list because listing all of them would take thousands of words to describe and name. The story is incredibly deep and realistic and the historical background in it (subsequent Nazi Germany and its relations with Czechoslovakia) and even the creation of the Aryan super race as part of Nazi ideology. Those great backgrounds, combined with the story of Johan and Anna make it one of the best stories ever told in animation.\nThe art is extremely detailed in the show. All the characters have different sized noses, ears, eyes, body shape they all look and feel incredibly human. They portrayed post-communist Germany and Czech Republic very well with all the different local buildings and city sites. It is truly a remarkable piece of art. The soundtrack is executed with use of violins, trumpets, the piano, and guitar being put to full use. Go on YouTube and look up the song “Seeds of Time,” this song usually plays when something dramatic is about to happen and it usually plays when Johan is plotting something terrible or doing something evil. The closing credits song “Angel hand” makes you feel in its two minute run time that you died and ascended into heaven and “Close your eyes” reminds me heavily of  1500s Italian/German renaissance music with the female singer singing in different time and rhythm than the woodwind playing below it. “What do I see” plays when (Spoiler Alert!!) Johan tries to murder everyone in the library. It will send chills down your spine and make you quiver in fear when being used in the show. The soundtrack really adds to the dramatic effect of the scene making it even more intense than it would be with just a generic soundtrack (I’m looking at you Marvel Movies).\nOverall, my enjoyment for the series was immensely high. Did monster have some flaws? Yes, it could have been cut down I feel by about 10-15 episodes but was it enjoyable? Absolutely, it made me think differently than any show I have ever seen. It made me cry, it made me laugh, and it made me shook (Mobb Deep reference). It was an emotional roller coaster throughout and it will change how you think about things in a deeper sense. It will also change how you perceive anime as a whole. Monster is one of the pinnacles of human achievement put through an animation medium and I am truly grateful and humbled to have been born in an age where masterpieces such as this show exist. It truly makes me marvel at the fascinating things that humanity has achieved when I watch this show, along with composers such as Beethoven, Wagner, and Chopin. The most interesting aspect of the anime to me was that \"human beings can become anything” which Johan proved by masterfully corrupting the best of us to do unspeakable things. But as a light in the darkness, many characters also chose to act against their former agendas to make a difference in the end even if it meant sacrificing themselves. This anime is very good dubbed as well as subbed so that is a bonus to it as well. This is an anime I highly recommend seeing before you die because it is that good. Some things maybe good but not many things are great. This show is greatness with all the themes, immense atmosphere, great artwork, and fantastic story which will suck you in even with its great length. This ranks up there with Wagner’s Ring Cycle as one of the greatest dramas ever told it is that good. Go watch it now!\n        "},

There are no twists, no super powers, you have a raw human doing work with his mouth, and getting actions done through words. This anime is a testimony to the idea that words have power, not just action. The sheer power of this anime is overwhelming, and I am quite prideful to admit that it has changed my life.\nThe very first aspect I noticed whilst watching this anime was that the art was drawn different. It was serious. There were no funny faces as seen in typical anime, it\n          \n        was straight faces with actual facial expression. Though, the art is a lie, and that is the twist. Nice faces may be the most despicable minds, Johan Liebert is a testimony to that. Personally, I watched this show in dub rather than sub, and found the sound quality to be quite the feet. It was simply one of the best sound crew I had witnessed to my ears. Captivating. Eerie.\nI decided to brush up on the less minor (but still 10/10) features of this anime in order to get to the meat. If one was to explain the story in simple terms, it would be impossible. A single sentence could explain the story from beginning to end, but the person who had heard that single sentence could not begin to grasp the true complexity within the words. Simplicity is a synonym to complexity in this anime. The many twists and turns that are witnessed all align. One scene may be linked to another many episodes down the road. Unfortunately, the aspect this anime seems to lack is putting the finishing touches. The conclusion was injustice to the watcher; after watching 74 episodes, you are not left with a sweet, savoring taste, but rather a bitter-sweet taste. A non-conclusive ending. Plus, this anime seems to take the matter of reputation quite lightly, simply clearing up the protagonists suspicions in one foul swoop at the end. However, those two are the only negatives. For 1,480 minutes of watching, only two flaws were found. \nThe characters make up the anime. Monster is not Monster without a 10 out of 10 in \"Character.\" Character is the dependent factor for story. Character is the dependent factor for enjoyment. Art and sound strengthened character. Through one of anime's best villains, Johan Liebert, this anime is an instantaneous breakthrough from all other anime. All characters are shown to be realistic, and that is what sets the anime apart. Every single character can be a man or woman near you in this world, it is that surreal.  The characters perfectly represent the true colors of the world.\nI am proud to admit that this anime is my favorite anime of all time.\n        "},

It is a magnificently animated magnum opus for it's creator, Naoki Urasawa, with monster, I not only got an emotional experience bordering on Vonnegut levels, but an intellectual workout worthy of a Kafka novel. The artistic style and animation reek of an insular paranoia, it expands and contracts and breaths with it's magnificent display of darkness and the occasional rare moment of light. The anime can move you to tears and to the darkest places of sadness, and to the most spiraling, towering, wonderful moments of happiness. The anime tenses and contracts, pulling\n          \n        you along with it, straight into the depths of an abyss darker then the blackest of nights. The real treat though, is the story, which is dark, grueling and merciless. It pulls no punches, and slams the watcher right in the face with it's aggressive darkness and voluminous intelligence that is carefully calculated and deviously arranged into an experience that hurts and has beauty of it's own caliber hidden within it. Monsters characters are unique, multidimensional and amazing all in their own right. The main villain of Monster is so magnetic, it's absolutely frightening. He is an amazing and alluring darkness, that creates such a contrast with the heroes good nature and willingness to help, that when they are together on the screen, you cannot help but feel like two epic powers are squaring off in the room. It makes every battle ever fought in DBZ seen paltry in comparison. The emotions you feel with every scene pummel you, until every time you see a character, your heart pounds with concern for them, and if a character is hurt or is feeling emotional pain, you feel pain with them. That is another amazing thing about this amazing series, the connection that you feel with the characters is so close, that it's almost as if you know them as close personal friends. Watching them struggle is like watching a friend struggle, and it's equally as painful to watch, even more so when you know you are cannot help them. Seeing them overcome obstacles is even more incredible and inspiration, and lifts you out of your worry for the characters and into the happiness of knowing a friend has overcome trouble in their life. I loved this show, I enjoyed every precious second of it. I would watch it again, and it would still have the same amazing impact. This show is amazing, amazing in every way, amazing down to the last line of the drawing. I cannot heap enough praise onto this amazing show, so i'll just settle with this: This is the best anime ever made. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless Monster. He was dying to have a name, so the Monster made up his mind to set out on a journey to look for one … At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone around to call him by it.\" As his protagonist and antagonist, Naoki Urasawa's Monster is highly intelligent and fascinating. The characters are complex and believable, the dark style in animation fits the tone of the story and its progression which could be described as a downwards spiral from a seemingly bright place into\n          \n        a pitch black abyss. And so it's only logical that one of the series' main question is, how long can you look into that abyss until it looks back right into you? This is the story of protagonist Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a brilliant and promising neurosurgeon, who could have it all if he could compromise his values just a little bit and try to fit into the superficial, ignorant, but pretty comfortable world around him some more. He cannot (or does not want to) do that anymore and, following his values and principles rather than the instructions of his superiors, decides to rescue a badly injured little boy rather than a wealthy and influential politician, loosing his status, privileges, fiancé and future in the process. Little did he know that what he perceived to be an act of principle and morality (after all, aren't all lives created equal?) would not only cost him deeply career wise, but would literally come back and haunt him in person, as that little boy was and will become an even worse sociopath and serial killer who would set out to murder dozens of innocent people. Tenma, feeling responsible for saving the boy who would otherwise have died and been unable to kill all those people, sets onto a quest to right his wrong, knowing he will loose everything and likely himself in the process. Doing so he is being hunted by the police for crimes not be, but that very boy committed. On his journey he discovers things better left undiscovered, as this monstrous boy, now grown into a young, beautiful and deeply frightening man, is a man-made monster with a rather horrifying past and history.\nThe themes and questions asked in the series are for an 18+ audience: Are some people just born or predestined to become monsters, or are we really all innocent and equal in the beginning? If so, what does it take to irreversibly destroy a person's soul and create the ultimate monster? Can anyone be turned into a monster, or are some people untouchable by evil? And if a monster was not born, but created, does that really justify forgiveness for his actions? Are we allowed to feel pity for such a monster, forgive him even, or is there a darkness where there is no coming back from, where it does not matter anymore how the darkness was created originally? Are we responsible for everything we do, or to what extent? And does one have to become a monster in order to be able to defeat one? The series does explore these questions in a very adult manner. The characters are very believable in their motives, actions as well as inactions. Tenma's journey from the gentle, selfless, compassionate, and caring doctor to the homeless, hunted, lonely outlaw (fantastically shown in the character design), his struggle to end a life, even if it might safe countless more, is more than touching. What annoys me in so many books and movies (the good and morally untouchable protagonist being unable to do what's necessary, leading to even more innocent people getting hurt), this problem was nonexistent for me in Monster, as we get to know and care deeply for the characters and their motivations, main ones or sidekicks. While deeply wishing for the monster to die, I found myself urging Tenma not to do it.\nFinal Verdict : 8,5/10\nOnly because it sometimes got a little bit too repetitive for me and some of the flashbacks and foreshadowing built up expectations that didn't hold up to what we got to see and experience in the end\n        "},

As the years pass though, the doctor comes to regret his decision, as that boy turns out to be a psychotic murderer. Well, a bit more complicated than that, Johann (the boy) himself never murders anyone, but instead uses his charm to manipulate people into killing each other, committing suicide etc etc. Doctor Tenma decides to correct his mistake, by killing the boy he saved years ago himself, giving up on his career\n          \n        and becoming a fugitive to hunt him. Countless subplots happen while he's on his journey, with various characters he meets developing, some of them reaching a grimly fate, while others fight their own personal struggles and demons.\nIs it well-written? Amazingly so. Is it realistic? I don't think I've ever seen any anime more realistic. Is it well-animated? For its time yes, it is still good to look at. So what's not to like?\nJesus f@cking Christ it drags on FOREVER. Yes, all characters go through their \"arc\" and become \"tragic figures\" of their own, but I want you to put the emphasis on \"all\".  When an anime runs for 74 episodes a very considerable cast is gathered, and we explore every single one. It soon gets VERY tiresome, especially in an anime like this that's so grounded in realism. Because people, reality CAN be boring. I know I often complain about lack of realism in animes but this goes all the way to the other direction. It's BORING, TIRESOME, UNBEARABLE, TORTUROUS EVEN!\nIt's a shame really. This is a gem by all means. Except it's a gem for people with unreasonably large amounts of patience. Perhaps I wouldn't be so harsh on it if it was 24-25 episode but SEVENTY FOUR? Come on! Pretty much all of my rate stats are 8+ but the enjoyment factor is an unforgiving, merciless \"1\".\nPros\n-Everything except the length.\nCons\n-It drags on foreeeever and eeeeever.\n-Rewatchability: Absolute 0."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The premise of the story itself, that a noble, well meaning doctor chose to save the life of a child with a fatal gunshot to the head instead of a powerful person only to find out the child he saved was a sociopath who killed his parents himself and instructed his own sister to shoot him had me pulled in immediately. I finished the whole show in just a few days and have watched it several times over with friends and family. I love that this anime is so mature in the realness of the fiction. Nothing magical or supernatural happens in the story. Except\n          \n        for maybe Mr Grimmer's badass mode. :P\nThe symbolism all throughout the story of the nature of the human spirit and the characters who represented different aspects of the human condition was so well done. The story's process goes plot progress --> character development --> plot progression --> character development and it's so well done. Every arc brings us new people who we are given a chance to get to know. And every arc brings new revelations about the monster.\nThe overall message of the story however is actually pretty simple, it's a story about the mind of a sociopath and why ordinary people don't get overtaken by darkness. And the reason is hedonistic pleasure and meaningful relationships to your fellow man. Love and fun. It's a beautiful story that anyone should enjoy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is a masterpiece. Every single bit of it. Easily my favorite anime of all time and the first one I recommend to people. They are always hooked when I explain the beginning of the plot, which I feel like isn't explained well enough in the summary page (but for good reason, as it does give away the first few episodes). You really need to make it in about six episodes to fully understand what's going on and get hooked. \nThe characters are so beautifully drawn and complex. There are no two characters that look alike. You can gleam a lot about a character's personality\n          \n        just by their face, eyes, stance, and expression. How many other animes can you say that about? Very careful and precise care was taken designing these characters. You can even tell what beautiful characters have ugly or cold souls just by looking at the way their eyes are drawn. The attention to detail is the best I've ever seen in any anime. None of that \"every character looks the same except for the hair.\"\nThe plot is complex and compelling. The mystery gets darker and more complex the further it goes. The protagonist gets more and more jaded as the story goes on. His appearance changes subtly. The clothes he wears, his facial hair, his eyes, his hair, everything. He starts out so innocent and nice and he slowly changes to the point where if you put the picture of before and after next to each other, they look like different people. It is subtle, but incredible that the creator managed to do that.\nIf you're a fan of dark, serious animes, this is for you. It uses no cheap tricks to terrify you. Gore is pretty minimal. It's mostly psychological and I think that is so much scarier.\n        "},

The story is very involved and deep and actually makes you care about the outcome. Of course the main character kenzo is amazing and easily liked. The show itself is a thriller and involves many characters and side plots that are each unique and enjoyable on its own. It has a strong sense of good and evil and good vs evil. Morals, and the grey area's are all here. It is softhearted, a warm anime, but also dark, and depressing. It even had me tearing up\n          \n        near the end. I can say every character here is amazing. It has a very real feel to it as it is something that can feel like it happened in real life. granted, some episodes are just boring and it starts off a little slow but ive watched it three times and it never gets old to me. I highly recommend this anime(fun fact: a cat just jumped on my laptop) to anyone. It deals alot with crime of course so its good if you like that kind of stuff. Crime novels and such that is.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster is one of those animes that will make the watcher go to the edge of their seat. It's a game of cat and mouse really, and it can end in a way you never thought imagined. This anime was recommended by a friend of mine who kept saying how incredibly unpredictable and unique it is. It dwells deep into the human mind and can let show people how dark someone's mind can really be. It's this psychological mystery horror that can show the same event happening in real life. \nStory/Setting: \nSet in post-cold war and in Germany none the less was a definite change.\n          \n        It was the fact that we got to have a insight into the lives of Germans and ever mid-Europeans back in the 1990's. The watcher got to see the way everyone acted, how some lived, the technology they may have had, and the clothes they wore. A anime being set in Germany was a great risk for Naoki, and he did exceptionally well and succeeded fully. Even so, the atmosphere of several of the small towns would've been enough to pull the watcher into the plot like hypnosis.\nThe story is the same- different. The mystery and suspenseful scenes really opened up to the darkness of this tale, and we got to see how a proper crime story is folded out. There are a lot of subplots in the story, but they all tie together like a perfect puzzle at the end of it all. It's a shock to realize how different this story is from everything else out there. How every little detail that is shown, every line, every clue all leads down to an unexpected showdown. The normal was established quickly and the watcher got immediate action with several of the characters in the first episode. Naoki didn't hesitate to start the suspense early by using the dialogue as leverage. It truly is a unique plot. \nArt:\nThe animators really stayed true to Naoki's style and brought a realistic form into the anime world. Who said anime characters have to be big-ed eyed, colourful-haired drawings? This show really did well to maintain the human realism design in the characters. The background and the towns of the Germany brought the atmosphere of creepiness into the show, and gave the feeling of not being alone, real. The art is truly a masterpiece of it's own. \nSound: \nWatching it in dubbed didn't drag away how incredible this show is. Even the English voice actors did well to maintain the characters and didn't let it slip from the watchers fingers. The emotion these actors put into the voices made the dubbed successful. \nThe sounds of music and the natural background noises opened up the tension and creepiness of the plot. The gun shots, rain, and the beginning and closes songs really did show the watcher what this show can really be. \nDark. \nCharacter:\nNot only were these characters impressive, but they really did give a sneak peek into something that can happen in real life. \nWhen someone hears the word \"doctor\", they think of someone who saves lives. But what about a doctor who is out to kill? Unique, right? Naoki has given the watcher something to watch by giving a doctor a dark side. Tenma, Kenzo is a character who has gone beyond the limits of what a doctor can do, by no only saving lives, but taking them away. He is one of the best protagonist out there and is almost like a superhero in a way. Naoki has even kept the Japanese feel alive by making Tenma, Japanese, and giving him everything the watcher looks for in a character.\nJohan was a character that gave the show a purpose. This mysterious guy can give the watcher a headache with everything he does. He is a one of a kind, high class serial killer that puts him high on antagonist list. Through his innocent and menacing expression there is no telling what this guy is thinking, but he puts the psychological piece into this puzzle and gives the title: Monster something to talk about. \nThis is an anime where stereotypes are non-existent. Naoki has opened a new door into characterization and developing these amazing characters into possible real life people. The supernatural aspect of these characters are somehow unknown and make people wonder after all of this, how dark someone's mind can get. \nOverall/ Enjoyment:\nCrime/mystery isn't my forte which is a reason why I didn't enjoy this anime as much as I wanted to. However, it did go above and beyond my expectations and limits. With the fantastic tension building scenes to the perfect paced episodes this anime is not a disappointment. It has shown that everyone has a dormant monster, one that sometimes wakes up and causes chaos where we may be. Everyone has a dark side, and through this chilling tale, it shows how dangerous the human race can really be. \nI give this epic tale a A+ or 98% on the Monster scale. \n        "},

It centers around a doctor named Kenzo Tenma who's considered the best neurosurgeon  in the hospital one day he's forced to choose between saving the mayor or a young boy who has been shot in the head. \nIt starts out pretty simple but as you go on\n          \n        it becomes very complex\nArt: 9\nThe art for this series is very realistic, it's not the best but it perfectly fits the show. What I like about it is that you could tell each character and where their from, the German characters look German, Turkish characters look Turkish . Unlike many anime each character looks distinctive, you'd easily be able to tell them apart. \nSound: 8.5\nthere's not much to say, again it's great and it fits the show perfectly  but not the best. When watching an anime I don't focus much on music..\nCharacters: 10/10\nFirst I'm gonna talk about the main character, Kenzo Tenma, he starts off as a somewhat naive person who's happy with his life, he's liked by everyone and is engaged to the hospital director's daughter. I normally don't like the \"goody two shoes\" type of main characters but he's just so well written and it's easy to connect with him. Also the character development that he goes through is one of the best in anime or tv shows in general. One of the best main characters. \nNina Fortner/ Anna Liebert is the main villain's twin sister, she's the second main character of this show. She's first introduced as a kid in shock duo to witnessing her family being shot. Later on it's revealed that she has amnesia because of what she's been through as a child. Again, very well written and her character development is amazing. She's not the \"bad ass female character that kicks ass\" nor is she a damsel in distress, instead she's just a smart, independent woman like almost all the female characters in this series. \nJohan Liebert is the main villain and you could say, \"Monster\" of the series. If there's one thing you've heard about Monster it's the villain, Johan, and honestly for good reason. I won't say much about him because literally everything about him is a spoiler. Naoki Urasawa outdone himself with this character, the details, the dialogue. A very complex and well written character.\nI'm only gonna talk about these three 'cause these are pretty much the most important and there's alot of other characters. But I will say this all of the secondary characters are outstanding minus Carl, Lotte, Schuwald and that lawyer they weren't bad they were just okay. It's amazing how characters that only appear like an episode or two can have double the amount of character development of other show's main characters, and their like 100+ eps long..\n\nOverall: 10/10\nOne of the best not only in anime. Imo, it deserves all the praise and hype it's getting. With all that being said I don't recommend this show to the lighthearted and there's also alot of politics \nIf you're looking for something that's long and has alot of depth, then you should watch it\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    This was the first time where I entered the realistic side of anime. Prior to watching this I saw a lot of animes that had power-ups, transformations, and really just a bunch of non-realistic shit(not complaining tho). Monster was all about realism, realistic characters, realistic conflicts, and a realistic story. I felt it was best to watch it dubbed since it took place in Europe and after watching the whole series here's what I thought.\nStory:9/10\nVery complex and beautiful. Since this was also a thriller, it was very suspenseful and contained a lot of dark moments. It heavily revolves around morality issues and coercive human condition\n          \n        that gives the series an incredible tone and give interest to its audience for people who don't much of the dark side of humanity. The story also had great conflict. It does however, lose a point for its slow pacing.\nArt:8/10\nDue to it being released in the mid 2000s the animation isn't gonna wow anyone today. It was however very good for what it was given. For one it had a nice cinematic quality to it and gave a good grim atmosphere. Another thing it did well was the use of facial expressions as they were realistically portrayed to match the tone of the series.\nSound:8/10\nOne of the best dubs Ive seen so far. The actors brought a lot of emotion to their characters. Although I wasn't crazy about the soundtrack, it was very acceptable. The background music was used very well especially during suspense and it has a very good opening theme. The one thing that bother however was that it wasn't very versatile plus there weren't a lot of tracks.\nCharacter:9/10\nSuperb characterization and great development. Dr. Tenma made a great protagonist becuz we cared deeply for him. One of the show's biggest standouts was its main villain. What made this villain so great was the enormous impact he played on Tenma, plus the villain had amazing charisma and great at manipulating other people making him a HUGE threat in the series. I conduct a point here cuz there were some side characters that didn't feel relevant to the plot. They instead hinder ploy progression which was one of the main reason why its storyline had a slow pace.\nFinal Verdict\nDue to its slow pacing this is one series that u have to be patient with. But this is still a MUST watch anime becuz the characters and storyline are very worth watching. Plus it shows that anime in general can handle realism very well. Monster is imo one of the best thrillers ive ever seen and highly recommend this one to all fans."},

He believes that no matter what he lost to save the life of the small boy, he will never stop from being what a real doctor should be.

The suspect flees from the hospital one night, and Tenma chases after him. Only to find that the man who hired the suspect, is  Johan. The small boy who disappeared 9 years ago, now reveals that he was the one who killed the hospital director and the 2 doctors, 9 years ago.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Often lauded as a masterpiece, Monster is a gripping thriller which follows the carnage caused by the psychopathic villain Johan Liebert. And in the same way that Johan toys with his victims, the show dances around its audience. Truth is doled out in driblets, a whiff here and a taste there. In short, Monster is a show that should have spanned 40 episodes, yet is stretched over almost double that length.\nThat is not to say that Monster feels especially slow. It has no fillers. In fact, there's nary a moment without tension and fraught drama, even if it must be forced into a scene. If\n          \n        a character's life is in danger, she may sprint away from the safety of a crowded area to a nicely secluded one. Just as a crucial bit of information is about to be revealed, somebody interrupts. And as noted in many reviews, when there is a gunshot, the scene will often cut away so the audience has to wait to know what happened.\nBalancing out these artificial elements is the organic character-driven drama which is ultimately what carries Monster to its finish. The protagonists writhe and struggle. Each has his own agenda and way of thinking, and when a character dies, it is abundantly clear how high the stakes are. Even if some plot elements are absurd and clearly used for emotional manipulation, these characters keep the show grounded.\nAs it wades through underworld of central Europe, the show introduces many interesting and mature themes which are far from the common anime fare. Racial elitism and social experimentation come to the fore, along with questions of good and bad, right and wrong. And of course there are the ideas of justice, atonement, and redemption.\nWhile the strong characters and themes compensate for many of the show's small irritants (such as the fact that the wanted criminal Dr. Tenma never changes his appearance or name), I found a few decisions to be particularly frustrating. First, the protagonists are indecisive at the most critical moments. It's fine to struggle through certain decisions, but once the choice is made, it is hard to watch their resolve waver when it is needed most.\nSecond, the show is fixated on childhood trauma. This is a common trope in anime, and I understand that these particular characters suffered in Soviet brainwashing centers, but I don't need to know how many meals they were served. Knowing that the villain Johan is a mass murderer, is it really necessary to psychoanalyze his favorite children's books? Lastly, the ending was unsatisfying. As if 74 episodes were not enough to address everything, the series closes with asking new questions.\nIn terms of artwork, Monster is nothing to be envied. The washed out colors portray a bare and dreary world, and the majority of the runtime is spent talking with the two-frame wagging jaws.\nMonster is a show which grasps at greatness. It is riveting, a true psychological thriller which doesn't rely on violence or gore to compel its viewership. I found it a good anime and worth watching. Ultimately, though, it suffers from systemic flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece. \nOverall: 7/10\n        "},

From the first scene to the last, this anime makes perfectly sense. No loose ends that ends up giving you a heavy mindfuck. And the way everything in the anime is connected or becomes a part of the whole thing is just fantastic. A master piece.\nThe animation is good and goes well together with the storyline. It’s perfect for this story, but for some the animation can seem a bit \" out washed \" or dull, but the way the story is\n          \n        animated is just perfect for a story like this.\nThe sound is good. The music, the background music and the voice actors ( which all did a fantastic job! ) makes the whole thing very dramatic. All the voices are synchronized very well and fit very well with their characters and nothing is out of synch.\nAll the characters are very fit to their roles. I will ( of course ) not reveal anything about the characters and their behaviour, but as with everything else in the anime, it just fits perfectly. It happens that the story changes protagonist, but these new protagonists always become a part of Tenma’s journey.\nEnjoyment was immense. There was not a single moment of boredom or where I fell asleep because nothing happened. I just loved how everything was so dramatic. The scenses were all perfect. You can almost feel the atmosphere when the drama becomes really intense. It’s just incredible enjoyment. I enjoyed EVERY episode, EVERY scene till the end.\n\nOverall, I can recommend this anime to those who watched and liked Death Note. But those anime viewers that want a dramatic journey.., just watch it, if you like drama. Seriously. You will not be disapointed. Everything, the sound, story, animation and so on. All these make Monster one of the best animes.\nWatch it, you will not regret it..\n        "},

After a few episodes, i craved for it, like a addiction. This anime is a anime that you must fully understand if you want to get all of its story. You may want to watch this twice, or even more... because if you watch it a first time, and then a second time.. you question yourself saying... wow! i didn't know this... well yeah... if your going on a anime marathon, don't watch this... watch it slowly, and try to gain the understanding of\n          \n        the story... especially at the last 20 episodes, you start asking what did that mean, what does this mean... anyways now to my specific reviews...\nStory\nThe story was marvelous, DONT spoil yourself and read the spoilers!!! It slowly builds you up, and builds you (slowly of course), its never like.. oh wow and then another episode oh theres no story.. its like a FULL run of a video, and was never edited..well it felt like that... and then it brings you the greatest scenes... then it starts slowing down.. but its not a bad thing.. when it starts declining in intensive action, it brings a  huge TWIST... well it was a twist for me.. this whole anime has twists like no other... trust me.. the story is 10/10!!\nArt\nThe art was pretty good, they didn't go cheap and make crappy scenes... and art.. it was that spectacular like other animes... but since this is a more serious dark tone of a anime... the art was famulous! 9/10\nSound\nHonestly, the sound for me just wasn't that amazing... it was like any other anime...  6/10 (fair ...not that bad.. it was decent)\nCharacter\nWoah, the characters in this anime are really, really good! They stay true to their role, and they don't become like a helpless character... if they are bad ass, they stay bad ass, if they are good, they stay good... the characters progress like the story... it has a good flow... it really is awesome.. i would have wrote more, but it would be huge spoilers... 9/10\nEnjoyment\nI enjoyed this anime, i plan to watch it a second time in a few years... It really is worth watching a couple of times.. i don't say this often either.. only a few 10 can get on my (watch again) list... But i hoped there was more action, they prepared for it too... but too less.. i guess its because they wanted to provide you more story.. a rich story :)  ... 9/10\nOverall\nWell, this anime was quite long, and it was well worth it... i would highly suggest this anime to anyone who wants a serious type of anime that is a bit psycological.. and a bit more of a mature side... honestly there ins't much to say.. i know my review was quite short to others and not that clear.. but heres probably the best thing i've said in this review.. go watch the anime gogogoogo!\n\n"},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    I'm no critic, so just consider this my opinion and nothing more\nBeing a 74 episode show, the plot of this show is bound to get complicated, and it most definitely is. Never \"confusing\", but it is a somewhat deep story as far as just how much is involved in it. If you enjoy mystery, this will most DEFINITELY be your cup of tea, it most definitely was mine. However, I've heard many people call the story \"slow paced\", and it really, REALLY is. This isn't just a slow burn, this is a sloooooooooooww burn, and I'd be lying if I said that it didn't drag\n          \n        at times. There is some semblance of filler in this anime as well, with I'd say about 30% of the episodes focussing on side stories and characters. These fillers are definitely enjoyable, and build on the world and atmosphere nicely, but if you're someone who just likes to \"get to the point\", this may irritate you at times. Of course the story has many twists and turns and is very good at keeping you guessing, which is of course the point of a mystery. Because of how well the story is written, it even managed to make me overlook some of the leaps in logic it took occasionally.\nThe art in Monster is somewhat unique, in that it goes out of it's way to avoid every anime art cliche. No huge eyes, bright colours, or chibi here. The colour palette is gritty, lots of greys and browns and dark blues, fitting the gritty tone, and the animation is solid throughout. The character designs are more realistic than conventional anime, and translate very well to real life. You can imagine how these characters would look like in real life, and as a result makes them easier to care about and root for.\nAs far as music goes, it's dark and atmospheric. Dark strings, sombre opera singing, even hard edged guitars all keep the atmosphere and tone consistent throughout the show, it always works. Nothing is outright catchy, but both the opening and ending are quite beautiful and captivating. Just an overall very well done soundtrack that fits the show like a glove.\nIf there were one area where Monster suffers slightly, it is in the characters. First off, Monster is VERY good at making you like and care about it's characters. I found myself becoming attached to one-off, episodic characters because they were just written so well. It is in part thanks to the slow pace, that we spend so much time  with these characters, and begin to really care about them. Same goes for the show's villain, who is written incredibly well, he's terrifying, and yet whenever he's on screen you cannot take your eyes off of him. However, the issue comes in this show's main character, Dr Kenzo Tenma. He has one issue and one issue only, he's too PERFECT. He starts out as the perfect, ethical, all around good guy, and stays that way throughout the WHOLE series, never growing or changing in any significant way. This is a huge issue, as the protagonist is the most important character, and if they are written poorly, it effects the show much more negatively than if some random side character was written poorly. Still, Tenma is very likeable and easy to root for, which still means something, and keeps him from being a straight up bad protagonist.\nOverall, I enjoyed this series a hell of a lot. I'd go through stages where I lost interest for a while, but I always found myself coming back to find out what the hell was actually going on! The ending is definitely polarizing, I'll let you come to your own conclusions on that though.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I stared Monster as a recommendation.  All that was said was \"A doctor on the run in Germany\".  I've been spending so much time watching shows that bend the rules of anything real, big robots, space, a couple slice of life shows, this sounded like something nice to get into.  \nSo I started the first episode.  I was interested, but not hooked at all.  I'm sure you've read many times that this show starts out slow in relation to how big it gets.  The situations are things that any of us could face in our daily lives.  Then\n          \n        something happens that changes the course, even still, remotely.  A couple murders, an investigation, I didn't think it was that big of a deal.  I didn't expect it to be a typical murder mystery.\nBut then the restraints on the story snap, and things start moving.  You start to get a feel for why this show is called Monster (ignoring the fact that it's being pushed at you).  My one possible complaint that I had was: \"I'd hate how much this show sidetracks if it weren't so awesome\".  Even when you feel the story couldn't stray anymore, you know that everything that is happening is absolutely applicable.  Everything comes together in the end, I don't know if there was a loose end by the finale.  \nIf you're getting into this show, I would really urge you to keep going.  I was considering turning it off a couple times, it just felt a bit dry in the beginning.  As I said, it was interesting, but I didn't feel much substance to it.  I think it was intended looking back.\nOne of my favorite aspects about this show are the characters.  They were very well developed, and even the ones who were purposefully made out to be no more emotional than a rock, one of them in particular ended up being my favorites out of the show.  Some of these characters didn't get the glory of being introduced with a huge back story, and they were still really interesting.  Their contributions weren't their past, but what they did during the story, which was really great.  Even one of the people I absolutely hated at the beginning became to be someone I really enjoyed seeing on my TV.  The characters and how they develop are no doubt the strongest aspect of this series.  \nInterestingly enough, a lot of the time while I was watching it, I kind of lost focus.  Some conversations do kind of go on for too long, and I took a couple breaks from it as I went.  The immediate enjoyment factor is there, but not as much as you'd like.  It's definitely not a steroid-fueled experience, which is good, but don't go into it under the assumption that every moment is going to be tense, they replace that with a slight sense of paranoia instead.  I wasn't always thinking to myself \"I need to see the next episode right now or I'll lose my mind\", but I always kept coming back to it wanting to know overall where everything is going, and where it will end.\nApparently this show is very acclaimed, and rightly so.  I hadn't heard of it until very recently.  If you're put off by the hype around it, understand that it lives up to it.  I would recommend you watch this.\n        "},

		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Monster is touted as a masterpiece of the psychological thriller genre, boasting some of the greatest characters you'll find in an anime, and a story that is close to unrivaled in the medium. I think of Death Note as quite possibly the most genius story ever executed in television, film, or text, and no show is mentioned in the same breath as Ohba's masterwork more than Monster. While I wasn't going into this series expecting something quite of that caliber, I was expecting a great deal of suspense, top-notch dialogue, and, what I expect from every series I take the time to watch, a fulfilling\n          \n        ending. While there certainly were strong points in the show, enough to justify watching the entire run, I was let down largely on the first two counts, and entirely on the third.\nI'll start with the characters. As you would expect of a show that runs for 74 episodes, the number of faces you'll become familiar with is significant. That said, no long-running show I can think of develops seemingly inconsequential characters like Monster. My favorite supporting characters include Rosso, Braun, Reichwein, Martin, Gillen, Müller, and the best character the show has to offer, Wolfgang Grimmer. My favorite characters tend to be the main protagonist or antagonist, Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, but here I think Grimmer shined brighter than Dr. Tenma and Johan. I wish I could say that had everything to do with his appeal, but it was also a symptom of my disappointment with both of the primary characters.\nI felt bad for Dr. Tenma, and wanted him to regain his freedom, but almost more on an intellectual level than an emotional one. This is a problem I had throughout the show. I got where characters were coming from, but the emotional attachment wasn't there. Most every character familiar with Johan described him as a 'monster', as 'pure evil', and there were even some expecting that he'd be the next Adolf Hitler. Psychopaths realized what he was at first glance. He had an uncanny ability to bend anyone to his will. His power and greatness were unquestioned. This was the case from the start, but I can't say I ever truly bought into it. Again, on an intellectual level, I can look at his resume and realize he's a threat to humanity that must be erased, but I never really felt it. And, given that the show revolves entirely around his life, my overall enjoyment of the show was handicapped by my relative apathy regarding it's title character. While he did have some of the most impressive lines, I found myself hating Lunge, the Baby, Roberto, and Eva more than 'the devil himself'.\nAnother inexpiable fault is the inability of certain characters with supposedly strong resolve to accomplish what they claim is their greatest goal. If you have a problem with individuals pointing guns at people whom they claim to want dead, letting at least 30 seconds go by, and ultimately not doing anything, then there are a few scenes you'll almost certainly take umbrage with. There is a point about midway into the show where the only logical ending would effectively end the show. Perhaps for that reason, that conclusion is dodged artlessly and everyone re-enters their respective roles.\nIt's a big story to have to tell, but around 40 episodes in I found myself dreading the time I'd have to spend to get to 74. And while that time is used to develop some characters rather nicely, the story moves at a pace that is gradual to a fault. For a supposed thriller, I only found a handful of moments that brought me anywhere near the edge of my seat, and they were too mild, scarce, and late into the show's run to tip the scale much in either direction. Real intrigue was drowned in minutia and storytelling that read more like a book report than a gripping tale. The oft attributed horror component was non-existent, as far as I could tell. I can't remembering feeling legitimate fear once during the show.\nThere were also some hypothesis and claims offered up, and dealt with in ways that left me wanting legitimate answers. Without spoiling anything, the question of split personalities, Nina's significant one-on-one with Gillen, and Johan's true plan and it's relation to Sievernich were all glossed over or dealt with poorly.\nRegarding the art, Monster's animation quality is serviceable, when you take it's age into account. That said, the character designs always bugged me a bit. The way Naoki Urasawa draws faces, specifically noses and eyes, differs greatly from my preferred style. I don't believe any element of the art inhibited my enjoyment of the show in a significant way, but nonetheless I did find it to be burdensome.\nThe acting is fine (I watched the dub, for the record). I do feel that there were a few lines here and there that were underperformed, but I think Silverstein (Johan), Strassman (Nina), Seitz (Reichwein), and Platt (Eva) particularly did a fine job. The SFX were of a similar quality, a few questionable foley decisions, but generally solid. The music did it's job, as one would expect, not exceptionally impressive or poor.\nUltimately, I found myself wanting to see how everything ended up, but not needing to see the next episode like I would with Death Note, or Black Lagoon, for example. Within the last ten episodes the concept of urgency is introduced, far too late to make much of a difference. Some fantastic characters meet fitting conclusions, there's a level of redemption, and finality peeks it's head around the corner, but the way the ending is handled is tantamount to a cop-out. When a show is so wrapped up in finding answers, it's finale should provide more than Monster's did, especially considering the severity of what's left up in the air. Conceivably, the show could've gone on for another 70 episodes, or been wrapped up neatly. Ambiguity like that in a long-running mystery series seems to defeat the point entirely.\nFor the first 20 episodes or so my overall grade hovered around a 6.3, which dipped to a 5.5 a little over halfway in, then, with the ending, to a 4. I'm glad I watched Monster, if only because doing so eliminated all of the curiosity I had regarding it's purported quality. While Naoki Urasawa's opus had it's well-crafted moments, it's ambition outweighed it's intelligence, an unforgivable sin for a psychological thriller.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    OK, so after spending about 25 hours of my life I've finished Monster. If you happen to have 25 straight hours on hand then I highly recomend Monster. Otherwise don't waste your time. The only thing that really makes Monster entertaining is slowly, very slowly, figuring out the big picture. There's not a lot of action, and when horrifying scenes do occur you usually only get to see the  character's facial expression, which is almost always a wide eyed look of shock. Overall there's really only two \"shocking\" things that happen, both of which can be considered funny instead of scary. \nA lot of\n          \n        people have compared this to Death Note but that's highly decieving. The only thing Monster and Death Note really have in common is mass murder. It's not just a battle between two main characters but several, and instead of the cause and effect story telling of Death Note all the plot points of Monster are driven by Johan's magical powers. Johan doesn't really have any magical powers, in fact there are no supernatural elements to speak of in the entire anime, but seeing as none of it ever gets explained I'm calling it magic.  \nArt. Everything looks good and it gets the job done so I'm giving it a ten. After awhile though a lot of faces start to look the same in subtle ways, especially the little asian girl, but I guess there are only so many original patterns after drawing massive amounts of characters. \nThe story is very complex. Not confusing but complex. There are never parts where you can afford to not pay attention. Some parts are even worth watching again if you didn't quite get it the first time. This story keeps you going non stop all the way to the end and barely gives you a chance to catch your breath. These aren't episodes so much as they're just one long continuous story broken down into managable pieces. \nThe sound is hit or miss. Like a any movie certain themes play for certain situations. Somtimes they fit perfectly and sometimes they wreck the mood entirely. I especially liked the cigarette lighter static one, which made me think my speakers were broken the first time I heard it. The intro song never changes and the credit song only changes once, though both are freaky and , yes, the background pictures are relevent.\nCharacters are many and unique. Characterization is basically the whole plot. You will get a lot of background whether you want it or not.\nIn conlusion, the whole ride is interesting and enjoyable. You'll like every episode until you get to the last one. Then it all comes down to personal preference. Personally I don't like spending a full day of my life waiting to see if my questions are ansewered and then finding out they're not. I mean if the only thing that kept me watching was to see how everything turned out and then it didn't, I really just feel like I wasted my time. But that might just be me. Since the ending, if it can even be called that, frustrated me so much I don't recommend this unless you have 25 straight hours to kill  or you've completely run out of entertaining anime where a single episode can stand alone. However, seeing as so much went into Mnster (not just lengthwise), I'm giving it an eight. It's a well done waste of time.\n"},

Everything was explained well. There were many great twists. The characters were all incredible, especially the supporting cast. When asked about the show, I often describe it as \"If Hitchcock made anime\". It has a very similar style to Hitchcock movies, and is executed just as well. If you are new to anime, this show is great because it's very western. You can ease into anime after seeing this. Furthermore, it doesn't have any of the obnoxious parts of most anime. There is no fanservice. The\n          \n        faces are properly proportioned. There are no high school students (the main character is about 40).

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    It's amazing how much they could fit into the first two episodes. The initial god impression lasts for quite a while as the show takes a metaphysical turn and the action starts to develop. We can even excuse the highly unusual number of coincidences, or how a Japanese man manages to just blend in,  in Germany.\nUnfortunately, about half way through the story it starts to look like the writer had no idea how to progress the action or reach a resolution and so, started to introduce a high number of subplots and characters in order to fill in air time and create the illusion\n          \n        of complexity. Not surprisingly, this leads to a disappointing anticlimactic ending with a cop out in the form of an empty bed, seemingly thrown in at the last second to leave an impression of an afterthought, a cheap cliche.\nA lot of the characters introduced in the second half lack depth and a lot of the subplots feel unnecessary. How many times does one need to see a miraculous escape, a mexican standoff, or yet another super-villain behind it all. \nIt would be better if the show was at least 1/3 shorter and the creators found a much more satisfying way or resolving the plots that were already there by the end of episode 33 (the book is introduced). \nThe animation is decent but not impressive in the least. It is also quite bizarre that the two characters drawn with somewhat east Asian features are Eva and Lunge, but that's Japanese animation for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my first review here on MAL, and I wanted to do it with my favorite anime of all time: Monster. I will try not to write too many spoilers\nIntroduction:\nI found this anime completely on accident. I looked On Demand and saw Monster episode 1 and decided to give it a shot. They only supplied the first five episodes at first, and by the time I finished those episodes I wanted more. I usually just watch an anime for entertainment purposes, but Monster actually got me thinking and I couldn't get enough of the story and characters. I have never been impacted by an\n          \n        anime as much as I was with Monster.\nStory:\nThe story starts with Kenzo Tenma, a brilliant neurosurgeon whose future looks bright with his fiancee and a promotion in the works. Until he discovers how corrupt the hospital truly is when he is supposed to save the mayor instead of a boy shot in the head. He ultimately chooses the boy, and with this decision his life changes forever when the director and other doctors at the hospital are killed and he is suspected of the murders. Years later, having put his life back together and is now at a new hospital, he meets with the boy, now a young man, once again. After realizing that this young man, named Johan Liebert, was the one who committed the serial murders, he feels like it is his duty to stop this \"monster\" he created. Tenma is thrown into a twisted game of cat and mouse and sees how seemingly normal people can transform into horrifying monsters. The writing is exceptional, with all 74 episodes used amazingly. There are moments of shock and awe, and when you get those little doubts that an episode doesn't seem to fit well into the story, you will learn how wrong you were later on in the series. \nArt:\nThe art style of Monster makes the characters more realistic looking then most other animes. Emotion has a lot to do with Monster, and the emotions and expressions on the character's faces are done very well. I wasn't used to this art style at first, but it grew on me and I love how it gave us more realistic looking characters. The backgrounds are very detailed as well, showing us different sceneries from all over Europe. Light and dark is also used a lot in Monster, hiding in the shadows for example. The Art is something you may not be used to at first, but it definitly will grow on you.\nSound:\nThe sound is absolutely amazing. The opening, as with the art, wasn't something I was used to at first, but as I got more into the series I loved it to death. The music and sound effects in the anime is also nothing short, but amazing. The music definitly helps to make the scene, being hopeful when need be and also being depressing when need be. It also emphasizes the character's expressions of shock and horror, and it will help you feel shocked or horrified with the character.\nCharacters:\nEven though Kenzo Tenma is the protagonist, he is not in every episode. The introduction of a lot of new characters made me wonder if the episodes were filler, but this is where the amazing part comes in: all the character's relate to the story in some way. In an episode where you realize that the character's are actually connected in more of a way then you first thought is one of the biggest shock moments you will have in Monster. You fall in love with some of these characters, even minor characters. The character's are very well-developed and the voice acting is amazing, even the dub is superb in my opinion. I know I have already slightly mentioned Tenma and Johan, but I don't want to give too much else away in terms of everyone else.\nEnjoyment:\nI never have watched an anime that made me think so much about how cruel reality really can be. Normal people really can turn into monsters. I had moments of awe, shock, horror, and wonder. I enjoyed this anime highly and I am proud to call this my favorite anime of all time. I fell in love with the characters and the story and I hope that you will too!!\nOverall:\nObviously no anime can be perfect, and sometimes this one can be a little slow, especially at the beginning. Once the story gets rolling and especially when you realize how it comes together, you won't be able to stop watching it. I know this review was slightly long, but I felt like Monster deserved a longer review. Thank you and enjoy!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Anatomy of Monster...\nI will try to demonstrate how much varied this show is even if it rest on earth and even if there's no fantastic element. \nStory: 10/10\nHow I can put this?\nThis isn't your typical confrontation anime.\nNot even a police mystery even if this anime is clearly partially a police anime.\nIn fact, it's a manhunt in all of Germany and a bit more.\nThere is much worse than the man that Tenma want to capture.\nThe story paints the human in a very sad and evil way.\nIn fact, one last thing, the series will take many reversals and many outstanding course of action. There's also a high\n          \n        value of philosophical term in it.\nWe have in the beginning the synopsis that tell already a philosophical question. If you can save the life of somebody that is a serial killer, will you do it? Remember that letting someone die is the same as killing him, in a case where you risk nothing at saving him. For the rest of the philosophical toughs you can have, I will explain some more in the character department. Now, the major division in the story include. The synopsis that is been telling by my anime list. The search for the sister of Johan and her new identity. An orphanage that is trying to repeat an old experience on kids. Neo Nazis and their plot to burn a town. The not known son of an old man that will receive his heritage while in a book donation ceremony, a plot to kill every one present there. A false accusation and a past that is starting to be reveal in Prague. An old mansion and his atrocious past. A prison break. A major murder series by many different people all related. Neo Nazis and a preparation for a next Fuehrer. (Now, this is maybe the part of the story that is the most unrealistic, because I have a German friend that hasn’t seen this show but is practically sure that Neo Nazis can’t go that far without been arrested, but he haven’t told me it was impossible. This friend study in history and even knows more than me about my own country, so I think his opinion is something to consider. If someday I have the time to view this show with him, I will make sure to come make an update) Finally, like it wasn’t enough already, a complete town that going crazy because of fear.\nArt: 9/10\nA very good art with, for a change, very realistic touches. It has also a dark touches when it needs to. The souvenirs have been taken with weird angles and with a very dark ambience. What I mean with realistic touches is the fact that there are no exaggerate hair, no artificial wind and no exaggerated reflection of light in the hair, something that I have seen not that often in anime that came after 2003. I mean, the majority of the anime adapt a realistic corpse but when it comes to the hairs, the reflection of lights is more than not exaggerated. If not that, there’s always many scene where artificial wind appears. The effects of particles like fire is pretty good rendered too. The details when we see dead people are precise. Maybe too much for people that doesn’t like blood...\nSound: 10/10\nThe voice acting is superb, very emotional and realist. When they cry or when they are happy, voices goes with it, when they are shocked, there’s little grasp or sound that myself will be doing if I were in the same position.\nThe op song is actually a psychedelic song that fit perfectly with the anime. (The fact that the anime is very sad and borderline depressing, and pretty introspective (Human is evil but can be good))\nThe ep song fit also very well with the philosophical aspect of the show with the little distorted opera vocals that can have been influence form a church chorus (Very floating verse).\nAnd the music while the play fit very much. A dark music while what’s happening is dark or bad.  The moment that are calmer, there’s also a much calmer sound behind.\nCharacter: 10/10 even more\nWe have a character for all the level of goodness on a legend out of 10.\nWhile one would mean angel, and 10 would mean pure evil...\nNote that the man that Tenma is hunting is only at 7, so at least, there's 3 more bad characters than him...\nEven Tenma is 3, there are two characters that even beat him in goodness.\nAll of those are totally respected and act normally. The author has even found a way to put a character that is a bit funny on how he acts. (Heckel, maybe 5 on the legend)\nFor a proof of the extreme variety of character there’s in this show, I will named many while giving a brief description and where they appear on my legend with explanation.  \nDirector Heinemann is actually a director that only want reputation for his hospital, he don’t care at all for the people he’s suppose to care about. In term of moral, I’m not sure if we already have somebody that is worse than Johan, if it’s the case, I put him at 8. How a director of a hospital can be like him, or how he could have the job, just think about it, in the capitalist world, the only important thing is the job done, the popularity and the reconnaissance. So, with the fact that he helps celebrities, even if some people receive a bad treatment, the overall state in the media will be that he save a celebrity. The capitalist objective been accomplish, this guy is perfect for a private hospital, even if we hate that fact. (8 in my legend, he just don’t kill anyone directly)\nHartmann, a character that appear in episode 11 for only three episodes, is maybe the more evil of the series. Even if he sees what has done Johan while been a kid in this orphanage, he still wants to repeat the same experience on another kid. This is completely sick and crazy, actually, he enjoy doing this experience that can turn a kid to be emotionless. I’m not sure if I put him in 9 or in 10.\nDieter, the little refugee from the orphanage, this kid while been controlled by Hartmann has found a way to think by himself. He then becomes one the character that is truly good. Considering what he has lived before knowing Tenma, this kid has a very great will of good and that make him a 2 on my legend.\nAnna Liebert, this character start like only the sister of the bad guy but turns out to be much more deep and detailed than we can possibly known. She seems to have her own bad thing in her past. These bad memories are so bad that it’s pretty unbelievable how she want to be good, she act not less good than Tenma while many people beside her would have become completely crazy. That’s why I think it’s the character that is the most good in the show. (1 on my legend)\nHelmut Wolf is an ancient Nazi that now understands how foolish he was in the past. He will help Tenma know more about the atrocious story of the red rose’s mansion.  An evil character that doesn’t wants to continue his wrong doing and wants to do good things is not that bad.  That’s why I put it in 6 on my legend. He has done too many bad things in his past to be forgotten, but he is still better than someone that rest evil all the show. (6 on my legend)\nWhy Johan isn’t the most evil character, it’s only because he don’t enjoy the bad thing he does. This guy thinks hard that life isn’t good. Johan is more someone that wants to suicide while not is the only one to falling into despair while accomplishing his suicide. (for that the 7 on my legend)\nChristof Sievernich, this is next Fuehrer. Till I need to be even more precise... that’s why I put him at 9 or 10 on my legend because I truly don’t know whose worse, Hartmann or Christof.\nRoberto, the man beside Johan that help him with all he can. You will think that he is less dangerous or evil than Johan, but the story tells otherwise. He actually enjoys the thing that does Johan while Johan don’t like it. The only reason that I don’t think he’s pure evil is the fact that he was in the orphanage at the moment of the incident, so he has a traumatism that explain his behaviour. (So 8 on my legend, for the 9 and 10t stage of evilness, it’s when they don’t talk about any traumatism)\nEva Heinemann, while in the beginning of the series, she seem like a total bitch, the way that her character evolutes is very interesting. Many times we will be surprise on how she will act. The more we advance in the story, the more her character get involve. In the secondary character department, I will say that she’s the best. She will for example been completely involved into the Neo Nazis thing to encounter the next Fuehrer. For the goodness, I will say that she’s not good more than many others, but while she may be too much in love with Tenma, she will still act like she think. She try to help in his own way (She’s more good than evil, but its stop there, so 4 on my legend)\nHeckel, the thief that is not that present in the show, but when he’s there, he makes for a bit of humours. The fact is that man isn’t very bad or good. Actually, he wants to steal and while stealing is bad, if he hasn’t steal anything, than the show will have been even more depressing. So because he doesn’t harm anyone and maybe save people without knowing it, I put it in the middle of my legend (5 on my legend).\nGrimmer and Lunge are the two other character that are present for a more entertaining reason. Lunge with his weird thinking and analysis. Lunge also tends to be a bit sure of himself. Grimmer is always smiling while his past is not something to smile about. Actually, you may cry while learning what has happened to him. How Grimmer act has a more funny way than many other characters, that’s why I have said he is an entertaining character more than other ones.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nThe enjoyment really depends if you can accept that this series paint the human like being evil person, but demonstrate that any human can be good with will. Wolf is one of the characters that demonstrate this by the fact that he has regrets of his past. Not only this one, there also Franz Bonaparta that wanted to retire and lived a normal life. (Dieter too) After that, the psychological mind of kids, how the story tells that you can make child become killers. Just say that you take a kid and start telling story as grey as the story of the monster in the show. Without any reference to what’s good or bad. The kid will start to think weird and will maybe think that killing other is necessary to his own living. If it starts to think that way, congratulation, there’s a crazy kid on the planet.  Second thing that is maybe seems weird, how a village can go crazy just with fear? Think about some places in the United States, were all people have weapon, and where people are able to shoot at you if they see you on their terrain. If this seems excessive for you, these kinds of laws have been decided because of fear. (fear of been attacked, fear of others etc.) Fear can go really high sometimes.\nOk, it was a long reading isn’t it, but it has to be that long for me to prove everything that I try to tell you here. \nReason why I like it that much.\n1-	High philosophical term.\n2-	Extreme variety of character.\n3-	A story that while unbelievable can be explained.\n4-	An outstanding sound performance.\nDon't see this anime if you want something relax or funny.\nFan of magic, battle, etc; go away, this isn't for you.\nIf you are open minded, or like James Bond or stuff like that, or maybe, you only like philosophy, this anime is exactly for you."},

But one night, he is forced to save the life of either a small boy, or some politician who the hospital is loyal too. Of course he chooses the boy. Unfortunately, his choice has negatively affected him after the hospital demotes him, and his gold digging girlfriend breaks up with him, not only that... but the boy he saved turned out to be a murderer and now he is being accused of murder so he goes on a long\n          \n        ass journey to deal with this \"Monster\" (name drop).The reason I jump straight into this review is because I have so much to say, I haven't felt such a void after ending a show since FMA.This show is really good and looking back in anime history there are no others like it.\nGetting into the story. It is one solid story, but the reason why it is 74 FREAKING EPISODES is that instead of it being just one story, It is a collaboration of stories that supports this one story. Tenma may be traveling through Germany looking for this guy, Johan, but for every person he meets and action he takes, another story is created, whether it being a backstory or a whole new story with character development and everything in between. And these stories (lemme tell ya)are freaking amazing. There are so many characters in this show but each person has a very organic use in this story. Not only that, but when their story is over, if they don't -you know- die. They show up again to give an update of what's happening or help Tenma or the exact opposite or trying to get Tenma put in jail or whatever.Not only that but the themes OMG. There is a good message of how a person can be affected worse as a child grows.And how people can really do a lot of damage towards others MMMMM SO POWERFUL\n\nGetting to the art and animation. The art in this show is what you get when something is beautiful yet dated: nostalgia.Looking at the art style brings me back to a time where backgrounds were made by hand on paper instead of computer. Speaking of which, the background is beautiful.There is so much detail in each shot.The character designs as well are on point. Something that is very hard to do in anime but what Madhouse accomplishes is how each person has a realistic look. Every single character main or not, is distinguishable in some way. From the hair to the noses to the facial structure.There was not one time where I forgot what someone looked like and let me tell you that is award winning for the amount of people in this story.\nHere is my stance on long anime and their budget, I couldn't care less if the show had adequate animation as long as they don't blow it all off on the opening and scrape by in the actual show ......absolute duo.....this show does conserve its budget and never dips below adequate but THEN there are breathtakingly beautiful animated moments. These moments contribute to the art direction which is also spot on, There is great work with camera direction,lighting, and even shading.And let me remind you that this show has 74 episodes yet it looks better than Twin Star Exorcists that has 51 episodes and was done over ten years after this.\nThe soundtrack in the show plays with your psyche by using different  instruments. It is more ambient instead of being rhythmical and it is so cool.You know what else is cool, the opening theme. It’s like someone took a chorus and just made a nice remix, it is a very funky beat. And the ending theme is probably what you would hear if you were like dying and going up into heaven. It’s great.And the dub is out of this world. The roles are played so well. There are times where the characters would be talking and dying at the same time and you could actually feel the struggle of that character trying to talk.\n\nIf you thought this review was long enough, I can’t even with the characters.Tenma goes through so much not only emotionally but physically. He suffers from malnutrition and his hair starts to grow. He goes around spreading the message of not killing but a nice guy like him is going to kill someone, he trains to know how to shoot a gun but he helps people more than he harms. Johan Liebert was an enigma in this show, when he shows up because he wasn’t in the show that much.He seems nice and kind but he is also suicidal and very manipulative. Some of the things he does didn’t make sense but it didn’t really click with me till the end why he was like that, Because he is not a normal person. And then there are the other characters like detectives, doctors, famous people, and people close to Johan himself. There are a lot. The show does a great job of self reflection and redemption. There will be people you hate with a burning passion but after a while, if they are not dead they will make a lasting impact on you. Each person has many different sides to them and the show touches on all those sides at least for the main characters.I also need to give a shoutout to Grimmer because he was an awesome guy.\nI can't gush about this show enough, it is a journey tale that uses the power of character study instead of crazy things happening to tell a great story. But as a disclaimer, if you want to watch this show in an effective way, YOU WILL HAVE TO COMMIT. There are some episodes where things happen without things actually happening. One example is when two people go on a shopping spree and that's it. And another episode is where a dog goes missing and ironically it is one of the best episodes in the show.Don't marathon this show, because it will exhaust you with everything going on, The best way to watch it is watching at least four or five episodes each day, don't force yourself to watch it because you WILL lose track of what is happening.But do what you want because this show is definitely a classic.\nOverall-10\nSorry for triggering all the Twin Star Exorcist fans out there, all 5 of them.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Story: Monster is very unique in the fact that it has everything-doctors, lawyers, thieves, hitmen, etc... working with and against each other. Its story line is one I would have never expected or even could have come up with in my mind. You see that there are multiple stories within this overall story, making you at one point wonder, how this anime would go if another character had the leading role. From Dr. Tenma, Johan, Martin, Eva, Diedre, to Nina Fortner, you're always left pondering who really is the \"Nameless Monster\". Despite the long progression before the story eventually starts rolling, I feel everything was\n          \n        just perfectly written, the character development was excellent, and the characters themselves were just amazing overall.\nArt: The style of the anime is drawn to look realistic which allows us to relate the anime and characters with ourselves and events that occur in our daily lives. The anime shows the realities of the world (poverty, joblessness, violence, sexual harassment, death, suicide, and strings of happiness) and shows humans darkest motives leading toward it.  The director did an excellent job at creating a dark mood throughout the story which goes perfect with the chilling story line. When watching this anime at night, these effects really come into play. \nSound: I watched the dub version and I thought the voice actors were excellent, especially Johan's voice actor, whose distinctive \"light\" voice created an unsettling mood throughout the story. Additionally, the soundtrack is genius. From one scary and spooky song, to a sad and pleasant one, it creates a beautiful melody.\nCharacter: Johan's character is one that will stand out from everyone else's on the show. He's a character you'll grow to pity and be afraid of at the same time. Initially, you might think of him as a young man who really cares about his friends. But through flashbacks, starting from the tender age of 10, you see that he's always the mastermind behind every indecent plot. You're always left wondering how his background led him to be as he is.\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it to others. The only things I didn't like about the show was that the story line took a long time to develop and actually start moving. However, once it did, there were nights I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and I really wanted to know how the story was going to end. Also, the ending of the story was one that angered and confused me a lot. At one point, you're kind of left with a feeling like it's not over yet and you still have questions to be answered. I suppose, however, that the ending is left open for interpretation for the public to take what they know of the characters and piece their own idea of what the ending means.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Before I begin, I'd like to preface this by saying that some may consider the following paragraphs to have spoilers, but that was unintentional on my part, and I would like to apologize and say that they are only minor details.\nTimes exist when you are expecting something alright,but receive something actually unique and wonderful. Monster is a series that has been endlessly praised and even harshly criticized for years,but here I am,stunned by what I have witnessed.\nMonster creates a deeply disturbing and seriously immoral world,and plunges a perfectly kindhearted man into its abyss of terror. Kenzou Tenma is a prodigy in neurosurgery,perhaps even a master\n          \n        at it,who works in a hospital that has been corrupted by its own politics in Dusseldorf. Refusing to obey the director,he chooses his own morals and decides to perform surgery on a young boy,rather than on the Mayor of Dusseldorf. This is merely a kernel of the story of Monster,and is just the surface of it all. \nThe journey we experience throughout the series is breathtaking and is superb. Dr. Tenma's desire to stop Johan Liebert and his struggle to control the monster that is Johan himself,while ensuring that he himself does not succumb to corruption makes for a spectacular series. I will admit that,while personally I had no problem with the pacing of the show,some may find it a little slow at times. The story is magnificent in my eyes,but it progresses at quite a leisurely pace for some.\nThe characters in Monster are absolutely amazing. Dr. Tenma's core belief that all people are equal and his refusal to kill no matter what circumstance is his defining characteristic. Many would like to say that his flaw is in his effort to be flawless. Tenma's morals and ideals are what he grasps at desperately to save himself from becoming a devil himself. Johan Liebert is an absolutely demented and twisted character,and his embrace of the evil growing inside of him is a malicious sight indeed. Johan's deceitful personality almost overshadows him  as a cruel and almost,if not completely,inhumane monster is integral to the story obviously,but also to other characters we are introduced to.  Heinrich Lunge,an inspector trying to hunt down Tenma for a series of murders,and his relentlessness in his approach to do so,is a character whom you may hate at first,but over time you begin to see him as this character who will do anything to either prove himself correct or to repair his errors. Among these there are many more characters who are intriguing and fascinating; main characters and side characters alike.\nThe music in this series was brilliant to say the least. The opening theme,'Grain',is a mysterious and captivating piece that is a complete contrast to many anime openings we see regularly,and its two ending themes are quite strange,but in their queerness they fit with the series. Personally,I thought that the background music was fantastic,but not flawless. The art and animation is also consistently great throughout the grand scope of the series,but never falls into that perfect category.\n\nPerhaps this is just quoting public opinion,perhaps I am blinded by some sense of bias,or perhaps the series is too fresh in my mind,but I think that this series is phenomenal,and is a gem in the medium of anime because of how well it blends character and story,and how difficult it is to separate the two. Monster is an anime that will stimulate your mind,instill fear in your heart,and bring you an enigmatic sense of enjoyment all at once.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Fun fact:  When I first heard of a show called \"Monster\" where the main character was a doctor, I immediately thought of something akin to Frankenstein.  I was so far off it's funny.\nAnyway, this show is fantastic, but I can't imagine it is for everyone.  It does not prioritize flashy battle scenes or anything of the sort.  This story is pure art.  It is emotional, suspenseful, exciting, and everything in between.  Even if it does not sound like your cup of tea, you should definitely give it a try.\nSTORY:  10\nMonster's story is obviously its priority, and it should\n          \n        be.  It is symbolic and moral, but is not scared to show us the ugly side of the world.  Like I say in my other reviews, I won't explain the general story because that's what the synopsis on this website is for.\nFor the first 24 episodes, we get to see the journey of Dr. Kenzou Tenma experiencing misfortune everywhere but not ceasing to help others as he unravels the mystery of Johan's past.\nThen, starting on episode 25, things get more complicated.  In this show, you will go episodes at a time without seeing either Tenma or Johan; the two main characters!  There is so much going on at a time in this story, which to me is a good thing, but that doesn't mean I don't miss seeing Tenma's perspective after a while of watching other characters.  You will probably experience the same thing, but maybe not with Tenma.\nThe last five episodes are nail-biting and probably the most suspenseful thing I've ever watched.  I won't say anymore but my goodness is it good.\nART:  8\nMonster is old-ish.  It was released in 2004, so compared to today's animation it is a little lackluster.  That's ok though because the most complexly animated thing in this show is probably a gun being shot or a building burning.  There aren't any major battles or anything that would require today's level of advanced animation to produce well.\nThe art is very realistic compared to most anime.  The only problem I really have there is that some elderly characters' noses are a little bit big, which is ironic because usually, in anime, the opposite is true!  It's NOT a glaring issue, though.  Otherwise, I really love the character designs.\nA lie that I would like to mention, is that the art style does a great job of making different races look different.  Dr. Tenma definitely looks different, being Japanese, than the Germans, Czechs, Turks, English, etc. who all are different from each other as well.\nThe story in Monster takes place over a long period of time.  Tenma's appearance definitely changes throughout the series as he becomes more rugged and dirty from his journey.  I like the attention to detail there.\nSOUND:  9\nThe opening and ending themes are NOT like other anime's.  The opening sounds very suspenseful and makes me think of the word \"desperation\" which is a very good word to describe the characters' emotions in this show.  The ending has two versions depending on where you watch this anime.  One has lyrics and the other does not.  Even the full version with lyrics has several instrumental portions that I enjoy a lot.  Both versions are beautiful.  The background music in Monster is pretty good and fits the scenes it plays in well.  Some of the tracks definitely warrant listening to on their own, but no as many as I would like.  My personal favorites are \"Angel Hand\", \"Than One\", \"Cannot Hear\", and \"Faith\".  There's a couple more that I just don't know he names of.  That's all not to say the rest of the soundtrack isn't good, it's just more atmospheric and doesn't really have very many melodies that stand out that much.\nAs for the English dub, I thought it was a very good one, except that some of the kids' voices and a few others are kind of annoying.  For the most part it's great, though, especially the most important characters.  The story takes place mainly in Germany and Czechoslovakia so maybe you will prefer that simply for the sake of immersion, even though TECHNICALLY they should be speaking German and Czech for the most part, English is more likely than Japanese.  That may or may not make a difference to you, though.\nCHARACTER:  10\nOh, jeez.  There are a LOT of characters in Monster.  I'll go over the main characters individually and the side characters as a whole.\nKenzou Tenma is one of my favorite characters ever.  I myself am a Christain and his morals really reflect my own.  He is kind-hearted, intelligent, and selfless, which I can relate to.  That does NOT make him a boring character.  He definitely has his fair share of moral dilemmas, and since he is such a good person, it is interesting to watch him have to make the decision to do something a little more morally gray.\nJohan Liebert, the main villain, is an extremely unique villain and one of the best ever.  He is often compared to Light Yagami from Death Note, but I don't think that is a very good comparison, even though the two anime are similar.  Johan is psychotic for all that we can see of him, and I've never seen psychosis portrayed nearly as well in any fictional story ever.  You actually feel bad for Johan, as you can tell he is not fully... there in his head.  There is just something off about him no matter what he does.  Light on the other hand, slips into a demented psych because of his power and situation.  Johan's story is tragic and one of the best character backstories ever, but I won't spoil anything.\nSome other notable characters include Detective Lunge and Anna Liebert.  I'll let you experience both of their roles on your own, though.  I'll just let you know that they make things very interesting.\nThere are several other side characters, and some are better than others, but they all add something to the story, even if you really hate their guts.\nENJOYMENT:  10\nMonster is one of the greatest works of fiction that I have ever experienced.  If I were to divide the series into thirds, I would say I enjoyed the first third the most, the second third the least, and the final portion in between, at least on the first watch-through.  I'm currently re-watching it and it all feels a bit more equal to me now.  Regardless, the whole show was a blast and might be my single favorite show, rivaled only by Death Note.\nOVERALL:  10\nMore authors need to look at Naoki Urusawa and his masterpiece of a story that is Monster.  Instead of giving us fan-service, focus on the meaningful parts of your work.  This does not mean that shows cannot have epic battles if they are integral to the story, but plot and character development should always be the top priority.\nMonster is a masterpiece, and you should definitely watch it.  Give it four or five episodes before you decide it is not your thing.  I don't want you missing out on what might be a life-changing story.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Naoki Urasawa's Monster is a masterpiece in television,  in storytelling, and in animation.  It has made it's way to the top of my all time favourite shows list, anime or otherwise. I'm writing this review after my second viewing and watching the English dub (I first watched it in May 2014 in the original subbed). \nStory: 10\nI won't give a summary, as it's A: not advised, and B: It wouldn't do it justice. The MAL summary will do, so read that first.\nMonster is a slow burn, and will be where many people may find the show divisive. The show constantly operates in phases,\n          \n        with several episodes of a seemingly unrelated nature, often containing a self-contained story, and then linking together in one explosive, tragic, or horrifying episode. This happens throughout the whole show, with the gaps getting shorter and shorter. There's always some other twist, leaving you wanting more, even down to the last few minutes of the last episode. \nMAL labels Monster as a horror, though it should be noted it is not body horror (something like Parasyte), or monster horror (Gyo or someting) - despite the show's title. The Monster in this show is a human being. Someone just like you or me, and that's what's unsettling. The \"monster\" within the show also gets several charming names, like \"the next Fuhrer\" or the Antichrist (I don't believe these are present in the dub however). Given just a little push, the entire scenario within the show could happen in the real world. \nThe story also sets place in a land rarely seen in anime - Germany - primarily Dusseldorf and Frankfurt (and later in the series the Czech Republic). And this Germany is not a hyper-Nazi version either. Instead, the series is mainly set between 1994-97, with a short prologue during 1985. As a result, themes of socialism, the East v West, and more dark themes (without saying too much) are prevalent throughout. This is not a show you want to show your kids, and having prior knowledge of these events is certainly helpful, though it is not wholly necessary to the show's enjoyment. If you want a long, psychological show to keep you intrigued, Monster is certainly my recommendation. If you want a more tight-knit or action-packed show, perhaps instead try Death Note or Psycho-Pass, both of which are quite good in their own right. \nLastly, if this show doesn't make sense at parts, just wait a bit, it will answer it. Though sometimes, it may have said the answer already, and you just need to think on it. It also has an interpretive last episode, so if that's not your thing, there's that. \nArt: 8\nMonster's artstyle has a realistic tone to it, in both character design and background art. Throughout the dozens of characters you'll meet in the show (get to them in a bit), each one is drawn in the same style, but each one sticks with you. One character you saw 30 episodes ago, might show up, and you'll remember them almost instantly The show is also done in mostly drab colours, which may be off putting at first, but will quickly begin to match the tone of the show. What few colourful moments there are will often either be the green of a beautiful country field, or the bright lights of a red light district. \nThe animation is generally consistent throughout the show, with fluid movements during a tense fistfight or a raging fire. One of my particular favourites is the animation of one character's certain tic. Rain and wind are also drawn particularly nicely. Other than that, it retains the standard anime technique of frames of nothing moving but mouths and eyes. Some animations are not so nice however. Vehicles often look rather misshapen when moving around, and doors have an odd habit of turning into flat textures at times. \nLastly, and this stems primarily from the manga, many background buildings are based directly off those in real life, with one scene being a direct 1 to 1 drawing of the Charles Bridge in Prague, with all the buildings exactly where they are. \nSound: 9\nBoth the subbed and dubbed versions are excellent. It's important to note that there are soundtrack differences between the versions, as the English version could not obtain several licenses. Most notable is the ending song. In the subbed it's \"For the Love of Life\" by David Sylvian, a rather depressing tune, followed by a rather bad second one, \"Make it Home\", by Fujiko Heming. The dub version instead has a haunting instrumental version of the former throughout the show. \nThe voice actors in both languages are outstanding.  First up, let's talk about our two leads, Dr Tenma and Johann Liebert. The Japanese VA for Tenma is a perfect cast for the gentle-tempered Tenma, out to save lives and the world. But when it comes later to the Tenma out to kick ass and take names, he can rarely pull off the aggression and anger needed for the scene. Meanwhile, the English VA, Liam O'Brien (who you may recognize as Gaara from Naruto) is the exact opposite. He can pull off an \"okay\" Doctor, but when he comes to Dr Badass, he nails it. delivering the hatred and pain behind all he's been through. It comes down to individual preference, but I personally prefer the English version.  Johann has a consistent tone throughout the voice as part of his character, and both VAs give a similar calm, soothing voice, even during the most morbid of situations. I'd say they are about equal. \nSide characters and the like are both voiced on surprisingly equal terms. The only notable difference I could point out is that the English VAs can easily outperform the Japanese when saying the more difficult German and Czech names. Other than that, both perform very well. \nLastly, the soundtrack to the show has often unnerving, haunting tunes. The English version again has a slightly different soundtrack: The Japanese soundtrack has a lot of stringed instruments, whereas the English has more deep piano tunes, and occasionally disturbing theremin sounds during the more horrific scenes, really ramping it up. The Japanese version has a better sounding soundtrack, but the English version uses it instead to boost the effectiveness of scenes. Again, personal preference on which you prefer.\nCharacters: 10: \nThere are an insane number of characters, ranging from the Monster's sibling, a frighteningly determined detective, an amnesiac spy, a bastard of a hitman, a rich alcoholic, and a psychiatrist analysing the nature of evil. And that's a fraction that you'll meet, and as mentioned previously, you'll probably remember each and every one. Sometime characters will show up in one episode, seemingly have their little story down, only to show up later tied to another event, with something new on their plate. It can be a little daunting if you think about it too hard, but the show is careful enough not to load you up with too much at once. As you might have inferred, there are several subplots throughout, besides the Tenma/Johann one. Several other characters are also working their way to the truth, with various levels of success, and their are just as many doing their most to counteract them.  \nSome characters do some pretty messed up thing too, such as engaging in eugenics, genocide, rape and murder of various levels. No single character in the show is perfect. In fact, Tenma is probably the most flawed character in the series. He starts out as a simple doctor, but by the end, he's almost lost his mind with grief, and at times forgets a doctor's #1 rule: Do No Harm. \nEnjoyment: 10\nThe show is one long, complex mystery, with lots of little mysteries rewarding you with only clues to the bigger puzzle.  People die a lot, you try to figure out whodunit, and you think you'll have an answer. The answer the show then reveals instead turns out to be more tragic, spiteful, or mortifying than anything you came up with. Even on my second viewing (with an admittedly long gap between them), some of the revelations still caught me by surprise.  The show will grab you at times - if you're a patient person that is. That slow burn stuff is still up to everyone. You could watch one episode, go \"What is this trash? This is as fun as the Endless Eight.\" If that's you, it's a shame, but this slow burn stuff is just my type (don't worry, NO-ONE likes the Endless Eight). \nAlso, if you're a history nerd, you might learn a few things too. Though the series rarely outright tells you, if may hint at something, enticing you to go out and do some more research on your own. Thanks to that, I learned more about the history of Prague, the Berlin Wall, and a few German words. Yay!\nOverall: 10\nI'll say it again. Monster is a goddamn masterpiece. A magnum opus. It's story is exciting, depressing, horrific, and full of impact. The art style is realistic, rare in the realm of anime. The voice acting is superb, paired with a tingling soundtrack. The vast array of characters will stick with you, even some side characters in only a few episodes. It's mystery will keep pulling at you, and have an interesting backdrop to accompany it.  \nMonster is an anime that can stand among the grounds of great television shows, like Breaking Bad and The Wire. It may even be joining them soon, with rumors of a TV adaptation with Guillermo del Toro that have been circulating for years. If you want a real experience of a show, Monster should be at the top of your list. \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I'm honored to give my review for such an amazing anime. Monster is a pure masterpiece, very close to the perfection. I would say that this anime is not a typical one, like many anime series and even seinen that are action-packed, have magic, supernatural powers, time travel and some other unrealistic elements used in anime. \nThis anime series actually tried to be more like live-action than anime. When you watch it you really have a feel like you're watching a serious thriller full of suspense. From that point, I could say that Naoki Urasawa want to be different from other artists and if you\n          \n        ask me he really succeeded. \nMonster is a unique series that actually try to explain the connection between good and evil that is often very hard to recognize. The story in series is full of suspense, mysteries and drama.\nWhat I find interesting about this series is that the picture book that appears in the ending credits is an important  subject in the story.\nMonster is often compared to Death Note. I have finished both series and Monster is much better in my opinion. First: Monster is more complex while Death Note is focused on only one thing: find Kira, though the story in DN, has a faster progress than in Monster. But I could watch Monster all day regardless of the length, the story is so fantastic. And it's ridiculous to compare Light and Johan because they are so different in many ways. Light as a highly intelligent student has made a big mistake in his strategy at the beggining (I'll write about this when I'll review Death Note). Johan is genuis and he doesn't need supernatural  powers to kill and manipulate people. I also find some characters in DN, too arrogant and annoying. Moster is in many ways better than Death Note. Those two series are completely different by themes and story. The only common they have is a deep nature and both are thrillers filled with mysteries and drama (that's probably the only reason to compare those two series).\n\nStory: 10\n\nThis is by far the best storyline I've ever saw among all the fictions. Every episode and character is connected to the story, no single filler. I'm amazed how Naoki succeeded keeping it balanced through 74 ep-long series. It's interesting how some of the history's most important figures like Hitler and Soviets had an impact on the certain characters. The story is set in Central Europe but mainly in Germany.The story has some historical references, but it's not really a historical tale either, it tells how some of the eastern countries suffered from communism and Soviet Invasion. Many characters are Slavens and Germans what I like because it's rare to see their names in anime.\nArt: 10\nNaoki draw the characters to look realistic as far as they can. The art is not focused on the big eyes that are typical for animes and there are no kawai characters with green or pinkish hair, characters are really suitable for realistic anime like this. Although art is not specific it is very well done. \n\nSound: 10\nSound effects and music are really trustworthy for those genres. While I was watching the Ruhenheim arc in Monster, ny mom was reading the book and by sounds she recognised that I was watching something like thriller mixed with mild horror. Soundtracks are so awesome escpecially the ''Faith'' and ''The seeds of time'' are EPIC!\n\nCharacter: 10\nMore than 30 complex characters, none of the characters is useless. Johan is by far the most fascinating antagonist in the whole anime history. He is a master-mind and I'm amazed by his way of manipulating and playing with people. Tenma is one of the best protagonists I've seen so far. He understood the roguery of the politic game that unfortunately exists in the real life also. He lost his job, fiance and everything to find Johan and solve the mystery. He did the right thing despite the fact that he saved the life of the serial killer. \n\nEnjoyment: 10\nI enjoyed every second in this anime. Although the first few eps. were not that epic later I became so hooked, every moment kept me on the edge of seat. \nOverall: 10\nThe best anime I've ever seen. Even my parents who consider that nothing good can come out from anime got interested for Monster. Soon we'll watch it together and I hope they'll understand the real value of  Monster. This series can teach you a lot about life.\n\nWarner Bros's New Line Cinema is planning to release the live-action film since 2009 but it's still in progress. Let's hope we'll see it someday on our screens and in cinemas. Maybe if they'll make the movie good and epic as anime then more people could recognise this phenomenal series. \n\nI can't believe that some people complain about its length -.- Personally I couldn't imagine it shorter, every episode perfectly fit the follow of the story.

This anime series is long (74 episodes) and I will admit that is does drag at times -- but it remains one of my favorite animes. The story is original with twists and turns that keep you interested until the end. The writing/art/and music are all great. It's not just some average silly sci-fi story -- it has real depth. \nIf you tried to watch this on the SY-FY channel and \"just couldn't get into it\", please find it in its entirety (DVD or streaming online) and\n          \n        watch blocks of episodes at a time. You can't get the full effect of this show by just watching little bits here and there.\nAll I'm asking is that you give this show a chance. Maybe it's for you - maybe it isn't.

The characters are consistently surprising, and also surprisingly human.

I can say that I expected better, but that may have happened because the hype around this anime made my expectations rise a little bit too much. Still, it is a masterpiece and I really enjoyed it.\nSome parts of the story, though, seemed to lack some fundamental reasoning. There are many things happening that are either rushed or thrown in there a bit strangely. Luckily, these were mainly things on the side of the main plot, so it didn't bother me too much, but as I went back\n          \n        on what I had seen, some moments made me cringe.\nHowever, the main storyline was really good. The character development was also outstanding. The voicing was heavenly. So yeah, you probably already know that this anime is worth watching, so I will skip the worshipping.\nAnother aspect that could have taken more patience is the art. Some transitions are not right and some images are kind of awkward. But, just like I mentioned previously, most of the mistakes occur when there's a less important moment, so you might not even notice them (unless you have universe-sized expectations like I did).\nOverall, this anime is worth watching.

It's not based on a supernatural aspect, but rather a Monster that is completely human. That's what makes it such a thriller. The characters are extremely well developed, and the art style fits the storyline perfectly. It can seem plain at points but, honestly, the series doesn't need intricate art to make it better. I love\n          \n        the soundtrack as well. I own the entire thing, and it can honestly terrify me sometimes.\nSome moments in the series can give me actual goosebumps, and I definitely recommend it if you like thriller anime series.

I really thought I’d already reached the darkest of the dark, but then, ahead of me, I beheld a darkness even greater still.” – Johan Liebert\nMonster is extremely different than most modern anime, in that there is basically no fan service and no high schoolers. Hell, Monster doesn’t even take place in Japan; the majority of it takes place during the 1990s in Germany. So when I watched Monster I was looking for something different no slice of life or action, I wanted a real psychological thriller and damn did I get what I came\n          \n        for and it even lasted 74 episodes with absolutely no filler episodes just exposition and plot.\nStory – 10\nMonster follows our Protagonist Kenzo Tenma who is a brilliant Japanese neurosurgeon working his way up Eisler Memorial Hospital in Dusseldorf, but he makes a judgment call and decides to save a young boy over the life of the city’s mayor. Was this really the choice? Most people would agree that saving a young boy over an older man is probably the morally correct choice, but Dr. Tenma is left debating that decision over the rest of the series as he realizes that he didn’t save a boy but instead he saved a monster. Dr. Tenma then decides to hunt down this monster for himself and solve this problem, because it becomes clear the police can’t seem to handle this monster for multiple reasons. My first thought after plot line of this series was, how the hell does it last 74 episodes? Now I might be wrong on this point as I watched the series a couple of years ago but I do believe there is absolutely no filler and every episode is canon. Monster is one of those series that uses their time really wisely, you’ll probably always be interested in whatever is going on, trying to solve the multiple mysteries of this show while enjoying the seemingly casual dialogue between two characters. Though our Protagonist is Dr. Tenma the show does switch off to other characters quite a bit, probably 32 episodes switch the point of view of the story and follow a different character. There isn’t any way for me to really describe how great the Story for this anime is without giving any spoiler’s but a lot of fucking people die and their deaths are usually pretty brutal. The pace of the show is slow because it lasts 74 episodes but man does it captivate you bit by bit and leave you wanting more, the ending is also extremely climatic. \nArt – 9\nSomething that people usually aren’t comfortable with while watching monster is the art style, not the animation but the art style. Unlike some mangaka Naoki Urasawa (the person who wrote and drew the manga for Monster) has a really distinct art style; nothing is kawaii or moe. Though I’ve only read two of his works (20th Century Boys and Monster) they both have a very realistic art style which I feel is to attempt to make the viewer realize that this series is something that you should take rather seriously. Anyways the animation is decent for its time, nothing really flashy happens in this series so none of the animation is very flashy.\nSound – 10\nMonster OP and ED are unique to say the least, I can’t say if I really enjoyed them, but I do feel that the fit the eerie and mysterious tone of the series really well. The OST is on point, and this show almost never has the problem of misused BGM. The voice acting is on point in the Japanese Dub, I can’t say too much for the English Dub because I never heard it though I am a fan of Liam O’Brien.\nCharacters – 10\nEvery main character in this series is extremely interesting the least of which is the protagonist and the most of which is the antagonist. Johan Liebert tops the charts of evil villains in Anime/Manga. I really don’t know who is eviler, Johan or Griffith from Berserk. Johan Liebert is a god of manipulation this man is a fucking genius, but he is seriously fucked in the head. Ok, sorry had a bit of a fan boy moment but seriously he Is my favorite antagonist from any anime series and I do believe him to be the most evil and quite possibly the greatest antagonist any anime series has ever seen. Most people who have already seen Monster will hopefully agree with me on this point. The characters really just make the show the masterpiece that it is, though some characters are one dimensional and rather pointless most seem to have unimaginable depth and make me question how Naoki Urasawa came up with all these brilliant characters. From the extremely likeable Wolfgang to seemingly bitchy Eva, I find this cast of characters extraordinary and very realistic though they still entertain me.\nEnjoyment – 9\nI admit, every once in a while I wasn’t entertained. This anime certainly isn’t action packed like SAO and SNK, and it isn’t comedic like Gintama and GTO. It’s a thriller and sometimes I just wasn’t too thrilled. But that’s literally impossible for a 74 episode series to keep me thrilled for every second specifically one that has an extreme amount of exposition. The mystery element of this show always did keep me guessing, but I wasn’t smart enough to figure it out without the show explaining it to me. The main enjoyment for me came out of the great storyline and characters. I feel to enjoy this show you do need some level of maturity, though I don’t know how much that means coming from a 17 year old kid.\nOverall – 10\nThough there are some things that aren’t done absolutely perfectly I feel that they are damn well near perfect, and for whatever Monster messes up on one aspect and makes up for on another aspect. If you aren’t a fan of psychological thriller’s in genre this just won’t be for you. If you watch anime for the Japanese culture this won’t be for you either because it takes place in Europe. This is some really dark shit you’re getting into my friend, if you only watch light hearted stuff like Slice of Life or your typical shounen series then I recommend at least branching out and trying something new like Monster because it’s a hell of a series. But don’t forget my friends “Evil sometimes wears a pleasant face”."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Naowi Urasawa's Monster is a tale that seems to play with the natural delicate nature of the humans. The story is famous for its tension, amazing characters, and amazing themes. Unless you are here for a praisefest, you should really know that this anime/manga has very little to no flaws that I can nitpick at, and I had to actually think quite hard about the cons in this review (as I try to be as honest as possible in my reviews).\nProgression (10): This is a long anime/manga (74 episodes, 161 chapters), however it does not felt like it was prolonged unlike many other anime. The\n          \n        story ties together very well, and in no part of the story did I ever ask the question: \"Was this part actually necessary?\" as all of the parts were necessary. The only thing I can nitpick at here is that all of the characters seem to be conveniently related to each other, however I cannot really take off points for this since in almost all great literature and media this occurs as well.\nStory (10): The story and themes of Monster are very deep and dark. The story is very complicated and actually quite unique. The identity of the villain is always a mystery, and because there is so much within this story that is unknown you are actually somewhat scared at times (and this is the first time in any anime/manga have I ever been afraid). The subjects of brainwashing, psychology, child soldiers, prostitution, addiction, and much more are presented in a disturbingly genuine fashion and knows how to draw the attention of the audience to make them either frightened, amazed, or just downright shocked. The themes within Monster are also amazing, it often questions the fundamentals of human nature. It is not all darkness however, as redemption, unity, and hope for happiness in the future are shown as small glimmering lights at the end of a long tunnel. More than ever, Monster feels like real life, it makes you disturbed at the things a human can do, but often it makes you hope for better times that can and will occur in the future as you live on.\nArt (10): The artstyle of Monster is quite unique and quite good. It is not an extremely \"anime-ish\" artstyle, rather more realistic. It draws the characters and their faces well enough that often you can tell what ethnicity said character is. The colors within the anime are not very strong, and feel somewhat faded, but this fits the atmosphere well because it only further enhances the realism that you often feel within this world.\nSound (10): The soundtrack in Monster is very good. It adds to the mysterious and creepy tone that the show has. Silence is one more thing portrayed very well in the show. Some shows attempt to play silence on as creepy, but more often than not feel cheap as the tone isn't creepy enough. With Monster, it is overflowing with disturbing moments, and the silence just adds to the tension and the fear of the anime. Although, I would normally suggest subbed over dubbed for voice acting, the voice actors in the dubbed did spectacular. The setting is also in Europe, and the dubbed voice actors nailed those unique, varied accents.\nCharacters (10): Let me put this straight, this anime/manga has some of the best characters in all of anime/manga. It doesn't matter if they're main, major, minor, or antagonists, they are all interesting characters. The main antagonist of the show (who I shall not name because that is a minor spoiler), is not only genuinely frightening, but has a way of making you cringe at what he's thinking about. Throughout the show, it feels as though the main antagonist is just \"beyond the veil\" poking at strings and playing with the other characters as though they're puppets. The main characters all have great development, and more so than anything else feel very human and very responsible. You can feel the sorrow that they go through, and the moments in which they feel genuinely hopeful as though you were feeling it yourself. Even the minor characters who come up but once feel amazingly real, and often I felt that I would not even have minded if I could see more of that character because they were that interesting. They all had interesting back-stories that made them varied and unique, and none of the characters suffer from any type of cliche writing. Even the characters, who you find out later are basically \"redshirts\" are not expected to be \"redshirts\" because of how developed they can become in one episode.\nEnjoyment (10): I enjoyed this show immensely, however I must warn that if you are just looking for something lighthearted, this may not be your show as it pulls no punches back for those types of people. Even then, I would recommend it to those people because of how it draws you in, and especially because of how it is unique enough that it breaks most of the cliches of thrillers, mysteries, and even just anime in general.\nTLDR?\nPros:\n*Amazing storyline, despite being somewhat long it has kept me interested and on the edge of the seat the whole time. Everything feels necessary in this story.\n*The artstyle is unique and great, you can even tell what ethnicity a person comes from in this manga/anime, unlike most other manga/anime.\n*The soundtrack is amazing. Also, silence is used very well. When silence befalls this anime, you start worrying and getting a little scared whereas in many other anime, it sometimes feels cheap.\n*Tension is amazing, I have heard Urasawa being called the Japanese Alfred Hitchcock because of this manga/anime alone.\n*All characters are very interesting, even the ones that only show up for an episode have interesting and deep back-stories.\n*The themes are extremely interesting and well developed. The themes aren't all just about darkness either; there are some that depict the good of human nature.\n*Very realistic world, this anime/manga has one of the most realistic worlds I have seen within anime/manga.\n*Both dub and sub are very good, in fact, this is a rare case that the dub might be even better than the sub.\nCons:\n*Very few cliche scenes that involve the \"Who's going to shoot first?\" question. Does occur occasionally, but not often enough that it does much damage to the product as a whole.\n*Not for the lighthearted, some scenes can even get genuinely disturbing as it questions the fundamentals of human nature and things that could have actually occurred during World War II. I would still recommend it though because of how it breaks other cliches because of its uniqueness.\n*This is as perfect as an anime/manga gets. After I watched this, a lot of the anime that I previously thought was good became pale in comparison (I am not taking points off for this point)\nOverall Score: 9.9/10 (Just round it up to 10/10)\n***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it. If you enjoy/hate this anime/manga, feel free to accept my thoughts on said anime/manga or discard it.\n        "},

An anime that will leave your bones chilled, your mind reeling and your heart racing. A masterpiece. Monster, also known as Naoki Urasawa’s Monster is a prime example of such bone-chilling perfection. As a seasoned anime watcher I have yet to find another anime that comes close to this masterpiece, though Death Note and Code Geass come close.\nI have gone out of my way to dish out a lot of praise for this anime, and will give it a 10/10. So let me break it down.\nAnimation –\n          \n        7/10\nBeing an anime released in early 2005, the animation is obviously not on par with some of the more recent anime released. But it still is quite good, graphic and detailed, being a Madhouse production; the animation complements the story beautifully. The characters are detailed, the scenes picturesque, good and overall fine.\nCharacters – 14/10\n“Look at me! Look at me!”\n“The monster inside of me has grown this big!”\n“Chomp, chomp, munch, munch, gobble, gobble, gulp”\nThe characters are….\nYou may think I went a bit overboard with the ratings, but I would have gone even further. The characters are this anime’s strongest points, and what makes it a masterpiece, especially Johan Leibert.\nHe has been described as the Anti-Christ, the Monster with seven heads and ten horns, and is flawless in terms of what should be described as “evil.” There are so many things that can be said about this man that I could go on writing forever, but alas, I can’t describe him as delicately and artfully as I want.\nHe excluded, the other characters, Kenzo Tenma, and Johan’s twin sister Anna Liebert, are also powerful characters in their own right. If one can grasp the beauty and complexity of the characters, they are in for a fun ride!\nSound – 8/10\nPersonally, I prefer subbed over dubbed, but here is an exception. I watched it dubbed, so I could hear Liam O’ Brien. The music, other voice cast, and soundtrack everything is beautiful and well done. Especially the opening, the opening is haunting, chilling and so creepy yet at the same time beautiful, alluring us, calling us into it, and also giving us an idea about what we are headed for.\nThe dialogues are also perfect, nothing over-done, clearly placed, and thought-provoking, and just enough haunting to leave you thinking, about what is considered good and bad, what may be considered “returning a favor” and what are the grey-areas of science. Of course it depends on the reader, and other things may cross their minds.\nStory – 9/10\nIf you look at in perspective, it’s just a wild goose chase, which explores human psychology, human nature, hierarchy, devotion, human relations. It explores the themes of mass murder, human experimentation, child abuse, brain washing, Yup, a wild goose chase. Those who have seen it can agree with me that whether they like it or not, it is an extremely dark, uncomfortable show in which Urasawa takes some common themes and subjects and tears them asunder to rebuild them new – and one can’t help but just go along with it, as the story will chomp, munch and gobble whoever decides to watch it.\nEnjoyment – 10/10\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this show, and it is a masterpiece, but an unconventional one. It displays the world’s horrific sides, it’s dark gloomy beauty, and I would never call it a “must-watch”, for there are some things that should just be left as it is, and not be served to the masses.\nMy rating – 9.6, rounded to a 10.\n        "},

The bogeyman, the ugly witch, the ones that our parents tell us stories about before we go to sleep at night and makes us check under our bed and closet for before the lights are off. And then, there's the monsters who are real, who exists in our world and yet seemingly doesn't, the monsters that people fear.  \nOnce in a while, a masterpiece comes along and completely blows you away, and then at end of it, you sit down and wonder will you ever\n          \n        get to see something like it again. Monster that one of a kind masterpieces not frequently seen in any medium in this day and age. Its unconventional storytelling, combined with its excellent direction and fully realised characters puts it high up it the echelon of top animes. \n\nThe Story: \nDoctor Tenma is a Japanese brain surgeon residing in Germany. He has everything a man could ask for: A purpose-filled career, a promising future ahead,  and he even managed to snag the hospital Director's daughter. One day he was thrown into a moral quandary when he met Johan, a young boy who was shot in the head.  Johan's surviving on a thin thread, but hospital's political bias is threatening his very existence when the Town Mayor,who requires immediate surgery, was brought in shortly after. \nNow this is the part where the films wonderfully displays the notion of choice, the value of life and our constant search for meaning in it. Haunted by his guilt of abandoning a patient for a more illustrious one, Tenma decided to operate on Johan instead, and indirectly causing the death of the Town Mayor. As it it turns out, the boy would grow up to be a cold-blooded serial murderer rampaging across Europe in his crime spree. And Doctor Tenma, now washed up and a fugitive framed for his crimes would embark on the mission to end the boy's life himself.\nWithout exposing much of the plot itself, the whole anime span decades from Post WW2 all the way to the turn of the century. The plot is very deep and rich and it would require some time for the viewer to digest it completely.  For those who are expecting a light-hearted anime, it would be like a punch in the gut and it is relentless. Beneath its plot of a simple cat-and-mouse between hero and villain lies a deeper convoluted plot that exposes the dark an inhumane side of human nature, government conspiracies, and also foreboding some religious prophesies. It brings forth unpleasant issues that people hide deep inside their closet of skeletons and  it delves deep into the abyss of human depravity.\nThe characters:\nTenma and Johan are two opposite sides of the coin, each representing one side in the age-old debate of good vs evil. However the anime blurs this line. He is trained to save lives, but can he take it away? What would make the murderer of a murder?  As we follow Tenma in his travels around Central Europe in hot pursuit of Johan, we also experience Tenma's personal struggles. As bit by bit, he uncovers Johan's dark past, we also sink deeper into Johan's twisted psyche.\nAnother impressive thing about this anime is how it draws its character influences from classic Hollywood film noirs. We encounter many corrupt characters, scheming politicians, washed-up detectives, the anti-hero etc. \nEvery character in the show have their own cross to bear, some of them lasting only an episode or two, and despite Monster's wide range of casts, many of them managed to leave a poignant impression behind. It is definitely one of the shows with the most fully realised characters I've ever seen. \nSettings/sound:\nGenerally a very masterfully drawn anime. The layout and architecture all accurate portrayals of Central Europe to depict its culture and atmosphere. I like that the anime decided to adopt a film noir visual style. Dark shadows, low key lighting, claustrophobic spaces, rainy, damp streets. It all brings a very dark and gloomy settings to it and I loved it. It helps that the anime is set in the final years of Cold War Europe where the air of cynicism left hanging in the air. The sounds are all typically film noir with the usual downbeat jazzy music and the use of silence when it needed it be. Brought a very melancholic feel to it. \n10/10"},

However, its my opinion and my review after all, right? My review isnt the most thorough one, but more of a brief commentary. It's not very professional, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on this anime.\nThe story of Monster, the idea and plot itself is actually quite intriguing. A doctor turned detective chasing a serial killer he once saved as a child, and the many surprises and twists that come along the way, make for a fairly interesting plot. However, it is these number of twists and\n          \n        turns that are way too many to actually complement the story, as if it is forcibly implementing the twists for the sake of it. In addition, every authority in every location seems to be corrupted and every police officer turns out to be a conspiring villain. What is also bogus to me is how Dr Tenma and Anna Liebert turn into 007 agents, while the German BKA is most inefficient. Even the underground fascists are so well informed that they know the whereabouts of Dr Tenma and Anna and the rest of the 'good guys' while the government agencies are virtually non existent.\nThe characters too arent really that good. Almost all of them are depressed and having a traumatic personal background or going through an unfortunate time in their life. The character designs of some characters too, are an eyesore. While I'm not expecting the cliche anime designs, some characters look just plain terrible.The sound is quite good, though the spooky effects they try to integrate aren't always spot on. \nNow, you might read my review and thrash me for it, but it's just how I feel. Yes, I emphasize largely the negatives without pointing out the positives, but its these negatives which make this anime so frustrating for me to watch. Am I saying this anime is just plain bad? No, its just that these glaring cons could have been better dealt with, and the anime would have even higher ratings. On the whole however, the anime is still enjoyable. I haven't watched a good mystery anime in a while, and Monster still provides for an exciting watch despite its flaws. \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    In my review for Monster, I had to give 10s in all categories, and I don't give 10s easily. Anyways...I just finished this series about 10 minutes ago, and..wow. There is little more to say in description for its power in quality storywise and character-wise. \nThe Monster blurps around really don't do the story justice, although adding to them would be impossible without spoiling. Almost every episode kept me holding my breath, and for someone with quite the short attention span, that is saying something. Normally, I have difficulty watching something without at least playing solitaire, but with Monster multi-tasking would have been foolish to\n          \n        say the least. \nMonster is dark, to say the least. It is not the dark creepy of, say, Pandora Hearts (not to mention that has humor), but it is darkness of a non-fictional history reincarnated into a fictional present. It is not the thing to try if you are just looking for some mindless entertainment. \nIt does have a lull, however, that I should mention for about 10 episodes. For anyone wondering if it gets better, it does, it gets much better. Once you are past that lull, it is hitting the ground running. \nCharacter-wise, Monster causes a very strong reaction to every character, either a love, or an intense loathing. Everyone developes and grows, whether it be positively or negatively. I should make an art-shout out here, something I rarely comment on. The art is so subtly detailed that you can see subtle signs in a character from episode 1, to episode 74 where they could physically look the same but look more mature. \nContent-wise I'd recommend this for no younger than 16, for although the amount of fanservice is zero, mature content in other ways is definitely present. From child abuse, Nazism to strongly inferred rape and a couple short sex scenes. \nFor anyone looking for a truly amazing story, not just something to pass the time, I would recommend Monster. This is a story you get more out of then just \"fun enjoyment.\" You get solid storytelling, and masterful weaving of plot point to plot point. The art of Monster is definitely not just in its visual form, but in its entire embodiment. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Monster is an anime I wanted to see after reading several reviews on this site, I was looking for something to really get stuck into for a long period of time and seeing countless scores of 9 or 10 made this the ideal series for me.\nI'll be honest right from the start, I enjoyed Monster a lot but I can't help but feel it could have been slightly better.  I'll explain why in each paragraph for the story, art and so on, but I will say it's well worth your time if you have patience.  It is 74 episodes long, adding up to\n          \n        more than 30 hours of solid viewing time.\nStory - 8/10\nAs mentioned at 74 episodes Monster is very long, but the story is captivating and often enthralling.  I do feel the entire series probably could have cut out a fair bit of the more pointless scenes (and even perhaps the occasional episode), in my opinion I would have probably given the story aspect of Monster a higher score if there wasn't so much filler in between the more interesting moments as it all builds towards a thrilling final ten episodes or so.  However the longevity of the series has its advantages, primarily with character development and attention to detail.  For example there are several themes of historical significance from the Berlin Wall coming down to Neo-Nazis making a nuisance of themselves, and the various cultural quirks from the different countries in Western Europe primary protagonist Doctor Tenma visits are captured flawlessly.\nArt - 8/10\nWhile there is little I can think of that particularly stands out regarding the art and animation found in Monster it's all put together in a very realistic manner.  The scenery looks excellent without being too elaborate and the attention to detail when it comes to trees or hair blowing in the wind is excellent.  What impressed me most was the consistency of the character animation, the quality never dropped or changed significantly at any time and the transition in age between the characters at the beginning and end of the anime was a particular highlight of mine.  Much like in real life it was hard to spot any major gradual changes in age until seeing a photograph of someone ten years previously, I thought that was very well done.\nSound - 6/10\nProbably the weakest aspect of Monster was the sound and music.  The voice acting was easily the best part, with character like Lunge/Runge and Doctor Tenma himself being voiced to perfection.  The general background sounds such as traffic, gunshots, rain and so on were also adequate, but Monster had a less than interesting soundtrack to accompany that.  The ending theme used up to around episode 32 I thought was an exceptional piece of music that really fitted in well with the overall feeling of the anime, but once they changed it to the frankly stranger second piece used until the very end of the series I was less than impressed.\nCharacter - 10/10\nOne of the advantages of watching an anime as long as Monster is that there is plenty of time for individual character development.  There is a very large cast, but the writers do an exceptional job of allowing a lot of time for the viewer to become emotionally attached to a lot of the more major characters.  There's a fairly standard divide of good guys vs bad guys, either aligned with protagonist Tenma or antagonist Johan one way or another.  Without spoiling too much there are a substantial amount of deaths throughout the series, tugging at your emotions as either a character you've come to love or one you've come to despise finally meets his or her end.  It's all done to perfection.\nEnjoyment - 9/10\nDespite various flaws I enjoyed Monster very much.  It's by no means the best anime I've watched but it's definitely the most unique, thought-provoking and one where at times I couldn't wait to find out what happened next; I often watched half a dozen episodes in one sitting which is rare for me to do.  The only negative point I want to make is with the slow pace of the series, particularly towards the beginning, at it was at times a slight struggle to get through but once I did I never regretted it.\nOverall - 8.2/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Monster is an award winning manga written by Urasawa Naoki from the mid 90s to the early 2000s. A couple years after the manga ended it got an anime adaptation from Madhouse. Them again? It feels like I've said everything about their studio that I possibly can in the past few months, both good and bad. So... let's just take a look.\nOkay, so there's a Japanese neurosurgeon named Tenma. After an attack of conscience about being pulled away from poorer patients he takes a stand, breaks orders and handles the operation of a boy who got shot in the head. The boy survives, thanks to\n          \n        his expert care, but it destroys his career. At least, it does until the hospital director and several others are killed by poisoned candy but he and his twin sister both vanish from the hospital. Cut to several years later and there seems to be a bunch of unexplained murders. That's when Doctor Tenma learns that the young boy he saved back then is responsible. To make matters worse, Tenma is wanted for the murders. Wanted by the law and determined to make sure that there are no more victims, Tenma goes after the boy known only as Johan. Now, it probably seems like I'm going into spoilers, but I'm not. This all happens in the beginning. Now, one concern I had about the length was that it was going to drag, but it doesn't. Everything that happens is necessary and plot-related. To Monster's credit, the episodes also don't drag, well mostly. There are a few scenes that feel overly long, but not many. There's also a good mystery here, not over who's responsible since they tell you right away, but over the reasons why. There are constant clues as to what happened to the twins in the past. You get these hints piece by piece until, eventually, the answers become clear. Now, I won't spoil it but it is really interesting. Another thing that Monster does well is handling the darker content. Unlike a certain other anime from Madhouse, which I could name but those of you who regularly read my reviews can figure out what it is, Monster takes the darker content and handles it with maturity and intelligence. Yeah, it's a really dark anime, but it all works because the writing is so well done. Take note, this is how you handle mature content. One issue I did have was with the ending. Honestly, it's too optimistic and doesn't quite fit the rest of the series. It's not badly written, but it does feel like a strange tonal shift. \nLike the story elements, there isn't a character introduced who isn't important. Yes, some of them disappear for a while and some of them are only in a few episodes, but they're all important to the plot. Not only that, but they all have developed personalities and many of them get further development as the series progresses. That's pretty impressive. It takes skill to write a 74 episode series without any unnecessary characters or plot lines. I also really like Johan as an antagonist. He's incredibly clever, so the police don't look inept for not being able to find him. It also helps that he rarely gets his own hands dirty, preferring to manipulate others into doing it for him. And they say that charisma makes a good dump stat. \nThe art is really well done. The characters look pretty realistic. The scenery does look a lot like the areas they're supposed to be. The various objects from guns to food to cars are all nicely detailed. There are some cases where you can't quite see because it's too dark, but it's always done to strategically build tension rather than a result of incompetence and it always works. \nThe voice acting is excellent. Everyone does really well from Sasaki Nozomu to Kiuchi Hidenobu to Noto Mamiko, even if she's not playing a yuri girl in this. What? She plays yuri girls a lot. Moving on, the music is really good for aiding atmosphere and tone. However, the stuff that actually has lyrics is kind of poorly done.No offense to Sylvian David, but he sings in this like he breathed in a bunch of helium and he's just coming off of it. \nThe yuri factor is a 1.5/10. There are a few scenes that could be interpreted as homo-erotic, but there are only two of them and interpreting them like that is kind of a stretch. \nThe final rating for Monster is a 9/10. In the end, most of my complaints are pretty minor and none of them detract too much from the series. The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the art is great, the voice acting is excellent and the music adds to the series. In spite of a few complaints, everything is done really well in the series and I do recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good drama. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. \n        "},

If I were to compare Monster, to any television  show it would be the Mentalist, reason for this is that the antagonist protagonist relationship is very much similar. If some of you  are not familiar with the show Mentalist, it involves the relationship between the Investigator(Former psychic)  hunting down\n          \n        the serial killer that killed his wife and child named Red John. As i stated the relationship between the antagonist protagonist is very much similar in both shows.\n\nStory.10\nThe story is set right after the collapse of the Berlin wall which makes the story and character development that more enticing. The show draws you in becoming more involved with each episode the anime itself is addictive. The many plots that occupy this show makes each episode draw you in that much closer.\n\nCharacter.10\nMonster uses each episode to its advantage making the use of each episode. Though you don't mean to within one episode of any featured character you sympathise with each one.\n\nOverall. 10\nOK for those who think and still believe that School Days is a good psychological show are f@#$ken idiots when comparing thiis show to that it shits all over it. In comparison this by far is a must see even if you do not like psychological shows..\n\nThough my review may be short but if i were to divulge any more words to express this anime it would just be writing AWESOME 1,000,000,000,000,000 TIMES\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    A nail bitting psychological thriller without any supernatural elements. A Must watch.\nStory: First, let me give you a brief about the story. It's main protagonist is a Japanese doctor, Dr. Kenzo Tenma. He's an excellent neurosurgeon and life's going in a perfect way. One rainy night, he falls into a complex fork. He was going to operate on a ten year old boy who has a gunshot in his head. Then, he gets instruction from the director to save a critically wounded mayor. Dr. Tenma believes in the theory all lives are equal. He makes up his mind and saves the boy with a lot\n          \n        of hardwork. Then various unusual events arouse. Obvoiusly I won't spoil it. Reviewing the story, I'd say it's brilliant . The story is like an epic jigsaw puzzle with the central piece missing . The piece only comes up at the end of the story and makes everything feel complete. The plot also has references to literature and psychology. It has various lines which will leave you thinking for days. The main antagonist of the plot is Johan Liebert. He compromised most of the plots's psychology. The story is a masterpiece. One of the best stories I've come across not only in anime, but also in my entire life. It's a classic example of perfection.\nStory Rating: 10/10\n\nCharacters: The story has a LOT of characters. Most of the characters have been majorly touched in the storyline. You'll feel as if the characters are real. By saying this, I'm not exaggerating. Dr. Tenma as a central protagonist is perfect. MonsTer showed how a succesful Neurosurgeons life drastically changed. The supporting characters are Dieter, Wolfgang Grimmer, Inspector Lunge of the B.K.A, Nina Fortner. They were pretty likeable and intersting characters. But the most important character of this show is Johan Liebert. Johan has to be the best anime villian. Most villians are aggresive, hot headed and masculine. But Johan's only weapon is the monster inside him. You'll realise more when you watch the anime. He is kind and cruel. Ironic huh? But true. Johan increased the epicness of this nail bitting thriller. I can't pick out any flaw in character development.\nCharacters: 10/10\nSound(Voice Acting+Music): I watched the English dub. It was rather flawless. I liked every single characters voice. My favourite was that of Johan. His voice expressed his calm. All characters could express their emotions. Especially Nina's voice. Getting to the music part, it was okayish. The music felt good during the show but it didn't make me want to hear it after the show. It could have been better IMO. Just my opinion.\nSound: 8/10\n\nArtwork: It was pretty good. The drawings were sharp and the animations were almost fluid.The faces and eyes could clearly speak the emotions of the characters.\nArtwork: 8.5/10.\nConclusion: AWESOME. Has to be one of the best anime ever made. Definitely the best psychological thriller. Light years ahead of the other psychological thriller animes I watched. Naoki Urasawa is a  legendary mangaka.\nOverall: 9/10\n        "},

I don't think I can, because there's just TOO MUCH TO WRITE. \nOk.. Basically, it's about a doctor who saves a kid that was about to die. Well, that seemed to be the biggest mistake the doctor name Dr. Tenma has ever made because the kid grows up to be some kind of murderer and a real master mind. \nStory: \nwow, to begn, this is probably one of the very few long series I have seen. (the other being Marmalade Boy), I rarely watch any series longer than say, 25 episodes. But something about this\n          \n        series just got me hooked on it. The story is definitely mysterious and its sort of creepy in a way. At least I was while I was watching it. Anywhos, the story has so much details and so much backgrounds, it's simply.. brilliant. \nArt: \neh, the animation wasn't as great compare to other series, but in a way, I'm glad it had that realistic human look because if they had huge eyes and pink hair, I would probably be freaked out. \nI think one of the other reasons that maybe they used that certain art style is perhaps to make it more realistic. I mean c'mon, the details are so realistic, let's not ruin it here. \nI'm gonna skip Sound because honestly, it wasn't too great and not alot of BGMs stood out for me during the long ass series. \nCharacters: \nIt's similar to the reason as explained in 'story'. There are alot of characters and if you don't like alot of em, then this series is not for you. Sure there are the main characters, but I can't even count how many other characters were introduced throughout this series. And it's even worse because you have to actually remember some of them because they appear in the early parts of the anime and then shows up again later in the series. \nBut overall, I think they did a great job connecting all these characters in one way or another. Not to mention how creepy the killer is. He even appeared in my dream.. or nightmare I should say. \nOverall, I'm not too much of a fan of mystery and such, and the series barely had any romance, but I have to say it is the story that just amazed me and the details of it. It really got me to feel the way the characters were feeling in some scenes. Anyway, I think it is an interesting series to watch and definitely worth watching all 70+ of em. \n        "},

Everything he has worked for is ruined when he saves the life of a boy called Johan. After this all the drama, plot twists, betrayals,and just plain insanity starts as Dr.Tenma has to figure out just who is this 'monster' that has criminals shaking in their boots.\nOne thing that made me a little cautious of this anime was the pace but once it got past the rough spots I could not put this one down.  One think I did like was that every little thing in each\n          \n        episode contributes somewhat to the entire plot. Even the minor characters have some bearing on everything in the end, each answering questions and bringing up even more.\nI feel the art deserves some sort of special treatment on this one. When I first saw the art I did not like it that much but after watching the anime more and more it just seemed more unique than any other anime I had seen before. It had a realistic tone to it which provided more in overall enjoyment. Although  I think that the noses were really exaggerated. One characters nose, Dr.Reichwine's, was just so large I chuckled a bit when I first saw it.\n I gave this anime a 10 overall because I believe that the plot, character development, and story are so intellectually put out that it just added to the enjoyment of the anime in all its entirety. \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    For yet another time, another compelling jewel exhibited itself upon my eyes. The anime series ‘Monster’, adapted from the famous Naoki Urasawa’s manga of the same title offers a rather peculiar experience. It was such a lengthy show with 74 episodes, rich with complexities, to the point that writing a fully objective review seems improbable. The show had its flaws, quite many of them to be honest, but those are shrouded nicely under its charm. Evidently, I’m being ambiguous and subjective here, but Oscar Wilde once said ‘It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors’, thereby, I think, it’s justifiable.\nThe plot takes\n          \n        place in Germany; some years after the Berlin Wall went down, not long after the World War II. Based on that timeline, the series tried its best to mimic the real world, the lifestyle and the landscape, the pub, the red light district, the underworld syndicate and the politics; all of the components form a frighteningly realistic duplicate of our world. Subtly and gently, we’re immersed into that artificial world that’s not so difference from ours, in which the chain of events began.\nTo the best of my knowledge, there’re not many series that thoroughly explore the every tiny bit of humanity; Monster happened to be one that vividly presented it in a rather shady theme with quite gloomy tone. It questions morals, ethics and conscience and plays with psychology. The fear, terror, love, hatred, happiness, anger, sorrow, and despair; it gives you chills every time you realize how realistic those emotions are expressed as you subconsciously blend into the characters. \nIronically, although being extremely realistic, the story tends to be nonsensical and rather illogical. This seemingly contradictory fact is surprisingly what makes monster really amusing; after all, we humans, the most logical creature are quite illogical, aren’t we? It was such commendable feat on how Monster cleverly obfuscates the boundaries of conventional mind through the intense emotional exposure. Will one play along with the hypnosis? The decision might drastically affect one’s enjoyment toward the series.\nFor some last words, curious minds who are interested into criminological psychology and for those who love to put some thought into philosophical view of humanity would likely find great enjoyment. Be warned though, it was such an emotion driven show, thus skeptical thinking is best put off board to best enjoy the show. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    After finishing it, I have always admire this sort of anime mainly due to its consistency to be interesting despite being over 50 episodes. Despite being good, I do not believe I will ever watch this a second time not because it is bad, but of all the unfortunate events that has happen in the series.\nWhile the series focuses on a reality equivalent to others, it gives you a chill of suspense that something out of the ordinary will happen. This is constantly reflected on the fact that the antagonist of the story is continuously causing horrific crimes yet police officers around the world refuse\n          \n        to believe his existence even when his name is repeated several times. \nThe antagonist is perhaps my favorite character due to his ability to elude the police, his intelligence that surpasses anyone in the story and even how he acts. On the outside, he is charismatic and looks like a good person, but by that time, the audience knows he is a mysterious monster lurking with plans in store that no one can comprehend. \nI cannot say much about him due to being spoilers, but if you want to watch the anime just for this character, feel free to do so. He is essentially the one that weaves the story throughout.\n"},

The reality, however, was a let down.\nLet me start out by saying that I by no means dislike this anime and by all means, if you're into the psycological and thriller genre's give it a look. But it is definately not the best I've seen, nor is it a masterpiece.\nStory 8/10:\nAlthough the actual story is great, what it lacks is pace. Too slow in some places, too condensed in others and snapping to new locations\n          \n        and events without any segway. This anime took 74 episodes to say what could have easily been articulated in almost half that and although looking back there was always something enthralling happening, it felt as if I were watching it in slow motion. I feel as if cutting down the script in the right places would have done wonders for this anime, perhaps even make it the masterpiece it is heralded as.\nArt 6/10:\nFor me, if an anime is going to take place in a universe so strikingly similar to our own, the art should add something missing from what we see every day, otherwise the point of choosing animation as a storytelling medium is lost on me. The colour pallet felt very bland, perhaps adding to the feeling of watching in slow motion, the quality of the animation was average.\nHowever, it's two saving graces from a bad score are the realistically designed and animated characters to match its setting and it's use of techniques such as foreshadow.\nCharacters 10/10:\nIn this respect, Monster excels. After watching this anime the watcher can feel a somewhat intimate knowledge of the characters, the voices are very well matched to the characters visually and in regards to the script, the dialogue was somewhat drab but admittedly this matches the characters too. I don't really have anything bad in this regard (And I'm a picky fucker)\nEnjoyment 8/10:\nWell, I think I've covered why Monster was somewhat a letdown for me, but I'll be damned if the finally isn't a banger.! It really does a good job of drawing you in despite all its flaws which I think is where it gets so much undying admiration. Not to mention the psychologically unnerving elements being super effective. I'm giving this an 8 not based on my personal enjoyment but the enjoyment I feel I would had watching this without listening to those who put it on a pedestal\nOverall 7/10\nAs I said, I don't dislike this anime. It's a damn sight better than a lot I've seen, and it would be even better if it wasn't help up so highly in the anime community as the savior of psychological thrillers.\n        "},

Monster is the rare exception to those descriptors. It rises above these descriptors; it is legendary.\nArt:\nMonster's realistic art form works perfectly for what it is trying to do. The art enhances the dark nature of the story, and allows for extremely detailed, expressive faces of all nationalities.\nThe cities are animated and drawn extremely well; locations like Heidelberg, Dusseldorf, Prague, Munich, and many others seem almost photorealistic in nature, and are magnificent setpieces for the story. \nSound: \nThe\n          \n        soundtrack, though relatively short, is an integral part of monster.

I can't say much more, in fear of spoilers.\nEnjoyment: \nMonster is similar to the television show-a slow burn that builds up throughout the series, exploding at certain points.

Instead the first 2-3 episodes of an arc are used to set up the supporting cast. At points like this it does sometiems feel slow as it may feel like no progression is being made in the story itself although it helps character development  with dedicating these episodes to them. These episodes also will help to tie in with plot points later on in the arc.\nCHARACTERS\n          \n        - Monster has a  wide range of characters. With its many  supporting characters that get introduced it  shows many different type sof characters.  Its main lead character Tenma is a very interesting  character seeing him developing over the series. The series also has what is one of the most memorable villains in anime.\nSOUND - The sound of Monster is reallly well done the music fits the different atmospheres that the arcs take place in\nART / ANIMATION - So the art of the series is very well done however since this series was made over a decade ago the animation is a bit outdated.\nThe animation does a good job of conveying the atmosphere of the  different places that Tenma goes to.\n\nOVERALL - Monster is one of the few series that could be described as a masterpiece. The only thing that truly holds this show back is its outdated animation.\nIn all its 74  episodes it magnes to all tie togehter and keep you interested all the way through.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I literally made an account on MAL to post a review of this masterpiece, the product of the genius Naoki Urasawa. I was always a fanatic of psychology and drama overall, and I thoroughly enjoyed anime of the type, and when I watched Monster, it was like I was rediscovering not only the genre I love the most, but in the same while, revisiting the human mind and how it functions. \nLet's cut to the chase, though.\nMonster tells the story of a brilliant neurosurgeons; Dr. Kenzou Tenma. Tenma is a Japanese (go figure) surgeon who came to Germany under Udo Heinemann's will, for his amazing\n          \n        work and great benefit to the Eisler Memorial Hospital. Tenma has it all in the beginning, appreciation from his co-workers, a hot fiancée that 'loves' him, a bright career under the care of Heinemann, the guy has it all.\nOne day Tenma operates on an Opera singer under the order of Udo, which is completely typical, but on the other side of things, a Turkish man enters the hospital before the singer, yet dies because Tenma doesn't operate on him. The encounter with his wife and child marks Tenma. The main reason for the whole plot is Tenma's reaction to this event, it marks him psychologically.\nTenma chooses to operate on a child who was shot in the head instead of the Mayor, the child came in first, and keeping in mind the whole Turkish guys' death, Tenma after a lot of psychological struggle saves the young child.\nIn exchange for saving the young child, not only his career but his life falls apart; Fiancée leaves him, loses his position, and loses all hopes for a brighter career.\n...Until one day, the killing of a few individuals restore everything to Tenma, his fiancée, his position, his career... After years of this event, Tenma seeks to know the truth after witnessing a terrible event, and seeks to correct the right he had committed by saving the life of the boy.\nMonster drives us around many parts of the world, mainly Germany and the Czech republic, other countries are mentioned but ever so rarely. This anime literally depicts every single psychological phenomenon that could happen. Fear, despair, horror, sadness, joy, hope... Monster has it all.\nThe story itself is just amazing. Every single episode left me breathless as to WHAT would happen to the characters I loved so much. You won't only get attached to Tenma, but people who are with AND against Tenma throughout the story, the characters have such great charisma, the secondary characters who play a large role also have an established storyline. Tenma's path to justice, making things right after the killings of innocents demonstrates polar morals at their finest. The antagonist is a pure genius who lacks empathy for people, the devious in the antagonist's character is so mysterious that you'll really wonder 'What the fuck is he doing?' at some point in the anime. Every character aside from the ones Naoki Urasawa has made unpleasant are really likeable. The story has a lot of depth and you'll always have a certain clue for things, but that makes things even more exciting.\nThe art is great as well. The character design is pretty neat, every character is well designed, even the ones that don't look so good, you can clearly see the complexity in their design, the main characters are very charismatic design-wise throughout time, there isn't much of a comment that can be made on art other than that.\nSound was pretty good. The sound effects when Tenma takes a turn, or when there's a suspense are just very VERY fitting, and make this suspenseful mood for you. The OST is very good, I loved the opening and the endings were pretty well-made as well. The music that can be heard throughout the anime is very fitting with the situations at hand, calm music, desperate music for the frustrated, sometimes joyful... Monster has it all.\n\nAs I said, the characters are very charismatic overall, their development in-depth is pretty much what makes Monster so special, going so deep into psychology, showing us the very raw despair and frustration people have, manipulation of the characters occur many times, some of them have great moments of genius as well, the whole plot is very intriguing and will make our hero(s) wonder about 'what's happening' more than often. The personality of the characters are very well established, and some completely differ from your expectations at first sight, nevertheless, I can't say I've felt any disgust for any character, even the really 'bad' ones (bad morally, that is), they all play a part in the plot, there isn't much fanservice if at all, and a lot of the characters are straight up badass veterans.\nI really enjoyed this anime, perhaps my enjoyment was one of its kind because I felt something unique, different, while watching Naoki Urasawa's Monster. After the 74 episodes I've watched, I can say I feel no disappointment, not even one bit, but I was delighted to watch such a masterpiece, each special anime leaves a certain feel in you, well, I'm mad Monster is only 74 episodes, that I actually finished watching Monster, because I had such a great time watching it. The suspense, the psychological struggle, how well nihilism is demonstrated at many points, the political nature of man, etc... Monster has it all.\nSo, if you're ready to be amazed out of your mind, just watch this. There is no reason ever NOT to watch this. People speak of horror but personally I wasn't scared at any moment (and I can be sensitive when it comes to violence but Monster had acceptable-tier stuff).\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Where to start with Monster? The overall impression after watching is that it is a fantastic anime that deserves to be watched at least once. The premise the story is based on is a fantastic blend of morality and ethics. The opening was great and the pace leaves the audience on tenterhooks throughout. \nThe character development meant that the audience really feels for each and every character, from the villains to the good guys. The background story and changes that the characters go through reveals a lot about human nature and you often feel sorry for even the worst natured characters in the end.\nI had\n          \n        a lot of free time on my hands and was considering which anime to watch next, and browsing through the forums on here I found Monster. I'm glad I did, I was looking for a drama and not something farfetched from reality and judging by the reviews Monster seemed to tick a lot of these boxes. However, I do feel that it does fall short in some aspects.\n*Possible Spoilers*\nThe main antagonist, Johan, around whom this anime centres, seems to have some attributes that are too removed from reality in some parts of this anime. I understand that he is portrayed as a genius of sorts but there are some holes in the plot that do not sit well with me. For instance, how would a boy who has just come out of brain surgery be able to poison the candy that the hospital director then goes on to eat and share? \nAs well as the candy, his information gathering on many of the families seemed a bit too unrealistic in my view. The manipulation aspect was overplayed in my book and need not have been stretched so far, in fact, it seemed to lose a lot of its sheen due to overuse. At first it seemed cold and quite unnerving how Johan could manipulate people but some of the scenarios weren't quite as realistic.\nIn my view Monster could have been cut down a few episodes and I am disappointed at the portrayal of Johan as superhuman like which is a recurring theme in many anime which I was specifically trying to avoid, in fact it had stark resemblance to Death Note at times.\nThe bottom line is though these gripes of mine are there because I really wanted Monster to be an anime that deserved a 10 score, and I feel that if this was fixed it would fully deserve it and more. \nWould I recommend Monster? Definitely. If you're a fan of anime then I think it is a must watch at least once sort of anime. It is a bit long, not because of the number of episodes but in terms of where I feel the story seemed to be stretched out. My complaints may seem numerous, but please remember when making them I am not comparing Monster to any other anime I have seen, I am comparing it to the perfect benchmark. \n        "},

Kenzo Tenma is a renowned suergon at a hospital and is a very good morale man, who believes\n          \n        all lives are equal and all he wants to do is save lives. however after learning that the hospital he works for is not at all as good moraled as he is, he makes a choice to save a young boys life over a patient that has came in after him being the governor or some shit. Tenma successfully saves the boys life. years later a string of murders occurs and he finds out that that young boy is a true monster killing like a maniac, and now it's up to tenma to stop him. See, the story of Monster is truly about unraveling the secrets of the killer that Tenma saved, as well as the morales that tenma believes every life is precious. story - a perfect 10\nThe art and animation to the show is not really the highpoint in my opinion in this show because it really isn't something spectacular. it's an interesting art style but it is mainly just there to get the job done. but I wouldn't knock it, it's just mainly dated, I mean it is 2015, this looks shit compared to what's in anime today. art and animation- 7\nThe sound is one of the best thing being done in this show. It not only perfectly executed but it's easily one of the best musical tracks I've ever heard in an anime. The opening is the true definition of art and it is beautiful. with a definite high point in the show I give the sound a solid well deserved 10\nThe charecters are actually awesome, and I would go into them one by one, but the cast is HUGE! Mainly a must see to understand why, but I will say that the reason the charecters are awesome in monster, is because every last one of them is likeable to either absolutely amazing to very creative, especially johan's character (the killer). truly the character side of the show deff deserves a 10 as well for having such a large cast and ALL of them being likeable.\nmy main reason for this show to be recommended, is because this show is the best definition of how a psychological thriller should be, and has truly the most evil main villan I have ever seen in my entire anime watching years. it's a one of a kind a must not miss if your into the psychological thriller genre. \n        "},

The event of the Anime takes place during the period of Cold War in Germany, specifically during the period of Berlin Wall dividing Germany into the East and the West, and the period after the fall of Berlin Wall. With this in mind, it is for sure that you will be coming across\n          \n        some facts of the historical events, especially the struggle for power among elite groups within the country and the discriminations of German citizens on other ethnic groups. \nThe story is centred around a Japanese doctor named Tenma pursuing a cold-blooded serial killer Johan, who along the way murders many people that have ties with him in order to erase his traces for investigation. Doctor Tenma, who feels responsible for saving such a monster back to life 10 years ago, now sets off on the journey to stop the serial killer. Throughout his journey following the killer, doctor Tenma is then accused to be the killer instead, thus besides pursuing the real murderer, he has to evade from being caught by the police. \nThe development of the story takes a slow pace to include many events and introduce many characters along the way. Even though I thought that it might be boring with the slow progress, but I was proven wrong by the author and producer, they really know how to make each episode of this Anime enjoyable.  I was also pretty curious why the author kept on introducing so many new characters along the way and thought that some were not necessary, but then again, I was surprised by the fact that some characters that were introduced along way, later had significant roles in story, which took me by surprise. \nEven though the story is mainly focused on pursing the serial killer, there were many mysteries along the way. Each of the mysteries was uncovered one by one, sometimes those were mind-blowing, which made me pretty much enjoy the psychological aspects of this Anime. The author really never failed to impress me. \nThe art may not be very good, but if we take into consideration of the fact that the Anime was aired in 2004, I would say it's quite good. But most importantly, because the event in the Anime was happened in the 20th century during Cold War, I think they intentionally kept the art to be quite old as during that period of time. Overall, I still think it's good. \nThe sound, especially the OPT and EDT, at first I really thought it was quite creepy and dark, but this may be well suited for this type of dark psychological thriller Anime. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Each one of us makes mistakes. Some mistakes have greater consequences than others. There are little, nonessential mistakes that are forgotten right away, but there are also fatal mistakes that will hunt you down for years. \nWhile believing what he is doing is right, Dr. Tenma makes mistake. The one whose live he saves, who he believes to be an innocent child, turns into one of the most evil men you’ll have the displeasure to meet. Being hunted down by his ‘mistake’, Dr. Tenma decides to ‘right his wrong’. This is the story of Monster in a nutshell. Sounds simple doesn’t it? \nWhile watching this\n          \n        show I realised why the description of it was so simple; you cannot make it more detailed without spoiling anything. \nAt first I was quite sceptical about Monster. The story sounded interesting enough, but the length was terrifying. Now I know that there are anime out there that are much longer than Monster is, but still 74 episodes is quite a considerable length. Anime with a large amount of episodes (let’s ignore the term long – running since I’m not too sure when exactly you can call an anime that) tend to have a lot of filler – episodes, which I’m personally not a fan of. \nHowever, when I finally got to Monster I was pleasantly surprised: in the range of 74 episodes there was only 1 (max.2) episode that was skipable. I wouldn’t even call it filler, just that it didn’t add much to the plot. Each other episode, even when it doesn’t seem important, adds something to the plot. Sometimes it's something little that helps you understand a certain character a bit more, sometimes it's something crucial that makes the plot twist. Monster has so much quality with regards to the story it tells and it keeps it up till the last episode.\nThere is however a problem, at least if you want to call it that. The show starts rather slow. It's not until episode 11 or something that it starts getting you on the edge of your chair. Before that, I personally didn't have the urge to marathon the series, it was an episode or two at the time. After episode 11….you can say I was hooked. \nHowever, if you consider that Monster has 74 episodes, the slow start shouldn't come as a surprise. It is even forgiven.\nA nice thing about the series was the setting: it wasn't in Japan (like most of the anime is) and it wasn't limited to only one location. We get to see different cities in Germany and a bit of Prague. All of it was really well captured.  \n\nNow, as for the characters….this is another aspect which pleasantly surprised me. All characters are well thought - through and get quite some development. There are not that many characters who'll leave you indifferent to them - they all make an impression. Some of them you'll hate, others you'll love. Some of them you'll think of as wise, for others you'll feel sorry. Monster really cares about its characters and it goes into depth of their souls.\nThe confusing thing about the characters was their nationalities. Until it's said in the anime where a certain person comes from you cannot tell. However, I liked the fact that there were different nationalities like Germans, Japanese, English, Vietnamese and Czech \nThere are many characters and most of them are worth mentioning, however I'd like to talk about these two here:\nDr. Kenzou Tenma\nTenma starts of as a naive neurosurgeon who does exactly what he's asked to do. This changes when he's forced to face the ugly truth of reality. Tenma is driven by the belief that all lives are equal and because of it starts to go against his superiors. This is the first step in his development that we get to see. Throughout the series, Tenma gets tougher while still holding on to his beliefs. Life doesn't treat him nicely, but no matter what happens, Tenma stays a doctor who'll save people's lives. This is quite interesting: Tenma toughens up, but still has his original goals in sight. \nJohan Liebert \nJohan, often referred to as the Monster, is the boy who Dr. Tenma saved and who turned out to be a cruel serial killer. This is the only main character who gets no development whatsoever. Oddly enough, this is a good thing. Johan is covered in mystery. We don't know that much about him or about his motives. Sure, we get to know something ABOUT him from time to time, but we don't get to know HIM. We never get to see what he feels, what he likes, what he dislikes. Put in another way, we never get to see what's going on from his perspective, even though we get him to see alone a few times. Why is this a good thing? Because if we would see things from his pov or know more about what he thinks, Johan would seem human. \nJohan is this dark cold beautiful mystery. If this amazing character would be portrayed as more human, he would loose his charm. There would be no 'Monster', there would probably be a 'poor, lost, confused boy' and that is not what the show aims to show us. This is the first anime I've seen till now, which holds on to that 'evil is evil'. \nThere are a few tiny moments in which Johan shows that he's human, for example when we get to know that he dearly cares about his twin sister, Anna Liebert (aka Nina Fortner). Those little moments make quite the impression thanks to the fact that Johan isn't humanised in the remaining time.\n\nI'll be short on the art of these series; he thing I liked is that it was more realistic than the majority of the anime which fitted into the more heavy, serious tone of Monster than most anime have\nThe music fitted the series and there are plenty of themes in the soundtrack that I can listen to on their own. My favourites are the pieces called 'we'll be waiting of the night' and 'grain'. The latter is also the opening for the series. It is an alternative opening and I love it\nThere's no other way to conclude this review than to say 'watch it'. Monster is truly a magnum opus and worth your time. It is dark and it deals with heavy themes, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you're looking for a mature series that is enjoyable, I can't imagine that you'll be disappointed.  \n\n\n\n"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Let me begin by stating that I am shocked by the rating of this anime.\nIn my honest opinion it is massively overrated. The first word that comes to mind when I think about this anime is BORING.\n** Story ** The story is good, but it is far too much dragged out and the pace is super slow. The suspense building up goes up and down for me during the series. The ending was also a massive letdown and I will tell you why in the characters section.\n** Art ** The art of the anime is mediocre at best. I really do not believe there is\n          \n        a single person that believes this anime has good art and not to mention one deserving a score of 10... There is not much more to say about it other that it is unimpressive at best.\n** Sound ** I usually do not care much for the opening and ending songs, but in this anime it fits the tone of the show which is dark. However the sound themes during the episodes are nothing remarkable and could have been better suited to fit the atmosphere.\n** Character ** This is the most annoying part for me in the show. There are some great characters, but the main characters are not complex at all and do not evolve at all. People saying otherwise are simply ignorant and want to believe is something that is not there. The main character is on a mission to stop a man who seems committed to do evil acts. However no matter how much proof of the wrongdoings of the evil man he gets and how many murders he has done he does not have the guts to do what he intended. This is a massive let down for me because the MC (Dr. Tenma) is a naive man to begin with and remains the same until the very end. He does not grow a pair and does not change at all. You see him the same person in every episode trying to do good and keep away from others so they do not get hurt being near him.  The guy he is trying to stop - Yohan is also not changing at all. He remains the same smart and evil monster he is from episode 1.\n** Enjoyment ** I was really bored with most of the episodes - the action was far too slow paced and the repetition of naive acts from the main cast was annoying quite a lot. There were some interesting twists and the story itself is interesting but the execution of the way it is presented is hindering it massively. \n** Overall ** I would recommend this anime to people who have a lot of free time (74 episodes) and do not mind slow paced shows. I strongly disagree with the common opinion that this anime is very clever - it is not. It cannot compare to Code Geass or Death Note in the meaning that it is not the same type of smart. This anime is like a thriller TV show that is just animated. Slow story and naive annoying MC killed it for me.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I happened to discover this spectacular series as a recommendation from the forums of http://myanimelist.net/. I was searching some anime with psychological tweaks, as I was impressed by what Death Note had to offer. And that brought me to this title. Conventionally, before I start with any anime, I always like to check the first episode; whether that casts some major effect upon me or not. In this case, I was remarkably astonished at its potential. The very first episode is enough in itself to hook anyone with a knack for mind-games and it goes without saying that it’s not an overstatement. It’s not uncommon\n          \n        that some anime tends to start magnificently but fails to keep up the level and eventually transforms into a mass of disappointment. However, with Monster, I can assure that is not the case. Although, it is troublesome to understand certain turn of events (especially the end to me), it continues to rise up until the penultimate episode, reaching the climax at it, and then it concludes in the 74th chapter as an epilogue. The vastness of the series allowed the story to be more elaborate, and it necessarily involves larger number of characters than a 12-episode or a 24-episode anime. Nearly each episode introduces a new character more or less, and depicts his/her emotions, behaviours, thought processes quite neatly in a manner that seems to grow upon oneself. Still, it does not feel overcrowded at any moment. Each individual has parts to play to make the story progress. Again, no character is purely white, nor is it absolute dark. Each one has its own individual tone colour. There'll be certain times when one would definitely wonder as to how could we be certain about the moral stability of any person we know? Among the other notable aspects of Monster, dialogues are concise, background scores are fantastic, and animation is marvellous. I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the manga beforehand. Therefore, I can't compare the two, but what I learned from others is that, this anime follows the manga precisely page by page. Then again, that's hearsay evidence. I can't possibly comment on that yet. Nevertheless, if I ever try the manga (and I do believe I'll try soon enough), then I'll perhaps add my experience there with the manga.\n        "},

There can't be any other way to describe the overall feel of this anime. \nThis anime is said by so many to be one of the greatest of all time, a must watch, a necessary part of any fan's journey in the anime world. I, however, have trouble understanding how anyone, after sitting through all 74 episodes could consider this such a masterpiece or at least as high of a rating everyone seems to give it.\nI enjoy the plot and it is a nice story overall. The realism is felt throughout and the true darkness of people is extremely\n          \n        captivating. The chase between Tenma and Johan, Tenma trying to clear his name, Nina's following closely behind both of them. It's layered, complex and full of twists and turns. I do feel that the story was rather dragged out far too long. At 74 episodes, the number of location changes, additional subplots that were added to the story, the side stories that were just thrown in to add fuel to the plot. It felt like so much more was trying to be drawn out that didn't need to be there. I can' t even begin to speak on how lackluster the ending turned out to be. With a story that seemed like it was heading to end with a climax, I was let down and given instead an allusion of how the anime began, with a few scenes that crept along and faded into the dark. \nThe characters have immense depth as well. What motivates them, their pasts that they hold on to as emotional and mental baggage. They play off of each other well and add to the story.  One of my few gripes with the anime, however, is the sheer number of them and how often they appear and leave as the show progresses. At times, the number of different characters makes the story confusing and leaves you wondering if any of the parts are even necessary. \nThe anime started out strong and felt like it was reaching for something bigger than itself, but then it changed direction and turned in on itself to focus on themes of love, loss, identity, and lost childhoods. The human psyche was a great theme and yet it was sort of a cop-out in the end. It never really went all the way \"THERE\". \nThe music and art direction definitely added to the anime. It was one of the creepiest and spookiest without being about a supernatural entity or even remotely close to a horror anime. The environment and mood carried well and lasted throughout, one of the few redeeming qualities in the anime. \nI don't think Monster was bad overall, I just think it went on a little too long. If this were cut down a bit, refined a little, ended with a true bang, have the protagonists and antagonists really pushed to the edge of their humanity, we might have something different. \nI can see how and why so many enjoy the anime the way they do, but I feel it was almost a chore and so strenuous to make it through all 74 episodes.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Monster is absolutely great. With that said, I think I went in with unfairly high expectations that it just didn't fulfill. But before I dive in to the review, I just have to say one statement. The first 10 episodes are some of the best episodes I've ever seen in any work of fiction, not just anime. Anyways, to the review!\nStory: The story is incredibly intricate. There are plenty of twists, turns, and cliff-hangers to hold you through every episode. My biggest complaint however is that the story just became too convoluted. They just kept adding side story after side story, and character after character.\n          \n        While it was all very interesting, the resolutions to most of these side stories were unsatisfied and didn't truly progress the main story. And with big intricate stories as Monster, there's bound to be a few plot-holes here and there. However, it never took away from the experience and didn't bother me all that much. But it's something I had to address anyway. \nArt: The artwork is incredible especially for being made in 2004. Character models, buildings, and Germany overall looked absolutely wonderful. No complaints here. \nSound: The sound work was also very well done. The guns, characters, etc... all sounded incredibly realistic. The voice acting was incredible, not one weak- link. The music score was haunting and beautiful, SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!! Again, absolutely no complaints here. \nCharacter: The characters were brilliant. I don't think there was one character who I found annoying or boring. Now, the problem I had was that some of these characters weren't really important to the overall story. They were interesting nonetheless but ultimately, they were pointless. With that said, there are a vast array of memorable characters that you will remember for ever. The main protagonist and antagonist are INCREDIBLE! The villain is probably one of the scariest villains I've ever seen in any form of fiction. \nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this Anime a lot. Some episodes felt like it was dragging and the story wasn't really moving around much and it started to feel like a chore. But Monster was still enjoyable, regardless. \nOverall: This anime is extremely good. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect mark from me is because it dragged around in many portions of the story and there were a lot of unnecessary characters and plot elements that were included in there. But even with those unnecessary characters, they were still all very interesting and you cared about what happened to them. The finale could have been better and it did leave you a little unsatisfied. But overall, this was still a very enjoyable experience and for this, I give it an 8. I recommend it!!!!\n        "},

Kenzo Tenma is the neurosurgeon, and the young boy is Johan Liebert (pronounced Yo-han).  Tenma meets Johan about ten years later and figures out he is the serial killer behind the murders ten years ago. And, Tenma is the suspect for all the murders. After Johan leaves Tenma to be, Tenma decides to go on a journey to find Johan and kill him for what he had done. He isn't doing it to prove his innocence. He just wants revenge, I guess.\nArt: 7/10\nI actually will forgive this anime for the art and animation, because it is actually quite good, but it's not the best. This anime was made in 2003 or 2004, so it is actually kind of old. Almost ten... no past ten years old. So, you'd have to expect and old anime like that to have not too good art-style. But, the art-style is fancy and I kinda like it, it just isn't the best.\nSound: 9/10\nI really like the soundtrack, especially the opening that plays throughout all 74 episodes. I didn't really want the opening to change, because it suited the anime and what was going on. So, I'm glad it never changed. All the music and stuff used is extremely good.\nCharacter: 10/10\nI love every single character in this series. Tenma, Eva, Johan, Nina/Anna, Lunge, Grimmer, Suk, Karl, Schubert... wait, nevermind... I fuckin' hate Roberto. Anyway, the characters are developed interestingly, especially Eva Heinneman, her development from the start of the series to the end of the series is truly fascinating. Lunge is still one of my favorite characters, and you will probably read Lunge as \"Lung-je.\" when it is actually \"Loon-gay\". That was not meant to be a joke, that is literally how it is pronounced.\nOverall: 10/10\nI love this anime. It took me a month or so to finish it, but I think I was taking breaks on purpose because I loved it so much. I was sad when it ended, but the anime had such a perfect ending, that I wasn't that sad. It ended with \"insert spoiler here\". Yeah, I spoiled it for ya'. I put a insert spoiler here sign there, that means there was meant to be a spoiler there.

Many anime or manga fail in doing a story that keeps it's serious tone without throwing weak comedy or fan service. Sometimes it's just a show that is supposed to be psychological or dark but ends up as shounen action adventure series. This anime doesn't have that problem and consistently keeps its atmosphere throughout the entire series. \nStory: (8/10)\nThe story\n          \n        rally catches your attention from the very first episodes setting that huge mystery behind Johan Liebert  and series of murders that happen around main character, Kenzo Tenma. Plot focuses on main character's journey to discover the truth we as a viewers  follow him trying to put all the pieces of this puzzles together. Other than that it's just your typical thriller movie constantly keeping you in tension and gives you the feeling that danger awaits on every corner. The setting is really realistic both in characters and environment. Anime contains 74 episodes and i have to admit that it's perfect amount to show everything important. It doesn't rush through anything neither it slows down on showing nothing relevant. I have only 2 complaints about the story. First would be that  some of the episodes in first half seemed a bit unnecessary as it's just about Tenma going from town to town helping some random people and contributing very little to the overall story. Second is open ending. After few episodes in and knowing that anime adapts the whole manga you would expect it to have actual ending. Well, it does come to an end but final scenes live you with some questions and make you tell yourself the rest. I'm not fan of such endings and I feel it was unnecessary to leave viewers with such conclusion.\nCharacters: (9/10)\nThey did very good job in presenting all the main cast. Their motives are clear, we know exactly why they do it and what makes them who they are. Maybe I'm just overexerting but i saw lots of anime marked as psychological that had really weak character development and characters acting against their will just for the sake of plot. They don't try to sell you any cliche cast, instead there's a cast of realistic characters who just seem natural.\nThey made a really good job in creating a villain. He has little screen time what adds up to his mysterious persona. He mainly sits outside of stage pulling the strings and is always few steps ahead of main protagonist. \nOther interesting character is inspector Lunge who adds another perspective to the plot. He's a person who knows very little about events happening he still manages to get closer and closer to solving the case. \nArt: (8/10)\nArt is important aspect of this anime. It really give you feeling like you're watching movie rather than anime making it more realistic what makes it a really good thriller.\nSound: (7/10)\nIt's nothing special, all soundtracks were so forgettable. It fits to the story but they haven't done anything above that, most of the soundtracks sound familiar to something you heard already hundreds of times.\nSummary:\nI would highly recommend this anime for those who what a serious story, or you are just tired of anime with school setting.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Minor Spoilers.\nMonster is quite a daunting anime with a compelling story that reaches into some very tough questions regarding humanity's dark nature and what does it mean to be truly evil. \nI will warn you though that this be quite a time investment with 74 episodes but I guarantee you that by the end, it will be well worth it but its not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. \nThe anime focuses on the life of a world class neurosurgeon by the name of Dr. Tenma voiced superbly by Liam O'brien. Everything in his life is going incredibly well but he questions his morality\n          \n        when he is forced to make decisions that go against his morality that all patients are equal regardless of how privileged they are. He goes against his superiors orders and decides to save the life of a young boy. Little does he know that this choice that he made is going to cause him and the people around him a ton of emotional strife and his perfect life slowly spirals out of control and yet he feels responsible for everything that has happened and he must do everything in his power to stop it. \nThis anime's strongest point is its story because it really grips you after the first episode. The episodes just give you enough information in each episode to get you excited to see the next episode. Unfortunately the story can often be seen as its biggest fault because while each episode gives you a little more information towards the over-arching plot it gets incredibly aggravating because the series could be moving a lot faster than what it does and with 74 episodes it can be a bit of a time sink. There are quite a few episodes that I would consider useless to the overall plot of the story and you keep asking yourself is there a specific reason why this episode exists or does it really contribute to the overall plot of the anime. This anime is incredibly guilty of doing something that I like to call false momentum. What false momentum entails is when you reach a certain plot point of the anime and it gets you excited to see a resolution to that plot point and there is  all this build up within a short number of episodes but it ultimately leads to nothing and therefore as a result the plot point doesn't get addressed until much further in the anime series. Even worse is that there are certain plot points in the anime that have a lot of build up to them only to be completely halted by an episode or two to focus on another character in the series. It's one of the worse feelings to be hanging on the edge of your seat to see a resolution to a plot point only to be left hanging for at least a couple of episodes to address another character in the series. \nThis may been seen as a much bigger fault if you were watching the anime one episode at a time every week as it was being released, but overall its far more forgivable especially if your binge watching the show. The times that it does off the rails with regards to its main plot point in order to address the show's many side characters don't exist for very long maybe 1 to 3 episodes at the most before it gets put back on the rails with regards to its major plot point. \nI think one of the more appealing aspects of its show is its visual aesthetic with regards to its setting and how it designs its characters. All the characters look very realistic for the most part. There are characters with a wide array of differing and realistic body types and it has characters of all ages and ethnic backgrounds and its something you don't see in a lot of anime these days. I do love the setting of the anime because it takes place between the late 1980's to the late 1990's and the majority of the series takes place in Germany and the Czech Republic. This is an interesting setting to build your story on because the Cold War is an integral subject that gets brought up consistently throughout this series and it really lends itself to why so many horrible things have happened to a lot of characters in this series. \nAnother strong aspect of the series is its characters and the amount of development each character has in the series. This series has a large cast of characters. Its understandable that some characters would be more developed than others but on the plus side a lot of the side characters never overstay their welcome where it becomes exhausting or overbearing to deal with them. They're in this series the right amount of time and they always contribute to the overall story arc. One strange thing that I did notice about the series as a whole is that as the series kept dragging on I found myself caring less and less about the main protagonist and the main antagonist of the series and side characters that showed up fairly late in the series or side characters that started off very unappealing at the very beginning of series started to become more appealing and respected as the series carried on. As happy as I was to see this, its not a good aspect of storytelling if your side characters are stealing the thunder away from the main characters of the series. \nUnfortunately my biggest complaint regarding the characters is the antagonist Johan. The hype surrounding this character was completely overblown with no sense of fulfillment afterwards. They started building up this character the right way at the very beginning of the series but as the series continued it disappointed me that for as big and scary that Johan was and his troubled history that made him the way he was we never got to see him do as many evil things as what I would of liked to see. He is kind of an evil force that works behind the scenes, a puppet master per se. There is a lot of great backstory of why Johan is as evil as he is and the atrocities that had in but without any visual stimuli. He is literally a tiger without teeth, or a missile without a warhead. It may look big and scary, but if you peel back the layers than you realize its nowhere near as scary as what he could be. He had plenty of opportunities to live up to his reputation that was exemplified throughout the entire series. There was a character in the series called Roberto and in my eyes he was a much more of a compelling villain than Johan.\nThis message that this anime exemplifies is what really strengthens it. This is not an easy anime to watch or sit through because it deals with a lot of difficult subject matter such as murder, child abuse, prostitution, the death of innocence, betrayal, psychological reprogramming, and torture. It really exemplifies on how monstrous people can become and what horrors humanity are actually capable of. It really analyzes why people can commit such atrocities and I think of the biggest things it exemplifies is that every human being is capable of being a monster regardless if its something that is forced upon us or its just a part of us naturally. I firmly believe that we're all capable of being a monster. We can go through life trying to be the best person we can be but I also believe that we are all but one bad experience or one bad day away from doing an evil act. This anime shows what motivation people can have when it comes to doing certain atrocities and if there is ultimately a justification for it all or do people simply want to watch the world burn. As Johan is constantly referred to as monster in this series and since Dr. Tenma was devoted to stopping this mad-man once and for all, I really thought that this anime was going to cater to the trope that is often seen in revenge stories of does a person need to become a monster in order to stop a monster. Thankfully it doesn't cater to that trope in full effect but it does straddle that line from time within many of the side conflicts in this anime. I'm grateful that in scenes of intense pressure cooler heads do prevail which adds a great amount of depth to the overall series. \nOne thing I will appeal and criticize at the same time is the end credits of this anime. I love the end credits of this anime because it shows scenes of a picture book that is a huge plot point in this anime called The Nameless Monster. During the end credits you'll see 3 or 4 pictures of this picture book without any context whatsoever and every 5 or 6 episodes you'll see 3 or 4 more different pictures of this picture book and I love this because its completely open to interpretation and your trying to make sense out of what your seeing and the story its trying to tell. Unfortunately the end credits get ruined half way through the series when an episode of the anime goes into great detail about what the book is about and how it ends and it shows the remaining pictures of the picture book which really makes the rest of the pictures for the end credits in the final half of the anime pretty useless. A minor gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.   \nOverall, this anime is a perfect example of a psychological thriller that deals with some very difficult subject matter. If you want an anime that explores that darker side of humanity than this anime is definitely for you. I just hope the pacing, and the constant use of false momentum does not take you out of it. If your willing to put in the time than I'm sure you can get some good out of it. \nFavorite Character: Wolfgang Grimmer\nLeast Favorite Character: Johan Liebert  \n8/10\n        "},

It makes some minor characters look alike, and can get a bit confusing at times.\nSound: The music was fine, just nothing spectacular. I do like the opening theme, and the first ending theme. \nNow, let's talk about Monster. Just for a short description, a genius surgeon saves a little boy who's almost certainly going to die. After that, stuff starts happening. (I'm not going to say anymore because it spoils a bit of it\n          \n        which is better left to watch).\nMost of the characters were really nice to watch, and the main antagonist is one of the most chilling characters I have ever seen in anime. While Monster may not scare you, it will create a very tense atmosphere at times. It is over 70 episodes, but it's well worth it.\nAs a final note, the last arc is quite possibly one of the best story arcs in anime... ever.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I got recommendation for this anime here n myanimelist. I told them that I like serious anime with deep thoughts (Neon Genesis Evangelion, Noir, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell etc.) and here I got one wonderful piece. I don't really like those long endless anime so when I saw that it has 74 episodes I was really wondering if it's worth watching. Heh I am glad I decided to give it a shot.\nThis anime is very interesting. The plot is mysterious from the very beginning to the very end. There are many scenes that make you think about the meaning. Some people would call\n          \n        it philosophical problems. It has even more powerful effect because of the whole atmosphere of this anime. I finished it today so still have to thing about some things. The ending was kinda epic.\nPeople who don't like blood and characters dying shouldn't watch this. It is not bloody massacre but the whole anime is somehow dark and full of murders. I was glad to watch finally anime where weapon is not just a toy and where villains are not there just to confront the main hero and lose. \nVery important thing for me was that a big part of this series is set in Czech Republic, my homeland. They did quite a good job with Czech texts and even spoken language. However I had to laugh many times :D.\nAnd about the length, people say that this anime has in fact no fillers. Yea I think I can agree. 74 episodes but all of them somehow related to the main story with something new and important for the plot.\nSo the result: This anime is exceptional. So long and yet so valuable. Watch it, if you are looking for SERIOUS anime.\n        "},

By combination of atrocities against humanity and the use of children's stories, the author has created an incredible story-scape with many levels of depth and complexities that sometimes only  become clear as you dwell on them later, adding to the overall gravity and gorgeously-crafted intrigue. \nIt's most definately a show that requires a\n          \n        brain to retain knowledge to reach a full effect, as the presence of almost all characters, actions and pasts bare great significance elsewhere in the plot. \nI particularly love the struggle against a characters morals, backed up by the stories which add a delicious circular motion to this immaculately weaved web of work. \nI could rant for a century... Just watch it! \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    It might look silly that I ranked every single item a 10, but that's really how I feel about Monster. It's a masterpiece for several reasons.\nIf you want to watch an anime series that is directed toward a mature audience -- not the kind of \"mature\" that involves gore or sex -- this anime is for you. It's a mystery, a thriller; it has elements of action alongside heavy moments of psychological horror.\nNaoki Urasawa's Monster is really unlike any anime I have ever seen. Anybody who is familiar with his work will know that his art style is a bit more Western at times; and\n          \n        unlike a lot of anime and manga, Monster takes place in Europe, which surprisingly adds some very unique thematic elements to the story.\nFirst of all, there are no characters with superpowers -- no epic battles, no token cute/dumb female love interests, etc. No cliches.  Everything that you find common among the anime medium is absent from this work.\nI like anime because of the complex and unique stories, and Monster is no exception. While at first it seems like the basic mystery/drama story, it quickly becomes a psychological horror, with a large focus on historical and borderline supernatural themes.\nThe story begins shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the majority of the tale takes place 10 years later, when the Wall has finally fallen. The time period plays a very important role in the way the story unfolds, and the historical references -- to communism, the differences between East and West Germany, the Nazi Party and Hitler -- add an incredibly realistic-yet-creepy feel to the story.\nWhile having a good grasp on European history certainly adds to the Monster experience, everything in the story is explained so well that any reader/viewer should not have any trouble grasping the story line.\nThe masterpiece lies in the story line. Urasawa has a true gift when it comes to complicated stories with twists and turns -- where every detail matters; every word holds importance and meaning; every seemingly loose end is masterfully tied up. As a writer myself, I cannot even begin to express how difficult it can be to create a complex story the likes of Monster. Everything is thought out and planned, and even when you become confused -- or think something seems too coincidental -- you later realize that there was a reason for that.\nThe artwork has a slightly less Eastern feel -- sort of a trademark of Naoki Urasawa. You never see a character morph into a strange-eyed face with tear/sweat drops to signify a certain emotion, or anything like that. Character emotions are perfectly depicted in a realistic fashion, and because of the story's realistic feel, you almost forget that you are watching an animated series. If any anime series could be converted into a live-action television show (as long as they stay true to the story), Naoki Urasawa's Monster is that series.\nBeyond that, the tone of the entire story is dark and mysterious. At times, you're not sure what Johan, the antagonist, really is. Urasawa leaves you feeling that there's something supernatural about him, only to remind you later of his human condition. The protagonist, Dr. Kenzo Tenma, transforms in many ways throughout the story, but always manages to stay true to himself.\nIt's even difficult to call the supporting cast a \"supporting cast\" -- every character has their own story, and their own fascinating qualities; and not only do they have their own histories, but everything they do affects the story as well.\nThe complexity of Monster is nearly impossible to portray in a simple review. The art is emotive and clean; easy to absorb and fall in love with. The tone is dark, mysterious and, at times, horrifying. Basically, everything about Monster, to me, is amazing.\nI would honestly put Monster up there with my favorite Hollywood blockbusters, bestselling novels, award-winning films and television shows, etc. In fact, in most cases it's not even \"up there\" with them -- it's better.\nThis series is a must-watch for not just anime fans, but for anybody who considers themselves a fan of art, literature and truly masterful storytelling.\n        "},

Anyone could conjure up that way considering the title of the anime. I tell you, it&rsquo;s the opposite. Every episode is detailed so that every movement of every character is rational.\nThe story has very deep meaning with a very steep learning curve.

However, there are a lot of subplots which push the main story and characters  aside. Some of them were good and well connected to main plot, but most of them were boring and unnecessary. Big plus is that there are no “real” superpowers in this anime .\nBig minus is a length of this anime: 74 episodes. Plot is mostly very good and interesting, but I felt huge disappointment at the ending. The progress of plot suggested that there is going to be  a\n          \n        huge spectacle in the final episodes. But the ending was very weak and nothing big happened at all. \nCharacters: 9/10\nI enjoyed most of the characters because they looked very realistic and unique: young and old, strong and weak, thin and fat, cruel and kind, scared and fearless. The only unrealistic character is the main villain who is the symbol of this anime. His personality is total opposite of his looks . Very charismatic and memorable character, one of the best ever created. A true human monster. The only character I disliked was the main protagonist because he was a real pussy sometimes. \nDrama:  9/10\nLoneliness and despair are felt whole time.  There are lot of main and supporting characters with sad or tragic fate. Most of them are finding their place in society.  There are even disturbing scenes of torture and abuse. Good dialogues.

In my opinion the story isn't even the highlight, it's the journey. It is\n          \n        well executed over 74 episodes, and the pacing is fluid.\nCharacters: 9/10 Extreme attention to detail and personality. Almost every character, whether making an apperance for only an episode or two, or the whole series, has backstories\nworthy of showcase. I watched the dubbed version and the voice acting is superb and really sells the anime.\nMusic: 8/10 Mostly orchestral with some occasional jazz influence. Plenty of ambience pieces very befitting of this anime's atmosphere, nothing bland here and helps carry the story.\nMy only complaint is for 74 episodes, a slight lack of songs. I believe only roughly 30+ tracks( I also, have high expectations of music though).\nArt direction: 8/10 Plenty of atmosphere here, of course with a real setting things will be depicted with realism, but contrast between settings and atmosphere is well maintained.\nFacial expressions are believable, nothing over done, spectacular angles which help paint the moment and smooth animation.\n\nMonster offers a wide array of likable characters, easy to follow story that will keep you enticed and guessing, relatable characters and a sense\nof different walks of life,  mixed with expirences you can take something from.

Probably some of the best elements this series has to offer. It made me want to visit Prague more than any travel book. Less dull and moody than Noir, more realistic and grounded than true fantasy or fairytale, in that sense, the mood is perfect. \nThis series is not fantasy, but contains elements of Romantic darkness and curiosity found in folklore. A serial killer and his mind are explored, and a simple, wonderful, haunting storybook about human evil that is tied to his life. Lots of great twists,\n          \n        interconnected characters and layers revealed. \nWho might like it: \nCan be described as anime for people who don't like anime, or have never seen it. Both the visual and the narrative style are easy and familiar for Americans to get into. There are no childlike/wacky elements found in other classics like Full Metal Alchemist or Cowboy Bebop. If those moments annoyed you, or if you need a break from that humor style, this series is for you. \nHow to sample it: \nYou could watch the first 8 episodes, and it actually holds as a stand-alone tale. One that is so riveting and atmospheric and satisfying that I would give that mini-series a perfect 10/10. If that's all you have time for, commit to at least that. \nThe intro song [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n86hgIXc1BM] and the storybook [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnQA-1qlgI4] featured in the outro give you a good taste of the height of this series' atmosphere. Which is gorgeous, intriguing and downright haunting. At least check out those clips on youtube. \nProblems: \nMy only real issue is during times of slow pacing, the mood and art can dip into bland. Emotional moments in the english dub often fall into corny (this is after the initial \"perfect\" 8 episodes), so the japanese original might make up for that problem (if you're like me, and you can't pick up on acting subtleties in a foreign language).\n        "},

This show has everything – the emotional rollercoaster starts at the very first episode and continues on until the very last moment. \nThis show is a prime example that anime is not \"just for kids,\" that it's a legitimate form of entertainment that can take various shapes and that can be just as realistic and believable as any other form of media. \nThe story itself is absolutely wonderful, with various twists and turns that make your heart explode and stop and... god,\n          \n        I wish I could relieve that first time experiencing them all over again. \nThe art leaves some to be desired, but overall, the technique is fantastic and personally, I prefer it over the current trends in anime character design. Some of the visuals are particularly striking and relevant to the story (for example, the picture book that is quite central to the plot). \nThe music fits the show very well without dominating it – and the intro will forever be a classic in my mind. \nThough most people consider this show notable because of the titular Monster, Johan, I do believe that most of the other characters are also worth praise: Tenma, Nina, Lunge, all of them grow and develop before our very eyes.

It felt that the author left it open ended for the readers and viewers to come up with their own appropriate finale. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster was the first anime that I encountered with the gritty realism to match a good western drama television series - which is probably why there were rumblings about it being turned into a live-action HBO series. A lot anime have a strong fantasy/sci-fi/supernatural element, or a breezy high-school atmosphere, but Monster is very much set in the real world, following real world parameters, and surrounded by the darkness and consequences of real world actions.\nSTORY - 10/10\nDr. Kenzo Tenma is a brilliant surgeon who is faced with a difficult decision early in the series - follow his boss' orders, or perform a surgery that only\n          \n        he can perform to save the life of a young boy. He chooses the latter, and sets in motion a string of events that would have been impossible for him to foresee. And yet he spends the remainder of the series wracked with guilt over that decision, and doing everything within his power to track down the boy - who is now a young man - and stop the reign of terror that the boy has unleashed.\nPretty much the entire story revolves around the boy, Johan. Johan is the titular monster, and the story slowly peels back the layers revealing, little by little, just how Johan became the monster that he is. I got a very distinct Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince vibe from the way that the other characters, predonimnantly Tenma, learn of Johan's past - just as Harry slowly learns of Voldemort's history. The idea that understanding how someone came to be who they are might be the only way to stop them is an interesting one, and the show spends a lot of time trying to figure out just who Johan and his twin sister, Nina, are.\nMore interesting, perhaps, is how Monster chooses to tell its story. Short arcs will unravel, and just when we think that we're about to find out something pivotal, the plot will back off and introduce completely new characters and begin to tell their stories - eventually leading to the place we thought that we were initially going, just from a different angle. While this can be frustrating initially, once you learn to trust that the writer knows what he's doing, it's actually an engrossing way to let the tale unfold. I found that it added layers of complexity to the plot that would be simply unachievable otherwise. Some might complain that it adds too many side plots and unimportant minor characters, but I would argue that those people are missing the point of the story altogether.\nThere is a constant gloominess surrounding the plot, which can be attributed to Johan's almost god-like powers to control everything that is going on around him. The story also touches on a lot of uncomfortable and dark ideas (mostly involving the treatment of children). This causes much of the story to be grim and depressing, but Monster does an excellent job, usually through Tenma or Nina or Dieter, of demonstrating glimmers of light and hope amidst the darkness. And, without giving too much away, the story does conclude on a happier note. \nANIMATION - 8/10\nMonster isn't as visually impressive as a lot of more recent anime. It lacks the dazzle and flash of series with lots of action, and the grittiness of the animation almost makes it feel like it's an entirely different genre of series altogether. But it works within the context of the world that the show is trying to create. \nMy main pet peeve is that the animation of actions is often clunky (people running, in particular, just looks really off in this series). But on the whole, the look of the show definitely adds to the ominous vibe that pervades every frame - the hopelessness that anything can be done to stop Johan. \nSOUND - 8/10\nI watched the English dub of Monster. I found some of the voice acting to be outstanding, while a number of the voices seemed somewhat jarring - they just didn't seem like they would belong to the character on the screen. But the main characters were all well done - Johan, in particular, has a haunting, yet soothing, quality to his voice that is really unnerving.\nThe series' score is also strong, and I often found myself entranced by the music during important scenes. \nCHARACTERS - 10/10\nLike any great series, the true strength of Monster is its characters. Dr. Tenma is an appropriately broken man through much of the story, unsure of his place in the world after the decision that he made. Even the look of his character shows the weight that he carries around on his shoulders. But despite all of his doubt and guilt, he always tries to do the right thing - the very quality that caused him to save Johan in the first place. Tenma is a simple character in that regard - you always know that he will do the right thing. But there is still a complexity to him that is intriguing, and he is an easily sympathetic character that viewers can identify with and cheer for. \nJohan, of course, is far more interesting, as most well-constructed villians will be. Johan is shown as the embodiment of evil, the cause of countless deaths across Germany, and even stretching into Czechoslovakia. But the truly terrifying aspect to Johan is that he's rarely the one who pulls the trigger - he has the ability to compel others to do his bidding. He is charismatic, and if we weren't privy to the fact that he is who he is, he might come off as a very likable character. In fact, as we unravel the story of Johan and Nina's past, we often find ourselves feeling a certain amount of sympathy for Johan. Nina (an overly good character, despite her own troubled childhood) serves as an example of what kind of person Johan might easily have become, had certain things never happened to him as a child.\nThere are a lot of secondary characters in Monster. Some of them are important, and others less so. But almost every one of them is given personality and nuance, and there are very few series (anime or otherwise) that achieve as much with as many characters as Monster does. Many of the key characters show a tremendous amount of development over the 74 episode span of the series. \nThe series tries to make the emphatic point that every person has a monster inside of them, but that each individual's choices determine whether they are good or evil. The constrast of two characters like Grimmer and Roberto shows just how easily a few choices can lead people with very similar backgrounds down entirely different paths. Eva, Tenma's ex-fiance who can't seem to come to grips with the fact that she still loves him and spends a decade trying to replace him, is another excellent example of a complex character who shows excellent growth over the length of the series. \nAll in all, I would put the character work in Monster right up alongside a series like The Wire, I was that impressed with it. I've rarely come across anything quite like it in an anime. \nENJOYMENT - 10/10\nI think I've rambled on quite a bit about everything I enjoyed about this series - the story is compelling and the characters are nuanced and detailed. It really was a pleasure to watch. It might be a bit slow-paced for some viewers who prefer a lot of action or humour, but if you enjoy slow burn dramas with plenty of tension, Monster works quite well. I'd currently rank it among my top five anime series.\nOVERALL - 10/10\nThe story is incredibly well-crafted, and the unique way that it unfolds adds so much complexity to the world that Monster builds. The characters are all well done - even the obvious heroes  have flaws, and the obvious villians garner sympathy (except maybe Roberto). And there are plenty of characters who are more ambiguous. And the series touches on plenty of weighty themes and ideas (more than I could ever get into in a review - you could easily write an academic paper on this series). \nI would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a more serious and deep story. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    So .. Many people claimed that this anime is a masterpiece and wadsoever. For me , i did enjoy this anime but not to the extent of what people exaggerate to be such a masterpiece and so on . I would only give about 8.5/10 overall. Just read on and i will tell you why.\nStory : It all started when a doctor saved a 10 year old boy that all the messy murders happened because those hospital directors being idiot and eat the sweets that the fan gave to the 10 year old boy as gift for wishing him recovery. Actually before that , there\n          \n        are darker story but the real part started when Tenma is kind of like being suspect as a murder. There he goes on his run , chasing after the real culprit.Even towards to the end of anime , there are many questions answered but the story is great. Many dark parts , it has very sad parts and finally the ending people wanted to see <3 HAPPY ENDING~~ However i would only give 8/10 for the story because I did not get to see the reason why the culprit done all these shit and how did he kill them ... Here i thought it will be revealed around the last 2 episodes... Though i am pretty sure the story does not end at episode 74 so i gonna check out the manga ....\nArt : Well , i kind of like the art style because it gives the very very classic type of movie production feeling . Back days when we watched tom and jerry , popeye , that kind of art style feeling . So i kind of like it cause it makes me feel like i am back in the past watching some cartoon again. Those characters are really well drawn as well . Because i do not have the image of Germans and so forth but they did really well on making the characters to a extent like we can see the differences between Asian and Germans . Not like many characters .... Be it foreigner or japan , the characters are still designed as loli or whatsoever bullshit. So i would give 10/10.\nSound : Opening song did not catch my attention because it was basically just instrumental playing and is not a very good one at that. However on the other hand , the ending song is VERY sad . There are 2 versions of ending song , one sang by female and another sang by male . The female one , it is Japanese version and the other one that sung by male is the english version i think . Both versions kind of like did a great job in expressing the sadness along with the lyrics. It is like telling us what johan is feeling or a message to johan , at least in my opinion lols. There is also great soundtrack during some part of the arc when characters get closer to the truth , that has great crescendo making it very intense. 7/10\nCharacter : This 74 episodes anime run is so long to be honest . And really , i don't see much character development in any of the characters . Tenma remained the same way as he is towards to the end . Anna , she became sort of crazy and very determined to kill the culprit that cause all these murders but still remained helpless , weak to the end . Johan , the culprit as well . He remained as a monster to the end killing many many people without us knowing the reasons behind it... Well , there are some characters that developed well in the sense of looking for the truth behind what Tenma said. The part of their arc when these characters getting closer to the truth of these murders made it very intense and they began changing their views on Tenma's story. I must say that the most exciting part in this show is on Johan , the monster side. I get very excited on Johan's Past and how is he feeling and what he actually is thinking when he killed all those people. The way he manipulate people and the way he is able to sniff out all those murderers even to the point of knowing all the details about them made me curious how is he able to do so . He is a REAL monster.8/10\nEnjoyment : Overall , i enjoy this series a lot . Many cool and great characters were there to make the show intense and exciting . NO HATES PLEASE : The villains in this show are the one that helps me enjoy this show the most. The way they say about how this particular person they look up to.... and just how charming this person he was.... and how scary he was... ( Johan) It just makes me hyped hyped hyped want to see more and learn more about Johan . He isn't your usual villains in any other animes . You just can't bring yourself to hate him even after what he done . AT LEAST , in my opinion . so i will give 10/10.\n        "},

It has one of the greatest story lines of any anime and the character development is nothing short of fantastic. The story follows a genius brain surgeon named Kenzo Tenma who saves a boy from a near-fatal gunshot wound to the head, against his director's orders. The boy grows up to be a serial killer and Tenma has to search for him while proving his own innocence. This synopsis does little to do the series justice but anything more would amount to a spoiler. The only problem I have with the series is its\n          \n        ambiguity and slightly slow-pace to some episodes but this is a very minor detrimental effect from the series as a whole. It also has one of the best endings of any anime I've ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone, anime lovers or not, because it is truly fantastic.\n        "},

This was also my first time to watch anything that Naoko Urasawa did. His work is definitely great in this and I tell you now why.\n(Story)\nMonster story is really addictive it's because even you can predict some things in this anime it's really has many interesting meanings and these meanings are great because they are great example of that can be used in life too.\nStory has many many twists so you cannot always predicted what will happen next. That's why\n          \n        it's left to people to think about and discuss it until the near end.\nAlso storytelling is this once just fabulous. It's start really slowly but after couple of episodes it's just amazing how it can stay right track without going to go any side tracking all episodes  that are in the series is connected somehow to the main plot line.\nMy grade for this awesome story is 10/10\n(Art)\nArt in the Monster looked first really weird it has a nice touching of old animation and it's like you watching really old movie that has old characters in it. But after couple of episodes you just really start understanding the art better and it's actually fits in the series really well. But one thing I have to say about art the persons eye's are almost same kind of which is weird. But all in all good art and definitely fits of this anime's atmosphere.\n(Sound and Effects)\nI really has to say monster definitely delivers in this section also. Music is really scary and effects that goes with make it really connected together. I have ever seen so great effects and music like in this anime. It really keep viewer in the good mood.\nI have to say I kind of got fed up with the OP theme because they are using the same OP whole 74 episodes. But it's atmosphere and scenes that is shown during OP is just amazingly done. And that's really go nicely to atmosphere of this anime. Now ED theme is my favorite one and it's has dark atmosphere in it. And lyrics also seems to be so good that they fit into this kind of anime.\nMonster get's nice 10/10 in music and effects.\n(Characters)\nNow where monster really shines is characters and definitely character development in this one. Because it seen in a lot of this series. All characters are really greatly developed whole series and also viewers see flashback stories most of the characters that has role to play in this anime. There is also many type of characters in this anime. But what finally connects this string is same goal in the end. Also everyone is having emotions too.\nI am going to give this excellent anime 10/10 for characters. and awesome developments that are going on here.\n(Enjoyment)\nI really did enjoyed monster I just watch it and didn't response any kind of other responses. Because this anime is so freaking awesome that I just sat on my chair and watched like 10 + episodes per day. And when it ended I had feeling I wanna watch more.\nMonster get's enjoyment 10/10\n(Overall)\nOverall Monster is great adaptation and is really worthy your time. You just wanna watch more once you are started watching this anime. It can also deliver you awesome character developments, really dark plot and wonderful meanings that could has place also in real life. It also seems what is really important in life with those meanings. Monster is complete anime with all the emotions that it has inside.\nMy final score this EPIC anime is going to be 10/10\n"},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I’ve become a psychologist because I’ve been in love with psychology since a very young age. So when I fall in love with animes and mangas, one of my number one must see stories are psychological ones. They would always showcases the most terrifying and greatest parts of life. But more than that, it always tackles the extents of what human beings can do.\nThere’s a very long review coming as this is the most brilliant psychological story I’ve ever seen.\nAbout the STORY\nFirst let me just say that what I love the most about this series is that, it is made as realistic it can be.\n          \n        There are no nonsense episodes. Every episode is so important that one wouldn’t understand the whole thing if not watch and truly understand every minute of it. I like how the whole journey of Tenma for the truth is expressed in detail. Like how other series uses the “several years after” then that’s it. In this series, all his information gatherings, researches and investigation are in details. It’s like we’re journeying with him. We learn and finds out the truth together with Tenma. Every revelation and turn of events is just mind-boggling and heart-pounding. What really happened in every incident is revealed in a way you will never expect and would really shock you. I am literally pausing for a moment to let the revelations sink in and so I can comprehend it properly. It is very knowledgeable as well because some of the important history of Germany is mentioned. You will learn a lot about the dark times of Germany and some about the Nazi as well. I’ve been fascinated with scary stories that would really give me the chills but this kind of scary story is what I love the most. More than the chills, I always become so bewildered in a good way. Because more than fictional or supernatural scary stories, psychology is a whole lot scarier. This is the very meaning of psychological torture or better yet, this is psychological torture elevated. I love the ending. It’s more than what I’ve expected it to be. I couldn’t ask for more satisfying closure for a magnificent story. With all this amazing things said, I think the most magnificent of all is none other than the AUTHOR. I am just so amaze how the author manages to make the storyline connected to one another even if it is from the past or the present. After revelations, you would think “So that’s what really happened”. Then after much comprehension, you would realize that it so genius. This series is beyond being just interesting or just a great story.  This is the very definition of a genius storytelling. A genius way of creating storylines, plots, and climaxes.\nAbout the CHARACTERS\nThe characters make the whole series even more amazing. They are made as realistic they can be. Because you can really find people like them in the real life which makes it even scarier. All the supporting characters are very much as important as the main leads. They play very significant roles in Tenman’s journey on finding the truth. You will be amaze how every character is surprisingly connected to the truth behind the MONSTER Johann.\nAbout TENMA KENZO\nIt’s so ironic because you could say that literally it is Tenma’s fault because Johann really is supposed to die by Nina’s hand that night. That’s why I wouldn’t blame him if he feels responsible for all the people who are killed by Johann. It is just so sad that Tenma is always one step behind Johann that he always witnesses how people is broken by Johann and worst of all, killed. Even more than that at the end of the day, because he saved Johann that night, many people died. He would be forever be reminded that he’s the one who let a MONSTER live. I feel so bad for Tenma for shouldering all the horrible things that is happening around him just because he chose to save a boy’s life. Just because he considers that human lives are equal. I could only imagine how that feels. Amazed that Tenma is able to maintain his sanity throughout his whole journey. Even after witnessing all the horrible things that Johann did, Tenma still manages to maintain his beliefs and principles in life. And not be influence by the paranoia that Johann brings. That is their biggest difference because Tenma has a very strong heart and will even after being miserable because of Johann.\nAbout JOHANN\nJohann is an example of what would happen to a person surrounded by twisted adults. What a person experience when they are young defines what they are growing up. Because of the irresponsible and twisted environment that Johann had, something horrible triggered his twisted world. That’s why even after all he has done, at the end of the day, I feel so bad for him. I could only imagine what he had to go through to become such very unstable and twisted person. Oddly enough, I just can’t bring myself to hate Johann despite being the most realistic villain I’ve ever seen. People like him prove the extents of the human mind. He has this magnificent yet creepy charisma that influences people to do things. He knows who to use and what to say to those people as to push them into insanity. Indeed, like a genuine evil but a lot scarier from fictional stories. The scariest thing about Johann is that he knows very well how to use someone’s weakness to manipulate them. He has this terrifying yet fascinating way of switching something in people mind’s to make them paranoid. That is very evident throughout the series. He scares me a lot that his name becomes something terrifying already. I strongly believe that the incident that first triggered the instability of Johan was that moment when their mother was confused on who to give away. It is so surreal that the reason that leads to creating a monster like Johann was simply because of that moment of hesitation that their mother had. To experience that at a very young age from their mother is something that would really trigger inner darkness even for a child. But if you would look into it deeper at the end of the day, the most genuine victim of all the twisted things in this series is none other than Johann. Deep down he is just a very sad person to the point of being twisted and wanting the world to feel the same way. But still, that doesn’t excuse him for all the sufferings he brought to so many people. Johann is the most effective, realistic, and terrifying villain I’ve ever seen. But the irony on it, he is one of the very few villains that I love so much. More than making me so irritated, I am so amaze by his character.\nAbout TENMA and JOHANN\nAt first look, Johann looks so calm or stable all time while Tenma looks completely miserable. However, deep inside they are complete opposite. Johann is so twisted inside which make him so unstable while Tenma is able to maintain his sanity. Even if he sinks deeper with the darkness that Johann brings, he would not succumb to it completely which only shows how strong Tenma is. Tenma is the stereotype main character which is perfect to opposite the stereotype character that Johann has. He is the complete opposite of how dark the other one is. Oddly enough, you could even say that among all the characters, Tenma and Johann have the strongest bond. A very strange and complicated bond that people around them would never understand. Perhaps Johann loved and cared for Tenma genuinely on his own twisted way. Somehow it feels sad yet irritating that after a very long journey, Tenma still didn’t have the courage to kill Johann. But at the same time, I am thankful because if he did then his no different from Johann and for sure that might trigger something and make him unstable like everyone that Johann touched. And besides, as much as almost all of us want Tenma to be the one who kills Johann, that wouldn’t be a redemption or even retribution but just a mere satisfaction from being so irritated with Johann. I believe that the whole point is not about killing Johann but more importantly, it is about the journey for the truth and Tenma’s struggles to maintain his sanity and beliefs and not to turn into something else even after the end of the journey. \nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\nTo be honest, the animation is not as amazing like others or not one of the best. However, it would be because it is made as realistic as it could be. It wouldn’t be realistic at all if it is made with so much effects like others. It matches the drama of the story so well that it feels like watching a real life drama. I am amaze that Johann is illustrated as a calm and angelic person when he is the real monster of all. It is so scary and creepy. His very angelic appearance and calm attitude despite his capabilities makes him even more sinister looking. It creeps me out and amazes me at the same time. I am having mix emotions and goose bumps whenever he is shown. It only shows that the animators did such incredible job on making not only Johann but all the twisted person in this series looked so scary with their expressions or whenever they would appear. The sounds fit perfectly with the psychological and suspense element of the story which brings out the greatness of the series even more.\nThe people and story of this series, is the reason why I’ve been in love with psychology but more than that this kind of series is the very reason why I am crazy in love with reading mangas and watching animes. You will witness the very harsh reality of our world and the very reason why people are pushed to do unimaginable things. How politicians’ experiments, twisted minds of adults, and the cruelness of the world turn a boy into a genuine MONSTER. You will fall to realize that more than anything in this world; human beings are the scariest creatures in the history of the world. More importantly, you will realize that more than the monsters depicted in fictional stories, the monsters in real life are much scarier and more sinister. Hence, the title is very much perfect for this brilliant series.\nIndeed, the world can really be harsh and even more terrifying than hell. It is also true that the human minds are so vulnerable which is why it becomes so easy to create chain of insanities. But let’s not forget that because human beings know that they have weaknesses, they strive to get stronger and dare to live this kind of world. And despite the cruelness of the world, human beings are still able to continue to live with their strong hearts and will because they know the concept that there is something more important than weaknesses and vulnerabilities. There is more to life. Which is why, even with all the insanities in the world, HUMAN BEINGS NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME!"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I had heard a lot about Monster and when i finally got around to watching it for the first fifteen episodes I couldn't watch it fast enough, i was immediately drawn into the series.  Then at about episode 40 it started to die down a little bit.  WHen you first start watching this series note that this is 74 episodes long and in some points might get be a little slow.  But don't let that discourage you.  This is an amazing thriller and i loved it.  Now if you are trying to decide whether to read the manga or watch\n          \n        the anime version i would recommend you watching at least the first 10 episodes of the anime and then decide from there because the anime is, from what i've heard and little of what i read, exactly the same as the manga.  The art is very similar to Death Note's, portraying people in a very realistic way.  Content wise there are some parts that have a lot of blood but nothing like Hellsing, some language and a few parts of nudity.  Overall I loved the series, it one of the best thriller's i have ever seen.  Lastly if you are thinking of watching this series remember that this is a seinen so if you are watching Naruto or One Piece be prepared for a change.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Fianlly I finish watching this anime and I was eager to talk about it. Very suspencefull and very good story that has great character dvelopment with each episode you learn more and more about the antogonist and other supporting character. Having one of the best antogonist I have ever seen in an anime. with a very likeable and a protagonist that you can relate to. This is my review for Monster.\nStory- The story is really great, one of the best written stories i've seen in an anime. Each episode you get more detail about the antogonist and why he's the way he is and who\n          \n        he really is, it was well put and well processed. If you like a very suspencefull tale about good and evil then my friend this anime is for you but the pacing of this anime is really slow I mean turtle slow. It shouldn't have been 74 episodes long, if you are unpatient then this anime is not for you.\nArt- Didn't like it that much, it looked like it was poorly done, very lazy work. Some of the character looks the same, they just had different hair with the exact same face and with that big ass pinochio nose. They could of done a better job at it if they weren't lazy.\nSound- Nice sound editing, they put the right tone of music at the right scene, although they could of included more music.\nCharacter- Finally I can talk about one of the best antogonist as I mentioned before. This guy was very evil, smart and a very manipulative person. Right at the beggining they tell you the kind of person he is and what he believes in, he has no remorse and sees humans as nothing but trash. The exact opposite of the protagonist wich think all life is precious. That is just the perfect protagonist and antogonist that goes against each other because their beliefs are very different. Think of Batman and Joker without the costume and makeup and you got Tenma and Johan.\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed myself watching Monster but like I said before, it didn't need to be 74 episodes. Great protagonist and a better antogonist with great character development that progressed with each episodes and a plot that gets better as you learn more about the villians past, this anime has my tamp of approval. I recommend this anime to all anime fans.\n        "},

The atmosphere was very well done. The script was very coherent. The moral of the storyline (forgiveness) was very well handled. However, the story in this show is not perfect. The problem was solved in 74 episodes whil it could be solved in much less episodes. And that is not good! Too much time was wasted by giving minor characters a day in the limelight by demoting temporarily our Japanese hero and disconnecting of the storyline.\nThe character designs were very realistic. The backgrounds and the scenery are pretty\n          \n        good. The animation is not perfect but is very good.\n The soundtrack was very appropiate for the situations. It's not that awesome, but it is still worthy.\n The characters are the best thing in Monster. The characters were very likeable, memorable, believable and interesting. Kenzo Tenma is a very good protagonist, because he is well balanced in his strengths and flaws, is relatable and is good without being a dumbass or a purity sue. Johan Liebert is a good villain, although a bit perfect, but his almost perfect condition makes him intimidating. The other characters were also good. Eva Heinemann (at first) and Roberto are irritant, but that doesn't harm the story.\n In spite of the ending fatigue, the chapters are enjoyable because of the characters and the well handled emotional moments (funny, sad, scary).\n Monster is a very good anime.

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    My issues with Monster lies in the fact that it has an incoherent plot. I was expecting a ending episode which ties everything in, but I got nothing, literately nothing. The best way to describe Monster is a puzzle that of which the pieces do not combine into a proper whole, some pieces connect with others while other pieces are completely independent of others. Monster gives us well made characters(well for the initial part that is) and explores varying themes and though these aspects may seem to contribute to the plot, they in fact do not. \nMuch of the story of Monster revolves around Tenma,\n          \n        the protagonist, seeking to rectify his own wrong doing of allowing the existence of the antagonist, Johan. As we progress through the anime, we are given more backstory and character development, which provides interesting interaction with characters, but because they are not connected they fail to contribute to the plot of the anime. Each piece has it's own meaning, but when they are put together no contingent meaning can be derived. That is why I view Monster as just an amalgamation of stories occuring that seem to contribute to the plot, but only serves as a mini story. Monster is, in a sense, similar to popular anime such as one piece and bleach in that they share the lack of a coherent overarching story line. \nMany of the mini stories in Monster explores the theme of morality such as the dilemma of whether the individual you help is either good or bad and the question of whether a bad person can change for the better, but these themes seem to be brought up arbitrarily. That is, they are neither referenced nor explored in early episodes and just talked about out of the blue which in conjunction with the roller coaster of storytelling pace hints at a lack of contingent storytelling. \nThe most exceptional aspect of Monster I would say is its characters. I was very fond of Lunge and Eva, but I really did not like Dr. Tenma because he conforms to the common archetype protagonist of modern anime. He is seemingly everywhere and able to help everyone, but his character lacks consistency. He is a dull and contradictory character whose characterization preys on those who desire to see themselves in his position. On the other hand, Lunge was a very well made character. His inability to discern Johan because Johan is intangible to his own reality leads him to chase after Tenma. He exemplifies the modern mentality that defines subjective beliefs as objective beliefs. \nOverall\nMonster is by no means bad when judged in an overall sense, but I have to be critical because for it to frame it as having a seemingly contingent plot and yet it does not pull the plot pieces together makes it just a bunch of small stories within an anime. Some stories are better than other, but those that that delved in psychology I found to be the most dull, because they argued on the basis that sad emotions makes what it frames as \"Monster\" and happy emotions is what makes a normal person. This kind of psychological deduction is quite myopic and nonsensical. That being said though I found the psychological aspect to be quite dull, the manner in which this aspect was shown to me was quite skilled.\n"},

However, this time the director chosen was out of character for the powerhouse studio. This director had mostly done child shows like Azuki-chan (1995) or was mostly a storyboard worker on shows like Chobits. Maybe Madhouse went with the right guy since the anime Monster has an incredibly deep written story. The director chosen to put creator Naoki Urasawa’s Monster on screen was Masayuki Kojima. To say the writing is something other than a masterpiece would not do the show justice. After 74 episodes and to have only the final one somehow able to put a nail in\n          \n        the metaphorical coffin speaks volumes to how amazing Monster is. \nMonster’s plot is super complex and detailed, but was also able to have uniform themes and ideas from start to finish. All of the various plot twists and events that drive character motivation can be overly complicated on the surface. Yet, once a bit of thought and interpretation is done, then everything seems to make sense as the series progresses. Monster is not simply a show, but a well thought out time investment for the story and all of the characters involved. Our main protagonist is the brilliant Japanese neurosurgeon Dr. Tenma who works at a hospital in Dusseldorf, Germany. Yes, the majority of the anime takes place in Germany. One fateful day, Tenma decided to operate on a young boy over a political figure not knowing what event this unknown child would bring. Unaware that this boy is the “monster,” Tenma sets out on a journey to right his wrong and slowly unravel a terrible serial murder case across Germany and more.\nThe fact that Madhouse even animated Urasawa’s Monster in its entirety given that most studios do not to stray from a “sure thing.” Regardless, Monster stays true to its source material. No, it is not a great looking anime, but it does adapt the character designs extremely well, if not better. Everything from colour to shading simply adds to the feeling that the viewer is truly experiencing the story being unfolded. Breath-taking recreations of scenes throughout Germany (mostly) ranging from the detail of characters sitting in a train station to the cars on the road all represent what the country and lifestyle was like in the 80s and 90s. Given the series length, the animation remained strong the entire way through. It gives chills to the production value this must have cost. To put it in laments terms, an anime adaptation could not get any better than Monster.\nThis is a show for a more mature audience. It is a show that rewards patience and attention to detail from the environment to the written dialogue. When the show may seem like it is straying off from the path of the main story, it actually does not. Slowly and surely each event and character does have a specific reason and value to the overall story. Let us take how the story begins as an example. Dr. Tenma saves a young boy from death and gets punished for it by the higher ups. However, Tenma believes he did the right thing in valuing all life equally. There were a couple mysterious deaths once that same boy suddenly disappeared from the hospital. Tenma was the only suspect since he benefited from those deaths, yet the police never found any evidence. Cut to years down the line and due to certain events reunites with this boy, now older. After a powerful scene and another death, Tenma is now on the run as a fugitive and the prime suspect. This all occurs within the first 30 episodes. There simply is not enough that can possibly be said without spoiling anything. Characters and events are so important, nothing can be missed. Every character does in fact have a place. Even if the main character Tenma, goes episodes without being in it. All is rewarded with time.\nIn some eyes, Monster may not be the best anime of all time. Perhaps spending 74 episodes is too much of an investment. That is not a good enough excuse to not watch Monster. Maybe nothing moving in the background at times annoys the modern anime fan. Come on, it is 74 episodes from Madhouse in 2004. This does not even matter because the dialogue is so interesting. Plus, in the anime world, nothing comes close to Monster. This masterpiece of an anime has crazy intricate storytelling, complex plot twists and turns, incredible characters, and excellent pacing. There is nothing more to be said about how amazing Monster is.\n        "},

There is a lot of comparisons to him and Hitler, which I also thought was an interesting angle.\ni gave art a 6 because i think that it is suppose to be unattractive people. The characters are mainly not good looking. Ironically one of the few people that is more handsome is the bad guy Johan. I took it to be representative of the fact that people in general tend to not believe that the pretty people are monsters.

It is one of the few that are actually better than the native Japanese. I would strongly recommend watching this in the dubbed version, the voice actors has made a superb job in catching the essence of the characters.\nI was at many times during the anime completely overwhelmed at how good it actually is, since it's long length I took quite a lot of pauses during my time watching it (watched it over a 3 month period) but every time I picked it back up I immediately remembered why it was so amazing.

It has excellent characters, plot, and speed... really, it's just great on the whole.\nCharacters\n     The main villain (who I happen to think is FANTASTIC!) is probably one of the most intimidating characters I have ever seen. His mere presence is enough to get the entire cast quaking in their boots, and he just has to be there. Let me reiterate that: just his being there is enough to keep you tense for the next dozen episodes, even if\n          \n        he doesn't appear for the rest of that time. He is also very unique, in all aspects of his creation, appearance, background, and motivations.\n     The main character, who is voiced by the same person who voiced Gaara from Naruto, is brilliant. It's as simple as that. He is unique in every way, and extremely good as a hero. His own inner turmoil is something that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.\n     Speaking of inner turmoil, many characters have some kind of insanity or paranoia plaguing them throughout the story. You would think this would get old, but let me assure you, IT DOES NOT! Their mental stress allows for some very intense and truly awesome scenes, all of which are very realistic and plausible. As one last note, the show skips over every cliche in the book. Almost every member of the cast is at least 25 years old, and those that aren't don't act as if they're 20, like in many anime. For characters, Monster gets a 10!\nArt\n     I have to say, art wise, Monster takes a hit. It has a very realistic style compared to many shows, and for me, that's a bit of a turn off. Also, since it was made in 2005, the animation itself is a bit lackluster. However, after about episode 6 or so, you will hardly notice the small things that are done perhaps incorrectly, namely a few scenes where characters run. The way they swing their arms... eh, I don't know. However, once your past that point, the art is actually quite enjoyable. So, for art, Monster gets an 8!\nSound\n     The sound for Monster is good at all times, though in no way memorable. The musicians wanted to play music to enhance the mood, and that's what they did. No more, no less. A generous 8 for sound.\nStory\n     The story is incredible. Imagine taking Death Note, removing all of the bad stuff and cliches, then put the good guys on the road. This is what Monster adds up to more or less, minus the actual death note. It's a crime story, chock full of psychologically powerful moments. The ideas and plot twists are numerous, and the story covers a sprawling area. There are few shows that can match the plot and scale of Monster. \n     The basic premise is somewhat simple: famous neurosurgeon saves child from a head-shot wound, child turns out to be a peculiar kind of sociopath who then proceeds to pin every crime on the man who saved him. The neurosurgeon, a man named Kenzo Tenma, is forced to hit the road on the run from the police. His only hope is to find the boy whose life he saved, and bring him to justice. \n     Like I said, this is just the basic premise. This is one of the most detailed shows I've ever seen, and side-plots and sub-plots are everywhere, all working in perfect unison to offer an incredible experience. Easily a 10.\nEnjoyment\n     I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of Monster, until it began to drag out around episode 65. The feeling soon passed, but the memory of it kept this show from the 10. A 9 that probably deserves a 10.\nOverall\n     On the whole, I would call Monster a masterpiece. It's a true shame that it's so unheard of, when it could serve as the crown jewel of many an otaku's anime repertoire. It is my personal 5th favorite, out of (currently) 43 shows. A solid 9.5. Watch this show; I guarantee you, you won't regret it.\n        "},

The animation does its job well and while the first impression is that it's low-budget and ugly, the quality never wavers over the 74 episodes and has its moments (Prague is conveyed with a loving detail that reminds me of _Aria_ & Venice). The musical score is as spare but well-chosen and haunting (both EDs come to be moving by the end, and the themes \"Bush\" & \"Cannot hear\" are eerie and beautiful).\nAnd the plot, the plot.\nhttp://www.theanimereview.com/index.html?reviews/monster.html nails a lot of my own impressions, and once you grasp the full backstory and\n          \n        the reasons for Johan's choices (a very helpful guide is http://www.mania.com/aodvb/showthread.php?p=842678 ) as he learns more about himself and his lost memories, the intricacy becomes impressive indeed.\nThere are many characters, who weave in and out of the story unexpectedly, and by the middle I felt I had mental whiplash simply from how many 'good' characters turn out to be evil. No targets were spared in this noir hell, and I give it props for never pulling its punches, not even when aimed at children.\nJohan has fantastic voice-acting and his plots and casual corruption of everything around him is fantastically written (the scene with the 'Red Hindenburg' and then him walking through the alley is a case in point), and scenes with him or his protege breaking someone's mind are almost at Hannibal levels of awesome.\nAt times I had issues with what felt like lazy writing, examples including Roberto (why won't he just die? how can he be a skilled hitman *and* a top criminal lawyer?!) and Dieter (go away already), and I hated Eva too much for any episode involving her to be a pleasure rather than a chore, but then episodes with Nina or Johan came along and I forgot my complaints.\nThe Munich library arc was fantastic, and then the Prague arc was also memorable, not just for finally giving some real answers. I see some reviewers say the Ruhenheim finale was satisfying but not as epic as they could have hoped for; I say that's balderdash.\nMy main regret is that not all of the side-stories matter to the main plot, episodes can move slowly, and now that I know the full plot, much of the mystery is gone; so I will probably never go back and rewatch _Monster_, though it is an excellent series. 74 episodes is simply too much.\n(Incidentally, randomly reading on other topics, I think I've discovered the original for _Monster_'s General Wolf! It's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Wolf : he was active 1950s-1980s, was a famous spymaster, left East Germany before the Wall fell, and guess what his nickname was? *\"The man without a face\"*! His biography doesn't fit the _Monster_ character perfectly, but the resemblances are clearly there.)\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    Monster anime review\nA story about a brilliant villain and a doctor with no job.\nStory 9/10\nThe writing in Monster is unique and the development of the story captivates the viewer.Why because it has a slow pace at the begining where all the characters are presented and thats good in my opinion because it makes the viewer get used to their habits personalities and course of action. Once the show has established the setting and many of the players, the series begins a thrilling, rollercoaster of action, suspense and character development. \nDialogue is not wasted at all in Monster. The anxious atmosphere is enhanced with carefully crafted\n          \n        lines that provide insight into characters' personalities and make the viewer doubt the fact that they are just simple minded and have one course of action in the thinking process.\nThe center piece of the series is the complex relationship between Dr. Tenma and Johan.The story focuses on the duel between those two and how they affect the other characters directly or indirectly through their actions across the series.\nCharacters 10/10\nThis is Monster's greatest strength the supporting characters which are better well defined than other supporting characters in other series. The show manages to bring up those characters back to life with extreme clarity despite the main characters lead Johan and Dr.Tenma who are all over the entire series and some viewers may grow attached to the minor characters more than the main characters wich shows that Monster doesn't need a god tier main character to show us how good the story is. Its a plus that it doesn't rely so much on the main characters since the story focuses in many other anime only on the main characters development and casts away minor characters after the mc has achieve his goals.\nTenma’s emotional, physical, and psychological transitions lead the audience through a complex maze of issues regarding personal and social morality. This is remarkably achieved without losing Tenma’s basic humanity or resorting to didacticism, and contrasts sharply with Johan’s manipulations and calculations which strike a cold realistic note with the audience.Here the supporting roles have a great involvement around Johan and Dr.Tenma which makes the story better.\nJohan is the best and well written villain in the whole series. Many other series can try to make a villain but it always gave them some plot convenience tools(hex, superpowers,death note,etc) to achieve their goals or to fail. Johann doesn't need those convenience tools to achieve his goals. \nThe only thing he uses is his sharp intelligence which was gifted since young and could predict the course of action a few steps in the future. Another tool he uses is the psychological manipulation which proves he has a strong mind and even life experienced people(know about psychological tricks, experienced them first hand) can be victims for him. A good example is the genius surgent Dr.Tenma who is one of Johann's victims. Even if the story has some plot convenience where it all goes well for Johann it's his own merit for that because he is capable to reap the fruits of his own labor and use his plot convenience tools(intelligence and psychological manipulation).\nAnimation 7/10\nUnique style of animation for the series which fits with the mature theme that it abords.\nEnjoyment 8/10\nI personally enjoyed the show even if some parts were boring and some dialogues dragged the show. I liked the slow pace in the begining and the rolercoaster that came later in the show.\nSound 7/10\nThe ost was fine especially in the tension and suspans moments from the anime that delivered.\nOverall 9/10\nWhat captivated me in this series was the duel between the two male leads, the mysterie and Johann of course a unique villain which no other series could think of it.\nThe story the characters and even the minor ones left a good impression so Monster did a good job in that way.\nI almost forgot what left a good impression where the characters qoutes especially Johann.The most memorable one:\n***Spoiler***\n\"Doctor Tenma, for you all lives are created equal, that's why I came back to life. But you've finally come to realize it now, haven't you? Only one thing is equal for all, and that is death.\"\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Monster is one of those anime that makes you think about the value of life. The story is superb as I judge most by realism and how it shows itself. The art is great for its time, especially the opening animation. The sound was fitting, however the ending hurt my ears, and I felt some of the tracks could use more of a touch up. The characters are very well written for an anime of this kind, especially Johan, Dieter, and Inspector Lunge. I had a blast watching this from the beginning to the end. The only main issue I had was how it ended.\n          \n        I felt like it had too many questions that were left unanswered. Other than that, it was an amazing watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is a really big and complicated story. I don't usually like anime about European culture (for the reason that European culture stops being actually European and becomes somewhat \"Japanised\") but that's not the case. That strange love of the Japanese cartoonists for orphans, experiments on personality, conspiracy, military men and crazy lunatics was finally put into a very decent, serious setting. The most dreadful thing about the whole story is that it's easy to imagine the events taking place in the real world (for those who are familiar with the history of World War II, at least). Well, strictly speaking there are some things\n          \n        which should be clarified otherwise they might seem illogical but they do not spoil the general impression from the series. Mangaka's done really great job, no wonder manga is going to have a second birth (as a movie series this time; it will be fun to compare the anime and TV version).\nOne of the main lines in the series is a fairytale of a Check author (I couldn't manage to find out for sure whether it was real or not) - it is just as adorable as horrifiyng. I liked everything about it: the plot, the pictures, the way it was read by Nina. Yet I cannot imagine what kind of impact it could have had on me if I ever had a chance to read it in childhood (thus, I cannot compare the influence it had on the twinst... pity). And I cannot imagine what impression they could get from their mother's choice as I haven't got an answer to the question who the real monster is. As for monsters, I find it completely unnecessary to discribe the characters: many of them are very vivid and quite convincing (in fact, many of them can be called monsters in a way), but one of the most exciting personalities ever is Yohan himself, he alone (apart from everyone else) is worth watching the whole series, this creepy guy sends shivers up and down not only other characters', but also the viewers' spine.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    It took me about 15 episodes to begin enjoying this show. It is very, very slow paced, yet extremely intricate. The story in and of itself is a work of art. This is a must-watch. One of my favorite aspects of the story is how it draws the bigger picture through small, separate events. Slowly the characters become aware of each other and the bigger picture, being brought together by means that you as the watcher understand are not chance. Simply put, the story explores a world where many people have been affected by one man's actions, and their hatred or grief fate them to\n          \n        meet, united under similar goals yet maintaining completely different views of their situation, creating dynamic and unpredictable interactions.\n        "},
