    Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. I can truly say it is one of the best, if not the best anime I've watched.\
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind (I left out the details that you don't care about). This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it\
          \
        in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly. \
But this debatable topic isn't the series strong point. Death Note gets a 10 in the story department, because of the way the plot unravels.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. You will not be disappointed. \
The flaws begin once it is apparent that there will be a second arc. This to me, seemed like an unnecessary way of drawing out the anime, although arguably a change in situation was required to break the dead lock between Light and L. Anyhow, the series being to lose some of its luster at this point, and if I were to rate both arcs separately, the first would receive a 15/10 and the second a 9/10. Anyhow, this intelligent story deserves an overall 10/10 in my books. \
Characters: Light and L are the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development is also seen, particularly with Light as you witness his calm, calculating figure being to crack into a maddening and reckless mess. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, he changes greatly from the beginning of the series. This change can be seen in various other characters as well, although not as notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting enough to give this a: 9/10\
Sound: Yet another brilliant aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more so as the characters attempt to read each other. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. But as you continue to watch the series you will notice just how well it fits Light's demented mind and how everything he has achieved beings to shatter around his feet. 9.5/10 (rounded to 10)\
Art/Animation: And again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the characters and scenery are all done amazingly well. I mean, the anime made writing with a pen look cool. The way they made it zoom across that piece of paper ... In terms of animation, the pen wins. It truly does. But seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well. A 10/10\
Overall: I was watching the series since it first started coming out, and those weeks of waiting killed me. That was how good this anime was. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would have done with a Death Note. Many of them will question and argue about the actions of Light. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. You may hate it (although very few seem to), but it is definitely an anime you must TRY. 10/10\

    Death Note. Another famous anime. But this time there is one reason for it. In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.\
Story (8): The first half of this anime is a masterpiece. The concept itself - the Shinigami's notebook which grants the person who has it the power to kill anyone by simply writing the person's name while picturing the face in his mind - is already brilliant to begin with as it presents the viewer questions like \"What would I do if\
          \
        I had that power?\" The way it is developed brings us yet more questions and defies our morals.\
Light Yagami, the main character, is a brilliant high school student who's angry at all the injustice in the world. One day, he finds the notebook and he tries it out. At first, he's not sure about if what he did is correct but he ends up loving the power he got and trying to use it to build a new and better world. He's nicknamed as Kira by the citizens. Of course that would simply be boring if it wasn't for L, a detective that tries to discover Kira's identity. Both of them are simply genius and their counter clock run to find out each other's identity is full of intelligent moves and suspense which kept me trying to guess what each one of them would do next.\
Really, the simple ingredient that's so great about this story is that it manages to keep you thinking. But at several levels. Let me explain that to you.\
First, it makes you think about if what Light's doing is right or wrong. \"Is it right to be the judge and executer simultaneously?\" \"Don't the circumstances of each crime matter as well and is it right to judge without knowing all the facts?\" \"Can't the criminals be reformed?\" \"Is a world where people don't commit crimes because they're simply afraid really desirable? Isn't what Light aims to achieve theoretically similar to a dictatorship?\" Those are questions that ran through my mind.  At one point, I was totally rooting for him. But as the story develops and his actions begin to change, you'll start to wonder...\
Second, it makes you think about what's going to happen next. Trying to follow Light's and L's line of though is both challenging and entertaining. Their move will surprise you and you'll keep trying to guess what they're gonna do next. This show will keep you on the edge of your sit through its entirety.\
Third, it changes the way you see the world and the people in it. With each kill and each action Light takes you can't help but wonder: \"It may be wrong but what would I do if I were in his place?\". People change, situations make us change. One different thing in your life and you could be going from a dedicated doctor to a serial killer (just an example).\
The only problem with the story is really the second half, for Near isn't nearly as intelligent as L, and Light seems to become way dumber and make pointless decisions rather than retaining control of the situation. The fact that the resolution didn't steam from Light's mistakes but from someone else's and was pure luck on Near's part in that regard was both a nice factor (I was rooting for Light to win because... no idea, I just was.) and a rather underwhelming one as well, for neither of them was the central piece that ended the puzzle. The story receives a 8/10.\
Art (9): The art is clean, the character designs are both unique and somewhat similar to reality. The backgrounds are detailed enough and the animation is really good. Even though there are few action scenes throughout the show, the car chasing scenes for example are really well done. A little exaggerated, yes, but nevertheless pretty good.\
But were the art really shines is in the coloring schemes.  The dark and dull tones totally fit the anime. And Light's monologues, with the red hair also add a nice touch.\
Quite good for its time and genre.\
Sound (9): First, let's talk about the openings and endings. Well, I dislike both openings and love both endings. Quite wired isn't it? Because you know, the 1st opening and the 1st ending are both by the band \"Nightmare\" (they're a really good band by the way) and the 2nd ones are both by \"Maximum the Hormone\". Still, it's just my personal preference though some people may be turned of by the heavy metal sound of the last opening and respective ending. \
The ending song from episode 37 is really beautiful and fits the last scenes awesomely well.\
But that's not all. The opera-like songs that pass in the episodes really add to the scenes and were, with they're somewhat religious tune,  the best choice to set the mood.\
I can't say much about the voice acting. I watched the english dubbed version and I thought it was good enough but I'm no expert on that matter.\
Characters (8): The characters are rather well portrayed. Let me put it this way. When I see an anime, there's always a character that stands out the most for me, that has characteristics that make me root for him/her. When that doesn't happen, I usually don't enjoy an anime. In Death Note, no character stood out. But somehow, I still loved it. I think no one stood out because they were all equally great. There was no one with fantasy-like characteristics. They all seemed like real people with real problems. No unneeded and exaggerated tragedies but no totally sweet lives either.\
The character development is pretty much nonexistent for most of the cast, but it doesn't need to be there, for it is really good for Light Yagami, the main character. Starting of as a genius, calm and collected high school student with a strong sense of morals and justice, he undergoes a slow but drastic change of character. The more he uses the Death Note, the more he slowly drops his morals because he finds it is needed to continue his work. He ends up an arrogant person with no consideration by the people who surround him. He starts trying to create a new and better world for people to live him but ends up obsessed with power and with being the \"God of the New World\".\
I love it when Light loses his memories about the Death Note. He turns back to his old self, refuses to use people as tools (what he had been doing all the time) and he even thinks Kira is wrong and wants to catch him. At that point, I also thought Kira's actions were going way too far but so did Light. And Light WAS Kira. So what if the notebook was real, what if I had pick it up? Wouldn't I do the same and end up like that?\
Moving on to L. He may seem like a plain character, but he is not. He tried his best to capture Kira risking himself a bit more in each attempt. He seems cold but deep inside I think he really didn't want Light to be Kira because he had never met anyone so similar to him in his ways of thinking and he saw Light as a friend, even though he was almost sure that Light was, in fact, Kira.\
The support characters are surprisingly interesting, despite not being all that well developed. I'm talking about the task force. At first, we didn't know much about them and they're development is not much noticeable but then at some point you realize you already know how they feel about Kira, what their line of thought is. The truth is, we subtly get introduced to their problems and internal struggles. This anime has an interesting cast of supporting characters.\
My least favorite character was Near. Even Mello was better developed than him. Near wanted to catch Light, sure. But it seemed like he was barely concerned about anything else that was happening as long as he could catch him. He was too cold and underwent none changes. \
Enjoyment (9): This review is getting way too long... Anyway, I really enjoyed this anime. Each episode got me craving for more. It made me think, it made me feel bad for some characters, it made me hate some situations... It was truly a great viewing experience. I enjoyed it a lot. \
Biggest problem was really the second half not being as intelligently scripted as the first one. But even now, one month after watching, I still think about Death Note and its moral changing story whenever I see some hostage situation on the news. Sometimes I'm just like \"Damn, I wish I had one notebook like that! I could prevent so many bad stuff from happening...\". And then, on those nights, as I'm in my bed the same questions I had when I was watching the show come once again to my mind. \"If the notebook was real, wouldn't it bring even more bad things that it could prevent? Would it be right to use it? What would guarantee that I would not get corrupted by its power?\" I loved this show and I still do.\
Overall (8): I may rate it a 8, but once again, that's largely due to the second half of the show. Nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone. Whatever genre of anime you like, you should watch this. It is a really intelligent story and even though you may not love it as much as I did, the chances are, you will. Even for people who never enjoyed anime, I would still recommend it. In fact, I am now in the process of making Portuguese subtitles so I can get my mom to watch it. Death Note defies your morals and enables deep discussions with yourself and others. It truly is a great show.\

    Allow me to explain my love of \"the pay off\" in entertainment:\
I hate when I watch something, and it doesn't really matter if I'm following it or not because nothing pays off.  So many times I the credits of a movie roll and I'm left stupified thinking to myself \"That's it?  What about the ___ and the ___? What was the point of me paying attention to the first hour and 20 minutes of this film?\"\
Some shows or movies set little subconscious mental snares, so that when something happens later on-it pays off.  Your friend walks in the room and sees a\
          \
        scene that looks like nothing happened, but you're going :O OMGG!  They don't understand what it means, the significance of what happened, because they didn't see the set up.  Therefore, when you watched that early part and did get the set up, it was worth your time and attention.\
To me, Death Note is one of the best examples of great pay-offs in the history of entertainment.  It's hard to even pinpoint this show/manga/story to a genre.  The aforementioned pay-off aspect makes it feel like a mystery, but unlike your cliche Sherlock Holmes or Law and Order mystery story you're in on the answers.  The main character is the solution to the puzzle, and you come along for the ride.  \
This is like a reverse-mystery story.  Instead of the show centering around the good guy detective (L) you get to take a journey with a young Japanese lad with a heart of black.  And unlike a common anti-hero, cheered-antagonist trope, he is truly evil to the point of not even being able to relate to him deep down. \
The premise is an easy pitch to those who haven't seen the show.  What would you do if you could kill people by writing their name?  Would you do it?  If so, who?  This anime then blasts off with an amazingly intriguing universe back-story of death gods in another realm featuring some of my favorite artwork in any anime.  It's truly dark and monstrous.  The creator imagined such a barren, hopeless, faithless, and gutless wasteland of sketchy characters and landscapes, which you then get to see collide with the human world's truly evil bad guy's moral play.  \
In issue 13 of the manga, which has interviews with the writer and artist, (fascinating read, highly recommended as well) the author insists that he meant no political or social commentary.  But allow me to do it for him:\
Is the death penalty OK?  Is it OK to try to wipe out the bad people of the world?  How far does it go?  When is it OK to execute someone?  At the beginning of the story, it's clear that the people of Japan LIKE the killings but won't admit it.  Is that what would happen?  And even further on, after so many 'bad' people have been killed it's depicted that the world actually does improve because of the executions.  Is that far-fetched?  I actually think it actually would make people more afraid, and less likely to commit heinous crimes.  But is that a good thing?  Would we want a world in fear of an invisible executioner?  Which brings me to my next point..\
The relationship between Light and Ryuk is highly dynamic, and the crux of the entire story.  When you think about it, this story is Ryuk's.  He is by far the most important character in the story and dictates the most essential plot points.  And yet, you might not think that when you watch it.  While Light is serious, well-planned, methodical, almost scientific, Ryuk is the opposite.  He literally can not stop smiling throughout the entire story.  He loves it.  The empty wasteland was boring, and now he gets to show us an interesting story.  And I have to agree, even if I was an extremely bored death god I probably would have had a blast watching that story unfold too.\
In the end, you could say the human is the one who became the real death god.  But who really called the shots in the end?  I've heard some people criticize the end, and even the entire second half of the show.  But to me, these elements are equally fascinating and add a lot, especially as they wrap up so many pay-offs.  I know I've said a lot so far, but this is truly a masterpiece.  Now I'm going to break down the technicalities. \
ART:\
Even if I didn't like anything I said above, I would love this art style.  This is by far my favorite art style in anime.  Just seeing this art style in another anime, like Monster, will make me enjoy it more.  This anime is not a bright bubbly explosion of genki fireworks.  And the art is no different.  It is dark and realistic.  Some of the expressions are so horrified and so believable.  It's not distracting, it really helps you get a sense of realism like-\"what if this happened?\" because everything is drawn to scale and with a certain weighted, grounded feeling that some animes completely lack on purpose.  \
The art gives special attention to colors, such as the red shinigami eyes, but it doesn't take color out of the realm of being realistic.  No purple haired people or girls with outfits that even the best cosplayers in the world couldn't pull off.  The animation itself is also excellent.  It's never too still, and never too fast.  When there are big movements (for example, the infamous \"most epic writing scene in the world\" from YouTube when Light is first writing his long list of names) the animation flows dramatically.  The kind of angles and smooth motion that would be hard to capture for even the best director with a million frames per second.  You can visibly and clearly see a tremendous amount of work was put into animating this series. \
SOUND:\
Oh, wow.  Just wow.  As a music addict, I'll tell you right away that this soundtrack never leaves my playlist.  I don't go around listening to all 1000 songs on this vast library of music constantly, but there are certain themes and moments in this soundtrack that surpass some of the greatest Hollywood film scores of all time.  Huge orchestras and choirs, smooth jazz, hard rock, club ambience, they really hit almost every genre of music and combine them in a really innovative way.  It's so hard to get tired of the deep variation, and when you put all of these songs to such an amazing story, you've got pure gold. This soundtrack really has some mood-altering songs.  I highly recommend you buy the soundtrack and check it out, whether you've seen the show or not.  \
Again, you can tell an unbelievable amount of work went into scoring this series.  Songs like \"Dominae Kira\" feature some of the craziest choir sounds and orchestral arpeggios that I've ever heard.  And once you've heard the L theme and its John Carpenter-esque odd time signature (which are also prevalent in the score) it will stay with you.  And then when they remix it and reprise different variations of the melody, it subconsciously brings you even further into immersion.  Interesting to note that one of the composers of Death Note was arrested for marijuana in Japan, and at the time of his arrest he had a little more than a gram on him.  (US: $20) Since this drug is very taboo in Japan, the reported value of a little more than a gram was over $120.  \
CHARACTERS:\
I've already touched on the main characters, so I'll just talk about the great supporting cast.  Misa, a gothic pop star, plays a really interesting, integral role in the story.  She indeed has the high-pitch voice of a cliche blonde haired little girl in an anime, but in this case it really works.  This is not your ordinary high pitched little Japanese anime girl.  She brings another layer to the social commentary of capital punishment, and Light eats it up.  They are perfectly meant for each other, despite the course of events that unfold between them.  To me, their relationship is beyond Shakespearean.  And like Ryuk, in the end she is clearly one of the most important characters.\
There's also a great supporting cast in the police side of this epic chase, including Matsuda and Light's father Soichiro.  Light's dad is also one of my favorite characters.  He brings such a stern discomfort to scenes, which is realistic for some fathers.  All of the characters are utilized perfectly, and he definitely has his opportunities to shine.  There is also a small supporting cast of other shinigami, which I think gave the author and artists a chance to bring some fantasy elements to their work while still keeping it feeling grounded and real.  \
The story depicts the shinigami as a secret realm, so the entire concept is introduced as something that could actually exist in a fantasy sense.  The revelation of their mysterious existence is realistically shocking, and from this you get shinigami like Rem-who my friend had to point out to me is actually a female.  Which makes her actions in the story even more intriguing.  You also get to briefly meet a few other shinigami, who are equally unique.\
VOICE ACTING:\
First off, you should know that I've never seen this show with English voices.  So I will be talking about the Japanese voice actors only.  The voices on this show are absolutely expert.  Light's tone and dynamics really put you in a mood, especially when contrasted by the tone and patterns of L.  Their conversations make me feel so interested to hear what they're talking about, whatever it is.  Also Ryuk is my favorite anime/cartoon voice ever.  His trademark laugh and quirky speech style is probably what initially pulled me into the show the most at first.  It's just a brilliant character. \
Light's dad and Misa also have really well-acted voices.  There's nothing and no one I can criticize as far as the voice acting.  Bringing this group of voice actors was so well done that it's one of the few times where I would like to thank whoever did the casting on the series.  \
CONCLUSION:\
There is one thing that I don't like about Death Note: it had to end.  I don't mean this in a joking way.  To me, the way it ends, the shinigami realm, the characters, the universe this story creates BEGS for another story, another season.  Some criticized the second half, but I truly feel this universe and premise has legs.  The follow-up to this show for the author and artist is so far removed from my interests.  There are few things that could happen in my life that would make me happier than if Death Note were to continue.  \
Please note: I'm not a huge anime fan.  I barely watch it, and this was the first anime I ever watched start to finish.  Which was almost a curse in disguise, because after that my interest in anime started as mostly a quest to find something 'else' to watch.  That is-something just like Death Note, something just as good, but different.  I still haven't found it.  There are lots of forum threads and Yahoo! answers of people who feel the same way-and sadly I don't think we will ever find something as good as Death Note.  This series was magical lightning caught in a bottle with perfect timing.  The planets aligned and the hard work of everyone involved lead to an anime series that is truly enchanting to enjoy.  So check it out!\
Thanks for reading!\

    Warning: Spoilers\
I wanted to like this. I really did. And I did for about the first 10-15 episodes. Death Note is probably the most popular anime ever, and when I read the summary, I could see why. After viewing 27 episodes and reading a summary of the subsequent 10, however, that opinion has changed a little bit. \
First, a review of the things I DID like:\
A) The Concept. Notebook that kills whoever has his name written into it, death gods that love apples, and two genius teens: one a student with a god complex, and the other a highly famous detective with a strong sense\
          \
        of justice and a wide variety of quirks. Who wouldn't want to watch this?\
B) Protagonist/Antagonist Switch. Stories where the protagonist is the bad guy and the good guy is the antagonist are more in-depth. It makes you think more about whose side you should be on as opposed to the normal setup, where it's obvious that you should be behind the protagonist. \
C) L. He's a great character, period. I love how the creators made him a quirky, unattractive genius instead of an attractive, pretty boy genius (*cough* Yagami Light! *cough*). This makes his likability depend on his personality and mannerisms instead of his looks. This so defies any male protagonist guidelines in general, and I love when authors have the brain capacity to create a likable character without making them look like they belong on the front of a magazine.\
Now for the things I DID NOT like:\
A) The Plot Randomness. After the first 10-15 episodes or so (and especially after 26), the plot seemed to have this \"made up on the spot\" feel to it, as if the author made the story up as he went along instead of mapping it out before he started writing it. Stories like that tend to tell me that the author is either overconfident or too lazy to plan it out beforehand. While this story had a few plot twists, none of them were really that twisty (except for the unpleasant one I'm about to mention in point B), considering that I wasn't really surprised by any of them and that I was thoroughly bored by episode 18. So if you like spur-of-the-moment plot development, this is the show for you.\
B) They Killed L. Seriously. Many of you are probably saying, \"It's good that the author was willing to kill off the main good guy. It's a great plot twist, and you don't see many stories where that happens, so it's creative.\" I do agree that it's a good plot twist, but IT'S L. The creators are quoted as saying that L is \"the smartest character in the series,\" but yet, he gets outsmarted and dies. Not to mention that in the episodes leading up to this, Light wasn't exactly getting the upper hand. In fact, somewhere right before the middle of the show, Light seemed to start drifting away from his previously praised intelligence. L was so close to connecting all the pieces, when BAM! And why did he die? \
Because no one seems to realize that Light's girlfriend is the most annoying creature to inhabit the universe. \
I mean, really. Two death gods fall in love with her, Matsuda idolizes her, Light's sister loves her, and everyone else acts as if there isn't a little pest buzzing around the room. Honestly, how can you not make her want to shut up? I hated her 30 seconds after she first showed up. She's not even necessary to the story, to be perfectly honest, and it would probably be 10 times better without her. But still, L dies because of a shinigami's misguided love for her. \
And then they try to replace him with children, one of which is an obvious ripoff of L himself (dark circles under the eyes, crouching position, black eyes, calm demeanor, etc.). And they don't even offer something like a clever he's-still-a-genius-because-he-planned-his-death solution, which would have made sense considering how smart he's supposed to be. The authors also made L's death out to be unimportant. No one grieves for him or gives him a funeral. Everyone's just like, \"L's dead, we need a replacement.\" Instead they just killed him off and pretended that nothing major just happened.\
\
\
Overall, it was a great concept with a great start that spiraled into a bunch of random not-so-well-thought-out plothole coverups. I can see why most people like it, but it got way too boring and unoriginal to me.\
Finally, I would like to say that this is my opinion. Everyone has them, so I'm sorry if mine is unsatisfactory to you, but I'm just sharing why I think a very popular show is a bit overrated.\

    May contain light spoilers...\
Death Note is a solid series with some brilliant moments in it, but some equally ridiculous ones too. Most of it is pretty much the same thing: a long-ass cat-and-mouse game that keeps taking turns going for and against the two lead foes. Early on it's rather boring as you watching everything take it's time to pick up, and there's even an episode that consists almost entirely of two characters wandering around aimlessly that get real boring real fast. Once the big twists start happening they're mostly impressive, but you almost get kind of sick of them after they keep coming over\
          \
        and over and they start to get a little repetitious. The last few episodes leading up to a major character's death are really good, but after it actually happens the plot goes off the rails and just winds up repeating a good portion of everything that's just happened before. But despite getting rather ludicrous at the end, the finale is a good payoff.\
The silliest thing about it is whenever the big, epic music starts playing everything is made out to be SUPER intense and over-the-top...and most of the time it's just someone writing down names, so instead of seeming super epic it just comes off as painfully cheesy.\
The characters are generally pretty stiff and don't change much, and when they do it's normally pretty sudden and doesn't have much, if any, build-up to it. One of the exceptions to this seems to be Aizawa, who is one of the few characters for whom you actually get a glimpse into the outside life of, even if it is small. L is impressively intelligent and deductive, but outside of that there really isn't much to him. Light is a sociopath with a god complex and anytime that might change it just turns out to be part of a monster scheme. Near and Mello are really forced characters, and Mello doesn't even stay the same character in his short stay and ends up becoming a mess of identity (he's seriously, like, three different people in his short time on the show). When it comes down to it, the best and most interesting characters in the show are the Shinigami.\
I'm not a huge fan of the overall artistic style and the general presentation, and the crazy colour changes get old after a while, but it's nothing too off-putting.\
In the end, though, I did enjoy the series. I can see why it's so popular, but I do think it's rather overrated.\

    Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? \
A: Death Note. \
The protagonist, and his adversary, are both genius pretty boys (with the odd names of Light and L) who have an incredible amount of achievements and skill for their young age. Light somehow predicts things that he could not possibly have the foresight to predict, because, you know, probability is a thing.  Don’t worry though, it’s not like you know that he’ll always win, because L possesses this exact same unexplained and ludicrous ability to predict the future; he just does so without a cheesy \"Just as planned!\"\
          \
        catchphrase that makes me want to shoot myself every-time I hear it. In this way, rather than being a dark and mysterious thriller, Death Note often manages to be an overblown mental mudslinging contest between two impossibly perfect master practitioners of bullshit who are both describable in a single sentence. This is epitomized in an early scene where the two, who both have tennis skills at a professional level, get into a match and engage in a ridiculously drawn-out internal line of logic about how the desire to not lose might relate to the true identity of the other. \
\
Furthermore, what kind of psychological mystery thriller has a plot entirely driven by coincidences, improbabilities, and impossibilities? Again, Death Note. Plot devices like this were used every-time the anime found itself in a narrative corner, and these cop-outs always completely killed the tension that was built up to that point, while simultaneously disengaging the plot from the audience. \
\
The concept was intriguing, and I won’t say it did not entertain me at some parts, but it was ultimately far too flawed in its execution to be called enjoyable or good overall, and it never managed to pull off the promise of its premise. It seemed overdone at times, with eye-roll worthy developments, and lines like \"I take a potato chip and eat it!\" delivered with the utmost significance and conviction, devoid of any irony or self-awareness. Light’s ability, of writing a name in a notebook as a method of killing, is initially well established and limited, while being relatively creative, although you would think he’d be able to do a bit more with it, but the way the new rules of the note are introduced as the story goes on can get a tad contrived.\
\
Characterization quality is somewhat varied, but I would say that it's generally not all that good. It was bad, really. Light is a bit too perfect, his only flaws being the well-concealed logical results of his perfection, such as his narcissism and overconfidence. It could be argued that this flawlessness was intentionally done in an effort to depict the deconstruction of a seemingly perfect human being, but I think this concept eventually fell flat. It would have been far more interesting to see an average teenager find the note and watch the scope of his ambitions and arrogance develop over time. Light is arrogant, ambitious, and a staunch consequentialist from the very outset; this, logically, kills almost all opportunity for development.  As for the rest of the characters, L was far more interesting and entertaining than Light, although he was even more unrealistic, evoking the child prodigy and boy detective clichés among other things; I mostly found myself rooting for him rather than the protagonist.  Light's eventual \"girlfriend\" falls in love with him, to the extent of obsession, right away, as the plot commands it, and this insufficiently-explored obsession with him defines her entire character. There is absolutely nothing to her besides that, despite her eventually becoming one of the most significant characters in the series. In all actuality, the motivations for most characters, besides the protagonist and the Shinigami, are hazy at best and, with the exception of L, none of them are interesting in the slightest. \
\
There are some religious symbolisms and themes, which are underplayed and done well until a forced Christ allegory towards the middle, but this all kind of falls apart in the second half and all of the symbolism disappears. To make matters more dire, the already limited development of the protagonist stagnates and his adversary is quickly replaced by two identical, yet duller and less compelling, copies. At the same time, while the developments and additional rules to Light’s ability in the first half were often a bit contrived, they were usually better than nothing; pretty much all evolution stops in the second half, and it only gets worse. The anime essentially loses everything that it ever had going for it, and it then stays in that inadequate stage for the remainder of the plot, all leading up to an anticlimactic conclusion that the audience knew was coming from the very beginning. The anime would have lost nothing to speak of had that conclusion come  at least 10 episodes earlier than it did. Therefore, as the plot progressed, it increasingly lost its higher significance and simultaneously started to wear thin the initial appeal of its premise. \
\
The art is arguably the strongest, or least flawed, aspect of Death Note, the character design being particularly astounding, with the exception of a couple characters introduced in the second half whose designs were either dumb-looking or recycled. The art is generally pretty atmospheric and it never skimps on detail out of convenience, although not much detail is required in the first place. The design of the main antagonist, while understated, is particularly impressive due to the fact that he manages to be very aesthetically appealing, despite the ridiculous heroin chic vibe that the audience gets from him. The animation is nothing special, but it does not really have to be; this is not an action series. I feel like the art for the manga was superior, and it could have been done better in the anime adaptation, but any complaints I have about it are relatively minor. \
\
In the end, what Death Note did accomplish was hackneyed and not all that original; it could not be called \"deep\" nor was it ever cutting-edge in the grand scheme of things. The coincidences and general improbabilities that drove the plot bar it from being called \"realistic,\" more than the out-there premise ever could. That said, it should be given some credit for featuring a true antihero, who is still often admired by the audience, and ultimately not being afraid to portray him as pathetic. It also never used the character’s high school age as an excuse to throw light school-life hijinks into the plot. But these positive qualities unfortunately failed to have too much influence in the industry, and they are additionally outweighed by negatives in the universe of the anime itself. Code Geass, a blatant Death Note rip-off, wasted no time at all in taking every single good Death Note did and flipping it all on its head. I might recommend Death Note, if only for the first half, but only with a warning that it fell apart and that even the first half is not as great as it's often made out to be. You honestly might be best off watching the first half and simply skimming the plot summary of the second, because it has nothing of value to offer the viewer beyond that point. \

    This has to be one of the most ingenious shows ever!\
Yagami Light finds the Death Note, a notebook he found falling down from the sky one day. If he knows someone's face and writes down their name, they die.\
So, he wants to kill all the criminals in the world with this, and he gets off to a good start. But then this legendary detective - L - is set to stop him. So starts the battle of the extraordinary geniuses. Yes, they're geniuses. And the same can be said about the ones who created the show. At times I just had to pause it and\
          \
        take a deep breath because everything that happened was so ingenious. Seriously, how could anyone think up such a good plot. It's just... awesomeness! Light trying to avoid detection by L, and L trying to find out who the killer - a.k.a. Kira - is. They even get close and get to know each other, which just makes it so much better.\
The animation in this show is noteworthy. It's really nice, and I totally love some of the more intense scenes, as well as the scenes when Light or L is thinking, and everything is colored red or blue.\
The music is pretty cool, and I really like it. The second OP theme was really, really bad, though.\
The main character, Light. is a pretty interesting case. He seems to be an alright fellow who wants to rid this world of criminals. But I could explain thoroughly, psychologically, why he is nothing more than a overly intelligent psychopath.\
I really enjoyed watching this anime, and I believe most people will.\

    Adapted by Madhouse in 2006 from the popular Shonen Jump manga written by Ohba Tsugumi and drawn by Obata Takeshi, Death Note is an entertaining ride if an ultimately shallow work.  Unless you just got into the fandom, I’ll assume you are already familiar with the basic plot.\
One aspect of the show that its fans seem to constantly praise is its writing and if you can swallow the cheesy, over-the-top dialogue (\"All according to plan,\" must be repeated at least a dozen times throughout the series) then you will definitely be rewarded with fan-favorite gems such as the infamous, \"I’ll take a potato chip…\
          \
        and EAT IT!\" scene.  The writing also has a tendency to rely on unnecessarily absurd plans in order to establish its characters as geniuses.  While some viewers may find these facets clever and entertaining, others will want to slap their foreheads at the circuitous logic that gets forced upon them.\
As the manga was completed by the time the anime was under production, it doesn’t suffer from the common lack of an ending that plagues many anime titles.  Due to this the pacing is quite deft and if you allow it to pull you in, you can find it hard to stop watching.\
Due to the series premise alone, some questions on morality have to, and are, raised.  But to the detriment of the work, these ideas are never explored or expounded upon.  So while something like, \"Is it acceptable to take human life (for the ‘greater good’)?\" is presented it neglects to provide any further insight.  The heralded moralistic quandaries some claim are, unfortunately, fan-created illusions.\
Death Note’s biggest flaw is found within its characters.  They suffer from being one-dimensionally predictable and as a result from the lack of development the relationships between characters quickly become stale.  The author tried to remedy this with a twist at the series mid-point by inserting new characters, but it ultimately fails as they suffer from the same faults; character depth is not created by tacking on quirks.  When the most memorable traits the characters’ have is a knack for puzzles or an affinity for chocolate it means they aren’t particularly interesting.\
However, Death Note is by no means a terrible show.  Madhouse’s animation, with the exception of a very few amount awkward digital copouts scattered throughout the show, is quite slick and stylized.  It does an exceptional job at capturing the gothic atmosphere that appeals to the show’s targeted angsty teen demographic.  The music is another highlight which serves to set the tone for the series (especially the first opening song).  On top of that you really can’t go wrong with either the Japanese or the English dubs as both have their fair share of standout performances.  \
It’s because of these strengths that that the anime adaptation receives the recommendation over the manga.  It also glosses over the previously noted much weaker second half.  Other than the slightly different ending, it is faithful to the original material so much so that if you’ve already seen one version, it probably is not worth your time to experience both unless you are a huge fan.\
Finally, as long as you don’t go in expecting an analysis to complicated, ideological questions or complex characters, you will likely be pleased with what Death Note delivers.  It’s accessible, presents an appealing aesthetic and is a cut above your average Shonen Jump title.\

    Death Note will forever be the best suspense anime for me..... and millions of fans.\
The anime starts off Light Yagami, a brilliant college student. While walking towards home, he stumbled upon a notebook that has the word Death Note written on it. As soon as he finds out that the notebook can easily kill off anyone by just knowing the name and face of an person, Light only desire for one thing. To be God of the new world that he will create by erasing all unjust people of the world. And nothing in the world can stop him....except an illustrious detective, who hides under\
          \
        the alias of L, known for solving every case he took.\
While not successful on all fronts, it certainly does its share of anticipating, entertaining, and making the viewer think... which is a lot more than most anime's manage.\
There is nothing rare about some kid going against the world. But it is how he goes against the world that defines whether it'll be among the hundreds of trash out there, or become a silver anime that shine's brightly. Death Note is no silver by any means, it is a pure gold. The story is already promising enough to be recognize. But never have I encountered a complex weapon before the Death Note. To kill someone you have to know his face and name right? That is only one of the many rules and capabilities of the Death Note. As if fighting the whole world isnt already complicated to begin with. But Light manage to use this rules to his advantage.\
There is only one reason why Death Note's popularity is spreading like a wild fire.\
And that is the chess element of the anime. Aside from the anti-climactic ending, Death Note never fails to deliver suspense to the audience as it has already mastered suspense. As Light plans gets to rid the world of evil, L foils his constantly intrudes and foils plans. The whole anime is about both of them outsmarting each other. For Light, the ends justifies the means. Light will do anything to win, from manipulating people to using them until they're on lying their ass off on a death bed. . While L on the other hand, will do anything to stop Light from killing more people as humane and rational as possible. Their display of rivalry is excellent, the relationship they have is intricate at best. It was the most refined connection between rivals I have ever seen. And what makes them different from each other is their ability to think, not by physical means. To remain triumph over the other, one must first be one step ahead. In the case of this two, either of them remains in same position for each episode. Its a constant overturn, thanks to this, this is what makes Death Note is where it is today, everywhere.\
The animation was smooth, nothing to worry about there. But the characters design are a real treat... for the fan girls. Personally I would've prefer Light and L to look someone like the handsome Usopp(btw L and Ussop have the same seiyuu) of One Piece. That way, those people that are watching just for the superficial things, will be non-existent. Anyways, as for the music, besides than the OP's sounding worse than a fingernail scratching a blackboard, it was superb. It really set the mood. Whether it was Light or L, it never failed to leave me in an uncertain cognitive state. I was always in an apprehension about what is going to happen and the credit goes to the sound.\
If the anime had one weak point it would be character development. Although I was already pre-occupied with all thats happening, I cant deny the fact that its missing a piece. Its a really total letdown that Light and L never changes. Even the rest of the cast, has minimal transition. It wouldve been a nice change of pace to see Light do something right for a change rather than gradually becoming more wicked and apathetic. It felt that Light was a soulless cardboard cutout who can do little to generate audience empathy.\
Now I havent read the manga nor do I plan to but I thought that he second half of the show couldve been better, a whole lot better. Although it was still good, the decision to linger on was a pitfall. And the shocking turn of events, was the blunder of the show but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed critics in the history of connoisseurs, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb anime, to myself.\
Death Note is a pulse-racing treat that is among the best. It is a stunning display of suspense that is still unprecedented today. I cannot stress enough on how much I want you to watch this and have the time of your life. Suspense-wise, Death Note is a masterpiece.\

    There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Note faces is how seriously it takes the threat of a killer notebook being dropped into the world, and how realistic a stance\
          \
        it takes on the response by police forces.  Since it attempts to be as realistic as possible given a fantastic story, the viewer is forced to start viewing the show critically, and if you're like me, it might ruin the show as your critical viewing and analyzing, since it does have a mystery side, will slowly chip away at how much you're able to overlook plotholes and points that don't make much sense.\
But I digress, there isn't much I can say in the way of what exactly makes the plot \"fundamentally contrived\" without revealing too much and giving away some spoilers, but I'll do my best to give you my position and why I rated the show a four.\
Story: 3\
The story is the most important part of a show that focuses most of its time developing plot.  As far as I'm concerned, the actual story that the show puts together isn't bad, it's the way that it is executed that puts the score so low for me.  There's major problems with the way that the drama is created.  The main character is essentially given something extremely powerful and, in some ways, overpowered, in order to make it realistic that he would act the way he does in an attempt to establish his own ideals.  It would be impossible to justify the main characters actions, especially after making him a genius, if the Death Note wasn't so grandly unfair in its power.  Of course, this forces and equally unfair opponent, which is where most of the \"contrived\" nature of the show comes from.  The story focuses on L, a detective, trying to figure out who's killing people.  The problem is that since its by a supernatural force, the writers are forced to create situations in which L is able to bypass his ignorance of the presence of supernatural forces and still get closer to the culprit.  This culminates in a series of completely contrived assumptions that the detective L must make that are NEVER WRONG.  And right there is where my main problem with the show is.  Either L needs to know something and the show creates a situation in which he somehow obtains that information, or L makes an assumption and the show arranges itself such that the assumption is true and then provides some reason for why the assumption is logical and not, indeed, an ass-pull, when really every single one is an ass-pull.\
A story that relies so heavily on assumption and then does a poor job justifying why those assumptions are being pursued is difficult to watch.  It forces the show to create situations that seem too perfect, or plans that have a very slim chance of working, which of course work every time.\
Nevertheless, moving away from this aspect, there are yet more problems.  The show creates a set of rules early on to establish what's different between the world of Death Note and the regular world.  There's a lot of rules and parameters.  The show has issues dealing with these conditions later on when it realizes that the parameters that worked in the beginning now make things too difficult to create any sense of drama, since the person with the Death Note should, by any logical reasoning, have the absolute advantage all the time.  Once again, the show is forced to create situations that seem unreal, or that seem to artificially enhance the abilities and luck of the opposing characters in order to make it somewhat believable that any conflict would actually occur, and in the process runs into problems with the conditions it sets up in the beginning.  Sometimes it will ignore some basic principles it had set up for a scene beforehand, and your left wondering why that information or ability was ignored, or why the character doesn't just _______ or _______.  In the end, the story could have been executed much better with simple changes that wouldn't require contrived scenes and turns of events.  When the show attempts to artificially inflate one scene with more drama by creating a new aspect to the whole situation, it just makes future scenes more difficult because now it has to deal with what it created beforehand.  All of this together makes the story difficult to believe and watch.\
Art: 6\
It's a not a show you watch for the art.  It's got some pretty backgrounds, but you don't watch an animation for still shots of some city backgrounds now do you?  The animation isn't anything extraordinary.  \"Action\" usually takes the form of camera pans and people writing in notebooks.  Of course, that isn't to say that it isn't pretty or well drawn, but it just isn't anything spectacular.\
Sound: 6\
Once again, the soundtrack isn't anything to write home about, and some songs get played so often that it's almost comical.  They did take some risks with the OPs, making them heavy rock/metal, but once again, nothing too special here.  The music suits the setting/scenes well, but that's what you should be expecting from a professionally produced show, right?  Standards might be set in different places for some people, but this isn't a soundtrack I'll be listening to after the fact.\
Character: 4\
There's also some major problems with the characters, not so much as with the story but enough to be of note.  \
The first problem is with the main character, an antihero named Light.  He's introduced as your cliche \"tired with the world\" guy who's \"too smart for this shit\" and looks down on others.  He has a sense of justice that centers around punishment for all those who \"deserve\" it, and makes this very clear.  Light develops into something like your classic villain who sits in an armchair tapping his fingers together and who cackles and smiles evily every time something goes \"exactly as planned\".  I've never had a problem with plans coming together perfectly, in fact I like it better than the overdone \"perfect plan falls apart but the heroes pull through anyway because of some bullshit\", but Light's plans... well... the most I'll say is that both you and he should have little reason to believe that they will work, but most of the time they will anyway, regardless of what logic may say.  This gets even worse as time goes on and the situation gets even more dramatized and on a larger scale. \
Another issue I had was that Light makes some pretty questionable choices even though he's introduced as a genius, and most of those choices seem to be written in specifically for the purpose of giving the opposition a chance.\
L is the only other problem character.  I've already discussed it, but it's not realistic to believe that he's good enough at detective work to literally defy probability and reason multiple times in a row and be correct.  While he's weird and goofy, and sometimes he's actually clever and not just given wisdom from the writing staff, but he's given too much help from the writing staff to be a believable character.  \
Misa is just sort of annoying, but I have no real complaints about her character other than that.  She's your typical head-over-heels MC loving character and pretty much is introduced for the sole purpose of ensuring that neither party, Light or L, gets too much of an upper hand before the show has run long enough to replay the same sequence of events over and over again.  \
Enjoyment: 4\
It's difficult to enjoy a show that, against your better judgement, you start analyzing.  The main problem is that it's difficult NOT to look at the show critically when it's analyzing itself in the first place through detective work and giving you every reason to believe you should be treating the actions occurring as realistic outside of the existence of the Death Note in the real world.  The problems with execution are a real shame, because the show could have been very enjoyable if it allowed a viewer enough room to suspend disbelief without crossing the line and forcing the viewer to turn a blind eye if they wished to continue without getting critical of the plot and characters.\
Overall: 4\
I realize that my opinion is probably unpopular, and I expect that there's going to be some sort of backlash because of how low a score I'm giving to an extremely popular show, but I had real issues with the execution and couldn't look past the problems I saw.  The show could have been much better if they had gone about allowing the plot to progress in a more believable manner instead of stuffing it full of drama that forced unbelievable events to occur.\

    Watching this anime for the first time after all the praise I've heard for it lead me to be extremely disappointed.\
At first, the premise is interesting. The characters are interesting, everything just seems good.\
But as you continue watching it only sinks further and further down hill.\
Twists are as heavy handed as they are predictable, Plot holes appear every minute, The characters become less and less believable and well, kind of stupid.\
There's instances in the series where a character would have to be a complete moron to fall for what's going on. This is done for the purpose of making the main character seem like a\
          \
        genius.\
Now really, if you have to sink to that, it's just better off not doing.\
Now, I'll speak on behalf of one of the series's fine points, which is its art.\
The character design and overall look of Death Note is very nice and aesthetically pleasing.\
But aside from that, it's failed potential through and through.\
There's a few characters who are actually likable, but they're not enough to save Death Note from itself.\
Death Note is not a thinking man's anime. It's not even a good anime.\
Death Note is just bad.\
It's pretentious but also ridiculously silly, a terrible combination.\

    Death Note is probably one of the best series I've ever seen. What I really like about it is that I feel the need to pay attention  -  that rarely happens with the other series I've watched. If you blink too much you might miss what's happening.\
Everything that happened was just so interesting. The details are always so well thought of and there are little to no loopholes. I think something major happens in each episode. I always have my jaw dropped at the end of each episode. I do have to admit that Death Note died down around 25-26. I'll leave it at that\
          \
        to avoid spoilers.\
The characters are just amazing. The way they think and act really contributes to the output of the story. I like how Light, despite his evil and sick ways (I hate his evil grins and laughs, but I love him at the same time!), is made to be the hero of the story. He's actually more like an anti-hero. Although I have to say, he is very smart. If I didn't know who Kira was, I would think he was someone like Light. However, I love L even more! He's really, really smart and quick. I also love observing his eccentricities. Another character I like is Light's dad  -  Soichiro Yagami. His attitude, personality and beliefs are to be admired. I also like Mello, mostly because he's good eye candy. Men in leather = perfect eye candy. Misa is OK too  -  she's kind of a brat, but she is funny.\
The voice acting made the characters even more appealing and interesting. L sounds like he's eating his words, but it fits his personality really well. I hate Light's mocking laughter and I scringe when he uses 'Boku' instead of 'Ore' but again, it fits his personality. Plus there's Aya Hirano for Misa. Basically any character Aya Hirano plays comes out great.\
I always say that anything Madhouse animates is good enough for me. The same is true with Death Note. The animation is really good and for some reason, it reminds me of Batman. Maybe it's because Ryuk looks a bit like the Joker from the Batman series? The color coordination fits the mood and feel of the series. Most of the colors are dark and neutral and bright colors such as pink and yellow were rarely used.\
Most of the BGM were really eerie and creepy, again complimenting and accentuating the theme of Death Note. I really love the opening and ending themes too, especially the second OP and ED. Maximum the Hormone's 'What's up, People?' really rocks. I still can't get enough of it until now.\
I'm almost sorry, no I am sorry that I put it on hold for so long. I definitely was missing out and I hate myself for not realizing it sooner. I guess I'm hooked, like all the other Death Note fans out there. For me, Death Note in a word is -  Brilliant.\

    The #1 popular anime on this site, and perhaps in the world. But does Death Note deserve all that popularity and praise? People are entitled to their own opinions based off of how they perceived (if there were any) the themes in Death Note, and how much people individually enjoyed the anime. But this anime is definitely one that EVERYONE should watch and decide for themselves how much they like/dislike it. If you haven't seen Death Note yet, then I'd definitely recommend you to watch it, because in my own opinion, Death Note is the greatest anime made. Of course, I may have over-thought the\
          \
        \"deep\" concepts in Death Note that may not have been written to be interpreted that way, but I'll write in my review, facts and the way I personally interpreted Death Note. \
First off the story was surprisingly simple, yet captivating, creative, and rather genius. The story is told not from the view of the 2 main characters, but from the view of a Shinigami (God of Death), named Ryuk. Ryuk's world, the Shinigami realm is boring and slowly rotting away, and so, seeking excitement and a way out of his boring, repeating daily routines, Ryuk drops his Death Note into our human world. On Earth, in Tokyo, Japan, a genius, bored and disgusted (of our world) high school teenager, Light Yagami picks up the Death Note. Out of curiosity to see if what he has in his possession is an actually a deadly mass-murder weapon, (Death Note: Any human whose name is written in this note shall die) Light writes down the name of a criminal that was on TV in the notebook. 40 seconds later, the criminal is confirmed to have been found dead. Finding out the true power of the Death Note, Light accepts his \"role\" in life, and vows to use this Death Note for justice; to cleanse out evil from the world and make the world a better/safer place. Light claims that he will become pure justice itself in the world. In society, some people see Light's actions as wrong, and some as right; the public names Light, \"Kira\" derived from the American world: Killer. Then there's the world's greatest detective L (Lawliet) who sees Kira's actions as morally wrong, and pure evil; and L believes that he is \"righteous justice\". L teams up with the Japanese Task Force Police in an attempt to capture this criminal murdering, \"Kira\" guy. And so, the epic, and intelligent Cat & Mouse game between Light and L begins. Justice Vs Justice. Who will win, and who is true justice? \
Often in great literature, the main character is a morally ambiguous character who has a naive dream that eventually leads him to his downfall; teaching the viewers/readers a life-lesson. Such is the case with Death Note. Light's dream to kill all the criminals in society today, and then become the God (Ruler) of the world was very, very naive. First off, when a criminal dies, there'll be another criminal that takes his/her place, the cycle will never end: that's human nature, we're not made to be pure and perfect. Secondly, killing criminals is not the solution to creating a better world. Killing other humans, even if they are this so-called \"evil\", is just wrong to begin with. But what about pollution, rich, corrupt business men/government employees? This is our reality, there will never be a perfect world, and no human will ever be perfect. Light Yagami's dream of getting rid of criminals started out as pure and naive, but as the temptation of power and struggle for survival increases, the purity of his dream dies away. There's a famous saying, \"Absolute power, corrupts absolutely.\" Light Yagami and his dream became corrupt as the story progressed, and he eventually gets overwhelmed by the immense greatness of his power/dream. Light had a bright future, and everything a teenage boy could want. He was accepted into the greatest college, as the top student, his family was financially stable, and he lots of friends/ and girls that like him. But because of a naive dream, he loses everything, his future, his happiness, and his innocence. I believe that the anime sends a message to the viewers about corruption, temptation, right/wrong, righteous/evil, and accepting reality. The apple was referred to as Ryuk's favorite fruit, and comes up quite often in the anime. Why do you think that is? It's because apple's are the symbol for temptation (Adam and Eve), and the Death Note in the anime is often connected to an apple (and when Light uses the Death Note, it's like he's taken a bite from the apple and gives into temptation). Is what Light did right? In my opinion, NO. Is Light evil? That's where he's morally ambiguous. Is Light's mindset evil, or is the power to kill (Death Note) the real evil? Moving onto L Lawliet's character: To me, L is a character that represents Jesus. He came, and served in order to protect the people, even those that didn't trust/like him. If you watch Death Note, then on episode 25 before an absolutely tragic climax, there's a scene that's the betrayal of Judas (to Jesus), which was represented by Light and L. Honestly, I may have over-thought things, but from my take of the anime, this is why I believe Death Note is a masterpiece, and perhaps the greatest anime I've ever seen.\
The art and music in the anime were masterful. This anime was made almost 10 years ago, can you believe that? But the art still bests most of the art today, not in the sense of beauty, but in the sense of matching the mood of the anime and realism. I particularly liked the portrayal of Light and L. Light was portrayed as a very handsome teenager, who was bright and popular, while on the other hand, L was portrayed as an (not so good-looking), isolated, weirdo. I found that to be pretty symbolic actually. But enough with the symbolism, and onto the soundtracks. The soundtrack in Death Note is the best soundtrack in an anime, period. Not only are the music delightful to listen to, but they also fit the anime perfectly, and the soundtrack built up the suspense in every episode. Each character got their own theme song (all amazing), there were church chants (matched the mood of the anime perfectly), and EPIC songs (that made the anime so epic, despite there being no physical action). Well, deserved 10/10s.\
I will not write about how much and why I enjoyed this anime, because then it would take up probably 10 pages of writing. I'll just say that this is (in my opinion and many other's) the greatest anime ever, and that everyone, no matter what genre you like, should AT LEAST give a watch. If you don't like it, then that's fine, everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but not giving Death Note a try, would be a mistake of a lifetime. Thanks for reading.\

    This is one of the most engaging thriller anime i have ever seen EVER. How could that be? Let me count the ways...\
Story - The first story arc involves an extremely intelligent high schooler (Yagami Light) with the power to kill against the best detective the world has to offer (only known to the world as \"L\"). Its a classic story of cat and mouse, one consistently outwitting the other with cunning tactics and sly tricks. Each episode also leaves the viewer with just enough suspense to keep you wanting more EVERYTIME! Not only that, like any good detective show (i.e. CSI), both main characters\
          \
        love to tell the viewers exactly how they pull off plans and show of their intelligence.\
Animation its very good and smooth no stuttering. The whole screen seems to have a purpose. The mood of the whole show is dark and shadowy theme which is why its predominantly black, night scenes, dark lit rooms, clothing, etc. The great thing about having the main theme as black is that they can portray certain emotions easier (i.e. snow representing innocence, apples being bright red, protagonist = white, antagonist = black, etc.) my only gripe is mostly dark... you'll understand when you start watching. \
Without a good storyline and good animation, you might as well throw the characters out the window since you wont relate to them. But thanks to the outstanding story and very good animation, the characters are some of the best in the business. You'll really relate to the characters point of view, thanks mainly to their thoughts being spoken aloud. They take \"getting inside their head\" to a whole new level. \
Overall this is one anime that you wont forget for a long LONG time...\

    Death Note is original, awesome, and a great anime to watch. The only reason it isn't perfect is because of Near who has to be the lamest enemy ever. Also, the ending was a total cop-out. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. \
The art wasn't that great, but I sure did like this anime anyway. \
The sound was fitting; it suited the tense atmosphere and scenes. \
The characters were all intriguing and deep, especially Light. It's cool to see such an evil protagonist in an anime. He's certainly original. \
If you want a super-cool anime to watch, watch Death Note. Except for L and Near, who made everything\
          \
        totally unfabulous. \

    Death Note\
Before you read this review I want you to know that a '10' does not mean perfect, because nothing is perfect. A rating of '10' is what MAL says it is, 'outstanding.'\
Story (10/10)\
I'm not going to bother writing a synopsis of the preface of the story since you can read one if you scroll up a little. So moving onto to what I thought of it:\
One of the things I loved about Death Note is I felt the need to pay attention. If you don't, you're going to miss what's going on -- and not only did I need to pay attention, I wanted\
          \
        to. Something I haven't experienced in an anime for a long time. The story was unique, original, intriguing, and really makes you rethink your own morals and views on the world, another thing I had yet to experience while watching an anime. On a side note, I personally loved the motifs, themes and symbols seen in the anime -- they're very original and really reflect the plot and just make you say, wow. How cool.\
Some argue that Death Note sank after the first 25 episodes or so, but I happen to beg to differ. Just because a certain character isn't there anymore doesn't mean the story is any worse. In fact, in  my opinion it only got more suspenseful and exciting until the excellent and stunning finale. The story is outstanding.\
Art (8/10)\
I can't really elaborate much on the art and animation seen in Death Note. To reflect the dark plot, bright colors were rarely used which I view a plus, animation flowed nicely for the most part and the hair especially I think was well-animated and looked nice. Nothing really spectacular about it though. Very good art, but nothing more, nothing less.\
Sound (9/10)\
A very good bonus that I fear some may overlook in Death Note was the sound and music. Sure, I didn't personally like the second opening all that much (though I <3 the first) but it's incredibly fitting to the series and all the animation in each opening and ending themes are very nice and original. However, the real thing I want to touch on here is the amazing job done by the voice actors. Most notably Mamoru Miyano's role as Light Yagami. It was absolutely stunning and most excellent. Of course, that's not to say the other voice actors did a bad job, in fact, they also did fantastic, but he stood out the most to me personally.\
Character (10/10)\
Along with the initial plot, themes & motifs, the best part of Death Note is the characters. Oh, the characters. I can almost guarantee you'll come to love one and loathe another. The characters are original and full of life as opposed to boring archetypes that I seem to be seeing more of everyday in anime. Not only that, but Death Note has easily brought me some of the most unique characters I've ever seen an anime, hands down, which I believe to be a very good thing.\
\
Final Thoughts\
Those of you who've read my other reviews should know by now that I don't let 'enjoyment' affect my overall score since it's pure personal opinion -- obviously someone who doesn't like a psychological-shounen-drama like Death Note won't enjoy it -- however, I enjoyed every single episode, every single minute, and every single second immensely. To this date (August 16, 2008), Death Note stands as my #1 favorite anime. It brought a new light to something I didn't think was possible to be in an anime with wonderful character, a unique and original plot that makes you really think, and just an overall terrific thrill ride.\

    I might be the only living anime fan that hasn't enjoyed Death Note.  The reason really is because it seemed to be gimmicky to me.  It doesn't mean this series is in any way bad, no not at all, it just isn't my cup of tea as they say.  After about half the series I began to feel less and less like finishing, counting the number of episodes I had left to watch.  To be honest it is a quality series with many and more good features, themes, characters and ideas, but it just didn't mesh with me.  \
The writing\
          \
        in the series is its strongest points and the voice it uses to tell the story in each episode is very strong, I suppose the real problem I had was with the supporting characters, I just didn't find any of them really entertaining.  The plot was good and can keep you on your toes.  The series also keeps up a good pace throughout.  Would I watch it again?  No.  Does that mean you shouldn't watch it?  No, if you enjoy decent anime with horror/supernatural themes with a splash drama then you'll be truly happy with Death Note, so sayth Lord Nyarlathotep. ",

    \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\" – Death Note\
Imagine one day you come across a notebook, but it’s not like those notebooks that you can buy at the nearest bookstore for a buck or two. By writing someone’s name on that notebook, you can kill that someone. What would you do? Would you kill those people who bully you during your grade school? Would you kill those who rejected you when you confessed your love? Or would you…?\
The story of Death Note starts when a perfect student, appearance-wise and intelligence-wise, Yagami Light comes across the Death Note, a Shinigami’s (God\
          \
        of Death, literally) notebook. On Death Note, an instruction of how to use the Death Note is written in English language. Light, being curious, tries to write a criminal’s name onto the Death Note, and much to his disbelief, the criminal dies. Light then vows to rid the world of evil to make a better world, he executes every criminal under the alias of Kira (Japanese interpretation for the English word \"killer\"). Fast forward for a few weeks, the polices begin to notice there are unusual deaths going among the criminals, they then decide to bring in the legendary detective L to track down whoever is killing the criminals.  Although it is true that the criminal rate has gone down drastically ever since Kira shows up, L believes that Kira is promoting peace in the wrong way.\
First of all, I have to say that the art is really well-drawn. Although it is tagged as shounen and most of the time it shows guys, the girls are really well drawn as well. The art style in this anime is really suitable for the genre. The art tries to be as \"anime-like\" as possible while maintaining its realistic and mysterious quality. I personally think there isn’t any better-suited drawing style for Death Note.\
I like to think that I’m an audiophile myself, and I find this anime really interesting sound-wise. The background music, which slides in every now and then, will allow you to feel the suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice actors/actresses are also very good. The voices for \"shinigamis\" are well dubbed in a hoarse voice.The opening and ending songs are really good, lyrics wise and music wise.\
The characters are very unique and varied. Light won’t bat an eye when he is killing other people, L likes to sit with his legs raised on the chair. Light and L are pretty much opposite in everything they do, but they both don’t like losing, and they will do practically anything to avoid it. Other characters, like Amane Misa, which will be introduced later as the anime goes, is also very unique. Out of all the characters in the anime, I personally find L very interesting.\
Death Note is one of those animes that require a bit of thinking in order for you to fully understand what’s going on. It’s really interesting to see how Kira and L try to outsmart one another, and it’s even more interesting when you can actually understand why they do what they do. That aside, if you are looking for some easy-viewing anime without any thinking, Death Note definitely is not your cup of tea.\
For those of you romance-lovers: although Death Note does provide some romance, (and by some, I totally meant little to none) expect to see Light doing some romantic manipulation scenes instead of lovey-dovey scenes.\
Bottom line, I really enjoyed this anime, and I will recommend this to almost anyone out there with decent comprehension level. Although this anime is relatively old (it was released in 2006), I feel the need to review this anime since I think this anime is hands-down one of the best animes out there. If you like those animes which require you to think, give this anime a shot and let me know what you think below! Oh, my personal favorite character is L, what’s yours?\

    When approaching Death Note it is important not to let any preconceptions you may have about the series cloud your vision of the series itself. Being one of the most popular anime/manga series of recent times, means that it has its fair share of both advocates and detractors. In fact it is easy to have already formed an opinion on Death Note without having watched a single episode or read a single volume.\
So, does it live up to the hype? Is Death Note a series worth watching? Well, the answer, as is often the case, is both yes and no.\
The series' plot is one of\
          \
        it's major selling points. Being somewhat loosely classed as a 'Psychological thriller', the storyline is the single most important aspect of the series' success. The series certainly starts out strongly, with the first five or so episodes being an expositional roller-coaster, the series, whilst being a tale of the supernatural, remains grounded in the real world. The characters are empathetic, with the two leads sitting on different sides of a distinct moral fence. However, about halfway through, the series begins to take a turn for the worse. The frequent logical jumps made by the characters become more impossible (I know they're supposed to geniuses, but come on!), their motives and intentions become cloudier and the plot begins to lose the fast pace it had in the beginning. By the time it reaches it's climax, the plot plods along without much motivation. Reasons and motives are never really fully explained, and when they are they don't always make a lot of sense and tend to be very confused. As is often the case with series that have explosive beginnings, Death Note peters out towards the end, to the point in which you are left uninterested in the climactic final episode.\
In terms of artwork, however, Death Note is sublime. The entire series is conducted in a 'realistic' greyish filter with no real bright colours. The characters are wonderfully animated, and the stylistic 'epic-writing' scenes are a wonder to behold (if not somewhat ridiculous). The audio aspect of the series, however is a bit of a mixed bag. The voice actors all do good work with their roles, and some of the music is very good indeed, the first ED in particular is excellent. However, the background music and sound of much of the series is not particularly notable, and a the second two OP and EDs are, in my opinion, far inferior to their predecessors.\
In terms of characters, Death Note provides us with an interesting selection. We have the Gary Stu main character, who (one suspects) is somewhat of a wish-fulfilment character for the author, and his nemesis, L, who spend most of his spare time eating a variety of chocolates and cakes without putting on any weight. Both of which are prone to omniscient leaps of logic, jumping to the correct conclusions without any significant evidence, or even hunches. Probably the most interesting character of the series is Ryuuk, the Death God, who gets unfortunately little screen time as the series progresses. Ryuuk spends most of his time cackling, eating apples and looking gangly, a refreshing simple character in a Byzantine series. \
As I have already mentioned, I initially enjoyed the series greatly, the characters were fresh and the plot interesting enough. However, the series starts needlessly complicating things around episode 15 with triple and even quadruple bluffs from the two main characters playing off against one another. The change in tone and pace after episode 25 also dampened my enjoyment of the series, with new characters being introduced that were either uninteresting or gimmicky (Melo's chocolate bar chomping and N's toys got old pretty quickly).\
Despite a somewhat scathing review compared to other reviews on this site, I do not think Death Note is a bad anime. On the contrary it has a refreshingly unique concept, and the characters, despite being somewhat idealised, are likeable and interesting. However, a dramatic decline in quality and pace, as well as issues with the plot means that this anime cannot really be truly considered an all-time great\

    This is a unique show that brings a new meaning to the concept of 'Death Gods'. Death Note would have to be the finest written non-action, non-romance anime/manga of our time, with a story that can easily get you hooked. ^_^\
This is the setting of this incredibly unique show. From the summary it may not seem like something worth watching but the first two episodes are capable of getting almost any anime fan hooked, to this thought-provoking show. Underneath all the death and normal day-to-day occurrences is a battle of wits, where you have two geniuses Light and L, constantly trying to outsmart each other.\
          \
        During these mental clashes it is easy to change the side you support, as both characters are so alike but with different ideals.\
The animation quality of this show can only be described as 'perfect'. The character designs are highly detailed and strangely enough, even a lot of detail is put into something as simple as writing that it can make anything seem so dramatic. There's really nothing negative that can be said about the animation because no corners were cut in the production process.\
The music helps add to the spectacular viewing experience, with the addicting opening and ending themes and a superb orchestra score to back it up. The only bad thing is the deafening 2nd opening theme, which you'll either love or hate.\
Overall this anime is a masterpiece able to turn a simple plot of a notebook giving the user the power of death, into something so thought-provoking and intricately written that you'll be glued to every word that's said. The only bad points are that there's some unneeded comedy and a phase when the show went downhill a little but this short period didn't last long. Although some of it changed from the original manga storyline, it managed to end disturbingly well, wrapping up everything with no lose ends. So I recommend Death Note to any shounen anime fan, who wants to try something a little different.\

    Death Note was probably one of the first anime series for which I read the manga first, but that's the main reason I was disappointed in it.\
STORY - As I said in my review of the manga, I find Death Note's story impressive in many ways, the most prominent of which is its ability to deal with such serious and controversial issues without offending or alienating anyone. The themes in this series are some of the most relevant and volatile ones I've encountered in a long time, and I really admire the manga for that. Unfortunately, adaptations of brilliant works will always be subject to\
          \
        comparisons with the original. This will probably be a very comparative review then, and I know myself to be a bit of a purist; that's my bias. Just keep it in mind, I suppose. \
The first twenty-three or so episodes of the anime were wonderfully done as they did followed the manga almost exactly. Sure, there were a few hiccups here and there (for seemingly no reason), but as a whole, I was satisfied. The story was good, and the storytelling was good. But then everything fell apart. The spoiler episode was awful. They tried too hard. They changed too much. One of the most dramatic things about the entire ordeal was that even though there was certainly anticipation, the actual event seemed to come out of no where. It had been sudden and went against all expectations. The storytelling in the manga had been fantastic. The anime made it far too predictable, far too cliche, and it tried way too hard to turn it into a gigantic sobstory. And it didn't impress me. I know I have a hard time seeing this anime as a standalone work, but even if I hadn't already read the manga, I feel like I would have thought this important turning point in the series was done in a completely over-the-top and unnecessary way. There were just so many utterly awkward and useless moments thrown in that I was left wondering what the hell the producers had been thinking. Did I dare think anything would improve?\
I was surprised to see that the anime was only 37 episodes. The manga was 108 chapters with your very clear halfway point at 58. This translated into episode 25 of the anime. Why compact the last 50 chapters into a measly 12 episodes? I am inclined to think that because the second half of the manga was considerably less popular compared to the first, they didn't think it necessary to dwell too much on it. This was unfortunate because it means they had to rush everything and consequently seemed to give very little thought to the build up and suspense that was so key in the manga. The last few episodes were a blur, character development was thrown out the window, tension remained low, and the end was disappointingly underwhelming. They once again, tried too hard to make a tragedy out of it when it wasn't supposed to be a tragedy at all. They changed the final tone of the series and completely ignored/overwrote what two of the characters ended up doing. I'm not so anal that I don't think changes from the original can be good (indeed, I adored both Death Note live action movies and they were incredibly different), but changes need to be done for a reason, and none of the changes that happened in transition from manga to anime made any sense to me.\
CHARACTER - For the most part, the anime remained true to the manga characterizations. Light was as conniving as ever, and L retained all of his endearing little quirks. Because of the condensed nature of the anime though, some of the detectives in the investigation team ended up not as developed or explored as their manga counterparts. The most drastic of the personality cuts fell on Mello though. Near was lucky enough to retain much more screentime than his counterpart and his character was mostly the same as a result. Mello, on the other hand, was reduced to nothing more than a chocolate-munching tool with an incredibly flat personality. And poor Matt wasn't even explained in his entire five minutes of screentime. Of course, Matt wasn't all that vital of a character, but if that was the case, why include him at all? No time is better than half-assed time. And considering Mello and Near's inevitable 'partnership,' I felt like he was really cheated out of better development in the anime.\
Additionally, because some material was changed from the manga, some characters ended up acting in ways they never did before, and these actions conflicted with their personalities. I still don't really understand why any of these changes were made other than to force the idea of a grand tragedy, which is kind of silly in the end. :/\
Other than that, you can refer to my obnoxiously long section on characters in my manga review.\
ARTSTYLE & ANIMATION - Though the anime didn't quite capture the essence of Obata's style, it was still well-rendered, and I would consider the animation to be on the higher end of the spectrum for series these days. The details in characters like Misa and Ryuk were well done, and the realistic environment of the world they lived in translated well from manga to anime. It was also interesting (and kind of hilarious) to see the high number of over-exaggeration, over-dramatization, and over-emphasis for some sequences in the series. As the manga had very little actual action, Death Note was destined to be a 'talking' anime, but it didn't seem to want to just take that label sitting down. Indeed, in between the talking, there are wild arm gestures, epic crunching of potato chips, and some of the most ridiculous depictions of the act of writing you've ever seen. Seriously.\
The most notable art and animation in the series was probably contained in its themes though. Both openings and both endings had a very experimental style to them that I really appreciated. The strong, symbolic colors worked well, and the craziness of some of things (lol, second OP?) really added to the experience. I kind of wonder if the carry-over of Light's EVIL RED EYES into the actual episodes was a bit overkill though.\
MUSIC - I was incredibly pleased with Death Note's soundtrack and especially the music for its openings and endings. It isn't often you get some of the harsher jrock stuff in anime. As Death Note presents itself as a fairly serious series, it was interesting to note that the wildness of its theme songs suggested at least a little bit of self-mockery. Then again, maybe that's just the impression I get as an American viewer; certainly the Japanese don't always realize that their use of Engrish is often hilarious to us. Already a fan of Nightmare, I was very happy with the first OP and ED themes; 'The World,' especially, seemed to work well considering the themes of the series; there is a tension in the vocals that parallels with all of the drama and suspense in Death Note, and 'Alumina' offers a more mellow and uncertain mood at the end of each episode. The second pair of themes by Maximum the Hormone were also pretty brilliant. Of course, 'What's up people?' has become infamous in itself for its refrain and near-psychedelic animation sequence, but really, I think the song works well for the latter portion of the series, and the 'Zetsubou Billy' is a good follow up for 'Alumina' as well. It's pretty rare to see a group do both themes for a certain cluster of episodes, but I really think this set-up works great.\
The rest of the soundtrack is impressive because, once again, it's able to capture the mood and themes of the series very well. L's theme is mysterious and a bit badass, and there is a slew of crazy dramatic orchestral and opera pieces that I think is incredibly appropriate for Kira's executions. What is with this association with classical music and death? In any case, this dramatic music, coupled with the animated over-emphasis of certain motions, makes even the most mundane of action sequences fun to watch (if not a bit silly), It definitely succeeds at entertaining you anyway.\
VOICE ACTING - I watched 1-25 and 36-37 subbed, and then followed the entirety of the dub as it aired. Let's talk about the sub first. The hilarious implications of Yamaguchi Kappei being the voice of L aside, I really enjoyed the Japanese cast for Death Note. Light's voice fit well with what I'd expected, and Kappei really did a fantastic job with L, though I thought would be tricky not only because of his unique personality and quirks, but because his age was largely unknown. I also really liked Ryuk's and Rem's voices as they were both rather strange and unique and thus fitting, considering their supernatural existence. Misa was maybe too genericly 'cute,' but she didn't really have that complicated of a personality to depict anyway. The investigation team also had some great voices; Matsuda in particular had a wonderfully appropriate voice and was fun to listen to.\
Now, the dub. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over the absolute hilarity that is the fact that Brad Swaile is Light Yagami. For the Gundam Wing fans among us, yes, that means that your pacifist Quatre Raberba Winner is your megalomaniac Kira. Of course, Quatre did go crazy for that one episode, so maybe it isn't so farfetched after all... In any case, because Swaile didn't really change his voice for the role, I had a hard time un-hearing it as Quatre and thus had the persisting impression that Light sounded far too innocent and nice, even when he was having one of his monstrous monologues. L's voice I was pleasantly surprised at because I'd never imagined they'd be clever or insightful enough to give him the slightest British accent. His age also remained appropriately ambiguous, and I appreciated the efforts to make him sound socially awkward as well. Was it as good a performance as Kappei? No, but I still found it rather impressive.\
Ryuk and Rem also had pretty awesome dub voices, while Misa fell into the trap of having an annoyingly high-pitched, cute-girl voice, though I'd blame her general personality for that more than her voice actor. Most everyone else, including all of the detectives, Mikami, Takada, Near, and the SPK, had good, solid, and appropriate dub voices. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for poor Mello who gets cheated again. Considering the otherwise decent dub cast, I was really surprised (and actually somewhat shocked) that Mello got stuck with some kind of stupid jock kind of voice. Seriously, what the hell happened? His voice was nasally and obnoxious, and it really sounded like his actor was trying too hard and failing miserably with every attempt to sound badass and/or serious. Matt also got a mediocre voice, but hey, he got like... two lines, so whatever, I guess.\
OVERALL - Honestly, if you count them, there aren't all that many changes between the anime and manga, but what did change was very significant. It's the little details that entirely change the way you might look at something. Some characters didn't get their final words; some characters did things they never would have done (and didn't). I'm indignant on these characters' behalf. Maybe I'm fixating a bit too much on these details though. Most of the story did remain intact, and the technical aspects of the show (animation, art, music, etc) were certainly impressive. In the end, I suppose how much you enjoy this depends a lot on whether you've already read the manga and how much of a purist you are.\

    Basically a brief summary of Death Note from my point of view:\
Death Note is a show that needs no introduction at all. The name is on pretty much everyone's lips, the people who have watched it or not and one thing which is certainly true is that if you aren't living under a rock all this time there's a very good chance you have heard the name atleast once in your life. It's one of the very few mediums that have crossed boundaries of it's specific origin and in this case, anime. Yes, Death Note is a name that has gone beyond the peripheral reaches\
          \
        of animation and is on a whole new level shared by a few. Dragon Ball Z, Attack on Titan, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood etc. are some of the titles if named. Even so, there's a great amount of daylight between all these and Death Note, which stands atop the popularity section here on Myanimelist, with members flowing in and the number rising by the second. \
The moment you step inside the world of Death Note, it takes a firm hold of you, denying to let go. The adrenaline this show provides is immense, keeping the viewer on his toes for almost every minute of the twenty-three. This is one of the greatest assets and the very core of success for Death Note. With a mind-boggling storyline and head-twisting plot twists, Death Note leaves no chance for the viewer to look away and is captivating throughout the entire process. And thus it also provides a high rewatch value. Perhaps one major mistake the show made is by introducing the two antagonists in the form of Near and Mello. With the addition of these two and Light seemingly in reach of his motive, Death Note loses all its tension and thrill which was imminent in the first arc of the show. To put it rightly, the story gets all mixed up and moves away slowly from its path. This however is not a good reason to look down on the show as a whole, which is still extremely and incredibly well executed. The popularity of Death Note and the fact that is one of the greatest piece of art ever made goes hand in hand with over 669k members and growing by the second. Death Note's place is cemented as the show that lit a fire on the industry and produced an inferno that would last forever. ",

REVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\
DEATH NOTE one of the most well-known anime worldwide and highly ranked. \
Let's start! :)\
\
-STORY: 8-\
Don’t get carried away, the story isn’t really unique, after all it is –almost- your typical \"vigilante\" –or hero of justice- anime with a twist. The \"lore\" –to call it somehow- used in the story IS what makes it unique.\
Enter Death Note, a book that falls from the sky, a book that is able to kill people by picturing the person on your mind and writing his or her name on the book –probably\
          \
        the most original thing in the shows-. \
The story starts with a bang, a very well-grounded \"myth\" and focus but after some episodes it becomes dull, repetitive and unimpressive -thing that usually happens with some mystery/police/detective anime shows- losing the decent ambient showed on the first episodes.\
From the start of the \"second\" part of the show it becomes predictable. I understand what they were trying to do; displaying a bigger and more intricate situation and world but what the writers achieved was to create a boring way to create the climax that would lead to the ending of the show –a very predictable ending if I may add-.\
The beginning of the \"third\" part, \"the real climax and ending\" –the last 10 episodes- are probably the \"best\". As I’ve stated before since the beginning of \"part 2\" the show becomes predictable and it doesn’t promise anything more but a great, expected yet graceful ending. The climax starts from the episode 30 –more or less- leading to an ending of \"fireworks and explosions\" –I mean this. You’ll need to see the show to know if it’s symbolically or literal-.\
To be completely honest, I was disappointed that the \"myth\" in which the story is based –the book and gods- doesn’t evolve it just gets \"stuck in the back\" of most of the story, like an inconvenient thing that will be used when it becomes convenient.\
The thing that saved –in my opinion- the story department in the show is three things: One: the ambition of the writers, a very interesting premise that will lead eventually to better things –in the end of the show-. Two: the suspense carried through the entire show. As I said before some episodes are dull and repetitive, but that doesn’t mean that there’s no interesting or good closing scene. And three: Something so small yet so important in the whole show the debate of what’s right and what’s wrong. Or in other words Light or L?\
\
-ART: 7- \
Outdated. That’s a word that I would use for the art in this show but let us remember that it was aired from 2006 to 2007. Death Note doesn’t have one of those art styles that \"immerse\" you into the show. It’s just generic. Does this means is bad? No, not at all, it just means that the art isn’t the most important thing in the show and that the art isn’t something memorable. The dark \"palette\" is good but it’s just there to give the mood and not to amaze the viewer. \
As a psychological show, most of the time the characters are talking and there isn’t really \"that much\" action making me believe that the ART team could have done something more or something better. \
In the last episodes the art becomes –really- much better, the \"palette\" changes from dark colors to brighter color giving a better sensation that in most of the show. \
\
-SOUND: 6-\
The voice acting isn’t a role model nor inspiring, it isn’t imposing something good. It’s typical and not passionate –until the last episode-. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is forgettable and uninteresting with some good choirs or piano compositions thrown at key moments. There’s nothing left to say except for the main themes that slightly save that department.\
\
-CHARACTER: 6-\
Disappointing, That’s the word I will use, other word would be \"wanting\".  \
The presentation of the characters is great.  Here you have Light, a character that looks amazing and really interesting but the through the show becomes typical.\
The rest of the characters regretfully as it may sound, are boring and plain. With the understandable exceptions of \"Light\" –of course- and \"L\". Characters that are incredibly smart, making the rest of the characters look dumb and ordinary with no business there; this in my opinion is short from all the potential they could have \"squeezed\" from most character (ex. Touta Matsuda). \
Being a show that depicts very intelligent people such as L and Lightning, to be honest, I’ve seen better portrayed \"masterminds\" in other anime -predominantly Lelouch vi Britannia (Code Geass) character usually compared to Light-\
The most disappointing part of the characters is their development which is your typical \"development\" in a psychological show. The typical cold and calculating characters that turn into the obsessive and mad characters, nothing new there. What started as a great mastermind character –Light- ended as an average psychological MC.\
\
-ENJOYMENT: 8 & OVERALL: 7-\
I would be lying if I told you that I didn’t enjoy DEATH NOTE, the waiting –through some boring episodes- to see how the -obvious and unavoidable- ending would unveil itself. The show isn’t bad, the premise as I told before is good, it promises something great, but the journey from begging to end its just boring in most episodes and the ending –expected I’m sure by most- is beautiful and as I said \"poetic\". \
Would I recommend it? Yes, but it doesn’t reach the potential it promises. \

    I'm one of the few people who would never say this is one of the best animes of all times and here is why:\
Although the plot of Death Note seems to be very interesting to me, I really belive it is painfully developed all over the anime.\
For me was pretty cool when the two main characters was presented has rivals (Light and L): I belived it would be really interesting to see which of them will defeat the other and how. However, all I could get watching it was fucking stupid monologues in which Light and L where ridiculously guessing each other thougts.\
Here it's an\
          \
        example of a joke I found on a spanish web (Inciclopedia) of an hypothetical battle of \"Rock-paper-scissors\" between Light and L:\
(YAGAMI LIGHT THINKING): \"The most logical to do would be play rock; L must know this, because of what he would probably play paper, and to defeat him I must play scissors. But: what if he discovered my plan? If that's what it is, to beating my paper he would play scissors, and therefore I should keep playing rock. But maybe he tought that I would think this way, so I must play paper...\"\
This is a fun example of what I belive is pretty much all you can find on Death Note. Really: this is what this anime is about. At the beginning is \"ok\", but then it just gets dummer and dummer, and in my case finished in the desire of killing the screenplayer. \
For the other hand, before watching Death Note you need to consider that you'd probably never expect to find what you will in the second half of the anime. And I'm not saying it in a good way: on the contrary, from my point of view the second half of Death Note is a big peace of crap. It is as if the writer had died, and a complete asshole had replaced it. \
About the characters I would say, although there are a lot of them, only a few has their own personality, and by the way, a non very deep one.  In the particular case of the only important female character, Misa,  I need to say she is hatefully annoying and do not have a will for her own: the only thing she does is adoring Light Yagami because he is hot, in other words: she is as shallow as she can be.\
Another thing: I have to admit I like L wiredness, but I hated when among the story more \"wired\" characters appear: for me they were just mediocre imitations. Don't make me talk about the guy that was always eating the beginning of a chocolate bar (you would never see him eating a whole bar: I belive he makes one bite, throw away the bar, open a new one, makes another bite, and so on).  \
Finally I have to admit I enjoyed the music and also the animation: they were really good... but that's not enough to make Death Note a a good anime. \
So: this anime sucks, and the only think I really love about it is the way some people make fun of it. If you want to watch it... go on, probably you will like it because most people does. However, if you watch it and you hate it, have for sure you will make fun of it forever and ever.  \
P.D.: yeah, the characters are hot, especially if you're a girl, or a gay guy.\

    Death Note is areally wickid awsome anime that is pretty much one of the best. Everything about it is pretty cool and set up well so thatalso makes t a good anime to watch.\
Story: Death Note is about a 17 year old student names Light/Ratio Yagami who one day stumbles apon a book called the 'Death Note' that the shinigami Ryuk droped into the human world from the shinigami world. After a few days of playing with the death note Light meets Ryuk. Because is trying to make the world a better place by killing all the criminals with heart attacks or so o he\
          \
        is nicknamed 'Kira' which in japanese means killer. Also because of what he is doing the famous detective L Lawliet and some other police go on a hunt to find this so called kira and bring him to justice. We get into more charactes and other things when you get deeper into the episodes.\
Art: The art of death note is very detailed and good. How they draw the characters and senary is almost realistic. The detail of it is also very well drawn and is very enjoyble to wtch when seeing the episodes. So the art of death note is very well done.\
Sound: The sounds in death note is very much related to the characters it is playing for. A example of it is Light's kira theme when righting names in the death note. It adds a edge to the characters. Also for sould the openings and endings are also much like the plot and chaacters. The OP and ED akes you wanna know what it is about pretty much in a way. The sound is pretty great.\
Characters: The characters of death note are, in a way, related to the plot. Like Light Yagami is the killer trying to bring piece, L is the detective trying to hunt down and put a end to the killer, and Ryuk is the previder of the device to help the killer. So the characters are very great and relate to the story.\
Overall: Overall, death note is a great aime for all who enjoy horror, mystery, psychological, and everything else it is. death Note is truely a anime worth looking at.  < 3\

    On the technical side of things, it’s hard to say Death Note has great animation because 90% of this show is dialogue. No one ever stops talking, and while they blabber endlessly, the artists have a field day with lighting, masking, and the poses of the intricately designed characters. Death Note has great, beautiful, gothic, faux-realistic ART. The background and character art is a regal feast for the eyes. The animation is rarely showcased. When it is, the animators have entirely too much fun, but bless ‘em for it, penmanship has never been so epic. (An A plus and twenty counts of murder in the\
          \
        first degree, Mr. Yagami!) \
Speaking of over the top, the music reaches new heights in gothic melodrama that makes shots of toilet paper seem epic...Forget over the top, every speck of this series is floating in orbit somewhere around \"the top,\" it’s heart-stopping and laid on entirely too thick, but clearly, the ludicrous flair was intentional and will color you impressed in its majestic silliness. \
When it comes to voicing these characters in all their bombastic melodrama, you have to stick to RGAs: REALLY GOOD ACTORS. This anime is entirely talking, half the time monologuing, and that is a complete disaster unless the voice actors are captivating. THANKfully, great care was taken with this dub, bringing in a few veterans for the main roles and several newbies with great voices for lesser parts. But rivals L and Light control this game and do most of the talking, so, I’ll be blunt: Alessandro Juliani is L. He blows away his Japanese counterpart who gave the detective a good gnomish and sometimes quirky monotone but comes nowhere near the musicality and nuance in Juliani’s delivery. It’s rare to hear a character say one thing but communicate several different things, but you hear it in almost every line L speaks, and I would recommend the dub for his performance alone. In reference to Light, though, I have to switch languages for a sec. I think Mamoru Miyano may be the most talented young seiyuu in Japan. Like Light, he’s a perfectionist in every subject, with breadth ranging from stalwart hero (Kiba) to comedic buffoon (Tamaki) to angsty hotty (Zero) and effeminate toady (Ichiru). He played his own evil twin so well in Vampire Knight that I thought it was a different actor for the entire show’s run. But nowhere is he more at home than in the part of the charismatic murderous mastermind. It’s scary how good this guy is, you’d think he had practice. Brad Swaille might have noticed this, because he starts off trying way too hard as Light. But within a couple episodes, he seems to slip into the role naturally, and by the end, his portrayal can stand up tall beside Miyano’s, laughing in perfect maniacal pitch.\
So if the incredible hype or the fact that the show’s almost a radio drama hasn’t scared you off yet, you’ll want to listen up: Death Note is one brilliant rollercoaster ride. It’s as Ryuk predicts: never boring. It’s not blah, blah, blah, car chase, fist fight, blah, it’s captivating revelation, melodramatic declaration of victory, brilliant deduction, holmes, and why are we watching a car chase, I want to hear them talk more! To give you an idea of the intricacy present, the original manga was illustrated by one man and written in fine detail by another, who I can only assume is one of those guys who sleep-solves Rubik’s cubes when he wants to give his brain a rest. He fills in cracks in the case’s web of logic that I didn’t even know were cracks until L is nice enough to explain it to us, and I find it astonishing how well the author remembered which character knows what and how he could use it down the storyline. It has the adrenaline fuel of a sports anime, but all anyone plays is mind games, brilliant mind games. This should offer a caution to some viewers though, because Death Note makes homicide \"so much fun.\" While it’s not irreverent, only impartial, the very idea of turning good and evil into a childish chess game turns a few people off, so be wary if you’re one of them.\
Be wary as well if you’re into complex characters, because Light and L are psychologically complex but emotionally underdeveloped little things subject to entirely too much speculation about what their relationship is like. (Yaaaaaoi fangirls approacheth...) Past their interaction, everyone else is a one-note pawn. None of them are unrealistic, and many are entertaining, but don’t expect to see any development, unfortunately. That would take away from the drive of the mindgame, so the show chooses quantity over quality with heaps of supporting characters. \
None of them can take a smear of the spotlight from Light or L, though, which is the death-knell for Death Note later on in the series when the focus is taken away from L for a time and the series spirals from masterpiece to barely watchable, saving itself only through a last episode so good you’ll want to rewatch it as soon as it’s over. \
In the end, these spare pages of imperfection are just papercuts on a masterful hand that guides this mystery in all the right directions, so if the phenomenon still hasn’t bitten your interest, make a note to see a show that for once, deserves its hype.\
All in all, Death Note is Shonen Jump at its very best, but it’s still just shonen jump. Don’t believe the rabid fans who tell you it’s some profound exploration of good and evil, because to give it false credit as a mature title would be to miss the point. This is a teen-aimed thrill ride that’s not too deep and it’s barely realistic, but dang, is it well-written, with high-gloss presentation and spare flaws you could fit on a post-it note.\

                          \
    I have to say that even though some elements of this series can be a bit predictable, it is still effectively cerebral. It’s one of those stories where it’s not about the destination, but about the journey. This anime is very methodical with its approach to further openly re-defining the classic good vs evil battle, and keeps other aspects at a certain ambiguity that opens up a lot of legitimate debate and discussion, such as the morality in relation to this anime, though the creators of the original manga have admitted that wasn’t a concern or intention of theirs. At times, the anime will go\
          \
        beyond good vs. evil, but I felt can be seen as a battle about whose right will prevail.  \
Everybody watching this anime, or maybe even reading the manga will naturally think that even though Lights intends to do the world away of criminals, does he have a right to take the life of another person regardless of the severity of their actions? Thinking about it, if you had the same kind of power, would you do the same? Do something different? Or try nothing at all? In addition to this, it’s not just Light that you will find yourself at odds with, but L will even stoop to some lows that will make him the poster boy for the Patriot Act. So even though L is on the side of the authorities, his methods at times doesn’t make him any better than Light when it comes to exceeding moral boundaries in the name of justice. While with Light being progressively preachy and power hungry, he will manipulate people and treat them as expendable that will make him detestable to viewers. At times, I felt the rivalry between Light and L went beyond who was right or wrong, but was more of a clash of who has the bigger ego, in which it has its own kind of entertaining value and really gets you immersed to the characters.   \
The relationships between the characters and how they interact and relate to each other is another trait I love about Death Note. Even though L and Light are mortal enemies, the series excellently presents that they are the only people that they can relate to. And I also enjoy the moments where Ryuk can be a foil to Light. Even though Ryuk only sees Light’s attempt at conquest as cheap entertainment, there are times he will question his motives and exhibits he is disturbed by his behavior. And it’s hard to really imagine a Shinigami of Ryuk’s laid back attitude to really have the moral high ground when he only sees it as fun, but you can’t help but see he has a point. \
But moving on, the pacing is very fast and a lot happens throughout a majority of the show, but I think some things rush are a bit too much for the sake of convenience, especially approaching the end. But I’m pretty sure most people prefer fast over slow.\
The designs are very faithful to the manga so I can’t really complain.  First thing I really like to talk about is the use of colors: due to the nature of this anime; not only is the presentation dark, it still exhibits very excellent resolution where you can see a good majority of the surrounding environment, and it greatly emphasizes the atmosphere and mood. The quality of the coloring makes the experience very significant to environmental and character details in which they all fit, and yet still stand out at a point where you can see virtually everything.  What I also enjoy from this series is when certain characters such as Light and L are high lighted in blue and red when they are internally thinking. It easily conveys who is the aggressor, and who is on the defensive, and also shows who is calm and collected, and who is hot headed. Granted these use of colors are obvious with the meaning, the way it’s highlighted around the hair and skin tones really brings the presentation more directly immersing and charismatic. I also love the scene with Near and Light when they are on the phone and it also shows the viewers of those characters in an imaginary elevator at a construction site. It did feel very random, but I thought it really added a sweet sense of the intensity to that moment in the series. \
One thing I strongly believe is that bringing out a sense of intensity is what keeps people hooked on Death Note. I believe what further defines that trait in this series were the angles, movements and pacing when Light was writing in the death note in the initial episodes, and you just gotta love it when Mikami does it. The speed and angles along with the music appropriately emphasizes the divinity that the notebook has, and brings a cinematic feel to it in which only the magic of animation can pull off. Some(of those) scenes involving writing in the death note will be over the top, but I think it’s one of those moments where you have to accept the approach, even if over the top and exaggeration of certain scenes aren’t your thing. Especially in the episode where he opens up a bag of chips and eats it, and that scene alone since then has changed my outlook at potato chips for the rest of my life. I had no idea potato chips could be that dramatic and epic. I simultaneously found it humorous and entertaining, which makes that scene iconic. \
I would like to open this part of the review by saying I enjoy the dub, and think it’s great. I’ll admit I was skeptical about Brad Swaile playing Light at first. I’m used to hearing him playing generically nicer and regular characters like Youta from Video Girl Ai, Quatre from Gundam Wing, or Amuro from Gundam. And I’ll admit that he does a good job of playing cynical characters like Mousse from Ranma, but I wasn’t sure if he was going to make that work with Light. I came to accept him as Light, though I personally think he could have been better as L based on my previous exposure to the actor over my years of watching anime. But I’ll acknowledge he made that potato chip scene, while it felt wasn’t that emphatically dramatic in the Japanese version. I believe Allesandro Juliani was pretty good as L, but I think he sounded a bit too formal and not really childish enough to make the character feel complete. But with the intention that the character was raised in England, I feel the English portrayal brings it out in its own way where you can interpret the character in that way. \
I’ll also say that I was taken by surprise that Yamaguchi Kappei, the voice of Ranma and Inuyasha, was L in the JPN version. Despite playing loud mouth and rowdy characters, he really did well coming across as calm, quiet and intellectual and I thought that the pitch of his voice gave him those child-like qualities he has, and it gives him a different kind of charisma to why his character is unique. Brian Drummond as Ryuk really had a voice that went well with the grin and really made him sound cool, but I think he kind of lacked this bizarre friendly charm that I felt he has in the Japanese version which I think makes him appealing. \
I also think that both Japanese and English voices of Misa were perfect in their own way. Haruhi fans will rejoice that Hirano Aya plays her in the Japanese version - and she will sound pretty recognizable to you, and I think the voice does a great job of representing her bubbly personality, as does Shannon Chan-Kent’s portrayal. If anything, I think Shannon Chan-Kent could make a great Misa in a Hollywood live action Death Note movie, along with the actors who played Light, L, and Watari. \
The last portrayal I want to get into is Mikami’s. In the Japanese version, he is played by Matsukaze Masaya, the voice of Hazuki Ryo, the main character from one of my favorite games of all time, Shenmue. While in the English version, he is played by Kirby Mirrow, the voice of Trowa Barton from Gundam Wing, Van from Escaflowne, Cyclops in X-Men Evolution, and Miroku from Inuyasha. I think they approached the characters stylistically different in their own ways, but I think the portrayals in both versions work that really do represent the character. If I were to define the portrayal of the character by his introduction alone by saying delete or sakujo, or whatever word you want to use - I say in the Japanese version, I get the impression that Mikami is more apathetic, while in the English, I though he sounded more aggressive, but I think that both portrayals bring out the sadist in him. \
The music is accurately orchestrated to suit the dark and cerebral atmosphere of this series and is 110% in your face, and I get that impression with Hirano Yoshihisa's music all the time, especially in the current installment of the Hajime no Ippo anime series. It really immerses you into the scene and keeps your eyes glued to your screen. The tempo and instruments perfectly fits the imagery at the right moment. A lot of the songs used really made me think of Verdis Requiem, the opening to Battle Royale, so I had a very strong feeling that I was to be disturbed but yet amazed by what was going on in the anime. The opening theme called the World by Nightmare couldn’t have been a better choice. It’s dark, but yet extreme and energetic and perfectly flows with the presented imagery that really just grabs your attention by your balls and makes you curious about this anime, that’s how excellent it is.\
At some capacity, I feel Death Note along with a huge majority of Madhouse’s and Shounen Jump’s products deserves a good portion of the praise it has gotten, and I’ll explain what I mean by \"good portion,\" and that relates to the ending. Death Note is one of the very few anime I’ve seen in which I already read the entire manga before hand. What has made the Death Note anime very controversial in some circles of the fan base is its ending. I can’t elaborate on it due to spoiler reasons, but if you’ve read the manga AND watched the anime, you know what I’m talking about, and I side with the manga readers on this issue, and that’s all I can say about it without getting into spoilers. And if it weren’t for this change in the ending, I would have probably given this series a perfect 10/10 overall. But anyway, that's my review of Death Note. ",

    We always have this inkling feeling that we can change human nature for the better. That change would be to wipe off all scum and villainy off the face of the earth to ensure that we can protect the ones we love and make the world a better place. Idealistic angst plays a role into it, which fits perfectly with Death Note’s theme. The theme can be characterized in a famous Nietzsche quote: \"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.\"\

At first, he uses it for justice to kill every criminal he sees on the News from their faces, at least what he believes to be justice in his eyes. Then we realize that with his fantastical power, he clearly develops a holier-than-thou attitude and descends into pure madness. That, giving context to the plot, makes Death Note a fascinating character study to behold.\
When we first get introduced to Light and the plot in general, we don’t necessarily know how we are supposed to view his intentions at a moral level. The writing does a splendid job of not portraying Light in a glorified stature to his heinous acts. It pieces all of the psychological aspects to his character in a way that makes him a very hateful person, but it feels fitting to how he portrays himself to the audience. Delving into how he manipulates people to do his very bidding gives him an anti-hero status from the halfway point and we see him from a very different angle than before. How it paces this growth in each episode is very subtle but poignant when it reaches the climax and gives it a nice spark of genius to it.\
The plot, while not the greatest plot there is, has some nice meat to its subject matter. Its only sufferings are how it skews over insightful commentary into the theme it presents and instead devolves into more extravagant drama. I wouldn’t call it out if the show didn’t bother to actually hint at doing one. The constant narration over Light seems to imply that it wants to add a message to its philosophy, but it doesn’t seem to explain itself any further than derivative narration. This in turn makes it seem like mere preaching than actually trying to convey a message in any meaningful way.\
So, with that flaw on point, what does save it is the amount of tension it brings in the dramatic moments in sufficient depth. Direction and writing serve this case nicely where, yes, even a scene of a guy eating a potato chip and him having a monologue about it still makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Death Note essentially comes across as a hard boiled police story with elements of mystery to it. The only difference is that you know who the killer is in plain sight, which adds to a slight problem to the story: it kills the mysterious aspect. It would prove more fruitful on Death Note’s part to have L be the main protagonist and we not know who Kira is specifically and we could then follow Light’s criminal methods later on to add a rich narrative. All that we have here is a simple drama piece with really halfhearted attempts at being a mystery.\
L and Light prove to be a welcoming duo near the middle portion of Death Note, whether they are secretly clashing with each other or working together to stop \"Kira.\" Both are gifted with great intelligence and charisma to their characters that don’t seem like such a bore to experience in either drama or comedy. However, there is the issue of the typical \"main protagonists are amazing but the rest pale in comparison\" syndrome in Death Note. One character even started off pretty good until she eventually devolved into pure nothingness during the later half of the series, and that is Misa. She’s the antithesis of a character who has a pretty significant tragic edge to her archetype but it seemed as the writers didn’t give her the time of day to really shine and just become another pointless side character.\
Others that fall in the supporting cast are really hit or miss. With the exception of Near, who is basically L 2.0 but hey I’m not complaining, I couldn’t really find any connection with any of them. They can all be summed up as having a problem with the lack of having a unique identity and no development to them. And I’m not specifically talking about the typical person in the police force. Yello and Mikami in particular have pretty significant roles in the story but they aren’t given enough depth for me to earn my interest. Nevertheless, some of the people in the police force do have more to offer in terms of actual presence. Light’s father, Soichiro Yagami, does have some nice-needed depth to facilitate the police-side of the issue of things.\
With the dark overtones in the colors washed in the background and foreground, the art compliments the tone with supreme efficiency. What is also fitting is the fact that it does not overshadow it to the point where its hard to tell what is going on. Having a grand scope to its animation is pretty astounding with the advents of the fantasy aspect to Death Note in conjunction with the real world.\
Everyone has either seen Death Note or at least heard of it. Does it deserve to be called the best anime of all time because of this? Absolutely not. It is most certainly good in its own right in many aspects. An intense and gripping drama are two things that define Death Note and that can be enough to warrant one viewing. Just don’t buy into all the hype that it has gotten, not even a little.\

    Death Note is a very good anime and manga, however the phrase \"more is not always better\" applies quite well here.\
Progression (10): The planning sequences are done spectacularly and are kind of like the action in this show. If feels very \"adrenaline-y\".\
Story (6): I felt that the themes were not well depicted, especially the ones about justice felt even somewhat childish as many characters attempt to prove their justice but never start having a grey morality. They never start questioning themselves and believing that there are no evils involved within this plot, only people who wish to do what they believe in. It even starts\
          \
        to depict some characters as evil which further reinforces the black and white morality in this show. For me, a show that is dark should have a more mature gray morality theme. The story is also relatively simple and even somewhat generic when written so that the main reason why you'll be watching this show is for the brilliantly executed plans that the characters use.\
Art (10): The artstyle is very dark and very well polished. I felt it fit the atmosphere very well.\
Sound (10): Though there's no soundtrack I would really prefer listening to by itself, the sound for this show was amazing when played together with the plans so much so that you could feel adrenaline rushing through your veins.\
Characters (4): There are not really any great characters in Death Note other than L. However, even he is somewhat generic and bland as he and Light make up the \"perfect\" stereotype often played up in anime. Worse is the fact that there is perhaps no or barely any character development and Misa is a very annoying character who often breaks mood and tension in the show where one should be immersed in the plan. However, this shouldn't really be faulted too much as this show doesn't rely on the characters to keep it moving. It relies on the plans of the characters to keep immersion.\
Enjoyment (7): This show has some of the best planning scenes I've ever seen within any anime. However, there are a fair number of flaws, not too large, but regardless they are flaws: the characters, the themes, and after episode 25 it felt dragged and boring. However, the reason why you came to watch Death Note was for those action scenes that have adrenaline rush up in your blood as you see Light's plans unfold and as your mind proceeds to be blown away.\
TLDR?\
Pros:\
*Great planning sequences (kind of like the action of the story)\
*Amazing artwork for its time\
*Great soundtrack\
*Very nice mood and atmosphere\
Cons:\
*Poor/little character development (though this show does not require much)\
*The story and themes are relatively simple and seem somewhat childish\
*Inconsistent pacing; after episode 25 the show gets quite dull and uninteresting. \
Overall Score: 7.5/10 (Round up to 8/10)\

    \"Ever get the feeling of being cheated\" because that's what I get about \"Death Note\".\
Yagami Raito(Light) is your average high school student who just happens to hate the world (the reason, just because), one day he finds the death note a strange notebook that apparently can be used to kill people with just knowin their name, taking it as seriuosly as a chain letter he tries to prove the \"functioning\" of the book by writting in it the name of a criminal who saw in the news, short after that the criminal died of a heart faliure, surprised by that fact he tires the book\
          \
        again with a street gang member and again tha man died this time the cause of death that raito chooses is crashing with a car, after a \"extremely\" quick deppresion for taking the lives of another humang being he decides to bring judgement into al the sinners in the world.\
after a month and with more than 100 victims of the \"note\" the international police starts supecting that the deaths of the criminals are the work of a serial killer with that the world's most famous detective (does that not sound like a cliché to you) \"L\" decide to take over the case, at the mean time Raito gets the visit of \"Ryuk\" the shinigami who owns the book, and thet's the begining of a the game of the cat and mouse betwen L and Raito \
I'm not saying the story is not interesting it is really enyoyable at least in the beginning but the mayor problem with the series it's how the story is developed into a lame and predictable (Yes, I said Predictable) cop drama.\
it appears to me that the main iterest of the author was delivering a great amount of plot twists, in an intent for making it unpredictable but this ends in a big faliure especially in the second part of the series, insteadof taking his time developing L's investigation he just pump it up with a great amout of tecnological gatgets and other stuff you must heve seen in most of hollywood spy movies (and that's not a good thing), due to this non stop bombarding of  bombastic action the mental battle of our main charcters just seems a little too unrealistic and some of the conclusions of our \"great\" team of detectives appear to be just taken out of nowhere\
I find most laughable when people label this series as \"psycological\" when there's no such thing as character developmet, if you don't believe me then tell me from when does Raito's hate for the world come he's the son of the chief of the police departament and he leads an easy life as a student and does not have a worry in the world, just as L, and most of the characters, stays in the shadow with no background or a true reason for their actions.\
In the end the creator of  Death Note tried too hard to make something new and unpredictable and end with  something we could see in one of the  countless and stereotyped detective series and movies that you could see everywhere. if you're looking for a well paced series with realistic characters and events and a police investigation that makes sense  you probbably don't want to see this, by the other hand if you're looking for some mindless fun this might do the trick\

    \"This world is Rotten. Rotten people should be killed off to cleanse this world.\" – Light Yagami\
Ever wondered what’s it’s like to possess the power to eliminate any person you want in the world, with just a pen and a notebook? Those that cause pain and suffering to the world find themselves to be in a very vulnerable position in this dark and twisted show. This review may contain spoilers so please beware!\
Story\
The story of Death Note centres around high school student Light Yagami. He perceives the world to be corrupt and unfixable in its current state, with crime and murder ruining the place where\
          \
        we live. He wants these factors to be eradicated from the world, in order to make it a better place for humans to live. But how can an innocent 17 year old boy possibly do this? With the help of a trusty Death Note of course. Very early into the first episode, Light comes across this menacing notebook, and is perplexed as to what it is. He takes it home with him only to find out that it has the power to kill anyone he wishes, with just the simple task of writing their name in the notebook. Light vows to use this notebook to serve justice upon the crime of the world by deconstructing, and reconstructing his own world where he is the ruler. The story for the most part is very intriguing and is successful in creating an ominous atmosphere for the audience to encounter. It’s not as simple as research and write every name that has a history of crime in the notebook. Light engages in several challenging problems across his experience with the notebook. For one he must deal with the force of the police, and investigator L who attempts to uncover who the person committing all these murders is. This is an effective way of progressing the narrative because it allows the watcher to experience Light’s intelligence, and how he will use this as an advantage to outsmart the opposing side. He may even have to compromise because a plan that he had been preparing for a lengthy amount of time was  breached by a very small problem, but in fact will affect many key things later on if the plan was kept as the original. This means that Light has to be a very quick thinker if he does not want his ultimate secret to be revealed and therefore his downfall. There are numerous unpredictable turns of events throughout the 37 episode span of the series, that will leave the audience to ponder their thoughts as to what came about Light to attempt something so risky yet sinister. The writing of the story has been used in an effective way of portraying Light as a very heinous character. Though it’s general to hate such things, having Light as this paragon of evil sets the tone very well for what the show is trying to be. For the most part, the story was very consistent in quality throughout the show. Though many argue and say that past around episode 26, the quality dips down a bit, it’s not a significant amount to make the overall quality of the plot and narrative bad. Many aspects of Death Note’s writing is taken through cognitive manners also. The anime kindly presents several of Light’s intentions through inner thoughts and monologues to create a sense of foreshadow and an intense vibe to the show. You will surely be amazed as you watch episode by episode how Light chooses to approach certain obstacles with treacherous yet genius decisions which can allow you to question his moral standing in society as he continues to serve ‘justice’ to those who oppose him. Story – 8/10\
Characters\
Moving on to the characters, I will be speaking of the two most significant in my opinion, Light and L. I will also be giving a brief overview of the side characters and their significance. \
Light\
Light is a 17 year old high school student with a thirst for vengeance. He is usually quite isolated and always thinks to himself, though this is able to play a big role in his characterisation once paired with the Death Note. He is very deceptive, and will even go to the extent of sacrificing his own family in order to cover his case regarding the sudden murders, if one were to find out. Having the main character as a debatable antagonist allows the audience to understand Light’s ideals and what makes him commit the actions that he does throughout the show. His sense of morality is not one to take lightly, and one can argue that this notebook being bestowed upon him was the source of this slow deprivation of his once known innocence as he turns into this savage monster with no consideration of others but himself; exerted with pride if you will. Light does develop quite a significant amount throughout the show, as his own ideals soon come back to oppose against him. These contradicting ideas of Light’s characterisation allow the audience to judge whether or not they are rooting for Light, or going against his so called ‘justice’. Whichever way you perceive him, he is a very diverse and detailed character and fits the role he plays well. If I were to criticise his actions slightly, I would say that he sometimes polarises his first intentions. For example, he states that he wants to protect humanity from the horrors of crime and murder, yet his sometimes kills innocent civilians throughout the show, just to protect his case from being uncovered. Though this is not too aggravating for some, it could be taken into account as a flaw. \
L\
L's dishevelled and languid appearance is a clear shroud of his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is very meticulous and analytical with what he does. He is the direct antithesis of Light, with the sole purpose in the anime being to stop the crimes ‘Kira’ (Light) has committed.  I couldn’t say that L possesses higher intelligence than Light, but rather they are balanced in intellect, but both perform actions that outsmart the other on numerous occasions. He sets himself to be quite at ease with most situations, but also well aware of the context and matters that must be addressed. His communications with Light are both humorous and though-provoking. Both are trying to outsmart the other whilst attempting to befriend one another, as L possesses suspicions of Light being the culprit, which the audience knows he is but Light is able to prevent L from uncovering his secret in many ways. This creates dramatic irony as the audience is able to possess more knowledge of Light than L himself has. The relationship between each other possesses numerous psychological traits, as they both have different opinions on the other, than what is really stated in speech between them. The writing allows L to be an extremely likable character, and his contrasting ideals against Light allowed the audience to choose who they will side with. L is both captivating, but menacing as you are unaware of his future actions to deal with the crimes he must solve.\
Side Characters\
Death Note possesses many side characters that contribute to the main plot of the story. These range from Misa, a so-called second ‘Kira’ that adds an additional element of mystery to the plot, to Light’s father Soichiro who is the leader of the investigation team under L’s command and has yet to realise that he is opposing his own son. There are also numerous appearances of supernatural 'death gods' throughout the show, who only appear to those that possess a Death Note. These gods aid in foreshadowing the effects and consequences of using a Death Note, and this helps to create a sense of danger and pre-eminence that over-ride the story. Though characters like these are not shown as much as Light and L, they still are very fundamental to add depth and variety to both the plot and characters we see over the course of the show. Characters – 9/10\
Art & Animation\
The art to Death Note can be described as being ‘morally grey’. The dark overtones that are blended into both the background and the foreground give justice to the tone of the show. This is because it adds to the atmosphere that Death Note creates with its plot and characters, and allows the audience to further appreciate the situations due to the colour pallet chosen. Character designs can said to be generic, however aid in the characterisation of said character. The animation of the show isn’t really something special; however it doesn’t need to be. The animation could be plain dark and shady, and it would work because of the atmosphere the show puts itself in. Psychological thrillers tend to have a similar colour choice to each other, as they all attempt to present the same kind of atmosphere and genre. Art & Animation – 8/10 \
Soundtrack\
The soundtrack to Death Note works immensely well with what it sets itself up to be, in a similar fashion to the art style. The opening and endings to the show cannot be misinterpreted at all, since they present the themes well. I particularly think that the change in song choice between opening 1 and 2 presents the change in Light’s character throughout the show, as his psychological traits begin to change. The OST’s also used throughout certain scenes are very well done, as they add to the intense and engaging moments that occur as the show progresses. The sound to the show overall is done very well, and I don’t think it could’ve been done better. Soundtrack – 9/10\
Personal Enjoyment\
It would be a lie to say that I did not enjoy this show a lot. The tense moments between Light and L aid in engaging the reader fully, and their actions throughout the show are able to leave you amazed after you witnessed them. Though it’s evident that the later half of the show was the weaker segment, this would most definitely not take away from the enjoyment factor that you would get from the show overall. I have also seen both the sub and dub and would fully recommend either as I feel they are both very good; it's whatever you prefer with watching anime. – Personal Enjoyment – 8/10\
Overall\
Death Note is a very enjoyable show with many memorable moments that will stick with you for future time to come. It has become one of the most popular shows in the recent years and will most likely be remembered for years to come. You engage in a very compelling story with many morals that you are able to take away with you. The soundtrack holds the show justice with its intense musical compositions and the art/animation presents the morally grey tone that the story sets for itself. Though the weaker second half of the show, I still enjoyed this show very much and would fully recommend it to anyone who has yet to watch it. I am giving Death Note a 8.4/10. \

    Death Note is the best anime if you're getting into the World of Anime. This was my first anime that I watched and actually got me into watching more anime, and the rating at first was 10/10, but being more objective about it it dropped to 8 then finally a 6. And I will explain why.\
Story - The story of Death Note is good, but nothing special when you look at it. The only thing that was special was the Villain protagonist and his weird adversary that calls himself the letter L. They have a Tom and Jerry cat and mouse game between each other\
          \
        through the anime. However that only lasts to a certain point and after the infamous episode 25 the anime starts going downhill. But I beg to differ.\
The anime starts going downhill when Misa Amane gets introduced. The romance is like watching a domination porn, the cat and mouse aspect its gone from the series, most of the thinking will be done by L inside his head and you will fanboy/girl all over him thats it.\
The Yotsuba arc is the most boring arc in the anime, the dudes from the corporation are boring and blank character + unexplored. Nobody cares for them and there is a reason for that. They are simply just bad characters.\
After the infamous episode 25 the anime goes downhill at a faster rate. The quality drops, bunch of bad, boring and rip off characters are introduced to the anime, but I will talk later about that.\
The Ending is simply horrible, the whole Vigilante character type is handled horribly, to be honest the Drama Ending of Death Note (2015) handled the Vigilante type of character better, but in the anime it was handled generically.\
Art - Art is good. It was pretty. Nothing much about it, to be fair. You like it or hate it. \
Its subjective.\
Sound - The soundtracks are outstanding. I listen to the soundtracks still today. Hell I can even name my favourite ones. The soundtracks are good and very well done. A lot of work went into them. The opening and closing songs weren't bad but it comes to your preference. The first OP/EN are slow and have a meaning to the story, while the second OP/ED have more energy to them. ( Misheard lyrics >D ). I personally prefer the second one beacuse its more insane.\
Character - Now this where the anime is lacking. The main characters are simply unrealistic, for their young age they have extraordinary abilities that would take years of work, but nah. Hacking the FBI  consider it done. Hacking a rich companies security camera consider it done. Hacking the police to get obscure information consider it done.\
Anyone who knows more about hacking will know that it is very hard to hack and its just not that easy. The prerequisites are a lot of hard work and practice. But L and Light pull it off, its just absurd.\
Light and L - They will be labeled together because  they are the same characters. Light and L are the same. They're both natural geniuses, are very athletic, have a lots of skills for their young age that would take years and years of practice. Both of them are perfect. But the only difference is that L is weird. And the author admitted that L is the opposite of Light. \
Light Yagami is a  prodigy kid, probably a narcissist, and a full Sociopath after getting the Death Note. He is the controversial type of character. Hell Even as I write somewhere on the Internet some people are debating with each other about him.\
His Ideal would certainly take up more paragraphs however he wants to create a Utopia with no crime, but fails to understand its impossible to do it, because We humans are no Gods, we are imperfect species that are on Planet Earth. Crime will always be out there because its part of Human Nature. And what is the point of living in a Utopia when you're scared for your Life?\
L - A weirdo with diabetes. He is your generic prodigy detective kid with exceptional inexplicable abilities of deduction, coming to conclusions with no real evidence. Light Yagami is Kira, I have no evidence to back it up, but he is Kira. While he is right, accusing someone without evidence is kinda illegal, considering they could sue you for slandering but hey its an anime. There is nothing much about him to say because his past is obscure to the  viewers, most of his fans are fan girls, writing yaoi fan fiction about him and Light or idiots who took the free online IQ test and think they're Nikola Teslas.\
Near - I hate this character. He is just a rip off of L, just admit it. I don't know why people like him. He sucks, hes boring, He  comes to extreme conclusions. Deducing who is Kira by watching the TV. God Damn. Oh I forgot. When he Said Light was Kira without evidence everyone believed him, but when L said it no one did. Plain simple shitty writing.\
Mello - Probably the most realistic character in this anime and its because he is suffering from a mental illness called Inferiority Complex. This character had potential but the focus went from him to Near. Mello was the only one who was doing things in the second half while the other we're just talking and talking over the damn computer.\
Misa Amane - I dont want to spoil much, but her character is useless. She is easily manipulated by Light and used. Tossed around. In the end her character gets completely useless.\
Ryuk - The bored shinigami who drops the notebook in the Human Realm. He is literally the comic relief. Probably the funniest character on the show. He is the spectator so he doesn't do much.\
The others - Bunch of useless characters and blank maybe expect Matsuda. They are anticlimactic, boring and dull.\
Nothing special about them really. Most of them are just investigator who only Abide Commands from Near or Light.\
Enjoyment - As I said the shows goes downhill when Misa gets introduced. The Yotsuba arc is boring, the second half is garbage, there is a reason most people bash the anime for the second half.\
Overall its highly enjoyable for the first 10 eps, then the quality starts dropping little by little, and then after EP 25, the quality drops like the Beat from a song.\
Overall - 6/10 This is a amazing anime if ur entering the World of anime. But once you watch more titles that are high calibre anime you will start seeing the flaws of it. \

    Death Note: Ah, you know! That anime where apples are a huge theme with a whiny genius who wants to rule the world! Of course. It was good but ended with lack luster.\
Let's start with the story: I'll try to keep it spoiler free.\
Story: Light Yagami is a young, Japanese male genius who is bored with life. One day he finds something called a Death Note, a notebook with the ability to kill. He uses this death note to rule down on all he deams unworthy (criminals). He sets off his plan but a group of investigators and one main one set off to find\
          \
        this killer (Light) and that is the premise of the show. It carries through and is quite the thrilling anime with situation after situation stopping Light and him cunningly find a way around it. The series really starts to die down after episode 26 though with most of the corners being cut and everything coming down to \"I'll just have to kill you before you kill me!\" It still has a spark but it doesn't ignite as well.\
Next is the art style.\
Art: The design and art style of this anime is very unique. It takes a modern day gothic style but applies a civil, sharp manner to it. If something looks sharp enough to stab you, that'll say something about that character or object. It keeps it either very dark or very vibrant. It likes to mix the two up to make a beautiful painting that is Death Note. It'll stay unique and you'll remember how it looks. \
The sound is critical so I'll talk about that. \
Sound: As previously stated above, the show takes that Gothic theme into mind. Even the first set of opening and endings applies this style to the show. If something needs a dramatic, classical themed background song, it'll use it to it's best.  Later on, the show picks ups a more chaotic feeling and even applies that through it's second opening and ending. Though I'm not a big fan of the second opening and ending, it does fit quite well.\
The characters... Well...\
Character Development: Personally, I didn't hate any of the characters. They all fit their roles in they were designed but I feel as if their attitudes were all copy paste. Each character looks different but the villains, excluding light, are all just in for the reputation, money, and power. All the detectives behind the Kira/Light case are justified and want to stop everything, though they may actually conflict with each other. Nothing just felt really special about any of the characters besides Light, L, Misa, Ryuk, Light's father, Near, and Mellow. Those were the only characters that stood out to me. Besides that, no one was too special. \
My overall enjoyment/overall feeling of the show are about the same: It's a great anime that I suggest to everyone because it has it's own unique style and feeling towards it's audience but it really starts to lose what made it so great after episode 26. If you're going to watch it, stop after that episode. Leave everything else up to your imagination. I watched it because I wanted to see what was canon and I don't quite regret it but nothing popped out to me. It's great, exciting, but lack luster in the end. \

    To tell the truth, there are very, very few animes that I really disliked like this one. Actually, dislike is a euphemism. I should say, I loath it. And for good reasons. \
I know lots of people think Death Note is one of the masterpiece of the anime-manga industry and that is also why I forced myself to watch it till the last minute. But as I was going through this anime, disliking it more with every episode, I really thought that it was probably me not grasping the full subtlety of the story. But by the last episode, I could honestly say, that this\
          \
        was simply a smartly presented empty shell. Maybe the manga is better than that, I wouldn't know, as I haven't read it. And to be honest, I don't feel like to. \
The whole story starts on quite an interesting premise, with a complete psychopathic anti-hero as the lead character and quite twisted protagonists as his main opponents. This could have made for a really thrilling and profound scenario about such issues as the causes for the existence of evil, the meaning of good and evil, the moral contradictions when dealing with it, especially when in possession of a great power, the balancing between good and evil, etc, which are all essential philosophic and moral issues that humans have been dealing with for as long as they started asking questions about the reason for their presence on earth. It could have been interesting to see what a teenage, bored by a too easy life, could have done with it.\
Instead, we end up stuck for 37 episodes with a completely immature, if not outright retarded, and self-righteous block who can't even realize the quite obvious and naked contradiction at the heart of his actions, despite being described by his surrounding as a brilliant and precocious genius! In his rage to exterminate bad people from earth, he almost never pause to pounder his own resorting to criminal means to achieve his aim. If he had been as smart as said, it shouldn't have taken him more than a minute to realize that his acceptance of criminal means to accomplish a \"good\" cause means that good and bad aren't completely distinguishable and that they are more often than not simply the two sides of the same coin. This should have led him quickly to the conclusion that no one is completely evil or saintly, but a mix of both good and bad. And to throw away that stupid \"Death book\" even before starting using it. But no, instead he simply sinks always lower into his frantic childish Manichean mindset to reach the final conclusion that he is the only decent person deserving to live! The last episode is so pathetic that I almost threw up! I couldn't believe I had mustered the courage to watch the whole thing to reach such a dumb end! \
My overall feeling was that of an absolute hoax and huge waste of time. Honestly, don't get fooled around by the apparent complexity of the plot itself, in which two parties are seemingly engaged in a chess-like life-size game. They are not. The fact is, Light is so simple-minded that L is always hundred moves ahead of him and this clearly shows in the last episode when Light realizes, FINALLY, that he has made a complete fool of himself from the very beginning!\

    In my opinion, Death Note carries a weight of suspense that I\\'ve never experienced in most or any animes before. Its story revolves around a notebook that a Shinigami, (AKA Death God) Drops into the real world on account of a whim, one of boredom. The Shinigami, Ryuk, finds the book to be obtained by Yagami Light, a highly intelligent, even elite student, who takes it upon himself to see it as a higher calling to become God of a New World, without criminals or crime, with which he can kill anyone whose name he writes into the book with the image of their face\
          \
        in his mind. It is up to L, the legendary detective, to stop him. The anime is unlike any other. It manages to have a plot twist that uproots everything you believed up until that point and turns it around. Death Note will leave your palms sweaty and heart pounding as you experience a battle of epic proportions among geniuses.The music and art are so articulate and riveting that it 'takes no prisoners' when it comes to the attention of the viewer. Each character has a specific and valuable role that is crucial to the series of events that comprise Death Note. The Viewer must choose a side of good or bad, that of the God-Judge of Mankind Yagami Light, or that of the defender of what is right, the legendary 'L' and his arsenal of objective diligence and dedication. Their war holds the lives of many in its midst, it encompasses a delicate subject of the role of god and justice in the world into a war over what is right and wrong, and that a single error will create a downfall. Death Note is a Must Watch 100% Anime, I loved it for its sheer insanity and unpredictability as I held on to the edge of my seat for each episode. I Highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone. \
Choose a side, and choose it wisely, for whichever you choose will be a thrill and an experience one will never forget. 'Death Note w00t!! ^_^'\

What was keeping this series from being a 10? \
If you can answer this question, I'll boost it up to a 10. \
So, the \"name\" part required to use the death note, \

Even though the lives of animals are slaughtered countlessly per millisecond, do we really have the right to judge mass murder crimes?",

    Let's be honest: There's a lot of shitty anime out there. Whether it's bland harems, obnoxious ecchi, or vapid dramas, many people have seen what physically and artistically represents the fact that sometimes even inane dimwits can slip through the cracks of entertainment. Thus, it makes sense that when a so-called \"smart\" anime hits the streets, people would naturally be enticed by the allure of a mature, thoughtful work. A lot of times these fail to impress as the author spends so much time thinking of ways to outsmart the audience that he loses track of the writing and sends it spiraling into stupidity and,\
          \
        quite simply, idiosyncratic nonsense. \
Despite its flaws, Death Note avoids that catastrophic cycle and is, in its own right, a very good anime. \
STORY:\
Well, where to begin. \
First off, as I said above, many anime in this genre tend to flaunt superior intelligence in the face of their audience, and Death Note is no exception. It is incredibly creative and the gambits created by the characters are truly mesmerizing at times. The problem is that because they are so over-the-top and absurdly scheming, many of them feel somewhat preposterous and a few plot points then become stretches of the imagination. While this isn't an overwhelming problem, as much of the plot is well thought out and planned for, the lack of meticulous care to the plot-line shows up at times and detracts from the story... but just a little bit. \
More negative is the lack of logic in the characters. Other than a few (the obvious two, mainly), the majority of the characters are just plain stupid. This becomes overwhelmingly evident when, at times, the villain of the story could have been caught but isn't out of sheer luck. \
However, the lack of logic isn't too overbearing, and the plot is mostly clean of any holes, so while it is a problem, it did not cause much of a backbite from my perspective. \
On another note, one of the main pluses of Death Note is the suspense and twists/turns that the narrative presents. While the plot twists aren't extremely unexpected or anything of the like, the series does throw some curveballs and the battle between Light and L is such an engrossing cat and mouse chase that it is rather enticing to watch. To this day Death Note is the anime I have watched the fastest because I just couldn't stop reveling in the overall intensity and eccentricities of the story.\
While not as heavy as something like Monster, Death Note has its fair share of thematic elements. Some of them are executed well (flaws of justice, legality of capital punishment, not so different heroes/villains) whereas some have some issues (power corrupts). It's unfortunate that the main theme is flawed, but because of the inconsistency and certain issues regarding it, the story comes off as more of a character study of a sociopath than anything else, which is completely fine but veritably inadvertent on the author's part.\
CHARACTERS:\
The most interesting point of discussion with Death Note, in my humble opinion, relates to the characters.\
Let's start with Light Yagami. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't go into detail, but essentially my thoughts are as such: Light Yagami is a very good character, a very likable/detestable character depending on your perspective, and he is written extremely well in the story. However, his character development has an inherent flaw in that it is much too quickly paced. Now, this is unfortunate because it isn't indicative of bad characterization as it is seen that Light has some flaws before a certain event, but the characterization used directly contradicts some of the moral purports that the author wished to establish. In other words, the \"power corrupts\" theme is nullified by Light's characterization. To truly make Death Note top-notch, I personally believe that Ohba would have had to have made his development more gradual, but alas that did not happen.\
Still though, I would like to clarify that, again, I really like Light Yagami and I believe he is written extremely well in the context, but there are some things I personally would have done differently with him.\
And... well, that's pretty much it. While there are some other good characters (L, Ryuk, Matsuda) none of them stand out in my opinion as truly brilliant achievements. This is yet another reason why I treat Death Note as more of a character study than anything else, because the development undergone by other characters is next to none for the most part, and while they do have some semblance of depth, their inner workings aren't profound enough to validate themselves as anything special. \
ANIMATION:\
Death Note is truly a feat in itself when it comes to the quality of the animation. Despite being made some time ago, it still holds up marvelously well, even with the anime that is being made now. The color scheme is very... gray, but it works because of the tone of the series. It just feels ominous and torrid, which is quite fitting. The characters look fantastic, especially in moments of fear or emotion, and their movements are fluid and don't look fake. \
SOUND:\
Ah, here we go. My favorite OST of all time goes to Death Note. If you want to make something seem epic, go for the choir noises, and it paid off marvelously here. There are a plethora of tracks that are illusive and fantastic for every sort of melancholy, vehemence, excitement, etc. The first opening and ending are also great songs in my opinion, but the second opening is... bad. Somehow a lot of people like it though, so don't take my word for it. \
As far as the voice acting goes, I've seen both the dub and the sub, and I personally prefer the dub but neither are bad choices. Brad Swaile does a phenomenal job with Light Yagami and L's voice actor (who escapes me at the moment) does as well, along with Brian Drummond as Ryuk. Besides those three in particular, everyone from Soichiro to Matsuda to Rem are played quite well, although the voice actress playing Misa Amane can be a little... jarring at times. You'll see what I mean.\
OVERALL: \
Death Note has flaws, as I have stated. However, these flaws are part of what is a high-quality anime to be sure. I recommend it.\

    All I can say is wow.  With the extreme amount of hype and popularity surrounding Death Note, it was only a matter of time before I watched it, and I must say it was everything I expected it to be and more.  A tale of a perfect kid with a perfect life trying to play his own version of God and pass judgement to the wicked?  This anime has suspense written all over it.\
I love how fucking original this plotline is.  To be honest, I was getting bored of following the same underdog or \"rags to riches\" style story.  Death\
          \
        Note was a breath of fresh air.  You follow Light Yagami, a straight A student as he picks up a \"Death Note\", which allows him to kill the name of the person he writes in it within 40 seconds.  After the initial doubt of the validity of such an object... Light is soon greeted by Ryuk, a God of Death or 'Shinigami\".  At first, Light uses his new found powers for what he thinks is a betterment of the world... that is until the police begin to track him down.  Insert L, the man behind a computer screen and the lead investigator on the case to catch Light.  What do you get when you cross the world's best detective with a blind-youth brainiac?  One of the best iterations of a cat and mouse story around.  Not to mention the fact that L may have been the best antagonist you could root for in an anime.\
At times during Death Note, the tension was so thick, you could cut it with a knife.  I couldn't tell you the last time I was that on the edge of my seat while watching an anime... if ever.  As devastated as I was once the first arc ended, the second one picked up with increased steam.  Every time I thought Light was about to get caught, he would pull some magic plan out of his hat, and live to hide another day, and the writing was damn brilliant.  A powerful, gripping piece of fiction, Death Note kept me glued up till and through its incredible conclusion.  The story was so powerful in fact, that it even enticed real-life \"Death Notes\" to sprout up throughout Japan and caused Vladimir Putin to place regulations on the series in Russia.  \
Death Note doesn't have the best animation out there, but I also had to take into consideration that it was created almost 10 years ago.  Quite a lot of breakthroughs have been made in visuals since then.  One thing I will say is that I was both terrified and intrigued the first time I laid eyes on a Shinigami.  Ryuk's creepy stare would be enough to scare the living shit out of anyone who came across him in real life.  I also like how introverted they drew L to look... socially awkward but genius, right down to the weird way he sat with his feet.  I also really enjoyed both openings, even though I almost fell out of my seat in shock when I heard the second one for the first time.  The death metal vibe did sit well, amassing the chaos between L and Light while getting you pumped up for the next episode.  Situational sound effects were also present at key points during the show... adding to the suspense.\
The juxtaposition of Light and his actions during the series are incredible, and entirely believable.  The transformation he goes through as a person and the degradation of his morality are showcased most often in the form of inner-monologue, and I couldn't wait to see what he would do next.  He's the perfect villain, and it was nice to see a story through the eyes of one as the protagonist.  \
L may very well be the greatest non-main character I've seen in an anime.  I was pulling for him the whole time, and his ability to match wits with Light was incredible.  Even when no one else believed him, L stuck to his hunches, and his weird mannerisms and love of sweets made him that much more interesting.  Sometimes when he stared at Light you could just read his thoughts and then he would utter some spot on observation of the situation.  I want to see more characters like this!\
The rest of the ensemble cast was great too.  I really enjoyed how goofy Matsuda and Mogi could be, following the clueless Misa around as her bodyguards.  Mello and Near also played great roles, and their vengeance rang loud and clear.\
I'm normally pretty critical as a reviewer, but there's not much to criticize in Death Note.  It's an intense and mind-bending ride, and I enjoyed every second of it.  It's \"binge-watch\" worthy for as I can neither confirm nor deny I finished it in 3 sittings.  As the story neared the end, I tried not to look at the episode number in fear that it would end sooner.  I would greatly appreciate more shows like this in the future!\

    You may be thinking 'Why has this guy given a low rating compared to everyone else?'\
Well, unlike the DN fanboys, I spotted the immediate problems in the story, which seems pretty big considering that Light and L are geniuses.\
Story:\
It got off to a strong start, with twists in the story being explained logically step-by-step, and without any repetitiveness. However, it began to get more and more illogical as the story went on. Someone watching the show might not realise it, but if you put yourselves in the charcters shoes and say 'What would L/Light do now?', you'll see that it gets more and more rediculous.\
          \
        If you want clarification, send me a comment/message, and I'll try and reply.\
Art:\
Seems good at some points, fantastic at others, and mediocre at others. Overall, pretty good with effects like the shaking camera and uses of shadows and colours. Some character art seems questionable (N and M), but overall pretty good.\
Sound:\
Death Note stands out here. The Gregorian chanting while Lights writes in the death note reallly sets the mood, and the drums and violins complement each other during dramatic scenes. Different instruments are for different moods (e.g. piano = waiting), but are not used so often that you get sick of it.\
Character:\
At the beginning, you can predict the kind of people L and Light are. But as time goes on, you realise that they have different facets. The character designs for almost every charcter is really good, from Watari to Matsuda to L himself. Only N and M look out of place.\
Enjoyment:\
I loved the first part of the show, but like I said, it gets more illogical until you want to strangle L yourself for not realising the obvious.\
Overall:\
Definately worth watching, regardless of the plot holes. It makes you challenge yourself to ask 'What would I do if I had a Death Note?'\

    Okay, I'm going to a review this time. So, as of a start I will be doing a review on Death Note since it's a fun anime to explain about. I've explained the plot of Death Note many times to the people who have never watched it. And if somebody is getting into anime, I'm sure they will love this anime. Death Note is an anime that really does a lot for me since it was very enjoyable. I review anime differently though. So, you have to follow along with me as I go along. Most my other reviews have got hatred. But, I really\
          \
        appreciate that since I think I could better on my other reviews. I hope this review gets very good since Death Note is a very popular anime as I see. And I'm bored and have nothing better to do with my time. So, why not write this review about an anime that I've been wanting to write about for a long time. So, I hope you like my review. And enjoy  :D \
Death Note really is an anime that is for beginners. If you haven't just watched anime a lot, or are trying to get somebody into anime, I recommend Death Note. Since it's fun to watch. But, it's not entirely good. Still, it can really stand out as an amazing anime, not the best. You get the point. Death Note was created by Tsugumi Ohba[wrote Death Note] and Takeshi Obata[manga artist]. They have many other manga such as: Bakuman, Cyborg Jii-chan G[Takeshi's work], and many more I don't want to name. Takeshi though has been an artist for many of manga. But, I'm not reviewing the manga. But, I haven't started to review yet. This is more of a beginning. Death Note really has a lot of detail to explain, since I liked this anime. And it's one of my favorite manga/anime. I love the anime more, since I enjoyed how it went. Light really looked sweet in the anime. His animation was really good, I enjoyed the art a lot. It looked pretty realistic, that's why I loved the art. Anime with a good art makes me want to watch it. Or anything else with a good art. But, I look for the story even more. After I watched Death episode 1, I wanted to watch the rest. My chest gave me the feeling that I should go even more, since it got me excited. The story really got me pumped. To see what would happen. Usually, when I go to sleep. I would think about Death Note's plot all the time. The way I rate anime is very different then most do. For example, I don't care about the number. 10, really. Why not something else, like 12 or beyond? MAL won't let me for some reason. I go even deeper than the 5/6 things MAL gave me. But, in this I will really have to tell you that the anime Death Note is really heart-pumping. Really exciting, and with many things that are so practical, maybe I can go on beyond what happened. \
I will get onto the Story, Art, Sound, Character, and so on and on.... \
I want to review my way first. \
My interpretation of Death Note: Death Note starts with a teen named ''Light Yagami''. He is really bored throughout life[kinda of like I am], and he would ''browse'' anything to get out of boredom. He is very smart, but really is bored. And watches the news on TV everyday, he notices how horrible the world is. Crime, rape, murder, and etc. He hates it. One day, he finds something falling out of the sky. He has no idea what it is. But, that's where his curiosity begins. After he had to get out of class, he went there. And saw a book entitled ''Death Note''. In curiosity, he picks it up and really puts everything in wonder: ''What is this?'' \
He looks in it and it says: ''Any human's name who is written in this will die'' \
Really in not thinking, he just leaves it as a mere joke. But, he keeps looking at it. And wonders more......\
Though, he takes it home and to ''research'' and ''test'' it out to see if it works. When taking home, he greets his mom and forth. While watching TV, talking about a man. Light writes the man's name down to see if the ''Death Note'' works. He writes the man's name, and waits[in seconds or so]. Forgets it, Light Yagami thought it is a flaw. Until, the man dies of a heart attack. \
Death Note says: ''Write the last name and the first name of the person, and you must think of the person's face at the time of writing it, and they will die of a heart attack in seconds or so. Unless you specify the death'',  \
that's the best I got out of it. \
Light uses the Death Note to create a ''new world'' killing crime. But, then a shinigami[Japanese god of Death] comes(noticing that the Death Note is here. The shinigami lets him keep it, so Light can go on with his plan. \
I didn't want to tell everything for the first saga.  More of just to get you the basic idea. \
Light can't get away with everything, so he has to hide from a Detective named ''L''. \
That's as far as I'm going. Not much here.\
In the second season: I will just tell you my opinions now. \
The first season was amazing, I just wanted to see everything that was going to happen after episode after episode. I just thought it was amazing. My heart got pumped up literally to see the anime. Just wanting to see more. And I loved the second season opening. It was strange and wild. Not going to talk about deaths or anything, but the anime gets sad too. In the ending and many parts near the second season. And I don't want to be ''open'' on this. It's just too much of the plot. And this is to get you into watching Death Note. Death Note is like a soul for anime, and as I mentioned. New anime fans should watch it. I consider it a very ''Practical'' and amazing anime. There are anime that might beat it, but it's a very good anime. I don't care if you watch it in sub or dub. Either way is amazing. The sub was funny, since I liked the voices on how they did this. And it was more fast-paced in the sub. The dub was very funny, and it really showed comedic flow. But, also made it very sad. Since, how much yelling was going on in the series. The second series should definitely be watched in dub, unless you want to go on to sad parts. I would say watch it in sub or dub. But, it gets very emotional in both ways since you're expressing a lot in the show. I would say due to its originality and its paced heart-pumping story. Watch the anime, I gave you a brief plot of the first season, the second season really could just be explained as if you watch it. Since, you've already watch the first season. The plot of the second season would just be amazing since you would know what was going on in preoccupation for the first plot. Same thing, but a different turn. Many of the characters emphasize their own role, many of them do. It really excites me to see that. And it really is a mixed anime, it's sad, funny, and heart-pumping at the same time. I have seen many anime like Death Note, but DN is a very original. Loved it! Death Note is a good show for beginners. So, watch it.  \
Okay, now MAL's way: \
Story: 10/10\
I would give it a 1000, but I can't since MAL is rude. Not really rude, but you could improve the system. Story is very heart-pumping and exciting. It keeps you motivated for the plot and very active into watching it. And it has an amazing balance of emotion, comedy, and excitement. Like its own aroma, the story is balanced in every way. [Read the manga too] \
If you want a good anime, watch Death Note. The story is a good part for everything almost in the series. \
Art: 10/10 \
The art is amazing, very realistic. And very balanced too. I loved the art, an amazing balance of sharpness, and a very legit art. The art looks very realistic as I said before, the art really compared to others is outstanding. The art is very good, the sharpest art I've seen in anime. But, I look for more. \
Sound: 9/10 \
The sound was good, especially this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYcApRm318‎\
I love the theme, so exciting. But, really it could be even more of a variety in theme. I do wish that it made more themes. Hey, that's how they made it. I can respect that. \
Character: 10/10 \
All the characters emphasize thier own role in the series, and it really can't be beat that the characters have weird experiences and are all in the den of doom. And they really make me want to laugh at how amazing the show was, but can't pace the best character is *never told* in my opinion. My favorite character was L. He really was a secret dude, and very smart. The best detective. But, can he beat Conan from Detective Conan? \
Answer: *shrugs* \
Enjoyment: Infinity X Infinity/10[10/10] \
I really enjoyed. I've explained much of why I enjoyed it. So, I think you should just know I told enough. But, I have very good feelings for it. It really made me cry out loud how amazing it was. \
Overall: Error, number is too big. [10/10] \
Overall is based on by the mean of the other things, so you take 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, and divided. \
But, that's it. \
Hope you enjoyed it :D \

Story- 9/10\
Death note has a very well written story. The two masterminds, Light Yagami and ‘L’ have realistic and intelligent conflicts, through testing each other’s resolve and pulling poker faces so straight I could hear Lady Gaga in the background. In crime genres, it is common for a ‘genius’ police officer to pick up some evidence and go, ‘hmmm, this gun has been scratched here. Therefore the suspect is male, 28 and lives in America!’ On the whole, this line of realism was never crossed and any plot holes in a particular method were quickly resolved. This\
          \
        all made Death Note feel more realistic and it enables the viewer to take the themes in the story that much more seriously, which is a huge bonus for something as serious as Death Note. \
The story is really engaging. Throughout the anime, controversial viewpoints are presented to the viewer, which aren’t directly answered in the show itself. Although the different viewpoints are tested to a certain degree in the show, it is the viewer that is encouraged to answer the questions themselves. This changes the experience from watching the anime to actually thinking about it. In a show where there is little action, being drawn in by the dialogue and themes is of the up most importance, and Death Note does this very successfully. \
The problem with the story of Death Note is that it feels like it’s not going anywhere. All of these moral themes are suggested, and the end ambitions of Light are clear, but the show ends up being bogged down by seemingly endless police/ investigation scenes. Whilst this isn’t an issue if you like that sort of genre, when the show did end, it felt kind of anti-climactic because it never did finish those interesting themes it touched on. \
Finally, as you are probably more than aware of, the show has a huge drop in quality after episode 25. This is partly because of the reason above; that the police themes are needlessly extended just to stretch out the show, but mainly because the show had put itself in the position of having to kill a pretty much invincible character. The result of which will most likely end up in you hating the entire new cast of characters that are suddenly introduced, and make you painstakingly aware of all the plot holes that start to form. Saying this, a huge drop in quality in Death Note still means that it’s pretty blady good. \
Sound- art 10/10\
Masterpiece. There is a deep symbolism within the artwork which I greatly admired. The whole idea of playing God and death were well explored. The atmosphere created through the use of lighting and colours made those intense scenes that much more epic. The animation itself and character design is slick and realistic. Again, it all helps you to take Death Note that much more seriously. The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. The composers, Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi were able to make the simplest actions seem so impressive and were able to create some very intense scenes. There are more than a few iconic tracks, here are a few to whet your taste buds; ‘Low of solipsism’, ‘Light’s theme’ and of course ‘L’s theme’. \
Characters- 8/10\
\"Misa: I can't imagine a world without Light!\
L: Yes, that would be dark.\" \
The battle between Light and L is and will always be one of the greatest conflicts of all time…….. (notice the amount of full stops). Both characters were so epically awesome, but were never unrealistically awesome. They both developed at equal rates and voiced their arguments with equal power. As a result the fight could have gone either way and you would still be happy. The only proof I need to back up this statement is to look up the numbers here on MAL on character favourites. We’re talking huge numbers, and both L and Light are very close. The conflict between these two giants was certainly very entertaining and is definitely the main reason to watch Death Note. \
The supporting cast was successful in bringing balance to Death Note. The two main characters are pretty much Gods of their own worlds. Whilst not entirely true, they do therefore lack basic human emotions as they have to become emotionally detached from the situation. The sub characters make up for this by adding very human reactions and emotions into the mix. Although generally overpowered by the awesome Light and L in terms of depth, they do have their time to shine and develop as individuals. So, as I said, they almost put the godly battle between L and Light back to earth which makes the whole situation that much more believable; which is key when presenting very real moral issues. \
As mentioned, the only flaw in the characters is after the 25th episode. A twist in the story leads to the inevitable influx of new characters that are having to compete with already developed and incredibly likeable characters. This does not work. The final episodes are pretty much carried on the shoulders of already developed characters which makes the end result even more aggravating. \
Enjoyment (awesomeness)- 9/10\
Death Note isn’t something you enjoy, per se. You don’t exactly jump up and down when someone is killed in such a serious way. The overall awesomeness of Death Note is what I will mark this section on. \
There is definitely a lot of media to find awesome in Death Note. As stated above, the soundtrack and art is nothing short of a masterpiece. Any given situation, no matter how menial is thus able to reach its full potential.\
The different genres that Death Note is listed as, (crime and supernatural predominately) are represented with skill. In terms of crime, Light’s plans and L’s methods are very intelligent. Individual scenes are very intense, and the general feel of a police genre is evident. In terms of the supernatural aspects, ideas and themes are definitely explored, but weren’t given as much definitive screen time, (i.e. nothing much was answered). Which was a great shame because Death Note definitely had more to offer in this department. \
And again, the conflict between Light and L was perhaps the most awesome aspect of this anime. There were so many memorable scenes that are the very definition of awesome. \
Overall- 9/10\
If the sheer popularity of Death Note isn’t enough for you, sufficed to say, I do recommend for you to watch Death Note. If it weren’t for a few short fallings, especially towards the end, Death Note would undoubtedly be at least in the top 5 animes of all time. But just falling short of perfection is still pretty damn good!",

    Death Note has a very strong beginning. The story is very thrilling and interesting, since it is a pretty untypical one you might never have seen before.\
Art, sound and characterdesign were outstanding good, especially because of the serious atmosphere it created throughout the first part of the anime.\
It definitely would have come out as one of the best anime I've ever seen if it would have gone on this way. But it did not. Actually almost the whole anime changes after about 1/3 of the anime (more clearly you coukl say that the whole atmosphere dies there), what I found really disappointing and made me\
          \
        stop watching it.\

Grab a bag of potato chips, all you wannabe gods of the New World, cause I'm about to shine some Light on this review Note. \
****Minor Character Spoilers marked with ****\
Overview: \
Light Yagami, resident high school genius and bored student stares longingly out the window, wishing something would happen in the tedium of the everyday. One day, a black notebook falls from the sky. He opens it and inscribed inside, \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die\". He laughs it off, a sick joke perhaps.. But sometimes curiosity gets\
          \
        the best of us. Light is no exception- a skeptic, he writes a name in the note, expecting nothing. A name of a criminal that was broadcast on the news, a man scheduled for execution. 30 seconds pass. Nothing. \
The man falls to the ground, clutching at his chest as though some specter has hold of his heart, squeezing the life out of him. \
He Dies.\
Is this real? What is this unholy gift? \
\
Art: 10\
Very consistent character design, and excellent attention to detail, even for characters who get one frame of time in the scope of the show. Dark, gray palette meshes very well with the overall tone. Shinigami designs are grotesque and unique, and at times downright creepy. \
\
Sound: 10\
Excellent dramatic and suitably epic soundtrack by Yoshihisa Hirano. With a title as pretentious as God of the New World, the music fits perfectly. The subtle tension it builds over the course of the show kept me engaged and on the edge of the seat just as much as the intellectual battle going onscreen did.\
Voice Acting: dub\
Top notch VA from Brad Swaile (Light), and Alessandro Juliani (L). The supporting cast also give very dynamic and heartfelt performances, my favorite among them (and favorite character of the show) Brian Drummond (of Vegeta fame) as Ryuk.\
Opening 1, \"Alumina\" and Ending 1, \"The World\"  both by Nightmare are excellent tone setters for the show. Opening 2 isn't my favorite, but the Ending 2, \"Zetsubo Billy\" by Maximum the Hormone is phenomenal.\

****Begin Minor Spoilers****\

Characters: 8 (hear me out)\
Light Yagami, genius 17 year old, incredible investigative, manipulative, and problem solving skills- potentially the most brilliant character you'll ever see in animated form, and rightfully so. He thinks his way out of whatever is set in front of him, but not to a deus ex machina point where it was clear the writers were written into a corner and had nowhere to go, a mistake lesser shows make, but not this one. His motives are complex, and his means of achieving them moreso, but Light will stop for nothing to attain his goals. \
L- Counterpart to Light- mysterious, eccentric, and incorrigible sugar addict. A detective that, alone, has solved cases for the nationalities of the world, and has never failed to apprehend the suspect. His skills are every bit as honed as Light's, and with the most deadly killer in history on the loose, he has every bit as much to gain from its completion, as the ultimate price may end up being paid. \
\
*******************Spoilers************************\
\
The only scuff on this tour de force would be two characters, who appear late in the show. \
The child detectives, L's proteges, Near and Mello, were, I felt, something of a ripoff of L, as if you took his persona and divided it in two, but with none of the charisma and aura of mystery/quirkiness that made L so outstanding and entertaining to watch. While not bad characters in the sense that they didn't break the established rules or come to untoward conclusions, they just were far less interesting to behold.\

Story: 10\
An absolute thriller of cat and mouse detective drama. Cerebral, mind bending, and importantly- never tries to be something it's not. Death Note prescribes to a set of rules introduced early on, and never breaks them. It stays within the confines of its narrative, and exploits it to the utmost. The story twists and turns, and never leaves you hanging with unanswered plot points or ridiculous cliffhangers. As mentioned above, though it seems sometimes that situations arise where there's no way the character can escape their situation, deft writing takes center stage and delivers with aplomb. Believable motives, heady dialogue, and stunning conclusions keep the wild ride rolling from start to finish. \
\
Enjoyment: 10\
I'm going to be honest, this was the first anime I ever watched, and the show that got me interested in the medium as a whole. I have a lot to be thankful for- this show was my first 10, and has remained in my top 5 from day one. Death note was a great starter, and I'd recommend it to anyone who expresses even a passing interest in anime. It doesn't have ridiculous over the top action, it's not a fanservice machine, and it doesn't fall into the trappings that some anime seem to have to fulfill to get an audience. It's a an excellent, complete product that doesn't have to rely on filler and tropes to reel you in. The story is very well thought out, and comes to life on the screen.\
All in all, a blast to watch, and when each episode ends, you're left with a choice, albeit not much of one- \"Do I watch one more?\". \
The answer is always yes. \
Humans are _so_ interesting.\

    Psychological thrillers are easy to write, but not as easy to like. A lot of what makes psychological thrillers work is making the characters act in a very believable and human fashion, which we don't normally see because the writers make the themes normally control the story and characters in psychological thrillers. This tends to ruin immersion a lot, especially when the purpose of such a story is to discuss the humanity behind their actions or lack thereof.\
The trick behind psychological thrillers is to also avoid making the story as dark as possible simply for the purpose of being, well, as dark as possible. It's\
          \
        very easy for them to slide into being too edgy for their own good, which not only ruins immersion by the viewers but also ends up contradicting the themes of the show.\
Death Note is a case where this is avoided...and played straight.\
The storyline is undeniably tightly written and many of the tricks and red herrings are carefully played out over the course of the show, especially in the first two thirds. This works thanks to the fascinating perspectives on justice, morality and even religion present over the course of the show, which is brilliantly handled when focusing on the society at large and many of the various side characters.\
The show doesn't work as well, however, when focusing these themes on the main characters. It feels like the show dumbed down a lot of character depth simply to make the pacing as addictive and fast as possible, which works if you look at what this show does on a basic level (as far as storytelling is concerned, it definitely knows how to hook the viewer) but it's hard not to feel like layers of depth were cut out simply to make the show as, well, thrilling as possible.\
Speaking of the main characters, it's impossible to bring up the main characters without focusing on the fantastic rivalry between Light and L, which is very well explored and grows fantastically throughout the show. \
This does bring us to another important point that ends up being what prevents this show from being a masterpiece; the moral ambiguity that works so damn well on everything else fails when focusing on Light and L, and that is because the show avoids making you root for Light by making him as much of a megalomaniac as possible. Light is simply a tool to advance the themes, and while this isn't particularly bizarre for a psychological thriller it fails in a show so rooted in morality such as this one.\
Light is a prime example of a great idea for a character gone terribly wrong, and while he is certainly a great deal of entertainment to watch over the course of the show, there is no conflict he holds within himself despite that being, well, the nature of the show. This leads to a lot of inconsistent characterization, especially in the final third of the show where the show just wants him to be painted as the most evil person possible. Sure, watching him slowly but surely slide into madness was a lot of fun but I couldn't help but feel that it could have been handled a lot better.\
The artwork is very distinct and pleasant to look at, with character designs being very distinct and the backgrounds looking great. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous over the course of the show, and the visuals look even smoother in the more tense moment of the series. Animation quality is solid and consistent and does a fantastic job bringing out the tension over the course of the show (despite the fact that you, the viewer, know all the information before the characters do). This show is filled with adrenaline and it knows it, and it works very well.\
The soundtrack is pretty rad as well, with some absolutely chilling choirs being played over the course of the show. The sound effects never feel out of place, and constantly and consistently fit the mood. The voice acting in both Japanese and English is top notch and it's hard to recommend one over the other, though I personally think the dub sounds better (simply because L sounds more like an introvert and Light doesn't sound as much like an adult).\
Overall, Death Note is a highly enjoyable anime that unfortunately suffers from being very inconsistent in its presentation, doesn't succeed at being morally ambiguous when it matters most as much as it should have and has a considerably weaker final third than the first two thirds of the show.\
It is nonetheless a show I can recommend as among the best entries in the mystery genre as far as anime is concerned, and if not for anything else it certainly leaves a lot of food for thought. \
I recommend it, but please be aware that contrary to what you may hear, it's not everyone's cup of tea (I swear I'm not making a reference to anything in the show) and a lot of the themes may offend some people, especially as far as religion in particular is concerned.\
Those who can look past all that will find a flawed but adrenaline pumping show rich in themes and symbolism and mixed in its execution.",

 [ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\
Death Note is one of the best anime out there and for many, it IS the best. This supernatural mystery thriller is simply amazing. With an extremely compelling storyline and a ruthless protagonist(s), this show keeps you at the edge of your seat with its exceptionally fast pacing. Watching the two main characters battle it out psychologically in a deadly game of cat and mouse is a real treat. With beautiful animation and a great background score backing this anime up, there really is no reason for you not\
          \
        to check this one out. The realistic approach to a supernatural concept is one of the main reasons for this anime’s success. It is a brilliant anime that will surpass your expectations. This show also serves as one of the best introductions to anime for casual fans.\
[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\
You are given a notebook. You are informed that if you write a person’s name in the notebook, then that person will die. Now, what will you do? Assuming you don’t believe this note works, who will you test it on? You wouldn’t risk writing your name, would you? Even if you did believe in this notebook’s powers, would you actually use it to kill someone? \
Even if you wouldn’t, Yagami Light would. In fact, he wouldn’t use it to just kill one person, but to kill thousands. Yes, thousands. \
In Death Note, you follow Yagami Light in his quest to become the god of the new world. And how does he plan on doing that? Very simple – he has a Death Note. A Death Note is a notebook, carried by Shinigami(Japanese death gods) and is used to kill humans. Now, to kill someone with the Death Note, you just have to write their name in it and they will die of a heart attack within the next forty seconds. One day, Ryuk, a Shinigami, is bored out of his wits and decides to drop his Death Note into the human world. And Light, a high school student, stumbles upon this deadly notebook and decides to take it home, thinking that it must be a prank. Once he confirms that this notebook is the real deal and becomes processed by Ryuk, he decides to take the law into this own hands by killing the criminals in jail. So every day, this boy wakes up, goes to school, comes home and kills a bunch of criminals by writing down their name in the Death Note while munching chips and watching TV. And to top it all off, this guy is one of Japan’s top students and is an absolute genius. He must be unstoppable now, right? Not quite. A master detective called L decides to step in and try to deduce who the criminal is. And so begins an engrossing game of cat and mouse between Light, who hides behind the identity of Kira and L, the world’s greatest detective who has never revealed his name or face. \
Death Note’s story is, without a doubt, the best I have ever seen. The plot is filled with twists and turns, guaranteed to take the viewer on a rollercoaster. The storyline is completely unpredictable and even hardcore detective fans will have a hard time predicting the next move. \
The animation is excellent with fluid movements and seamless transitions. There is almost no recycling of frames and this makes for an enjoyable experience. The graphics are really good and the character designs and detailing are very well done. Modern Tokyo is drawn artfully and blends in wonderfully.\
The background score for this anime is stellar. The dark goth themes are dramatic and are orchestrated really well. There are also a few mild tracks which suit the mood perfectly. The first OP was decent, while the second was just painful to hear. The first ED was great, especially the video, while the second was passable. However, the average OPs and EDs are forgiven because of the otherwise neat job by the audio department.\
Light vs L is probably the best duel ever, easily surpassing Naruto vs Sasuke. On one side we have the merciless and untiring Light, who will stop at nothing to wipe the criminals off the face of the Earth and on the other, we have L, Tokyo’s white knight, who masterminds all the operations to stop Light ( to him, Kira) in his tracks. The rules of the game are very simple – The one whose identity is compromised, dies. While Light tries to uncover L’s true identity, L tries to uncover Kira’s true identity. The dynamic script makes sure that this duel never gets stale by forcing them into confrontations with unique stipulations. Now, I did have an issue with the characters. They were extremely shallow and there was hardly any character development. Neither Light nor L display any form of emotion and this does start to itch a little. The only character who displayed any emotions at all was Light’s father.\
 Another problem I had with this show was that it failed to answer the critical questions. For example, Light’s philosophy on killing criminals is never explained. And although his ruthlessness is understood, the viewer never gets to know Light’s motivation for wanting to be a god or whether killing a person just because he has committed one crime is right. Right till the disappointing last episode, you do not get a clear idea on either of the two protagonists’ true mindset. The pacing becomes dreadfully slow in the second arc. I really felt that the second arc could be done away with and the series could’ve been condensed into a 26 episode one and that’s mainly why I’m denying this anime a perfect score of ten.\

    Death Note, as I'm sure you know by now, revolves around Light Yagami, a genius high school student, who finds a notebook titled Death Note, giving him the power to kill someone simply by writing his or her name into it. He takes it upon himself to rid the world of criminals, and hopes to become the God of the new world he creates. Upon killing many criminals, the world takes notice, giving this unknown killer the name Kira. The greatest detective in the world, L, is notified and takes up the case to find Kira and bring him to justice.\
The story really is an\
          \
        interesting one, there are many extremely suspenseful moments spread throughout the anime (although most are in the first half). It starts out exceptionally well, hooking you from the first episode due to the interesting story, and instantly making you a fan in the second with the introduction of L. From there, the story goes on at a fast pace, always suspenseful and  extremely entertaining. We first run into some problems when, in episode 16, Light executes a plan which we may appreciate in later episodes as genius, but for the span of seven episodes, the series' excitement lessens. This is because previously in the series, there were two different focuses: Light attempting to kill L and L attempting to find out Kira's identity. However, after episode 16, the former element is removed from the show until episode 24, when Light's plan is unveiled. But the show barely even has a chance to pick up steam again, because two episodes later, an even worse change takes place, as two new characters take up the Kira case, Near and Mello. For the remaining episodes, the only motivation for watching the series is that you feel a need to know how it ends since it was so captivating in the beginning, but almost none of the suspense remains. The series doesn't return to form until the last two episodes, when Light is directly confronted, but with one last trick up his sleeve.\
The art is great, it has a darker feel to it, which suits the tone of the anime. During some of the more crazy name-writing scenes the limits of the artists are really pushed as there is a sudden explosion of pen flying across paper with sparks seemingly erupting from the Death Note, and the criminals subsequently collapsing. The art also receives a needed improvement during the most important scenes, where the background detail is significantly amplified. Aside from these improvements, the art still remains fantastic throughout, the characters look great and the backgrounds are nicely detailed.\
The voice acting (I've only seen the dub) is similarly great, especially in L's case. The music is a strong point, the first opening and closing themes are great, as is the rest of the music for L's arc. There are many memorable songs, from simple but catchy guitar riffs to haunting piano compositions to full-blown neo-classical orchestras, complete with opera-esque vocals (to accompany those crazy name-writing scenes mentioned earlier, along with a couple other moments of major suspense). Like all (well, most) things in Death Note, the music gets weaker after L's arc, but there are still a couple great songs introduced in the second half.\
The character selection shows a nice variety, and nearly all of them have a purpose in the show. Light is a very interesting character, yet as the protagonist (if you can call him that) he lacks qualities you can relate to. Obviously there are people who agree with the major ideal of Kira, the ideal being that murdering people who do nothing but bad for the world is morally right, however you can not relate to Light from the very beginning of the show, best shown by his immediate desire to become God of his new world upon discovering the Death Note. No matter your ideals, I highly doubt your major concern, if given the power to kill, would be becoming a God. Sure, everyone wants power, but Light's just a little...crazy. And his craziness increases throughout the show, gradually increasing as Light gains less and less regard for other people until his insanity peaks with the last episode. L is a very interesting character, a lonely genius who enjoys eating sweets, sits (and holds objects) oddly. He doesn't really develop from there, he's always the same old detective with questionable tactics, but the character's always fun to watch. The small police team working with L has a nice little variety of personalities and moral positions. Misa is annoying, as she's supposed to be, so I'm not really sure if that's a positive for the show, for being able to make a character who you wish Light would just kill off, or a negative, for being, you know, annoying. Ryuk, the Shinigami who follows Light for a section of the show, is very entertaining. He's the one who causes the story to unravel, dropping the Death Note from the Shinigami realm just because he was bored. He brings some humor to a show that is devoid of it otherwise (other than Matsuda's obsession with Misa and L making the rare quip, which is always hilarious to me because up until he says it, you'd never imagine his character would make a \"Light\" pun, among other things), with his love of apples and the withdrawal symptoms he gets when doesn't have access to any, always laughing at the misfortune of Light in his raspy voice. Rem, another Shinigami, serves her purpose as a small obstacle to Light but doesn't add any extra enjoyment in doing so. Near is really a flat-out bad character. Although he serves as an \"L 2\" of sorts, just because he takes up the Kira investigation doesn't mean he has to act just like L with minor differences.\
Formula for 1N (one Near)\
L - love of sweets + love of toys -  black hair + white hair - both legs up when sitting + one leg up when sitting + always sitting - all enjoyment while watching - respect* = N\
*L gains your respect (or he would if you had respect for anime characters) by showing his genius throughout the show while Near just comes to the right conclusion immediately. L is guilty of this as well at times, but not to the same extent that Near is.\
Mello is pretty generic, he's pretty much just your average bad guy. But smarter. And with chocolate.\
So, does Death Note deserve a 10? Well, not really. All the flaws should take a huge chunk of enjoyment away, and they do, especially the entirety of the last half of the show (and that sounds like a damn huge flaw, an entire HALF of the show!?), but there's just no other rating I can give it. I flat out loved this show, and while in my mind it seems that I'm overrating it, it seems that it has a similar effect on others, as generally everyone recognizes the second half of the show as weak, yet the average rating is still 8.89. So while there are apparent flaws all over the show, all the positives outweigh the negatives to such an extent that the show receives a perfect score from me.\

    I've delayed this review for a long, long time. Such a long time, I dropped it off my favourites and the grade dropped from 10 to 9. Maybe it will drop from 9 to 5. You ask why, and I answer-hands down, the ending was terrible. Unsuprisingly, looking up my favourite characters shouldn't suprise you. Yet I thought Air had a great ending. That ending made me love the show even more, same goes for School Days. This?\
When I first heard of Death Note, I couldn't give a rat's ass about it. The common syndrome of not trying what is popular, and I thought it's\
          \
        some sort of a 'deep' anime, for the elitists. You know, like those losers in their Led Zeppelin shirt. Funny stuff. Then my friend recommended it to me, and I said, 'what the hell' and gave it a shot, because I have to get rid of my 'anti-mainstream' attitude. To my suprise, it was fire. Since the first episode, it already boomed. Just like how Holden starts 'Catcher In The Rye'. But, guys, why compare the two? The ending of Death Note got me saying 'what the fuck'.\
I should seperate the concept from the story. The concept was pretty good. I don't know why, but I can't call it 'genius' right now, but it was great. So was the story. It definitely got me questioning my morals and crap like that. The pace was also perfect. It definitely had some moments where I wanted to go sleep. Some parts were really slow, but it had enough great climaxes that were a wake up call. It's also not as pretentious as I thought it would be. I expected some pretentious drivel passed off as 'intelligence', but what I got is something both deep and entertaining. How I love that cliche.\
The characters aren't very far from the quality for the story. Here some bias shall be reveled. Light has to be one of the best male characters out there. Damn it, I enjoyed his character all the way through. Ryuk? Damn it guys, he was so needed in the show. His comic relief was really on-point, and helped the series not become pretentious drivel. However, I can't join the crowd and idolize L. Before watching Death Note, his design already pissed me off a bit. Luckily his character wasn't, but I never felt he was so unique, nor deep. L always looked like it came out of 'Conjuring Up Weirdos 101'. I find typical black sheeps to be much more interesting. There were also many characters who came and go. They all were able to milk their personality, and pop off beautifully. Yeah, it invoked the sadist in me. Another refreshing change is that the characters don't rely on attractive design. I'm a big fan of attractive characters, but this wasn't the right place. Thank god the creators had enough brain cells to know that.\
Animation and sound is... Eh.. Sound is great. I didn't bother watching the OP/EP, because I'm too damn impatient. But the background music was brilliant. Damn it, I never thought BGM could help so much. I mean, yeah it helped that part in Transporter 2, but I thought it was a one-time thing. My favourite was that creepy bassline. The animation could've been better, but it's still good. Not really average, not anything really impressive like School Days or something. I already mentioned the characters weren't really attractive in design, but they all had unique looks to them, and the Shinigamis actually looked really cool. Shido was cute, Rem was creepy, and Ryuk was somewhere in between. I must say I expected better animation actually, because the popularity made the whole thing feel like some big-budget stuff, guess not.\
Not everything is peaches and cream in the world of Death Note. Not after 36 goddamn episodes. I don't know why the creators decided to end the series like that, and frankly, I don't wanna know. Keep that crap behind closed doors. What's important is that the whole series got flushed down the toilet. I was so damn close to giving this a 10, claiming this is the best thing since Air, and jumping on the bandwagon. I did, but after some time I stopped. The volcano did a really nice eruption, but nothing was left. Not even those cool black rocks. I can't even find ways to describe how much I hated it. There's no way beer goggles will make it look better.\
If you were able to keep reading 'till here, then kudos to you. As you can see, I loved the series until the ending. It never let up. Even the slow moments were redeemed by climaxes, yet the ending was the antichrist of the climax, the christ of the anticlimax. Yes, I know I'm harsh, but it's fun stuff. I can't say the anime is bad, it just doesn't make sense to me. But I definitely don't know how I can recommend an anime that had to kill itself in such a humiliating manner.\

When killing is the morally good thing to do?\
Let's just say that we objectivly banish all the reasons for killing somebody. Yes, every possible reason for terminating a life is now eliminated from our cultural herritage. But what if I tell you, that by terminating one specific life, you can save thousand others? \
This problem was handled in a very mature and somewhat serious way in \"Death Note\", which I highly reccomend if you are a fan of mystery or physiological genre. Without giving many spoilers, the basic premise of the series revolves around a law student, obsessed with the\
          \
        ideal of true justice, who aquires a book which gives him the power to kill everyone whose name is written on his pages (The book itself is infinitely long, so it never runs out of space). Instead of abusing it's power for his benefit, he uses it to start a killing spree against known rapists, serious law offenders such as murderers, and other low-life scums. Near the end of the series, he gets rid of most of the crime in his country, crimminals are scared of even commiting the simplest petty crimes due to the power of our protagonist, but at the cost of our protagonist's own karma and personality, basically becoming the very same thing he tried to avoid.\

    Let's get right to the point.\
Death Note is an Anime that many love as well as hate. I'm one of those people who hate Death Note because of it's potential to become a masterpiece but fell flat on it's face.\
I'm disappointed in Death Note because at first it was just simply amazing and cunning. Light the Main character was doing risky things at all turns and I never knew what would happen next. It had me on the edge of my seat with a bag of popcorn and full attention. The Opening and Ending was simply amazing as well. Everything seemed to be going good\
          \
        until about half way in. The story started to just become horrible in my opinion and things didn't seem to make sense. I won't spoil anything but to me it seemed as though the writers got lazy and stopped caring.\
I honestly should have just dropped Death Note at that point but I kept watching for some reason. Maybe hoping it got better but it never did. It just kept getting worse and worse. \
Even as of 2015, Death note is by far the most disappointed I've EVER been with an Anime and for that I still hate it.\

    What if one person was given the power to kill anyone they wanted, whenever they wanted, simply by writing their name in a notebook?\
If you’re screaming at me about spoilers, you must not have realized what the title of this anime implies. This question is the basic theme throughout the entire show. While it sounds very strange, I can almost promise you that you have never seen anything like it before. This anime is easily one of my favorites, and I’ll show you why. I’ll also show you why this anime has a few commonly overlooked shortcomings. I apologize in advance for the length, but\
          \
        this anime requires a lot of analysis to do it justice.\
So here’s the breakdown:\
Story (8/10) – It’s going to seem like I’m contradicting myself here. You see, the story of Death Note is simply outstanding. I was completely blown away by it, and nearly everyone I know feels the same way! Now, if I say that, why is the score only an 8/10? Well, the reason I only scored it an 8 was because of how it felt like the show drug a bit at points. Let me try to clear this up for you a bit.\
Okay, so the show opens in modern-day Japan. The story closely follows a teenager named \"Yagami Light\" (a bit of an odd name, but more on the characters later).  Light isn’t exactly what I’d call average. He’s a mostly unremarkable character at the beginning of the show, except that he’s extremely intelligent. He’s the top of his class, and is preparing to enter into a prestigious university. Well, Light’s comfortable world suddenly has a very large loop thrown into it when he discovers a \"Death Note\". Now don’t freak out on me for spoilers; all of this is explained in the very first episode. Light discovers that the \"Death Note\" was dropped by a \"Shinigami\" (commonly translated as \"Death God\", or also \"Soul Reaper\", if you’ve watched Bleach). This Shinigami explains to Light how the Death Note works. As you may have guessed, the Death Note has supernatural power, granting Light the ability to kill anyone he desires. All he has to do is know their name, and be able to picture their face when he writes in the Death Note. Naturally, Light tests this power to see if it’s for real, and is surprised to discover that the Shinigami was telling the truth. Light holds the power to kill nearly anyone in his hands.\
Now, as you can imagine, this has some VERY interesting implications for the plot of the show. I won’t get into any further detail, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but the outset of this show is simply brilliant. Light goes through some downright incredible twists to try and hide what he’s been doing, and to keep his precious Death Note a secret. The first ten or twelve episodes of this show are very addicting. You won’t want to stop watching, as you’ll never know what’s coming next. Light has to kill off several people in an attempt to hide his tracks, and as the show wears on, you’ll begin to wonder if any of the original cast will make it to the finale.\
Now, for the reasons why I only gave it an 8/10. While the first twelve or so episodes had me completely hooked, the initial shock and uniqueness of the opening wears off after a bit. Around episode 18 to about 25, the show slows down for a bit. Now, this is a chance for some very interesting things to happen with the characters, but once again, more on that later. It felt like the show sacrificed plot for character development here, which wasn’t entirely bad, but it did make things a little slow.\
Things pick up again around 26 and don’t really slow down until the end. Even though things got more exciting, it never really lived up to the first twelve or so episodes of the show. The ending wasn’t necessarily predictable, but you will come to realize that there’s only one way for the show to end if there’s going to be a complete resolution. The way they arrive at the ending may surprise you, but you’ll likely see it coming.\
All in all, I felt like the show was just a few episodes too long. If they had, perhaps, cut it down to 30 episodes instead of 37, it may have helped things to move a little faster. You’ll likely enjoy all of the episodes, and none of them had that \"filler\" feel that a show can sometimes give you when it’s trying to avoid moving too fast. In any case, excellent story, just told over a few too many episodes.\
Art (10/10) – After writing rather more than I intended on the last section, I’ll try to be more succinct here. I find the art in this show excellent! The character designs aren’t as creative as you might normally find, but this is supposed to be the real world, not some fantasy, where girls have pink hair and cat ears. Even so, some of the Shinigami are pretty interesting, and no two of them look even remotely similar (except for looking like reapers of death of course).\
There weren’t any especially eye-popping effects to gaze at, but then again, this show is a psychological thriller, not an action or shonen, thus, it contains a rather sparse peppering of explosions, so there really wasn’t a need. The animators occasionally chose to animate things like cars with computer animation, but I found that this added, rather than detracted from the overall art design. The art is all based on a rather dark color palette, but I feel that this fits with the dark and ominous themes of the show. I really have nothing to complain about here. This show is superbly animated!\
Sound (8/10) – The music in this show certainly fits the mood, but it rarely stood out to me as being excellent. It’s not the sort of stuff you’ll find yourself whistling as you wash the car, so some of it is quite forgettable. There are, however, some moments where the music will give you chills! The operatic, haunting music when people are being killed off by the Death Note is astoundingly powerful!  The music in moments like these really helps to capture the mood.\
 I had to knock down a point for the second opening though. I’m really not a fan of death metal to begin with, but the singer screaming \"human f***er!\" was just a little too much for me (why are they screaming English curse-words, anyway?). While this probably fit the mood and themes of the show, it made me feel gross, and I skipped it every time after I’d heard it once. The first opening is much better though, and is usually worth listening to.\
The voice acting, however, is top notch. The voices are very believable, and stay away from what I often find can be very whiny, irritating voices when a character is emotional. The lone exception being \"Misa\", who’s shrill voice did bother me from time to time. On the other hand, the actors for Light and L were outstanding! The voice actors had to pull of some very strange dialogue at times, yet still managed it in a completely believable way. Excellently done.\
Characters (10/10) – Ah, the characters! Here’s where this show truly shines! I have never seen an anime that so brilliantly depicts the nature of humans who are given too much power. It takes Light a grand total of about one episode to develop something of a \"god complex\". Light believes that he should create his own rules with the new power he’s been given.\
While I find the name \"Light\" to be rather strange, I got over it when I saw what a compelling character he truly is. I can’t go into much detail without spoilers, but the course of events that follows Light as he uses his power is easily believable. The power that Light has discovered changes people into cold-hearted maniacs, and causes them to show their true colors. \"L\" (yet another odd name) is an equally compelling character, and his skills with deductive reasoning and logic are astounding at times. I cannot say much more about him, but L’s attempts to catch the mysterious killer cause he and Light to work against each other. Light and L get into a number of battles involving mostly their minds, and while the logic used isn’t always flawless, it will still impress you, and leave you eager to find out what happens next.\
The morality of Light’s goals and ambitions are highly questionable, and bring up such topics as whether one individual should have the right to decide the fates of others. Should criminals be killed off for the good of society, even if there’s a chance they may change their ways? Can one person be given the power to decide who lives and who dies and not become corrupted? Many, many more questions are brought up than this, but I won’t ruin them all for you.\
I really could go on and on about how brilliantly Death Note depicts what would happen if someone were to be given a power such as a Death Note. But, for the sake of time and spoilers, I will not. All you need to know is that this show is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and simply brilliant with its characters. Whatever shortcomings the story had are almost compensated for by the perfect depiction of the corruptible nature of human beings.\
Enjoyment (8/10) – While certain parts of this anime were nothing short of brilliant, I found myself rather bored at certain points in the story, forcing myself forward to find out what happens next. Overall, I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it to anyone. The re-watch value isn’t particularly high, as much of the show’s potency comes from surprise and suspense, but you still might find yourself wanting to re-watch it with a friend who hasn’t seen it yet.\
Overall (9/10) – Some points of this show were simply brilliant, yet I feel that some of its flaws are oftentimes overlooked. Despite what I find to be a few shortcomings, Death Note is still one of the most thought-provoking animes ever created. I simply felt that I couldn’t quite give it a 10/10, even though it’s considered a masterpiece by many. If it weren’t for the slow parts in the middle, I easily would have given it a 10. I was disappointed that the show stumbled slightly in this area, but I’m trying to be as objective as I can, here. Once again, sorry for the length, but I felt this anime deserved a lot of analysis.\
I hope this review was helpful. Feedback appreciated! (And don’t click \"not helpful\" just because I didn’t give it a 10 =P)",

    Prior to Death Note I stuck to watching anime that had some form of romance in it, but when I saw how great the animation in Death Note was I jut had to check it out. It completely changed the way I felt about supernatural/psychologial anime. It made me realize how enjoyabl other genres could be.\
Story: Death Note has such a great and unique story to it. With the arrival of a death note that came from the Shinigami. The person with the death note can kill anyone just by writting down their name in an otherwise seemingly normal notebook. It falls into the hands\
          \
        of Light who plans to kill off all te criminals in the world and anyone who tries to get in his way.\
Art: The animation in this series is superb. The character designs are flawless. The Shinigami's look creepy and it's nice to see how differently each one looks. Light's character looks like any ordinary teenage boy. He doesn't look like the type that would kill by any means. Bringing to mind that the worst people in society are the ones that blend in perfectly.\
Sound: There were plenty of dramatic scenes in this anime and the voice actors managed to pull each one off. Light's voice actor did great job. He could sound dark and evil in one sentence and normal and innocent the next. Both ending and openings go swell with the theme of the show.\
Character: The characters just like the rest of the show are unique in their own right. Light's character is the supreme anti-hero, but he's written so well that regardless of what's happening you're compared to cheer for him because athough he's evil, he's an evil genius. Even the unimportant characters are well written and develope nicely throughout the show.\
Enjoyment: VERY enjoyable. At the end of each episode, I desperately anticapated the next. The pyschological aspect of the show draws you in and refuses to let you go until the ongoing war has reached it's ending mark.\
Overall, I would recommend this to most people. The pyschological points in the series can be quite complicated at times so it's probably best to watch it when you're at your best at using your brain.\

    I just finished watching Death Note last night, and I just had to write a review for the series.\
After my friend spending months trying to get me to watch Death note, I decided, \"what the hay, I might as well give it a try.\" From the very first episode I was hooked.\
Story: I like the story a lot. I thought it was pretty original compared to a lot of anime's I've seen where the plot is recycled. If you don't know already, the Death Note is a notebook in which whose ever name is written down in it will die. Him or her will die\
          \
        in 40 seconds if the writer doesn't specify when they will die. If the cause of death is not written, then the person written down in the note will die of a heart attack. It's not that simple. For a person to die, you need to know their name and their face for the death to take place. These notebooks are in the world of the Shinigami, or death Gods, if you will, and the shinigami only use them to lengthen their lives by taking away from the humans lives. Well what happens when the notebook is dropped onto earth and the power of the Death Note is passed onto a human? Lets just say calamity ensues. \
Pick your own definition of justice. Light or L.\
Characters: I absolutely loved the characters in Death Note. Although I wasn't on their sides most of the time, (mainly Light) I still liked the character development as well as the character design. L and Light are very intellectual and mysterious in someways; it adds to the story. There are many times throughout the series where you think, \"Nuh-uh, how the hell did he think of that?\" Basically they're not very predictable.\
I adored the first theme song; I think it's called \"the world\" by nightmare. I thought it went perfectly with the series and it truly did get me amped up to watch the show. I never skipped the theme song, even when I watched many episodes in one sitting. The second theme song was a little to creepy in my opinion. It made everything seem all dark and demonic, although you can argue that it fits in with DN too. I wouldn't disagree, it just wasn't my taste.\
There are moments in Death Note where you're just thinking, \".... Seriously? Why did they even do that?\" - useless moments that don't add or subtract from the storyline. Death note hits a boring patch for a bit. Well, I mean it still is kind of interesting, but the episodes beforehand were more alluring. But trust me, it does get out of the 'slump'.\
The thing I like about this series is that they did things that deliberately pissed off fans of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything, but they did the unthinkable in certain cases, and it just added onto the overall effect of the show and made it seem more real, so to speak.\
The overall enjoyment of this show was high, and I would highly recommend it to people who haven't seen the series. Even if you're a Rom/com junkie like I ;) Death Note is still a good investment. Only will take 37x23m to watch ;D\

    This was my first anime I have ever watched and was an amazing introduction anime for me. I am now abit more familiar with anime now but this is probably still my favourite one.\
Sound/Soundtrack: I have always said that if you do not notice the background music in a film then the soundtrack is doing its job. Not once was I distracted by the soundtrack,it fits in very well with the whole theme of the anime. As a big fan of the band Maximum The Hormone I can say I really appreciated the opening and closing of each episode.\
Art: I am not much of a\
          \
        artist but I think just about anyone can enjoy the art in Death Note. Rather than taking on a theme of its own it just tries to mimic reality and it does so beautifully. The art just adds to the already delightful experience of Death Note.\
Character: Every character is solid and has there own distinguishable character. The chemistry between characters if very good but not amazing. Death Note does a very good job in showing heavy emotions like anger and sadness in the anime.\
Story: This is defiantly where Death Note shines brightest. The already amazing plot line is executed flawlessly. Everything is well explained without lingering on anything for too long.\
Enjoyment: Death Note might be very serious but it also knows how to have a little fun. One might be able to argue that there is little re-watch value and with valid points aswell. I have watched it twice (about a 2 year gap between) and found both times extremely enjoyable.\
I'll give Death Note the perfect score of 10/10\

    \"I'll Take A Potato Chip... AND EAT IT!\" -Light Yagami\
The 2006 Psychological-Thriller anime and the top 32 of the best animes in MyAnimeList, Death Note, is no exception and by far, the horrific masterpiece of the 21st century. Unlike any Detective, mystery animes out there like \"Detective Conan\", Death Note is the one who can make you going at the edge of your seat. It has tons of plot twists, the chase between good and evil is fantastic, logics and puzzles surrounding the story, and other good stuffs surrounds here. This is the darkest anime that I've seen thus far, and that's why, until now,\
          \
        this anime is still circulating the pop-culture today.\
Story: (SPOILERS)\
The story starts with the man named Light Yagami, a 17 High School Senior who is smart and intelligent and popular to women due to his looks. But, according to Light, he is already bored on his current situation right now, including his life, his school and even the world. Then, when he saw a notebook falls to the ground, he gets suspicious and tested it on his own hands whether this notebook is true or not. And when he use it, it was a surprise that the first guy who wrote on his Death Note dies of a heart attack, at first, it was a coincidence, but when he uses it on the second time because the group of thugs were sexually aroused by the innocent woman, one of the thugs dies. And with that, he is now currently trying to kill every single one of the criminals in Japan in order to restore the \"Justice\" in his own hands with his fellow Shinigami named \"Ryuk\", naming himself by the codename \"Kira\". But, when the mysterious detective named \"L\" interested about Light's mysterious killing behind the scenes, Light gladly accepts the challenge from L and the fight is on for who will get the right to fight for justice.\
The tensions is the best in my opinion when a detective named \"L\" was been introduced to stop Light, AKA, Kira, from killing every single one of the criminals around Japan. Then, things are about to get a little bit interesting when Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, is a Bureau Chief of the police department and now L's Deputy Director. But, Light is also smart and intelligent in many ways, so in order to prevent L's for suspecting him that he is Kira, he do many preventable ways in order to keeping out of the limelight from L. There are so many things that I could say, this is very fantastic and smart. It was great, full of surprises, so many plot twists, and secrets behind Light's shadow as Kira. Everything in this anime is the icing of the cake with the cherry on top. Including some Logic and puzzles that could make you think what will happen next is really keeps me on the edge of my seat. And It was very fantastic to see those scenes.\
Of course, because of Light, there are no happy endings, I assure you, he's the enemy of the state, so there's no such thing as \"The Bad Guy Wins And The Story Ends\" cliche. If there was an anime that has that cliche, Death Note has not. It was good, And bad in both ways. Why? Good because the bad guy dies, Bad because of the story's ending. And like everyone around the internet who watched this anime, this explanation fron \"Knight_Sentinel\" from fanpop.com has a good explaination, and according to him:\
\"For one thing, I never really liked Near or Mello, I always felt they were pale imitations of L. Near didn't really outwit Light he just got lucky because of Mikami's mistake. If Light had to lose, it should have been to L and it should have been because of some clever trick not sheer luck. Secondly, given how original the anime had been to that point, the issues it had raised such as questioning what was right or wrong I expected something better than the standard cliched \"good guys beat the bad guys\" ending. Light did do a lot of questionable things(as most great figures in history have done) but he was trying to create a better world and it would have been interesting and in keeping with the highly original spirit of the anime to see him win.\"\
But anyways, the story is great, the only thing that it was criticized about is the ending.\
Art:\
Due to it's graphical nature and it's violence, the art and animation performed well in this anime. But the only animation that really caught my eye is the first opening sequence of Death Note, where Light depicted as the false god and the \"Pieta\" depiction of Raye Penber and his fiancee Naome Misura.\
Sound:\
I've watched the English Dub Version of this anime, and the thing is, it was great actually from Light, to Ryuk, to L and others. All of the voice actors is the best in this English dub version. And as for the background music, it was a tense and gives me a lot of goosebumps in every single one of the episodes out there. And as for the OSTs, the only two themes that I like are the songs, \"What's up People\" and \"Zetsubou Billy\" from the Japanese metal band, \"Maximum The Hormone\".\
Character:\
From Light's Anti-hero character to L. There are a lot of character development around here, and the characters here are perfect. I have nothing to say in this character section. So, it is a job well done for these characters here.\
Enjoyment/Overall:\
Like I said before, this anime will always get you at the edge of your seat, it will gave you thrills and suspense about it and the revelations about who is owners of the Death Note and the purpose of this if somebody takes control of this diabolical notebook. So it is a job well done to MadHouse Entertainment and Tetsurou Araki (currently director of \"Attack on Titan\") for doing this wonderful work. The anime is great and it is the best anime of the 21st century because of the famous \"Death Note\" Notebook that circulating around the web. Including the important rule of Death Note is \"The Human whose name is written in this note shall die. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in mind when writing his/her name. This is to prevent people who share the same name from being affected.\"\
So my final verdict for this anime is a 9/10. The main bummer here is the ending of the story, that looks like it was in a hurry to quickly air the final episode. To be honest, it was good if MadHouse just told the fans to calmly wait for the final episode in order to set those things right. But anyways, 9/10 is enough to see this anime a well-done performance from MadHouse. It was fantastic!\
And I have the moral lesson of this story, and that was: \"Any gift or power can be used for good or evil, abused or praised, it's not destiny that controls those actions, it's our decisions.\"\

         Many anime fans consider Death Note to be one of the best anime of all time. I am not one of those fans. I feel that while Death Note is a good show, it has some very glaring issues. I have no problem with the people who love this show, but I am simply going to cast my opinion into the mix. I will try not to spoil the show too much, but I will have to divulge a few plot points of varying importance to get my point across. These spoilers will mainly occur within the story and character\
          \
        sections of this review.\
\
Story (Potential Spoilers): \
     For the 3 of you who don't know Death Note's story, Death Note takes place in the present day. One day, a high schooler named Light Yagami finds a notebook on the ground called the Death Note. This book allows the user to kill any person by just writing the person's name down. There are other rules and stipulations, like having to know the person's face, but that is the gist of it. After using this book a couple of times, the owner of the book, a shinigami named Ryuk, meets up with Light for an exposition dump. Armed with his notebook, Light goes on to rid Japan and the rest of the world from crime. Light becomes known as Kira, and becomes know all throughout the world for killing criminals. Eventually, the mass killings attract the attention of a world class detective named L. L decides that he is going to catch Kira, no matter the cost. The show ends up becoming a game of cat and mouse between L and Light, where you are never really sure who the cat and who the mouse is. \
     After reading this synopsis, you're probably thinking, \"This show looks pretty good, what is so bad about it?\" And you're right, if this was the entire show it would be pretty amazing. IF it was the entire show. At the halfway point of the show, Light gets his memory of being Kira wiped. He then teams up with L to beat a new Kira. Most of the drama and intelligence from the first half disappears during this arc, and is more lighthearted and funny. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is a bit big of a tone shift. If I wanted to watch a lighthearted and funny series, I would go and watch something like that. But for a show to go from a darker show to a much lighter one is a bit jarring. Eventually, Light does regain his memories and we are treated to a very satisfying conclusion. Or it would have been if it was the conclusion.\
     L eventually gets replaced with a new character called Near. Near attempts to capture Kira as well, but his battle against Light is just not as entertaining. Near just comes across as annoying, and is nowhere as To cut to the chase, the third arc that ends off the series isn't very good. The series tries to go back to the drama and intelligence the first arc had, but fails miserably. There isn't much to like in this part. The ending of this arc and the entire show is a cop out very underwhelming. The losing party in the ending loses not because the other party outsmarts the other, but because the plot demands it.\
In conclusion, this show's plot starts off really well and deteriorates over time. The first arc is really good, with a ton of intelligence and drama. These qualities are lost over time, and lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion. The story gets a 6/10.\
\
Art:\
     The art in this series is alright. It has a nice, muted color pallet. The character designs are pretty good, especially L's. The art commands a suprising amount of realism, and adds to the atmosphere of the show. The art was not the focus of this series, and it didn't need to be. The art gets a 6/10.\
Sound:\
     The music in this series is pretty good. The openings are both excellent, even if the second one is quite silly. The background music is also very good, with L's theme in particular standing out. The background tracks added a lot to the thoughts and inner dialogues of both L and Light. The sound gets a 7/10.\
\
Characters (Potential Spoilers):\
      One problem I have  with Death Note is the lackluster characters. L is the only one who has actual depth and develops throughout the series. I will be describing each of the important characters and giving my opinions on them. \
Light: My biggest problem with Light is that he has only two real qualities, he is smart, he is egotistical, and he is evil. Throughout the entire series, we see his intelligence in his battle against L and Near. We also see how evil he is, as he evades capture even if he has to kill people. He also always brags about how he is a god and how smart he is. Other than that, he has nothing. You could say he has compassion since he kills criminals, but he more does it to make himself feel like a god. He even says that he is trying to make a world where he is a god. His motivations never change. Light may be entertaining to watch, but he lacks much depth.\
Ryuk: Ryuk is the shinigami who owns Light's notebook, and he says he dropped it in the human world just have some fun. Ryuk likes to have fun, and does not care what happens as a result. He is often used for comic relief, but can be sinister at times when his apathy of others is shown. Ryuk was a pretty decent character.\
\
Misa Misa: Misa is a model who gets a Death Note as well, and uses it to help Light. Her entire character is that she is an airhead who just wants to help Light. Many people find her to be incredibly annoying. I didn't mind her, but she wasn't interesting to watch. She basically is pretty bad all around.\
Rem: Rem is the shinigami who gave the second Death Note to Misa Misa. Rem is a pretty lifeless character, however, she is hellbent on protecting Misa. Rem would do anything to help Misa, and her entire character is based upon that.\
Near: Near comes into to replace L in the hunt for Kira. Near main goal is to surpass L and show how smart he is. and he is indeed a cool, calculating, and intelligent person. However, that is basically his entire character. He shows no other real traits throughout his time. he also is not as entertaining as L is. I was never super engrossed when Near was thinking and solving problems, or at least not as engrossed as I was with L's thinking. Overall, Near is pretty shallow and not very entertaining.\
Mello: Mello is Near's... brother? I don't know. The two of them grew up together. Mello grew up in the shadow of Near, and basically insanely obsessed with surpassing Near and capturing Kira before him. Mello eventually kinda works with Near, but not really. Mello just didn't really have a lot to him.\
Soichiro Yagami: Light's father and one of the police officers working with L to capture Kira. Soichiro is a bit more fleshed out, as he sanctimoniously wants to capture Kira but doesn't want to find out that his son is Kira. He is very devoted to his work, and puts all his effort into catching Kira. He's an alright character.\
Matsuda: Matsuda is one of the police officers looking to capture Kira, and basically serves as the comic relief. He has a little development at the end when he is angry that Light is Kira. There is not much as else to say.\
Aizawa: Aizawa is one of the police officers looking to capture Kira. We find out that he has a family. He wants to capture Kira, but he doesn't want to leave his family alone if Kira kills him.  This leads him to leaving the Kira Investigation Team for a while before coming back. He is probably the only member of the police force to suspect Light of being Kira. Aizawa is a decent character.\
L: I saved the best for last. L is by far the best character. He is extremely intelligent, and it always entertaining to hear his deductions. However, he also has his quirks. Unlike Near, who is always cold and lifeless, L knows how to have some fun. He also experiences the most development as a character. He ends up becoming friends with Light when they work together, and ends up not wanting to find out that Light is Kira. However, it is heartbreaking when Light doesn't feel the same way. L basically saves the show from complete mediocrity.\
Overall, the characters get a 5/10. While L is a joy, the other characters don't compare as well. \
\
Enjoyment:\
     The first arc I found very enjoyable. Light and L's mind games were extremely fun to watch. It becomes less enjoyable when Light and L begin to work together and the show gets lighter. At that point, the show becomes more focused on comedy. In the final arc, any semblance of enjoyment I had was snuffed out. The show tried to emulate the first arc but could not compare.\
\
Conclusion:\
                Death Note started off great, but worsens as time goes on. The characters and stories vary in quality, with the story and characters of the third arc being dreadful. The music and art do their job well, but are nt masterpieces. Overall, Death Note gets a 6/10.\

    Death Note is the anime that got me into watching anime. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Although this show is great, I still think that it has several problems. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY love this show. Really. \
Story (B+): The story in Death Note starts out very fast-paced and exciting from episode one. I was sucked in right from the beginning and I always found myself wondering what was going to happen to next. There are many twists and turns that make it unique and really interesting. Unfortunately, this is\
          \
        what causes the many flaws in Death Note. The beginning is so intense that throughout the middle, it kind of seems like the author ran out of ideas and started coming up with random plot developments just to hold us over until he could think of something exciting again. The Yotsuba arc was really boring, and at times confusing, and several other parts get bogged down with too much dialogue and confusing additions to the plot. Both Light and L explain not only their own thoughts, but also eachother's. At first, this is really interesting because it's amazing how they know what the other is going to do, but eventually it becomes predictable.There's also some things that happen in the story that seem...a little too implausible (like having people in a room under surveillance for more than 50 days...wtf), but this really isn't too big of a problem.There's one MAJOR plot twist in Death Note that a lot of people have a problem with. Overall, I thought the twist was good, but after it happened the story was never able to be what it was in the beginning. The ending of Death Note should have been a climactic finale, but I found myself more dissapointed than satisfied. With all that being said, the story is still intense, and I was still very invested in it. The twists are really suspenseful and well crafted even in the very end. \
Art (A+) - The art in Death Note is some of the best. There are really no complaints here. The style of animation is distinctive, and definitely adds to the suspensful atmosphere and intense moments. Everything is done with flawless detail. The art can't be given anything less than a perfect 10. \
Sound (A+) - The same goes for sound. The music is PERFECT for this series. It goes so well with everything that happens. It really enhances moments that are emotional and intense. I was never dissatisfied with the music. The opening and ending themes are good too. Throughout the middle (I forget which episode), the opening and ending themes change. I was a little dissapointed because I really liked the first ones, but the new ones did grow on me overtime. The voice acting is really good in Death Note. Mamoru Miyano does such a good job as Light. It's definitely one of the best performances I've ever heard. All the voice actors are well suited for their part. The voice acting was another strong point of the show. \
Characters (B+) - The characters in Death Note are the same as the story - definitely a strong point, but also a major flaw. Light Yagami is one of the most memorable characters ever.  It's funny how you find yourself rooting for him even though he is clearly evil (although technically he's still the protagonist). His relationship with Ryuk  was one of the best parts of this show, but in the later episodes Light barely talks to Ryuk anymore which was really dissapointing. L was also one of my favorite characters and definitely a fan favorite. All of the Japanese police were very entertaining, and the shinigami were also funny. The characters that REALLY ruined some of the show for me were MISA and NEAR. At first, Misa is annoying, but atleast her character has a purpose (kind of) in the beginning of the show. In the later episodes, she doesn't even do anything! She ended up being a waste of space, and it was completely unnecessary to make her so dumb. Near was the other problem. He was like a less cool version of  L that magically knows everything without having to figure anything out. If they were going to copy L they might as well have just left Near out of it. The one character that I thought got the short end of the stick was Mello. He deserved wayyyy more screen time. He was one of the more intersting characters in the later episodes that actually had some depth, and he actually looked cool unlike Near. His mafia arc was alright, but I think he could have been utilized much more. The whole fight between Light and L was the driving force of the show. Taking that away and adding uninteresting characters like NEAR was really lame. The only other good character in the end was Mikami, and he wasn't even there that long. Overall, I liked the characters, but after that one big plot twist some of the new characters are kind of just...meh.  \
Enjoyment (A-) - Death Note is a very enjoyable series. When I first watched it I was sooo into it. I just couldn't stop watching. Even when the show fell short, I still enjoyed watching it a lot. It's an intense thrill ride that definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Although there are many intense parts, there was an extended period where I found myself pretty bored (ahem..the Yotsuba Arc), and waiting for the excitement to come back. Also, the second half of the show, while still entertaining, suffered a lot because of that big twist that happens in the middle. There's also not a lot of rewatch value because you know everything that's going to happen. I'd say after watching it twice it loses some of its appeal. Death Note is also a really well made show. I appreciate anime that are very well developed and produced when you think about all the crappy anime out there that look so cheap. Death Note definitely had a lot of effort put into it.  \
Overall (A-) - This show would have been a perfect 10, but flaws in the story and characterization keep it from achieving its full potential (in my opinion). It's definitely worth a watch for anyone who enjoys suspense, complex characters, and an in- depth story. It's sad that such a good show kind of lost its way through the middle, and was never really able to get back on track, but the creativity of the story makes up for it.  \

    Overview:\
Death Note is one of the most popular anime ever to air on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block. It is obviously  an anime that most otaku and even non-otaku are familiar with, but if you aren't I will give you some examples of the things this show did great and some things it could have improved on. \
Warning: minor spoilers. I mention a character dies, but I don't say which one.\
Story: 6/10\
The story starts out with a very interesting premise about a brilliant student named Light Yagami that one day finds a mysterious book. The book called the Death Note allows you to write\
          \
        the name of any person along with a time and cause of death, and if you know what the person looks like than they will die in exactly this way at that time. This book was dropped by a shinigami, which is a minor god of death in Japanese mythology somewhat like the Western figure of the Grim Reaper. This shinigami named Ryuk, dropped the Death Not simply because he got bored and wanted to see what a human would do with the powers of a God. Unsurprisingly, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Light starts out with an almost admirable goal of cleaning up the world by killing all the \"bad people\". However, his definition of bad begins to shift towards anyone and everyone that opposes him as God of a new world crafted according to his ideology. In order to keep killing, Light must engage in a cat and mouse game with the brilliant detective L. Lawliet. This starts out somewhat like Crime and Punishment with Raskolnikov's game of cat and mouse game with Porfiry Petrovich following the murder of a \"worthless\" old woman that Raskolnikov believed he made the world better by murdering. However, this isn't a redemption tale where Light realizes his crimes and attempts to atone. Light is an evil psychopath who abuses power to the fullest and doesn't give a shit who he needs to kill in order to keep that power. Light's personality profile is similar to that of your average egomaniac, paranoid, sociopathic dictator. What bothers me is that it seems a bit of a stretch that Japan's brightest student could think that all problems can be solved by killing \"bad people\". That is the world view of a naive moron that doesn't understand the complexity of global issues. The problems of overpopulation, pollution, famine, disease,  poverty, and most other problems can't be solved by killing a few bad people. Imagine I kill a brutal dictator in Africa like Kabila that rules the Democratic Republic of Congo. Would that make the Congo into a paradise? No! It would create a power vacuum and civil strife that will probably be replaced with another dictator. If I kill the replacement it will rinse and repeat. The Congo has all of the aforementioned structural problems that can't be solved with a simple murder or two. The second problem with Death Note's story is that it goes on for far too long. The manga was only 12 volumes and it really didn't need 37 episodes. This causes it to drag at times and I especially wasn't happy with the 2nd half. My last grudge with Death Note is something that was at least corrected in the movie. If your show or movie is almost entirely dependent on one beloved character to carry it on his back, don't fucking kill off that character half way through! Death Note suffers from the Full Metal Jacket syndrome, where it slides in the 2nd half at least in part because literally everyone's favorite character is dead.\
Characters: 6/10\
The main lead is Light, who starts out like the Punisher, Dexter, and all those Texan justice characters that kill bad guys and we root for them. I really appreciate that Death Note does not condone this simplistic, apish cultural trend and actually shows Light to be an absolute bastard. Just because a sociopath kills bad guys doesn't mean he is a good guy or that we should root for him! We in the US rooted for Bin Laden and his ilk when he was killing Soviets and called him a freedom fighter and hero of liberty. In fact he was a despicable psychopath who just happened to be killing people we didn't like. This is no guarantee that the sociopathic killer is going to continue killing only bad guys, because you know...they're a fucking sociopath and have no concept of right and wrong.  A rabid dog that just happens to maul and kill a rapist is still a rabid dog and should be put down rather than rewarded or praised. What astounds me is that some viewers still root for Light even though the show goes to every length to show that you are not supposed to. They even give him red eyes and a blood curdling evil laugh out of Austin Powers for God's sake! The best character by far is L, who is in the running with Lisbeth Salender as the greatest Asperger's afflicted detective in fiction. L is hysterical and simply adorable. When your main character is Joseph Stalin put in the body of a Japanese pop star, you need someone more amiable to keep people watching. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast kind of sucks and there isn't enough L. Special shout out to Misa, who is the suckiest of sucky. She is the Jar Jar Binks of Death Note. I have the FEVER! and the only cure...is more L Lawliet!\
Art: 9/10\
The art is really top notch in this series. It had a huge budget and even though it has been a few years since it came out, it still looks just as good today.\
\
Music: 8/10\
The soundtrack is quite good. I didn't really care for that death growl opening and thought it was a tad silly, but besides that thumbs up!\
Enjoyment: 5/10\
I really enjoyed the first part of the series and thought it really had the potential to be great. However, as the series wore on I began to grow tired of it and wanted it to simply end already. I can't really give it high marks for enjoyment when I spend the last 15 or so episodes looking at Light and screaming, \"Just fucking DIE already!\"\
\
Overall: 6/10\
Although I see the appeal and understand why people love this series, it isn't one of my personal favorites. It has a few flaws that made it somewhat lackluster for me personally. That doesn't mean its bad by any means or that you shouldn't watch it! It is in fact quite good and I highly recommend checking it out if you have been living under a rock and haven't seen it yet.\

    WARNING: Minor spoilers within.\
TITLE: Death Note\
MANGA/ANIME: Death Note was originally a manga authored by Tsugumi Ohba and with art done by Takeshi Obata (well-known for his work on the Hikaru no Go manga).  It was serialized in Kadokawa's Weekly Shonen Jump from May 2003 until December of 2006, and was licensed Stateside by Viz Media, with all volumes currently available.\
The anime version of Death Note was produced by Studio Madhouse (well-known for their work on Paranoia Agent and X) and was directed by Tetsuro Araki (Death Note was his first major work).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 3rd, 2006 until June\
          \
        26th, 2007, and was licensed Stateside by, again, Viz Media, and was released in various formats, including Download to Own/Rent and DVDs (with the complete series being available at the time of this writing), along with a run on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim from October 20th, 2007 til July 6th, 2008.\
STORY: Light Yagami is an incredibly smart high school student who's bored out of his head.  One day, he finds a notebook lying on the ground with instructions inside that claim that if the owner writes a name of a person while picturing their face, that person will die.  Light is skeptical at first, and tests it out on a few subjects, confirming its powers, along with the previous owner of the notebook, the apple-addicted shinigami Ryuk, appearing to him.  Light then decides to use the notebook's powers to rid the world of criminals, which, in turn, attracts the attention of the international police community and a mysterious detective named L.\
The area where Death Note excels is in its plot, and how it's structured.  For essentially being a shonen show, Death Note develops its mind games between Light and those pursuing him, L especially, amazingly well, with each relying on various gambits and bluffs to stay a few steps ahead of the other.  And the tension and suspense builds incredibly well throughout the run; in the last few episodes, there were several points at which my heart was actually pounding as I watched what was happening on screen.  And the fact that the writers didn't always make Light infallible, that he slips up at times and risks not being able to outbluff his opponents, is a definite plus in the shonen genre.\
Death Note has two major flaws, however.  One is centered in the structure of the series, which I'll discuss later in Length; the other is in character development.  Throughout the course of the thirty-nine episodes, none of our three major characters undergoes any sort of character development.  L remains eccentric and brillaint, Light remains brilliant and manipulative, except to develop a paranoid messiah complex and turn into even more of a jackass, and Misa remains blindly devotional and makes me want to trade in my uterus.  And without any sort of development, it's hard to relate to any of these characters.  Some of the more minor characters underwent minor character development, like growing a pair or getting even more crazy than they already were.  Additionally, some characters are defined simply by their quirks, which is not characterization at all.\
In terms of how accurate of an adaptation this is from the manga, I can only speak for the first three volumes or so, and vague knowledge of the rest of the manga.  Based on what I know, this is a fairly faithful adaptation, with each episode covering one or two chapters of the manga or so.\
ART: Madhouse does its normal attention to realism in character designs and background here, which is always good.  There's also heavy emphasis on religious symbolism with the main trifecta of characters, and different primary color schemes for each of them when they go into internal monologues, especially in particularly dramatic moments.  And this is all fine and well.\
However, the one part where they lost me was their use of SLOOOOOW MOOOOTIOOON in particularly dramatic moments, which may cause moments of laughter where the director may not have intended.  There's one particular moment early on in the series' run that best exemplifies this; Light is under surveillance by L and, in order to keep on killing criminals as Kira, he slips a portable TV and a slip of the Note into the potato chips package, seemingly studying and eating as he is actually killing off criminals.  The animation during this sequence goes into incredibly slow motion, with the grease off the potato chips sparkling, and Light seemingly making DRAMATIC EATING MOTIONS.  It's fairly ridiculous, and I was laughing out loud; pretty sure this was not what was intended.  And this is used fairly often throughout the series, and just pushes things over into ridiculousness.\
MUSIC: The background music for this is very heavy on the dramatic choral and orchestral arrangements, which kind of helps with pushing some of the more dramatic moments into the series into over-the-top ridiculousness.\
The first OP and ED are fairly standard J-Rock numbers, don't stand out that much, but pretty good in and of themselves.  The second OP and ED are speed metal numbers, and the OP's pretty catchy, good to use as an alarm.  Aya Hirano's (Misa's seiyuu) also got an insert song in here as well, not anything particularly big, but decent in and of itself.\
SEIYUU: Aya Hirano (famous for her role as Haruhi Suzumiya and Konata Izumi in Lucky Star) plays Misa Amane, and Maaya Sakamoto (famous for her roles as Hitmoi in Escaflowne and Aeris in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children) shows up as Takada Kiyomi.  Everyone else does a fairly good job in their roles.\
LENGTH: The biggest issue that I have with the series is in its length, and to go into this requires SPOILERS, so skip to the end of this section if you wish to avoid them.  The first twenty-five episodes are all well and good.  But after L dies, we essentially get what we saw in the last twenty five episodes recycled and compressed into twelve episodes, with a few new characters taking on the roles that L and Misa did during the first twenty-five episodes.  And honestly... it worked the first time around, not so much the second.  \
OVERALL: This is a fairly solid show in the plot department, but it has its share of flaws, mainly with regards to characterization, dramatic moments turning ridiculous, and the plot after the first half of the series pretty much just being a recycling of what we saw before.\
Definitely worth a watch, but not the ZOMG MASTERPIECE that everyone makes it out to be.\

     Unique, clever, thrilling, addictive.\
 I cannot fathom the brain and thought process of who created this. \
 In my opinion, \"Outstanding\" summarises Death Note from start to finish.\
 I have never watched anything so 'clever' in my entire life. You think you're smart enough to guess what happens next, I guarantee you won't. After a couple of episodes, you'll be hooked.\
 This is truly an anime anyone can watch. It pushes the limits of what can be created via fiction. The sense of morality, hope, justice, revenge and righteousness are a few examples of what you can expect. The plot twists and the character\
          \
        development are superb. After each episode you want more!\
 I would highly recommend this to everyone, whether or not you are into anime, it is irrelevant. \
 Death Note from start to finish questions the difference of what can be considered 'good' and 'bad', or in this case, good vs evil.  \
 If you have half a brain, or an average IQ, you cannot help but be sucked into this.\
 This is easily the most thrilling series of something I have ever watched. Not the first anime i've seen either, but this one stands out the most. \
 An absolute masterpiece, you won't regret watching this.\

    *FOR THE VERY FEW OF YOU OUT THERE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ANIME JUGGERNAUT, SPOILERS FOR DEATH NOTE. ALSO, THIS REVIEW WILL BE HUGE, BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME\"\
Let's flash back to 2006. Anime at the time was a decently popular entertainment medium with a few great hits that many internationals know. However, we never really got a global phenomenon from the anime industry. A pair of shoes came on at around the same time, and one year later, that pair got an English dub that showed the world the true power of anime genius protagonists and the effects they would have on our world\
          \
        as we know it. One of those was Code Geass, which was amazing, but had but a brief run in the spotlight meaning that despite being so popular on MAL, it would never truly cement its mainstream status the way a Shounen Jump anime adaptation would. Speaking of which, his show Death Note, was the other, more successful brother of the two, even if MAL scores say otherwise. This show originated as a Shounen Jump manga, and judging by Bleach and Naruto, that meant instant stardom, and now Light Yagami and his black notebook of death is the most popular anime of all time, and an anime who's worldwide phenomena juggernaut status would only be challenged twice. One by SAO, once by Attack On Titan. Well, now to the present. This show is officially a classic. Now, how well does this killer hold up? Let's find out, shall we?\
STORY: 7/10\
Light Yagami is a genius student in high school. One day, a black notebook literally falls from the sky, and in doubt, he tests it out on some criminals currently trying to molest a girl a few hours after class, only to find out, it works. It turns out, it was like a rock being thrown into stagnant water. Ryuk, a shinigami from a realm of shinigami (creatures who created and posses Death Notes) dropped it on purpose waiting for someone to pick it up and \"change the world\" because he's bored. Soon, the police realize how horrible such a thing could be, and call up the world's greatest detective, L, who quickly reveals the city where this killer, now called Kira, is. It soon becomes a figurative chess match between the two as many police members due to Kira's book, even if some methods are a bit cruel on Light's end. Soon, he gets scouted by Misa Amane, another Death Note wielder, only he is reluctant to have her on board, but decides to use her for this whole ordeal, ready to kill her if he doesn't need her anymore. Soon, after deciding to erase his memory, he and Misa are locked up and mentally tortured for days before joining up with them, as this group of corporate assholes is up to some shady business, and after that sidequest is finished, Light ends up re-encountering his Death Note and regains his memory, and with that, proceeds to finish L off. So, ok, good story. It was a fun little figurative chess match, even if the last few episodes up to that point felt like a tedious sidequest involving corporate assholes for the sake of an antagonist. \
Well, apparently, the original mangakas wanted to end it there, but due to fan demand, caved in and created a lackluster 12 episodes to cap it off. A few years later, after somehow having the world under his fear-mongering thumb, and not getting caught at all, he is still working with the police. Apparently, L has two apprenticed known as Near and Mello, who go off to do their own thing to catch the Kira. Mello kidnaps Light's sister and kills kid dad, while Near takes a more analytical and chess player like role. Ultimately, they were still sorta working together. A new Desth Note user named Teru Mikami joins Light's cause and looks like a perfect member, only until the ending. Somehow, Near and his men managed to barge into Mikami's room without anyone knowing, switched his Death Note with a fake, in a hackneyed attempt to lure out a super genius like Light, AND IT WORKS!!! Also, Light was never smart enough to come up with a back up plan like he always does, and ends up being exposed, shot, and eventually killed by Ryuk's own Death Note! I'll get to how badly the ending betrayed the characters of the Death Note users in the characters section, but the ending is just bad! I mean, it is so egreigious that it is literally one of the worst endings I've seen to date. Sure, Death Note had a decent story, but the ending was so bad. It felt like they had not reasonable way to kill Light, so they took the easy way out. It didn't entirely ruin the story, but the last 12 episodes managed to make a watered down sequilitis story that bogged everything down overall, instead of waiting and then making this last 12 episode arc into a sequel. Well, we have what we have, and overall, not too shabby, ending aside.\
CHARACTERS: 7/10 \
Light Yagami is a villain protagonist and let's be honest, while he was kind of interesting in the first 25 episodes, 26-37 make him lose all of his charm. He was power hungry and had a god complex, but had a decent set of morals that decayed the more he was immersed in his cause to save the world. Some say the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the first 25 episodes managed to do that brilliantly, and we probably wouldn't mind if he won since despite being morally questionable, he still has some morals about family and was interesting. The last 12 episodes make him cocky, lethal, toxic, and more power hungry than ever, ruining his credibility as a likable character. The ending was a real slap in the face for his character though. He became SO COCKY, that he never bothered to use Misa as a sure fire backup, gave himself away so easily that way he could gloat if he won, and overall, failed to have a reasonable reason to be defeated. However, he at least died with more dignity that in the manga, so I'll at least give it that. Ryuk is a snarky, narcissistic, creature who admits that he is only working with Light into Light screws up. He makes for some decent comic relief. L is an interesting genius with odd quirks, and a morality that can sink if need be. He also has a sweet tooth, and is kinda kickass, more so than Light. I like the way he died, since he died at just the right moment to jumpstart our hype back up after the fullness of episodes 18-24, and had a reasonable and epic send off. The officers are good people and decent characters as well, but for the sake of time, I will only be talking about four other people. Misa starts off as calculating, and also a good planner, when it comes to hooking Light. She doesn't show any of that off afterwards, becoming just another Yandere-ish jealous girl that always kisses up to Light, and while I didn't dislike her, I can see why many do. \
Now for the worse supporting cast. Teru Mikami, is a bad-guy fighter; always has been. He didn't care if he got hurt. As long has he stopped injustices around her, and grew to hate his mother when she tried to convince him to stop lest he got hurt by some bully. Now, he is crazy, with his epic pen writing skills, and a true immersion with his cause. This causes him to be rather gullible and stupid near the end of end though, and the face that Kira like his pawn/ex girlfriend only to find how he did that too and at the exact same time, made me really dislike him after I already hated Light for doing that. Mello, is an asshole. He is always at Near's throat, is blackmailing Light by holding his sister hostage, and is just a muscle asshole because an interesting antagonist in Death Note is a foreign concept. Near... I hate Near. He is literally a watered down L who uses are ally stupid method to somehow come out on top. Plus, he worked with Mello to do his thing, actually using Mello as a pawn, and he's a really good liar. So, yeah, not amazing, but a decent and late cast that I can't entirely cover, lest this review be as long as a novel.\
ART: 9/10 \
This was done by Studio MADHOUSE, and if you know MADHOUSE, you know how good they are at their projects. They went for a more realistic look combined with a more digital art that the early 2000's have plagued the industry with, and this show pulls it off rather well. When they try getting some trippy and odd imagery there to make a visual statement, they also succeed very well. The character models don't always look amazing though, but the art is well done nonetheless. Plus, the dark lighting in the final episode really adds to the tone of it, oven if the finale sucks. \
SOUND: 8/10 \
OP 1is a very good and memorable OP that really fits well with the narcissistic and almost nihilistic tone of Death Note. It's a great OP. OP 2... How do you describe the insanity. It is literally a scream-o. I don't like those too much, but the lines are so easy to misconstrune, it gets hilarious towards the end. It's beyond self-indulgent in its own madness, and man did Maximum the Hormone have fun with this one; it's crazy as sin.. ED 1 is just ok. Decent for the show it's attached to, but nothing more. ED 2 is awesome. It really brings the edgy and nihilistic tone to the forefront in an awesome song called \"Zetsubou Billy\" by Maximum Hormone (who also did OP 2), the band responsible for Freiza's theme. Yes, the guys who chanted \" FRIEZA FRIEZA FRIEZA FRIEZA\", did this awesome song. The dub, is also solid. Sure, the voices aren't really standout, and I could swear Misa sounds different in the last 10 episodes than the rest of the show, but overall, they gave a good performance. Also, Light is voiced by the guy who did Setsuna from Gundam 00, or more hilariously, Rock from Black Lagoon. Make of that what you will.\
ENJOYMENT: 7/10\
Overall, I was fine with the first 25 episodes, and for the most part, enjoyed them well enough, sort of excluding the slog that was episodes 18-22. The last 12, especially that ending, managed to drop the ball quite a bit for me. Not enough to make me dislike the show, but enough that I can't praise it as a masterpiece that many incessant fans would. The finale was nothing more than a cliched, unbridled train wreck.\
OVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 71/100\
So, does Death Note deserve all the hype it gets? No, not with that final cour it doesn't. However, it is definitely as respectable global phenomenon with some creative and exciting plans, some mostly good twists, and a sense of tension that is rife theoughout it's first 2 cours. I just wish that the last 12 episodes didn't exist for they turned a great show insi something less than that. Even still, some of the music is rest and the visuals are certainly some of the best of the late 2000's. With that said, I bid you adieu.\

    SHITTY REVIEW\
-shamelessly presents-\
Death Note(sub)\
Death Note is an anime that almost whoever has watched has give it a rating of above 7 .and it is not for a trivial matter.DN has everything to make you watch 25episode in a row.but what about the rest of episodes you may ask.That is what this review will explain.\
Story 10/9.8-The story is simple.A boy genius Light Yagami who is bored of  his school life and tired of the 'rotting' world founds a notebook in which if  we write someones name that person will die.Light decides that he will kill every criminal and become the god of his Utopian\
          \
        world(in short he gets a god complex),the UN noticed this phenomena of criminals getting killed so they ask the aid of world's greatest detective L to find the person behind this.the story is good.\
Art 10/9-For those who have only watched new anime may found the art  not so good.But the dark style was important for creating the atmosphere .\
Soundtrack 10/10-After Light and L.The thing that really makes DN awesome is the soundtrack.The Soundtrack has the power to make every scene awesome.For example to make Light even more awesome there is Light's theme and kuroi Light,to make L even more awesome there is L's theme and L's theme B and to make ANYTHING awesome there is kodoku(solitude) and low of solipsism  and Death Note Theme.Voice acting of Light was Amazing.\
Characters 9/10-All characters are in one or another way are average except Light and L.didn't I said that the story is simple and it is but what really moves it are these two characters.There ideas,their brilliance and their everything.but there is also M&N .M is a jealous bastard while N is a cocky bastard.there 2 appears after 25th episode and ruin everything.\
Overall 9/10-If you still have not seen yet three words for you WATCH IT  NOW\

    Though the animation occasionally veers into Bad Drawing Land, and all the sitting around (close up, pan, rinse, repeat) and yadda yaddaing can get very old on the eyes, the mental aspect of the anime is certainly up to par. If you can get over the anime and sound aspects, and don't crave explosions every other episode, this series could very well be a good choice. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys following a good mind game or two.\
Character-wise, it's pretty neat knowing that each character is supposed to have a specific mental disorder. Light and L have Sociopathy and Asperger's, respectively. Wikipedia\

    Well... my friend introduced this to me a while back. She said it was fun and really well-made, but with all the L and Light shipping by fans, I thought, \"Another piece of yaoi crud. Joy.\" I mean... To those of you who like yaoi, good for you! But it's just... Not my type. I'm sorry. \
Finally, out of my utter boredom, I got desperate. \"I'll watch it just so I can make fun of it, and point out to all the fans out there that this show is awful!\" ...And then, I watched episode 1.\
\
Story~\
This is my favorite of all time. I have to\
          \
        admit. I know that in my Higurashi review, I really praised it, but Death Note is my number one. I know, it's not the best thing, so it's my guilty pleasure, I guess. I lost count of the times I've seen this. Um, 10? Maybe 9. Basically, I watch it when I'm bored or I want a good thrill. After I finished it the first time, I IMMEDIATELY started it over (literally, immediately) just so I could pick out the plot holes. I found a couple, but then I realized they were quickly resolved after and/or explained. In my third time through I found some holes that weren't really resolved, but they are so small that it's almost impossible to notice-- and they really don't even matter or even hurt the story. Overall, it's great, and every little fine detail is so important to the overall show that I swear-- your mind might explode at some point in Death Note. Yes, some people think it's stupid, but my opinion does not change on my favorite anime. Sorry! Anyway, it's THE best mystery/fantasy/cat-and-mouse game ever. The second arc which takes place after episode 25 (I won't spoil anything) is sort of less exciting, but is still very good and enthralling.\
\
Art~\
Oh, the gorgeous art! Honestly, like 80 percent of Death Note is pretty much them talking to find out the mystery, but the art style itself is PERFECTLY dark, modernly gothic, and gorgeously realistic. And when they do move around, or an action scene comes on? They go all out, and never skimp on anything. It almost seems like they have eternal budget to make each scene amazing. Hehe. Anyway, all in all the art is amazing. One of my friend's hated anime, saying that \"it's for children and the art is stupid\". I forever converted her using this show, Death Note. It's just awesome.\
\
Character~\
Amazing. They're all unique in their own ways, but the most enthralling and notable characters for me (WARNING-- this will sound cliche) are L and Light. Ugh, you've heard that a trillion times... but is it my fault that the creators made such unique, such interesting characters? They're just genius! L seems like the cool, smart type, but he's not strong in some areas, and has more weaknesses than you might think. He isn't rude, but he does show a softer side later on nonetheless. He's a really hard character to sum up. Light, on the other hand, is immature. An image of your little brother just popped up in your head, didn't it? Stupid, annoying, cries when he doesn't get something he wants, everyone has to give him everything, and he's such a baby. NO. Light is immature in a different way-- yes, he's a freaking genius. He is a master of logical reasoning. He acts mature in public and always has a trick up his sleeve. But he's immature in his mind, I guess-- his idea of justice isn't the most mature, and killing people doesn't make you God, Light. Just thought you ought to know!~ Anyway, it's sooooooooo entertaining to see him change. I can't remember the person who said this, and I can't really even remember the saying-- I just remember this. \"Power doesn't change a man but unmasks what's been there all along.\" (Yeah I can't remember it really, sorry, but you get the idea.) Yeah, it's fun watching him go from genuis, well-mannered high school kid to psychotic mass murderer who thinks that killing people will make him God. All the other characters are good, and it doesn't really have too many characters but not too little either. And each has their own personality. They're all interesting. A certain character in the second arc seems like a wannabe of a certain character in the first arc, but overall they're fun.\
\
Soundtrack~\
...Wow. I mean wow. Some of the orchestral music is just rearragements of slightly older pieces, but does that ruin the mood? LOL. No. I have never laughed so psychotically at someone's death in my whole life. Not even in Higurashi. That astonishing music along with the perfect animation is just... Woooooowwww. The tracks that aren't orchestral are good, but not super noticed. The more I watched the show the more it stood out, but my first time round, only the choir chanting along ominously with the perfect set of instruments really stood out. And I mean REALLY. The first opening and ending were good, but not super memorable. The animation that went with them was epic though. The second opening and ending... Erm, I'm not a death metal fan. Let's leave it at that. \
\
All in all, Death Note is my top anime, no matter how much you make fun of me. It's just genius, and when I finished watching it I was delighted. It's pretty much everything I ever wanted in an anime, or anything for that matter. Fantasy, SLIGHT horror, mystery, psychotic characters, an... interesting ending. Gorgeous!\
I'd recommend this anime to ANYONE... Um, unless you're a raving romance-loving person, there is no romance in this. Protest all you want, but Light doesn't love Misa. He's only using her and that's all he ever did. So if you like bright, happy, lovey-dovey anime, this may not be for you.\
But truly, this is art and genius.\
You just may want to try it.\

    Well, you got to admit that Death Note has a special suspense in the atmosphere. Basically it goes about 2 geniuses who try to find each other. One has the power to kill, other one has the entire police at his side.\
Story:\
The story is alright, you will not get bored because of this, because every episode will be mind bugling. Every strategy both geniuses take took a lot of time for any normal person to come up with, and they just do it like it took them 5 minutes.\
Animation:\
Pretty good actually, not perfect but that's just my opinion (Animation is NEVER perfect). But you still\
          \
        know exactly what's going on if you look, it's not that you don't know what's going on and who is shooting who for instance.\
Sound:\
The background music is somewhat creepy, and it should! You're in a thriller and not in a comedy. The background music fits really good with the tension thats building up.\
Characters:\
The characters, well you basically have L and Kira, both are aliases for those 2 geniuses. The characters all have a background story why they became the ones they did.\
Enjoyment:\
Every strategy they make, every plan they scheme and every path they walk will keep you on the edge of your seat.\
Overall:\
This has got to be, one of the best anime's I saw in a long while. Death Note I recommend to anybody to watch. After the second episode you won't regret it!\

    I must say that honestly I believe Death Note is the greatest anime of all time. It is the COMPLETE package. It is the only anime I ever watched that I could not stop watching. It really makes you think and it has soooo many good twists throughout the entire series. You never really know what's going to happen next.\
Story: I mean, it's so unique. What other series have you heard of with Shinigamis and notebooks that can kill people? And it really appeals to a lot of different tastes. It is suspenseful without being scary. And it is funny without just being a comedy.\
          \
\
Art: Death Note's art is pretty amazing, but sometimes it seemed like the artist randomly changed. In a few episodes the drawings were semi freakish, such as the very last two episodes. But all-in-all, I must say that there is amazing artwork.\
Sound: Okay, by far, the best OP themes and ED themes every made in any anime. Maximum the Hormone has become my favorite band since I heard the Death Note OP and ED. No lie. Also, I really like the church music they play while Light kills people. It really adds to the mood of the show nicely.\
Character: FOR SURE a 10 when it comes to characters. At least in my opinion. Light has that sly characteristic where he is very good at hiding things and keeping secrets. Misa may be slightly annoying at times, but every show needs a relief character that you can just laugh at. L was that complete package character. He was cute and funny AND smart. And I loved how they said that Near and Mello together was like the complete L. That was a very good way to describe those two characters. And Matsuda has to be my favorite character. He is that guy that makes you laugh throughout the whole show and even if he doesn't have a MAJOR part, he was still important in the story.\
Enjoyment: I have never enjoyed any anime more than this one. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time I watched it. I laughed a lot in the beginning of the series and cried a couple of times by the end of the series.\
\
The only thing I must say negatively about Death Note is that the manga was better. But still, best anime ever.\

    If you like psychological thrillers then i suggest you go watch a James Patterson movie. \
Death Note did not cut it for me, the endless (and sometimes random) mind fight between L and Light gets tedious a few episodes in which slows down the plot considerably. \
The Sherlock Holmes logic of the characters reduced to intricate details like the colour of a chair (or something) which leads to a massive, yet not massive, clue to the identity of L or Light repeats itself several times always ending in a stalemate and some cliffhangers which i said to myself 'Here we go again'.\
The character designs are\
          \
        good however and the soundtrack does create a supernatural environment in which to enjoy the mind games between the two characters.\
Overall, not the best anime series in my opinion for thrills, kills, and spills.\

    Today I will be reviewing another favorite anime of mine (and many others), Death Note. Death Note did not seem like a title I would like, and I first thought the fanbase for this was just crazy. But one day I was bored and decided \"what the hell\" and figured I'd see what the hype was all about. I checked out episode 6 or 7 on Adult Swim on demand, and boy am I glad that I did. I got hooked. I thought this would be another series where I'd disagree completely with every other anime fan out there (i.e. Fullmetal Alchemist, Elfen Lied and\
          \
        and most Ghibli movies, anime everyone seems to love but I can't stand). Throw in my dislike for most Shonen Jump titles and you'll understand why I thought I'd hate this (although I now feel this show is vastly out of place among titles like Naruto, Bleach, and such. It's nothing like those shows). I'm just trying to say I didn't think I'd like this show at all, in fact part of me wanted to hate it. But it's so good I couldn't. You would have to be mad not to like this amazing show.\
Death Note was animated by Madhouse, who almost-always seems to impress me. It originally aired in 2006 and 2007. It was directed by Tetsuro Araki, who is a director to watch out for. He is a master of storytelling and able to create a great amount of suspense with reletive ease. He knows what he is doing, and how to do it. Of course he was just taking what Tsugumi Ohba (story) and Takeshi Obata (art) had already created as a manga, and adapting it into a TV series, but he still proved himself to be a more then competent director. Toshiki Inoue wrote the screenplay for the series, and it's handled with care. Anyway Death Note is suspense/psychological thriller anime about how a smart high school senior named Light Yagami, finds a supernatural note book with the power to kill, and how he uses it to try and become the God of a new world. He plans to kill criminals all over the planet, in order to create a crime-free world in which he would rule. To kill a person Light needs to know the name and face of that person, then write it down in the death note. And that is just the first of the many complex and thought out rules of the death note. And the rules are not meaningless either, as they are put to good use and becomes important points of the plot. Light is later joined by the former owner of the death note, a shinigami named Ryuk (who just decides to watch the show, and doesn't take much action by the way. Very cool!). But as the police start to notice all these criminals dieing, they start up an investigation to get to the bottom of it. They are assisted by the brilliant and mysterious detective L to help track down this mass murder, and a battle of wits ensues. Not that I needed to tell you all that, as everyone and their mother probally knows this already. The paceing for the show is very fast, but somehow it all works. In fact it's something you learn to love. You never get lost in the details, although a lot is happening every episode. It's never too hard to keep track of who has the upperhand, or what this person is attempting to do and how. Anyway the concept in and of it's self is just brillaint. It's very original and very simple. Who says there's nothing unique and original anymore? Everything is just the same story choped up and changed around a little? Not this. There's some originality left in the world.\
As if this brilliant concept wasn't good enough, the series challeneges the viewers, both mentally and morally. What I mean is the series has so much going on, you really have to pay attention and follow the logic of the show intensely and actively. And you have to think about everything going on. It also asks us some great moral questions, and may even challenge your morals a little bit. Like for example is what Light doing right? I mean the world would be a much better place without criminals, right?And as he kills these people crime rates do drop all over the planet. But on the other hand he's killing people he judges to be evil, who gives him that right? He's not able to be held responsible to the people like the government is, and how many innocent people is he killing, by sheer coincidence or accident? I mean not every single person in jail, or labled a criminal is guilty. The government and media can make mistakes too. Is L right, for trying to stop a coldhearted, manipulative mass murderer? Because he goes to some real lows, stopping at nothing to try and capture this \"Kira\", the name given to the person killing all these criminals. He does some terrible things along the way, like having no problem sacraficing a criminal in order to narrow down his search, or placing illegal wire taps and other surveillance in people's houses! Invasion of privacy much? There seems to be no such thing as civil liberites to this guy. The ends justify the means, as long as Kira is caught that's all that matters. Same goes to Light in a way. All of that is much more then most series can say. But that's not even the best part of Death Note.\
The best part of the series is the sheer thrill and excitement one obtains from watching the show. It's intense, dramatic and incredbly suspenseful. The thrilling nature of the show is really something else. Never before have I seen a show that relies so heavily on suspense, and not just any suspense, but very good suspense. The shows main suspense depends on the amazingly brilliant game of cat and mouse that develops between Kira (aka Light), and L. It's a sign of good storytelling when you worry about this character or that one, or wonder what's going to happen next. The status quo never remians the same for long, and the person who has the advantage can never seem to hang on to it. It's very smart how all this plays out. L is trying to find out who Kira is to sentence him to death. And Light is trying to find out who L is, to write his name in the Death Note to kill him. Whoever finds out who the other person is first wins. The story contains intelligent fast paced fast paced deductions, multiple dramatic scenes , strategies, and epic mind battles that will keep any viewer hooked for the long haul (as this is a 37 episode series, much longer then I'm used to anyway). There are also some great, well thought out plot twists throughout the show, that will come as a real surprise. Many of the episodes end on great cliffhangers, that make you beg for the next episode, and the show will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Also Death Note never relies on \"false suspense\", that is it doesn't provoke suspense to then end up with a red haring or creates suspense unintelligently (i.e. horror movies where a cat was what scared the character at first. That brings a big let down to the veiwer. Another example is a scene where the character can't manage to get his keys to open the door correctly when he's being chased by the villian/monster. That makes us want to hit the person, and makes us just plain dislike them. Plus it's just not very realistic and it's very contrived. These scenes usually damage a work unless they are handled with great care. However, Hitchcock could handle false suspense quite well. But of course most cannot handle it as well as Hitchcock. Death Note avoids \"false suspense\" completely, and it's for the better.) Death Note is a master of suspense, plain and simple. I doubt any other series (live action, anime or written works) will ever match up to it's ability to deliver suspense to the viewer. It is a rollercoaster of a plot, with great ups and downs, and wild turns and twists a long the way. And the conclusion (don't worry no spoilers) is incredbly dramatic, suspensefull, and more then satisfying. It ties up all the lose ends, and brings us down from our \"high\" of suspense quite nice. Also it's a very sad ending, that might impact you a little emotionally. In fact I rank the conclusion of this series as one of the best in all of anime (it's #2, right behind the exellent ending to Now and Then, Here and There). It will be hard to top the ending of this show! I was literally shaking with anticipation leading up the last moments of the show. It's a perfect bookend to the series.\
Now for the poduction values. They are godly! Let's start with the artwork and animation. The artwork is just perfect. Madhouse was a great choice for adapting the gothic style of the manga, and uses a great original style for everything. The color pallete is dark for this series, but not at all gloomy. In fact Madhouse seems to have used a great contrast of light and dark in this series, and made everything very easy to see, but still have a great dark look to it all (which is perfect for this as it's a very dark show). The character designs are also incredbly well done. They are very detailed and realistic looking. The older detectives looks great, the high school students look realistic, and the girls all look very good (many of them are quite pretty, yet still real looking). And I have to mention that the show has a hook in it for the gals. Many of the characters are clearly bishounen bait. The illusion of debth for the characters to move around in 3 dimensions is prevalent in this anime and very well done. As for the animation, since the show is mostly talking, walking and thinking, there's not much for them to animate. However they managed to make writing with a pen look amazingly cool and incredbly epic. That's a plus in my book. When there is an action scene, you can bet it's perfect looking. Car chases, shootouts, and dramatic deaths are all animated with great care. The music is another thing that will impress you. All the opening and ending songs are great tracks. Fun to listen to, and are very fitting. But the strengh of this series comes from it's brilliant background music. From intense themes, to more calm ones, to church like hyms (that fit with Lights idea of becoming a God) and dark tones, everything is done perfectly. The music is used to hold the suspense and drama and it's just amazing. The perfect theme is used at the perfect time, and they all sound great. It's very loud and noticeable, but this is a good thing. Death Note easily has one of the best soundtracks in all of anime. It's not exactly soemthign most would listen to out of context, but it's quite good for the show. As for the dub, it's just another perfect part of this amazing series. The dub was produced at Ocean Studios in Vancouver, Canada. Brad Swaile gives one of his best performances to date as Light Yagami. He just nails the role in every way. The way he handles his characters inner monologues is really impressive. Alessandro Juliani gives L a quirkiness about him, that just fits perfectly. Soichiro Yagami, Light's Father, is played by Chris Britton who gives him a gruffy and older sound that fits perfectly. In fact many of the older detectives have gruffy sounding voices, and many of the younger ones have a youthfullness about them that makes you understand them. A lot of thought went into the casting of this show, and every single line is acted perfectly. It's a very fresh, and expertly done dub. An example of what dubs can and should always be. It's one of the best dubs of the last few years, and a personal favorite of mine. Only slightly beaten out by another Ocean dub, Black Lagoon. This is a dub everyone and anyone would like.\
So with all that praise you may ask \"well is it perfect then?\". Well not quite, but very close. There are many people who feel the second half of the series does not at all live up to the first. Personally I disagree with that completely. There is nothing at all wrong with the second half of the show. It's just as good as the rest of it. The series keeps up it's quality thoughout and has no filler. Just because there is a major change in the style of the show, does not make it any worse. It's just different, not bad by any means. In fact I found the show to build on it's self, in so the later episodes would have even more suspense then the earlier ones. So then what's the problem? Well many of the characters are not very well developed. Many are nothing but chess peices, being used for the plot, by the plot, and only needed to exist when the plot calls for them. (Where are they when the story is not moving forward? Who cares!) So there are a few 2 dimensional characters in the show. However the show seems to have purposely done this. It seems to have decided early on not to develop some characters, and so it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things anyway. In fact the show may be better for it in the long run. Instead of wasteing time developing character after character, this series would rather stick to the giant game of cat and mouse between Light and L, and focus on creating suspense. But many of the characters are realistic, believable and sympthatheic and that's enough for me. Their actions make sense in the context of the show, and never feel out of place. Sure some people would like more emphasis on the characters evolving over time then this show has, but the way this series handled it's characters did not bother me too much. A little bit more emphasis on a few characters would have been amazing, but I'm more then happy with what we got. I felt it had just enough character development as to not take away from the plot, so I'm not that bothered by this small \"problem\". Oh and there was one deus ex machina (I'll just say \"the rocket\" and leave it as that as to not spoil anyone) that didn't fly with me in the show. It felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner, and did something completely unrealistic to get them out of it. It pulls you out of the show a little bit. Although in the context of the what's going on and the setting it does make some sense. That's all that really bothered me about the show. The rest is flawless.\
\
One note more note about the director. I first saw the anime, and then went and read some important parts of the manga afterwards (currently I'm reading the manga from start to finish). The changes the director made to the anime were done with great thought behind them, and I easily prefur them to the original. The slight changes really help the series more often then not, and the ending of the anime is vastly superior to that of the manga. They both have the same ending, but the manga goes on to show what happens afterwards, which is not at all needed. It ruins the punch of the series, and is not really that interesting. The series needed to stop at the right time, and luckily the anime knew when that was. After the last scene in the anime nothing else needed to be known. Going on and explaining more stuff is pointless in my opinion, and sort of ruins everything. Other changes, like the slight difference in the chronology of certain scenes are easily for the better, and flashbacks are used in more important scenes. The use of great camera angles, like those showing L vs Light, or many people at the same time during different things are exceptional, and something the manga lacked. The manga would show one thing at the time, while the anime would show mutliple things happening at once (making it much more exiting). I prefer the way the anime dealt with those scenes. The great use of flashbacks in the begining of each episode, cliffhangers at the end of an episode, and other changes to when things happen, helped to add tension to the scenes. Also I find that \"watching\" something is much more exiting and suspenseful then reading something. So if you want to have the most exitement and thrill out of this series, I suggest you watch the anime first. Then go back and read it to see where it all began. No offense to the original mangakas of course, as the manga is amazing on it's own. It's just a different experience to watch something then to read it. These are some signs of great talent for the director, so keep an eye on him.\
All in all Death Note is nearly a flawless effert. It's a smart show, that's very dark, intense, dramatic and exiting. The show is an example of how to create excellent suspense, and has one of the best endings in all of anime. The artwork and music is flawless, and the direction is very strong. The dub is a top-of the line effert by the Ocean Group, something sub-only fans would enjoy. There are some slight problems with character development, but it's easily overlooked. And one scene felt like the writers got trapped in a corner and wrote themselves out of it very unrealistically. But it is an excellent show. It's every bit of the hype. A smart show like this hasn't been popular since Neon Genesis Evangelion (a show the director admits to being a huge fan of), and I hope it's a sign of other smart shows to come. There really is nothing else out there quite like Death Note. Don't let the hype scar you off like it almost did to me. You just have to see this show.\
(Sorry the review is so long, but I wanted to do this series some justice)\

    This review will be on Portuguese, if so you can translate to your language.\
Death Note ( Desu Noto, \"Caderno da Morte\") é uma série de mangá escrita por Tsugumi Ohba e ilustrada por Takeshi Obata, e que cuja adaptação para anime foi dirigida por Tetsuro Araki. A história centra-se em Light Yagami, um estudante do ensino médio que descobre um caderno sobrenatural chamado \"Death Note\", no qual pode matar pessoas se os nomes forem escritos nele e se o portador visualizar mentalmente o rosto de alguém que quer assassinar.\
A partir daí, Light tenta eliminar todos os criminosos e criar um mundo onde não exista o\
          \
        mal, mas os seus planos são contrariados por L, um famoso detetive particular. A série é baseada num one-shot que foi lançado pela Shueisha na revista Weekly Shonen Jump.\
A série tem 12 volumes de mangás mas no entanto existe um volume chamado \"How to Read\" (Como Ler) que é o volume 13. O volume one-shot representa o Volume 00. \
Também existe um \"aclamado\" volume que se autodomina como o volume 14( na minha opinião)  que se chama \"Death Note Another Note: O caso dos Assassinatos em Los Angeles\"  - traduzido para portugûes. \
Basicamente retrata o caso em que Naomi Misora e L trabalharam juntos. Possui 178 páginas e foi lançado em agosto de 2006 apenas no Japão.\
O mangá foi publicado pela primeira vez em Dezembro de 2003 pela editora Shueisha na revista semanal japonesa Weekly Shonen Jump, até Maio de 2006. Mais tarde, a história do mangá foi adaptada para um anime desenvolvido pela Madhouse e dirigido por Tetsuro Araki, composto por 37 episódios.\
//Com algum Spoiler a partir daqui\
Várias publicações de mangás, animes e outros meios de comunicação têm elogiado e criticado a série, de modo geral. A série foi banida na China devido a vários problemas com crianças que alternavam os cadernos por se parecerem um Death Note. Também existe filmes feitos por americanos e por japoneses .Os filmes japoneses são uma trilogia enquanto que os americanos foram diretamente adaptados a partir do material do mangá e não seguiu a história das adaptações dos filmes japoneses.Os filmes japoneses chamam-se..\
- Death Note Rewrite (Basicamente conta a primeira parte do anime até ao L)\
- Death Note Rewrite 2 - L wo Tsugu Mono (Já este conta do Near/Mello até ao final do anime). Também existe mesmo \"Death Note o Filme\" que conta os eventos principais, Death Note The Last Name e \"L: Chance the World\" que é o terceiro filme da trilogia japonesa(retratado diretamente da novel).\
Existe 3 jogos baseados no anime e todos são para a consola Nintendo DS.\
Existe muitas coisas que não percebi no anime como por exemplo...Nós sabemos que Kira era um psicopata, que matou inocentes só pra se mostrar o melhor, usando as pessoas erradas. L é o melhor no confronto entre eles os dois, pois no caso KIRA trabalhou praticamente sozinho , e no geral foi Light quem precisou de ajuda.\
Acho que isso não torna \"Kira\" melhor. Mas independentemente disso, queria saber tipo ouve uma altura em que Light e  L estavam a jogar ténis, e durante o jogo, L descobriu que Light era o Kira, ou seja, trazendo isso para uma perspectiva real, acho que é impossível descobrir uma identidade assassina de uma pessoa num mero jogo.\
E no episódio 1 quando L ameaça Light do falso L (Lind L.Taylor) Light cai nessa armadilha, fazendo-se desmascarar no caso .Ou seja, o anime podia parar em 12 episódios, perfeitamente legítimos, sendo não necessário Near e Mello. Também acho que a Misa foi uma personagem secundária que apareceu só para dar vida ao anime e dar aquele toque \"sexy\", porque no geral o anime é uma espécie de rivalidade entre Light e L, não era preciso na minha opinião tantos episódios para provar isso. No entanto acho que, como o anime fez tanta fama penso que os 37 episódios encaixam bem no puzzle, porque existirá sempre pessoas (público-alvo) do lado do Light e pessoas (como eu) do lado do L. Também acho que L não devia morrer no anime, porque a história baseia-se na justiça e eu acho que justiça não é matar os nossos amigos ou entes-queridos porque isso não faz sentido.\

    If you watch anime, I highly suggest that you watch Death Note. It is a story about detectives, serial killers, Shinigami, and apples. With such an outrageous premise, you might think that Death Note is kind of ridiculous or that it might have sloppy storytelling. No, Death Note is a clean, dark, and serious drama.\
I give the story a 10 out of 10. When I was watched Death Note, the story went where I thought it would go. It was predictable, most stories follow a certain flow. But when it counted, Death Note would swiftly take a turn and take the story in a place\
          \
        that I did not expect and I loved it. There was never really a moment in the story where I would think \"Well, that was kind of dumb\". No, if anything I constantly thinking \"What's going to happen next?\" or \"What's happening?\" followed by \"WOW\" or \"I didn't expect that\"\
The characters are unique and memorable. I give them a 10 out of 10. Light is a genius student who over the course of the show becomes more sinister and deviant. As you watch the show, you'll just start to think \"Is he really going to win?\" There is also the young and intelligent detective,  L, who is the antagonist of the anime. L is a genius who is in a constant mental war with Light. And like Light, you are going to ask yourself, \"Is he really going to win?\"\
It's an enjoyable show. Death Note is pretty much just a battle of minds between Light and L, but the way the show carries and presents the battle, you'll enjoy it as much as you would a physical fight. \
Overall the series is a 10 out of 10. Sure, it's not perfect. But whether you love it or hate it, you have to admit that Death Note is an important part of anime and the otaku culture.\

    Story: 9/10. What i love about this anime is the utter mindfuck. This anime is unlike any other i have watched so far and that because its story and characters are highly unpredictable. This anime will definitely blow your mind with its complexity in the little details most people would fail to pick up immediately and the plot twists. One drawback i was able to spot (hence 9/10) is the fact that in one point the outcome felt forced. What i mean by that? Our main rivals were locked into a stalemate battle that dragged long. I believe the writer had to push things and\
          \
        make an outcome. An other thing is that i was a little bit slightly disappointed by the ending. But that's ok. Nothing can be 100% perfect in this life.\
Characters 10/10. Some of the best characters ever in anime. Kira and L are some of the biggest rivals ever existed in all anime and any show. They are both interesting, intelligent, perceptive and cunning. Ryuk is a troll but he is enjoyable. Misa is purposely dumb but that's kind of cute in its own way plus she is being voiced by one of the best female voice actors there is. Apart from the main 4, there are many other introduced characters. Some of them don't stay long in the show but i didn't find even one of them boring.\
Sound 10/10. All characters are excellently voiced and everything is perfectly executed. Soundtrack is top notch.\
Enjoyment 10/10. There was no moment of boredom i can recall. There was no episode without important things happening in it. Plot twists and exciting story elements everywhere combined with well fit music.\
Overall:10/10 I would recommend this anime to EVERYONE. Even people who don't even watch anime.\

    Death Note Review\
THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS\
Story:\
The story of Death Note revolves around a 17 year-old boy called Yagami Light and a Shinigami, whose name is Ryuk. In the Shinigami World, Ryuk was bored and then decided to throw his Death Note to the human world. But what does this notebook do? Well... \"The humans whose name is written in this note shall die.\"\
On the human world, Light catches the notebook, but at first, he thinks it’s just a joke. Despite that, he takes the Death Note, and goes home. \
In order to see if the notebook is real, he writes the name of a man\
          \
        who took eight people (including teachers and students) hostage. After 40 seconds, the man died. \
After that, Yagami starts killing all criminals he \"knows\", and then the police and the world best detective, L, join forces to catch Light, who is later called \"Kira\".\
I honestly think this is probably one of the best animes I have ever watched. This story is just unique and wonderful and to be honest I don’t think that there is anybody out there that actually does not like Death Note. It’s not my favourite anime, but it’s almost. \
The fight between L and Kira it’s just too amazing and brilliant. Tsugumi Ohba really did an wonderful job writing this. I give the story a 10/10.\
\
Art:\
Ok, I don’t know what to say about the art. I really like it. I think L is the one who is better designed. And Ryuk, too. The Kira’s evil look just makes him a badass. There’s not much that I can say about the art on this anime, because, well, you know, I’m not an artist, so the only thing I can do is appreciate it. Therefore, I give the art a 10/10.\
\
Sound:\
THE SOUNDTRACK ON THIS ANIME IS JUST TOO FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!! Every character has an awesome theme. My favourite one is Ryuk’s theme. PERFECT. L’s one is good, too, but, RYUUUUK!!! I also think the seyuus are perfect for ach character. The best seyuu, in my opinion, is Miyano Mamoru, who role plays Light. After saying this, I give sound a 10/10, as well.\
\
Characters:\
This is the best part on this review. I’m going to talk about three characters.\
Yagami Light: He’s my favourite character on this anime. I prefer him as L. I know his methods are not good, and I honestly think he shouldn’t make justice by his own hands, but watching him towards the anime, just made me realize he’s just too perfect. Yes, perfect. He got insane and completely crazy by having power. It’s like the people nowadays get when they have money: crazy. Light felt that, being such an intelligent person, he would always won. And that’s right, he’s intelligent as hell, but he didn’t won. Which obviously makes me sad, I wanted Light to win. Evil never wins, and that’s a shame. Sometimes things aren’t all sweet and pink. But he couldn’t win in this case. He would get killed by Ryuk at any time, even if he had won. Despite all this facts, Light’s just THE man.\
L Lawliet: I love L. I really do. When I first watched the anime, I didn’t like him that much, but after reading the manga, I almost like him more than I like Light. I was really sad when he died, but at the same I was happy cause that would give a chance to Light to finally win and be the God of The New World. Unfortunately, both of them died. Such a big loss to the anime world. L was incredibly intelligent, and he knew, since he met Light, that he was Kira. He just didn’t have enough proof. And it’s kinda sad, cause he saw Light as his friend. I don’t know if he meant it when he said it, but it’s sad, anyways. \
Ryuk: I just wanted to talk about Ryuk cause this guy is my second fave on the anime. I like him to much. On the last episode, the things he were saying while writing Light’s name, almost made me think he kinda \"felt\" for Light. I mean, they were together for 6 years, they went through so many things together. Light learned with him. Ryuk learned with Light. I know he’s is just a Shinigami, and Shinigamis represent pure evil, but... Rem felt for Misa. Jealous felt for Misa. Couldn’t Ryuk have felt for Light, even though he’s not that kind of shinigami? It’s what I think, anyways.\
The others character are good as well. But I have to say this, I HATE Near. I HATE HIM. Despite, I give the characters a 10/10.\
\
Enjoyment:\
I watched this anime in three days, so I really enjoyed watching it. 10/10 obviously.\
Overall:\
After everything I’ve said here, everybody can understand I give Death Note a 10/10. I really like the anime. One favourites of all time.\

    Death Note was one of the first anime series I've ever watched before and is the one that got me into anime, and making it my favorite anime ever. The story is great, Light Yagami,is a teenager that wants to change the world through a notebook by eradicating the world of crime, has a god complex and is an absolute justice type of character, (Like Akainu from One Piece) and is known to the world as Kira. L, a detective considered to be the world's greatest tries to prevent him from killing anymore criminals since it is still murder. It's L vs Kira, who will\
          \
        win? Most of the time, it's just a cat and mouse game, you never know who will win and it seems at times in the show that Light is so close to getting rid of L and L is close to revealing the identity of Kira. The first opening and ending are some of my favorite in anime and they have great music that goes along with the story. One flaw with Death Note is that there is enough character development except for L and Light. There's average development for Misa and others, but nothing great. There was never a dull moment in Death Note, and all 37 episodes were great. Overall, I give Death Note a perfect 10 out of 10, and highly recommend it. But if it were me, I would have ended it at Episode 25, because the second season killed it.\

    There is hardly any anime enthusiast who hasn’t seen Death Note and it has more than enough spoiler-less reviews. But what I feel the need of for this anime is a full fledged analysis of its accomplishments. And so, here I am trying to do that very thing. And since I’m going to have to point out several significant plot points and twists as examples, this review-esque prose will contain heavy amount of spoilers. If you’re one of those who haven’t yet seen the anime, I suggest doing so before reading this.\
A HUGE SPOILER ALERT!! AGAIN, JUST IN CASE\
Death Note is mostly popular for its\
          \
        thrills and moral ambiguity which are apparent to superficial views. But the anime has much more thematic execution than what meets the casual eyes. Having a brilliant and multilayered exploration of ‘Justice’, stagnation vs hypocrisy, commentaries on religion, society and so much more, Death Note is a densely packed thematic piece. Let’s dive into the elaboration on how it explores these topics.\
It’s a common complaint about Death Note that the anime forces ideals through the viewers’ throats. But the anime actually does nothing of that sort. It rather beholds many ideals through its characters to study those ideologies and evaluate them. It showcases the fallacies in their senses of justice. Light tries to rid the world of evil by becoming a murderer who kills bad people, L tries to stop Kira using some underhanded methods, Near cheats as well.\
The anime compares between conflicting ideals to choose what is better. Light may be a hypocrite, but his hypocrisy is actually cleansing the world which is evident from the 70% drop in crime rate and the complete halt of wars. L, with his own sense of justice pursues Light/Kira using suspicious budget and unorthodox methods, which is hypocritical as well. L succeeded to close in on him until he tried having a criminal use the notebook in order to confirm the ’13 Days’ rule. He pushed too far with his hypocrisy with this and the world couldn’t allow such hypocrisy overtake the one that is improving the world; and thus he was gotten rid of in episode 25, right before he could execute his plan.\
Having defeated the greatest detective in the world, Light’s megalomania and God-complex grew bigger and he became more conceited. He had planned from the beginning to force people into doing good deeds with threats, but he was sure to do it after his final confrontation with Near. If he won, he’d have no one to stop him from forcing his ideals onto the world. This time, Light’s ideal was more dangerous than it was beneficial to the world and so the world decided that it’s better without him anymore. Thus, even though Near’s hypocrisy was even bigger than L’s, he defeated Kira, using that very hypocritical strategy.\
In the last encounter of Near and Light, Near cheated by using the real notebook himself. When he found the notebook Mikami had hidden thanks to Mello’s sacrifice, he used it in order to keep Mikami’s actions restricted in the final encounter. By writing Mikami’s name on the real notebook, he had him bring the fake notebook that Mikami made himself. Near lied when he said that Giovanni made a complete replica in a single night and it was quite obvious (as if anyone can perfectly replicate the whole notebook with all the names and death conditions in one night). There are more proofs for this.\
If you don’t want to read through the thorough explanation of this particular point (which is gonna be BIG), you can skip through to the sign I put up in capital letters to indicate the end of the explanation.\
https://animetropolisblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/output_bxmgrn.gif?w=1000\
If you carefully notice in that^ gif, when Near showed Light that Mikami also wrote Takada’s name in the note, he (Near) used the notebook Mikami brought with himself, evident from the names of task force and SPK members. But he also claimed that the notebook is completely fake. So why would he show the notebook he himself claimed to be fake? Near carefully avoided opening the real notebook because Mikami’s name was written in it and he couldn’t risk the task force members seeing that for obvious reasons. This brings up the next question.\
Why didn’t Near just write Mikami’s name and death condition on a piece of the notebook? The anime provides an answer for that as well. We see that Near asked Ryuk in the end if writing a name on a scattered piece of the notebook works or not. In other words, he wasn’t sure whether doing that would serve his purpose or not. And he obviously couldn’t take a risk on such an important event, therefore, wrote Mikami’s name and specifics of death inside the real notebook instead of a torn piece of it.\
Speaking of torn pieces, there is a complaint I used to have against Death Note’s ending. Why didn’t Light just suggest Mikami to keep a hidden piece like he does himself, only to use it for this final encounter? This complaint was resolved once I found out about Near’s cheating and realized that he actually did suggest Mikami to do that. But as Mikami was restricted due to Near using the notebook, he played according to Near’s scenario instead of Light's and used the fake notebook instead of the hidden piece. This possibility of a hidden piece is another reason why Near had to cheat in order to ensure his survival and victory.\
While I don’t have any concrete proof of the existence of such hidden piece, it does make a lot of sense this way and Light’s behavior backs up this argument. When he saw that nobody died and got exposed, Light first thought of the possibility that Mikami might have betrayed him, which is only possible if there was a hidden piece that Mikami didn’t use. Later on, Light was screaming at Mikami to write down everyone’s name even though he (Mikami) was already caught. While this was shown like a desperate scream of someone who lost his composure, it’s actually him ordering Mikami to use the hidden piece because there was still a chance since Mikami’s hidden piece wasn’t discovered yet. Light trying to write Near’s name right before that acts as an appropriate foreshadowing of it.\
Near using the notebook is nothing out of the blue. He previously did propose that he’d be willing to write names in the notebook to test the rules, so it’s not surprising that he did it in the final confrontation. Mikami’s behavior was also weird and out of character, thus supporting the possibility of Near’s cheating further. For Near, it was a last minute call that he had to make, or they’d be completely defeated. After getting his hands on the notebook thanks to Mello’s efforts, he couldn’t overlook the possibility that a hidden piece could be functional and so had to cheat and restrict Mikami in order to ensure Kira’s fall.\
We also see Misa Amane standing on the edge of a high building’s roof in the very end, clearly giving a sign of an upcoming suicide and her body language pretty much confirms it. While it’s quite possible that she committed suicide after knowing of Lights’s demise, her death can very well be Near’s work. But as we know that she had forfeited the ownership and all, so why would she have to die? Well, while it is true that Near isn’t sure about that and had to make sure that Kira is gone for good, there’s another strong reason.\
At first, I wasn’t sure if she could be useful to Light in the final encounter, but the possibility isn’t zero. Then I came across this interesting video, which provides a pretty interesting theory regarding how Light could’ve come out victorious in the final battle. While I don’t agree with the context of the video, it gave me a new field for thinking. It's NEARly impossible to summarize the video here because I still have lots of other things to talk about. So I'll just link it here and I hope that the moderators would be kind enough to allow this for the sake of articulation.\
https://youtu.be/_j58ZQSf1vA\
Now, the reason I don’t agree with this video is because it assumes that Light didn’t actually make that plan (and I honestly don’t blame the one who made the video for that, considering how subtle the anime is). While I don’t know if the writers of the series had this plan in mind, but Light just might’ve made that plan and act accordingly. And that is why restraining Misa Amane by using the notebook was a must. With that being done, there is now no way that Light’s plan will be executed. It makes perfect sense this way and has enough hints as evidences to back it up, therefore I like to think that my interpretation is correct.\
THIS IS THE END OF THE EXPLANATION OF DEATH NOTE'S ENDING. WE CAN TAKE IT SLOW NOW xd\
In case you forgot what we were initially doing with this explanation, we were looking up Near's hypocrisy and its importance. Death Note judged Near's hypocritical course of action to be better for its world than Light's since he became too megalomaniac. While it's quite obvious that defeat in this anime means rejection and victory means acceptance, the anime also provides direct evidence of this. The task force members were discussing whether Kira really is evil or justice in the latter part of the story, where Light said, \"if Kira wins, he's justice. And if he loses and gets caught, he's evil\". While this statement is a fantastic commentary on how the world works, it also proves that success means acceptance; and I love how it's perfectly harmonized with the narrative flow.\
Before we get to the main thematic punch of the show, let's look at another way DN takes to explore the theme, through the deconstruction of ‘Religion’. It applies the basics of the idea of ‘Religion’ like the dogma, the ideal, the Messiah (Kira), the punishment for breaking principles (death in different ways), Messiah’s miracle (the notebook) and even the Messenger Angel (with black wings) who brings the Messiah the news of his selection; in its own way to fit in the setting. But they’re applied in a manner that extracts a different coherent essence from these elements that ultimately weaves into a different context, which makes this anime a successful deconstruction in essence. But that would all be pointless if it didn’t bear commentaries on how fear is an asset used for strengthening religions. The deconstruction could also have been my mere overthinking if there weren’t appropriately used symbolism and religious imagery connecting to the idea of religion, which confirms the intention of said deconstruction.\
By going through all these, Death Note shows us that true justice doesn't exist and therefore every ideals of justice is filled with hypocrisy. But even so, the anime accepts them because these hypocritical justice is still better than leaving the world be. It tells us that a functioning hypocrisy is better than stagnant sincerity. Or so it seemed until the last episode where it turns the table. By having Light defeated, Death Note returns its world to its previous free form (except the world is much cleaner now).\
Death Note, embodying ‘utilitarianism’, doesn’t side with any ideal but rather chooses what’s best for its world. And it tells us that stagnation can be the better choice as well, depending on the situation. What Death Note encourages, however, is having one’s own sense of justice, as every other characters had displayed throughout the anime. The ending where Aizawa and the rest rejected Near’s ways of doing things, and chased after Light as he tried to run away, that moment sealed the final deal. It culminates the entirety of Death Note’s thematic journey.\
Death Note's story executes these thematic punches as if there's some entity or system that is evaluating the characters' ideals and overseeing the entire process. As if the anime has a consciousness of itself. A consciousness that controls what happens in the world, a true God. The anime is shown from the perspective of such entity and that's why the series has such overwhelming atmosphere all through. It's as if the consciousness is watching everything from the perspective that seems the most intriguing.\
And we viewers watch the anime through this perspective. In a sense, the anime is inviting us to be the judge of what this anime provides. It's also along the line of Death Note's main theme, having our own sense of judgement through considering the merits and demerits. Rather than forcing ideals through viewers' throats, this anime encourages to have our own, so I found the complaint I addressed earlier to be quite misleading. The theme is quite intricately explored throughout the series little by little.\
But even after all these, I can't call Death Note just a theme driven story. It is both theme driven and plot driven. Death Note's story is never influenced by a deus ex machina device, but rather flows in its own stream. Each point of the story has a buildup and proper transition from its previous incidents. Even the most insignificant details are properly set.\
For example, Light meeting Naomi Misora in the police station when she was trying to get through to L may seem a bit too convenient. But it actually follows up the earlier events perfectly. Light needed to go to the station for gathering information on how the task force is reacting to the 12 FBI agents getting killed. And his father couldn't come home because of that incident as it made things complicated. So Light went there in the pretense of bringing him a change of clothes.\
And Naomi Misora was there because her fiance was one of the 12 agents. The timing makes complete sense as she also took some time to investigate things and coming to the conclusion. Also it's not like she just went there exactly when Light went. By her conversation with the receptionist, it's obvious she's been bargaining for a meetup for quite a while. So even calling that convenient would be stretching it way too far and every other shows would be so much more guilty of plot contrivances.\
That was just one example from the top of my head. Every bit of the anime is well thought to such degree. What makes it especially great is the fact that it's constantly climactic, which is quite daring and rare. Death Note is masterful at creating critical situations. There are several key moments and ingenious twists in every episode, making it a fast paced enticing experience all through.\
Its play of inevitability is one of the best in all of storytelling medium, as the story's situations are always so critical that the characters must choose the best or the second best plausible option because once chosen, there's no going back in the path. Loopholes in the supernatural rules, technical advantages, political power, using all kinds of resources they have, the characters in this anime proceed with the best or the second best course of actions available to them, in order to defeat the other and win. These tactics are clearly explained through either proper dialogues or subtle visual exposition. While those tactics are mostly unprecedented, logical and ingenious, the few strategies that were already on the table were modified and handled in a clever way in order to adapt to the anime’s situations. It provides the two absolute best tactical showdown I've seen including the ending one that I explained earlier in this essay (the other one being the confinement strategy).\
While the value of the writing is already one of the highest, it becomes unrivaled due to how coherent it is to the theme. There are many routes for the story to follow and picking one of them while closing off the rest without any inconsistency and contrivance  is a challenging task itself. But Death Note elevates that challenge by several times by having the story follow a specific theme and executing it with absolutely masterful crafting. The brilliant handling of the characters' information/knowledge, improvising and strategies works so well for the theme but is never forced or manipulated in any way. There are cases where things don't always go as planned due to accidents or mistakes, but they're never contrived and they feel very natural when they happen.\
It's really perplexing how it does all these with proper transition from one point to the other.\
Death Note is a concisely stylized piece with expositions making even some silly parts look cool, but those silliness hold some serious points underneath. For example, that \"I'll take a potato chip and EAT IT!\" part was stylized as such because Light really was using the chips as a cover while skillfully beating L's surveillance system. One of the things that makes Death Note so constantly exciting is the fact that it chooses not to give much screen-time to unnecessary and boring points. For example, Light's decision to use the notebook actually took several days of consideration which is shown through some quick shots of him thinking about it and reaching enlightenment. Another example of this is when Near picks Mikami out of all the videos of Kira related programs, which may seem too contrived and fast while in actuality, the shot composition clearly implies that he gave a lot of time going through all the tapes before realizing that Mikami, the perfect choice for X-Kira appears in so many places.\
This anime has some very good use of metaphors and symbolism throughout. One of them being the lights, which is used for capturing the enlightenment I just mentioned along with some more in several other places. I literally wrote a whole article about some more visual and narrative cues from this anime in my blog. These fill up the holes in the story and the characterization. Coupled with the narrative perspective I mentioned regarding the atmosphere, these make the narrative and visual style of Death Note one of the top tier I've seen.\
Being an anime where deaths, murders and police works are the main focus, people often tend to overlook some really striking emotional moments when talking about Death Note. Souichiro's last moments, the moments before Light's death, L's death, Naomi Misora's death are some of the obvious emotional moments, but parts like Aizawa's emotional crisis after leaving the investigation team, L having Light spill out why he seems suspicious from L's perspective, that foot massage, those moments on the roof, Aizawa and Ide appearing to assist the arrest of Higuchi, Light's defeat to Mello's gang, etc. were some strikingly emotional moments as well. The whole show was thoroughly impacting if we include the exciting points. The minimal exposition of emotions most of the time makes those few focused moments much more valuable.\
What I said so far covers parts of Death Note's characterization. Each characters have enough consistent character traits and act human. They all show a wide range of actions and interactions while never betraying their character writing. There were subtle little developments to the characters which wasn't quite too much, and it makes sense since they're mostly grown ups and people don't quite change much. Light Yagami had the most development as he got more and more megalomaniac.\
What the characters have though, are fantastic interactions and mutual influence on each others. \"Also, as soon as I said we knew he was in Kanto region, in defiance he made sure that his next victims came from within Japan, as if to say ‘what are you gonna do about it?'\"- this explanation by L highlights how L and Kira were having such intriguing interactions before they even met each other. The development of their interaction is consistent and well written, which, while being a cat and mouse chase at the surface, has considerable psychological depth in its encounters.\
Having said all that, the characters of Death Note is not one of its stronger points. Madhouse did brilliant job with the production of the anime. Stunning visuals is accompanied well by one of the best sets of soundtracks in anime. One of Death Note's most impressive aspects is how it connects every one of its accomplishments with each other. The story writing, themes and characters are directly connected to each other, the theme connects to the narrative perspective which in turns connects to the atmosphere, which is also connected with the story's climax.\
It's done so skillfully that the coherence itself becomes a godly feat of this anime. The directing is solid across the board, with some transcending directing choices. The clash of ideals is phenomenal. It has a stellar supernatural lore with perfect rules for the usage of the notebook. Every aspect of it is induced to make it more enjoyable, enthralling and ecstatically overwhelming.\
The anime has some more really good feats but let's stop now, since we've already had enough. There are 10 works of storytelling medium I've come across that deserve 10/10 in my opinion and Death Note is one of them due to all these excellent feats. It's also one of my top 3 personally favorite anime. I'm thoroughly impressed by how ingeniously it handles everything. I consider Death Note to be one of the most intelligent pieces of storytelling medium if not the most intelligent. Among what I've seen so far, that is.\

    Death Note is the first anime that I have ever watched. At the time, I did not consider myself to be a fan of anime in the slightest, and it was my girlfriend that convinced me to give this show a chance. It did not disappoint, and it has changed my view on anime completely.\
I will try my best to keep this review spoiler free, not revealing any major plot points, which could ultimately ruin the show for those yet to watch it. \
I personally feel that the concept of Death Note is unlike anything I had seen created before, giving a good understanding to\
          \
        the viewer about how too much power can corrupt any man. The way that this descent into madness is handled is brilliant, and although the change begins very early in the show, it increases towards the end. The entire show is essentially one big, exciting game of cat and mouse between main characters, Light and L. After a few episodes, you will begin to \"take the side\" of one of these main characters. The show does a fantastic job of providing both sides of the argument positives and negatives. The way that Death Note constantly surprises the viewer is mesmerizing, what you are expecting to happen rarely ever takes place. \
The characters in Death Note are the real selling point of the show. Two completely unique characters, unlike many others in media today. We decide which one we consider to be the protagonist and the antagonist. Both believing that they are fighting for justice, giving these characters their conviction, both feel that they are in the right. Ryuk is a Shinigami, he is responsible for Light being given the Death Note, and throughout the show provides comic relief. I do, however, feel that Ryuk was a bit of a wasted opportunity, and after the first 10 episodes he rarely appears. The concept of the Shinigami World having Death Notes is an interesting one, and I am upset that we did not learn more about it. Later on in the show, we also get to know the character Near, who I feel is an under appreciated character. His personality is very unique, and the actions we see him carry out, in order to find Kira are interesting. He is often seen playing with toys, which depict characters from the show. The show also introduces many other characters, however none of them are nearly as memorable as Light and L. \
Like most people, I have to agree that the show begins to go downhill after episode 25. However, in my opinion, it does not become as awful as some people make it out to be. It is just not up to the same quality as it once was. I thoroughly enjoyed the finale, and feel that most of the loose ends were tied up. If the show were to have had a different ending, similar to that of the live action Death Note films, I feel the show would have received much more praise from viewers.\
As I mentioned earlier, this was the first anime that I ever watched. Due to this, I did not have a great idea of what was good art and what was not. After viewing the art of other anime series, I feel that Death Note has good art for its time of release. However, I do not consider it good enough to be a sole reason to watch the anime. The show has a dark, dull colour palette, matching the theme of the series. We are very rarely shown a landscape of something to be considered \"beautiful\". I found that the show mainly concentrates on the story and the character development. If this is something that interests you, you should love Death Note.\
For those interested in watching this anime with the English dub, it will not disappoint. There is not a single character who's voice does not suit them. The English voices of Light, L, Ryuk and Near are my personal favourites.\
Overall, I feel I would rate Death Note 9/10. Almost everything about it is perfect, however as mentioned before, it does begin to go downhill later on in the show. If the plot were to have been altered, so that the second half did not occur, I feel this would raise my score to 10/10.\

    Have you ever thought about the way the world is now? Have you seen it in a positive light or a negative light? Have you ever thought about how you can change the world you're living in, for what you think is the better? Then one day, you find yourself with an unlikely weapon which you use to change the world.\
Welcome to one of the most critically-acclaimed anime in the world, \"Death Note\".\
The story begins with Light Yagami, a 17-year-old high school student who is basically bored with his entire life. One day, he notices a mysterious, black notebook literally fall from the sky. Of\
          \
        course, since Light is human, this particular notebook piques his curiosity. This particular notebook is labeled \"Death Note\", and according to what is said inside of the Death Note, anyone whose name is written in it will die. Light initially thinks that it's fake, but he discovers it's real after testing it out. Now, aided by the Shinigami Ryuk (who was the one who dropped the Death Note into the human realm in the first place), Light sets out to create a \"better\" world by using his Death Note to \"punish\" criminals. Meanwhile, as all of these deaths are happening, the police, aided by a man known only as L, try to catch the man behind the deaths, who are known to them as \"Kira\".\
I don't know if I even need to explain all this, though. If you haven't at least heard of Death Note, I don't know if I can say that you're a true anime fan. (No offense intended.) It was through all this hype that I was finally tempted to watch Death Note myself. Now, after watching all 37 episodes, I know what all of the hype is about.\
Let me start by talking about the story. It's clear that the story is the strongest point of Death Note. It's a suspenseful story with lots of twists and turns. Although some parts of the story had been spoiled to me even before I started watching it (for example, the way it ends), that did not stop me from not being able to really guess what I didn't already know. Thus, I can't say I hate the story at all, even if some parts of it were ruined for me.\
Now, the characters. There was quite a number of interesting characters in this series, but were ALL of them likable? Of course not. In fact, some of Light's actions left me really hating him. Yeah, I just said I don't like Light, who is the protagonist whom the viewers are supposed to be following all of the way. Think about it, though; while it's great that he punishes criminals, he also makes the loved ones of those criminals sad. What's worse, he hardly feels any remorse toward them. Then, you've got L, who is basically Light's opponent. While I didn't know exactly what to think of him at first, I eventually grew to like him. What happens to him in the anime, which I refuse to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, really was a shame.\
The animation was rather well done; it really gives off the intense atmosphere there is most times. All of the opening and ending themes were pretty awesome, too, especially the first opening. It matched the anime very well for the time that it was the opening theme. I should probably mention that I was watching the English dub for Death Note. The voice actors did an excellent job, especially (believe it or not) Brad Swaile as Light.\
For the amount of time that I spent watching Death Note, I can say that I greatly enjoyed it. It's a suspenseful police drama that is not all that predictable unless you were giving spoilers for it. I guess the series getting spoiled for me was what killed some of my enjoyment. Even so, the hype for Death Note is well worth it; I'd say you give it a try. Oh, and while you watch it, try taking a potato chip and eating it. (You'll catch the reference soon enough.)\

    Death Note is a Japanese manga series created by writer Tsugumi Ohba and manga artist Takeshi Obata which was adapted into an anime and directed by Araki, Tetsurou and produced by Maruyama, Masao. It centers on Light Yagami, a high school student who discovers a supernatural notebook, the titular \"Death Note\" or \"Desu Noto\". This notebook grants the ability to kill anyone whose name is written. The series follows Light's subsequent efforts to create a criminal-free world using this extra ordinary notebook, and the efforts of a detective known as L or (Lawliet L.) to stop him.\
Death Note was first serialized in 108 chapters by\
          \
        Shueisha in the Japanese manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. The anime series aired October 3, 2006, to June 26, 2007. Consist of 37 episodes.\
Death Note brings you to the mood of critical thinking and intelligence, which will make you think over and over again.\
It has a great plot that insures you to get your characters from Point-A to Point-Z. \
Creating a new world with your own hands isn't fair enough, bringing up the fact that no one has the right to judge anyone and that what is Desu Noto is all about.  Story relation with its own viewer is really epic; it permits you to solve the puzzle first before it reveals what really happens in the series.\
This is a good example of what is psycho thriller was all about.\
Exceptional art for Death Note was implemented resulting into a masterpiece series when it comes to anime & character illustration. Supposed to be that the anime story is in a classic theme still the latest art was implemented in a really nice way, also I love the art for some scenes when Yagami Light is talking to himself where he turns to be a red colour Yagami. Not only that, Lawliet L was the highlight for this series (for me) when it comes to the art section.\
Sound, there’s nothing really special here as usual hardcore music are being implemented when it comes to psycho and supernatural series. The one that caught my attention here are the voice actors/actresses they did a great job to personalize and to illustrates the visualization for each character. Lawliet L. was the most impressive here when it comes to voice acting. Performed by (Japanese) voice actor Yamaguchi Kappei. \
About the character well, I've already said it earlier that characters are impressive either personalization & visualization. Each of them has a unique characteristic. Let say for example, Lawliet L. the way he moves is really strange and very intriguing, answering the phone and reading something in an unusual way spiced up the whole series. This also applies to \"Near\" as well which are very entertaining.\
\
Well I really enjoyed this one, the fact that you are also involved with the story spice you up on what is going to happen next. You might get to the point that you want to play it in a fast forward mode.\
So overall I gave it a mark of 9/10, which means it is almost perfect to me, because I've never scored 10/10 as many of us would not agree since we have our own preferences.\

    (contains spoilers, read at your own risk.  YOU have been warned)\
This review is strictly reserved for the critique of the second half of the show.  Most of us will agree the first half is basically flawless, so why concentrate your time dissecting something perfect?  Especially since  you can write a lot more based on the unbalanced second half.  \
I do admit that the second half isn't nearly as well done as the first half, mostly because they obviously shoe horned a convenient plot twist so that Kira would lose after all.  And in a way, i could see how\
          \
        that pissed people off, me included. I agree with that sentiment; albeit, I don't think we should write off Near and his minions off just yet.  They are done very well with a very emotional and interesting past to them, enough so to keep them relevant and wanting to find out more, and you have to give it to them - the back story to L's and Near life make the second half worth it.  Another part that was very well done was the death of Kiras' dad. \
Why is the second half panned so much?  To me it really feels like Near didn't live up to the expectation of L and that Kira was beaten so lightly, when he had to go around hoops against L.  Either way, I feel the second half could of been approached better or maybe at least reserved for an OVA or something later, but it definitely doesn't warrant the notoriety it gets.\
I guess my only major gripe about the second half is they got ride of the bad-ass opener for something not as bad-ass, but some b.s. emo-fashioned esque opener that was just straight up lame.  \

    Death Note, what a ride.\
This series is one that after watching i would most definitely recommend to anyone, the suspense and heart-stopping thrills that this program provides is unrivaled by most any other anime and leads the viewers to construct active thought processes on what they support and believe in when developing this stand-off between two different ideals on the state of the world and the lengths to which it is ok to truly think that you are making the world a better place. A real thought-provoker which maintains the attention of viewers and keeps them enthralled on the edge of their seats.\
Story (10)\
The way\
          \
        the story is developed in this anime is one of those elements which really makes it what it is, outstanding. Death Note is one of those anime where you really feel like you have to be paying full attention at all times so as not to miss anything which is going on. As previously mentioned, the story really engages the audience in such a way that they find themselves re-thinking the way they view the world and the associated belief systems that they have in place. I would agree with all those who say that that the first half of the show is the most exciting half, but this doesn't mean that the other half is automatically bad, in fact, it still has that same compelling style of story-telling and continues a well executed story all the way to the final episode.\
Art(8)\
The art in Death Note is not a pushover, while at first upon viewing the first couple episodes i was rather critical of the art, i came to see the art design brought into this anime as one which is extremely effective, and the use of a dark colour pallet helped to re-reinforce the \"dark\",\"evil\" plot and story and allow the viewers to immerse themselves in the life of Yagami Light and his interactions with the World around him.\
Sound (7)\
So i am giving the sound in the anime 7/10 and this is even with me being someone who doesn't really understand the appeal of heavy metal or music where people just vent their rage. The first opening and ending audio tracks worked very well for me, (well at least the opening) but then the other tracks i found myself having to skip through them each episode because i couldn't stand them, but even so, if you are like me and can't stand that variation of music, don't worry! The rest of the anime is amazing\
Character (10)\
The characters, along with the story, are just sensationally put together in a way that brings the audience into the story and allows them to see the views and ideals of different sets of people and their justifications, it is perfect.\
What i love so much about these characters, is that not only are they perfectly voiced by the voice-actors (especially Mamoru Miyano voicing Yagami Light), but trust me as someone who has watched this anime, you will come to both love and despise some of these characters, and even better, it leads to different viewers having alternate thoughts on who they support. The characters are all unique, interesting and original (like the battle between L and Light, showing two separate kinds of character) and further enhances the reason why the characters make this anime so thrilling to watch\
Overall\
My final score for Death Note is 9 out of 10, an amazing anime defined by it's unique characters and immersive story, if you are reading this review and haven't yet decided/started to watch it, please, just go do it. You won't regret it :D\

    Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. - Friedrich Nietzsche\
Death Note is a thriller of the highest order, I'm sure Dean Koontz, Stephen King and Naoki Urasawa are proud of Tsugumi Ohba's accomplishment within the genre of supernatural/psychological thriller. I also saw somewhere on the web that a person listed Death Note's genre as chess master, I feel that is a fitting description as well. \
When I watched Death Note the first time the only animations I had previously\
          \
        seen were a Gundam and Initial D; that is to say I had no idea what anime was about. Boy was I taken by surprise by the very dense philosophical questioning the watcher is subjected to. I felt as though the questions of morals and values, of right and wrong, were intense enough to allow for personal growth in the audience. We know reality TV doesn't lead to personal growth but the same can be said for most fiction. Point being that it is a rarity to see television that can be a catalyst for psychological or philosophical growth, thank you Death Note for keeping it real within the realm of the unreal.... fiction.\
I enjoyed Death Note, I was displeased with the ending, but let us be honest. It only could've ended one way, and so that is the way it ended. \
Best Attempt at being Spoiler Free.\
Story: The beginning is flawless, dark and smooth. As the story becomes more complex it becomes more desirable until \"N\" No one likes \"N\". There is even redemption to \"M,\" but none for \"N\". I didn't love how it all ultimately went down, but I am of the belief that it had to happen that way. \
Art: Very Good, no coomplaints\
Sound: Both English and Japanese Voice Actors were on point. English Voice Actors were really on point all things considered.\
Characters: Light, L, Ryuk, Misa Misa and others were all fantastic. But no one likes \"N\"\
Enjoyment: Excellent, drags at the end, but still excellent and definitely worth seeing through.\
Overall: 10, a top anime, I don't think that's a refutable statement \

    One of the best shows I've ever seen in my life. \
STORY:\
The story is clever and it focuses on many philosophical themes and ethical dilemmas. The think I like the most is that it's surprisingly easy to understand and follow if you think about it a little.\
CHARACTERS:\
The show focuses on the rivalry of three characters, Light, L, and Near. Light is obviously the protagonist but his actions will make you think about his morals so you will find yourself siding with his archrival L a lot of times which means that those characters are well written and their motivations are legit and believable.\
ART:\
The show was\
          \
        produced by madhouse so it looks amazing. The characters look and move great, the shinigami are gorgeous and the visual symbolism is great.\
SOUND:\
Voice Acting:\
The actors the got do their jobs amazingly. Especially the actor who plays Light. I've heard him in a lot of works and he has become one of my favourite voice actors. Such a talented lad.\
Soundtrack: The soundtrack is greate. It fits with each scene and sets the mood perfectely. The composer was very versatile and included both calm subtle and huge epic tracks. The opening themes were also great tunes and I loved the symbolism in the opening animation.\
VERDICT: A very smart, well produced show. Highly recomended.\

    Eh, no ones going to read this because theres already millions of reviews of Death Note.\
Anyway, this has GOT to be in my top 10 (or 20) list of best anime EVER mainly because it was my first ever gateway anime. Also because I found the story to be completely ground-breaking compared to anything I had ever seen before. I literally felt like a caveman discovering fire for the first time.\
The plot, the suspense, the excitement, the thrill...oh yeah, this anime is truly a binge watcher's galore. \
The soundtrack is great and perfectly fit every scene in the anime. (It is a mixture of electronic\
          \
        indie rock and the occasional orchestra stuff for the epic scenes).\
For people who are new to anime, I SERIOUSLY recommend that you watch Death Note first mainly because of the crime/thriller/super natural genre, which MAY be easy to digest by a wide variety of audiences. Also because it doesn't have that much fan service which an outsider may find a bit weird or off putting at first.\

    Story:\
Ok I will say right now, this anime has one of the most griping stories I have seen in a long time.  Right from the start, the strikingly original plot sucks you in, to deliver a very satisfying story that will keep the viewer hooked from the start. Why is the story lower than everything else?  Well, lets just say the story kinda takes a turn for the worst about 2/3 of the way through, but pulls through in the end, delivering one of the most epic endings to anything I have ever seen\
Art: The art in Death Note actually is not utilized\
          \
        that much.  Most of this series is based on talking (Which is not a bad thing, seeing as the talking on this anime is actually much more exiting than the few action scenes in this show :P)  The few action scenes though, are really well animated and probably took up 90% of the animation budget, and its well worth it.  The character models look stunning, from the groomed, suave, genius Light Yagami, to the messy, skinny, detective with poor people skills, and dress attire resembling the modern day stereotype of an Otaku, they all look very well animated, and somewhat realistic (L's hair 0_0)\
Sound: The opening and closer themes of this series are all nice to listen to, and are a good precursor to this gripping series.  The music in the show is...well over the top is an UNDERSTATEMENT!  In most scenes there are just a creepy chant playing in the background, but when the series gets into one of its action scenes, the music switches to over the top, orchestrated pieces of goodness that redefine the word epic.\
Overall: Death note is an extremely gripping tale that will leave you glued to your seat through most of it.  Despite a few story problems, this series is a must-see for most anime fans, and will also even get not anime fans into it.\

    When I first watched Death Note, I was like \"OMG! This is the best anime ever!\" and I still think it is. But every anime has its downfall. In case of Death Note, it's the second half of the story.The first half was so ridiculously good, that I just couldn't give the show a bad score. But, the second is becoming nonsense and not really brilliant anymore.\

Story\
The story is very well thought. I mean, it's very smart, entertaining and it makes you addicted to Death Note at first view. The second half of the story ruined it a bit.\

Art\
I think it looks good, well drawn\
          \
        and all that.\

Character\
The characters are all really smart in the anime, you can really understand them as if you read a book. None of them showed stupidity like in other anime except for minor criminals of course, but they're not important.\
Everyone seems...how can I say this? Real? Yeah, they seems like real people, they act how we should more or less.\

Enjoyment\
Enjoy the first half ofthe story and say farewell the second half if you don't want to be deceived.\

Overall\
Well, a must-watch anime. Watch it, enjoy it, and stop before the second half of the story starts.\

    Spoilers ahead. If you want an anime filled with mystery, tension as well as mind evoking moments just like myself, this is perfect for you. Death Note is a compelling, well written and unique story able to combine story, art, music and characters to create a masterpiece like no other before.\
Story-10/10\
A truly outstanding story. Thrilling enough to have me off the edge of my seat at times. The interaction between the main cast, the dialogue and a considerable amount of plot twists was what made it so special. Even if the second part of the series is much weaker than the first one, it still\
          \
        makes you completely engaged to the story. The main character was what made it so exceptional, as he was unlike any others I had ever seen in other shonen manga. Light Yagami plays the role of the main antagonist, trying to outmanoeuvre and manipulate innocent people by killing them, just for the completion of his own goals. It adds more interest and tension to the viewers, as we slowly find ourselves questioning how an honour student becomes an A class serial killer in such a short time.\
Characters-10/10\
Amazing characters, with an unforgettable main cast. The reason the second part of the story was considerably weaker was mainly because of L's replacement with Near, who I absolutely despised at that point of time. It just shows you how complex and mysterious L's character was, as his ''friendship'' with Light grew stronger. The game between a psychotic killer and a hero certainly makes you hooked on your TV screen, as it slowly makes you rethink which side you should choose. Like a game of chess, it's unpredictable, it mind boggles your mind until you make your final decision about who the winner should be. And when you find out who wins, you stare at the board in awe. That is exactly how I felt when L died, except for a moment I didn't stare in awe but in disappointment. I could never forgive Near for replacing such a character. But the positives about Light and L made me completely disregard everything negative about Near, and thus this is why I give the character section a perfect score.\
Even if I find L's character to be better than Light's, I find myself questioning whether he is my favourite or not. The answer to this question changes every single day, as I really can't decide who is better between them. I would really like to choose L, but I always find myself picking up Light. That's because I can relate to Light more on a personal level. And also because villainous characters are kind of my ''fetish''.\
Secondary characters are excellent. Misa's personality might be annoying for some people but I find her perfect as a comic relief character, at least for this kind of anime. As a shinigami, Ryuk plays a fantastic role, same with the Task Force members.\
Art-10/10\
For a shonen anime the art is outstanding. The animation is probably one of the greatest points about the series, as not only does it capture the scenery perfectly, but it also makes every character move fluently. Despite the minimal movement, every action scene is animated perfectly. Epic scenes like ''I'll take a potato chip and eat it!'' will make you hyperventilate from excitement and pure satisfaction!!!\
Sound-10/10\
Low of Solipsism, Kira's theme, L's theme, Near's theme and many many many others will always rest in my Ipod, in the Playlist titled : ''Greatest themes of all time''... nuff said...\
Enjoyment-10/10\
I thoroughly enjoyed Death Note (as you may have guessed)... Before you call me a fan boy, (which I am) I must say that this anime is definitely in my Top 5. \
Recommendations:\
1) Code Geass\
They are both too similar in way too many aspects. Mainly, Lelouch is the next Light Yagami with slight differences...\
2) Hunter x Hunter\
It has nothing to do with Death Note. But this is too, one of the best shonen manga out there. \

    A very nice cartoon this one was. Deaf Newt is a super interesting character study that teaches us how ultimate power corrupts ultimately. But ultimately we already knew this so I don't care about that too much. Hitler already taught that lesson to us so I think we are tired of it.\
Where Death Grips excels is the fantastic cat and mouse game it portrays. Comparable to classics such a Tom and Jerry, this show has a genius display of two geniuses chasing each other down. L and Light are very similar but incredibly different at the same time somehow. Using the concept of the Death\

STORY: 9\
Death Note has a really good plot base. You write people's name on a notebook, they die. Easy. The story goes on perfectly. It has is amount of drama, though you sometimes giggle. It will always keep you watching. Until here, it deserves a 10. But there is a failiure in here: The last 12 episodes. From chapter 25 to almost the end of the anime is quite boring. That's why I give\
          \
        it a 9.\
ART: 7\
Though the charachers' clothes design isn't bad, the art in general isn't outstanding. It has some great points, like using the redish colours for Light Yagami and the blueish for L.\
SOUND: 10\
Music in this anime is amazing. It has the perfect theme for every moment. I usually hear them while I'm studying or doing whatever, actually. Masterpieces.\
CHARACTER: 10\
You'll maybe fall in love with some character. I did. The characters are brilliantly made. The inteligence of the two principal characters is astonishing, and Ryuk the shinigami is quite the icing on the cake. I hated Matsuda, though.\
ENJOYMENT: 9\
As I've already said in the story part, until the episode 25 it was perfect. Then, the enjoyment decreased.\
OVERALL: 9\
Death Note is my favourite anime of all time, maybe because it was the first one I saw. I've watched it eight times. I love it. I recommend it to every single person in the globe.\
Thanks for reading! \

    Intro: Are you a fan of M. Night Shyamalan or movies with cool psychological and intellectual story elements? If so, you've come to the right place. A lot of people tell me that Death Note is one of their favorite anime and after finally watching it, I finally understand why. Not my personal favorite or even in my top twenty, but I had a lot of fun watching this anime. It's a pretty unique story with fun characters to watch as they progress and grow. Now that that's out of the way, let me begin my review. I'll try my best to restrain myself from\
          \
        revealing key information and spoilers, but I might not be able to stop myself. You've been warned! \
Story (7/10):\
     The story begins with our main character Light Yagami. An overly intelligent high school senior in Japan who's unbelievably bored with life.\
One day, as he looks out the window from his class, he sees a mysterious notebook drop from the sky titled \"death note\". He picks it up and reads the instructions when he gets home. The instructions say something along the lines of \"if you write a person's name, that person will die\". That's the main thing you'll need to know. Soon after using the death note, Light meets Ryuk, a shinigami or demon from another world. Ryuk then explains to Light Yagami about the rules of the death note and Light eventually takes on a super cheesy god-complex or alter ego known as Kira. By using the death note, Kira kills criminals and those who are judged as evil according to Kira. Alright, so when I said the story \"was unique\", I might have been semi-exaggerating. The truth is, the whole demons interacting with the human word has been done over and over in anime, but I did take into account that this anime came out in 2006 so I gave it some slack. Anyway, as far as the story goes, be prepared for a lot of surprises and pay attention to detail. This is not an anime for those of you looking for cheap entertainment. Even though the story was thought provoking, there were a few times where situations got repetitive and dull. There were also times where I could guess plot twists before they were revealed. Overall, good story, but bad rhythm. Some episodes felt really long and some felt too short. \
Art(8/10): \
     Before I say anything about the art, keep in mind AGAIN that this anime came out in 2006. So, it's not super beautiful, but it has its moments. For example, I really enjoyed scenes with blood and gore. All the characters were really nice to look at and the colors in every scene were evenly distributed. The moods were set appropriately for almost every scene. Also, I really enjoyed the color schemes for when Light had his inner monologues. I also really enjoyed the art for the intro and outro of every episode. Overall, pretty good art. \
Sound(8/10):\
     I think this might be a tricky category for this anime only because the background music got cheesy some times. I love dramatic music, but it became a little too much to bear at times. EVERY TIME Light had an inner monologue, there would be dramatic music playing super loudly. Sometimes it distracted me from what Light was saying. As far as character voices go, I watched the dub version so I can't say much about the Japanese dubbing. The English dub was amazing though. Probably some of the best English voice acting I've heard in a while. As far as the intro/outro songs go, they were really nice to hear. Overall, pretty good music and voice acting. \
Character(7/10):\
    Another tricky category to judge. Our main character Light Yagami was awesome at first, but eventually got annoying and crazy. I liked him all the way up until halfway through the season. He's an extremely intelligent character and you'll see him overcome some harsh situations. You'll be rooting for him for awhile, but you'll eventually get tired of him. The other important characters like Light's father and Light's girlfriend are pretty rad, but they don't do much in the series. Light's girlfriend is pretty important to the plot, but she's such a dumb bimbo at times that I just want her  to go away. Light's father is probably one of my favorite characters, but I absolutely hate the way the series uses him. Another important character is \"L\", a private investigator who tries to bring Kira --  Light Yagami's alter ego --  to justice. Overall, decent characters.\
Enjoyment(8/10):\
     Despite some of this anime's obvious flaws, I enjoyed watching almost every episode. I was hardly ever bored and when I was, I just pulled through and kept watching. And honestly, the resulting episodes were extremely worth it. Almost every episode plants a seed for later episodes by foreshadowing certain characters, events, objects, etc. There's also a recap at the beginning of every episode so you don't have to watch the whole series in one sitting. Overall, I enjoyed this anime A LOT. \
Overall(7/10):\
    To be quite honest, the only reason I didn't rate this anime any higher was because it got repetitive, obvious and dull sometimes. Not only that, but it was really noticeable when that happened. Anyway, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something intellectual to watch. I had fun watching this series and I don't regret watching it in one sitting.\

    In my opinion, Death Note was an extremely good anime; I feel that the characters were developed very well and the story was easy to get a grasp of. While this itself makes for an engaging plot, what really makes Death Note one of the top series are the characters who cause an obstruction to Light's mission to rid all evil. Topping off the cast is the fan favorite L, whose character is just indescribable. A mysterious but somewhat successful genius, L is probably the only mind that could match the scheming Light. L was infact my favourite detective in the show. I loved everything\
          \
        about his character and the way it was developed. I loved his little habits and flaws that were shown throughout the show that shape him as an individual. The way that L and Light try to get around each others ideas is actually quite funny (not for comedy's sake, actually). This makes you take in every detail and anticipate the next move. \
This is just within the first few episodes when the characters are introduced and we begin to get to know their true colours. The story line is simple so that anyone of any intelligence would be able to follow it, yet many people have a different perspective of the way that L tries to figure things out (I try to say this without spoiling anything).  Additionally, this series offers something that not many other series do. There is no way that we could find out what happens if we used the Death Note ourselves. What if we had a Death Note? Would we use it? \
Would the rules and the concept of it be any different?\
This is the main reason why I like this anime. There are many ways that you can think about it in ways that we will never know whether we were right or wrong.\
However, when I first began watching this anime, I didn't find the plot very complex (in ways, this could be seen as a good thing). Nevertheless, I saw it as very uninteresting to begin with because I felt that there was not much of a purpose to the plot, and I felt that it was going to be very predictable. I was wrong. The plot twists in Death Note are absolutely incredible, as well as the art and the development of the amazing characters is too.\
I literally couldn't stop watching it when I got mid way into the series because I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. Hahaha!\
I recommend this anime to absolutely anyone who can endure something a little more twisted and mysterious. I also agree that this anime could be classed as a little gory towards the end of the show, but anyone who can endure that I think will really enjoy this show. \

    Death Note is a prime example how to start a show in a great way and drive it to the deepest abyss of the green hell. Anime viewers must be way too forgiving - Death Note indeed has a fantastic setup, but quickly declines and people tend to overlook the major flaws this show has. \
The cat and mouse game of Light and L works pretty well and is very entertaining, but the author reached the peak just way too fast. Instaead making the show 12 episodes, it is 37 episodes long. He solves this problem by various \"Deus ex machina\" moments, where something or\
          \
        someone appears completely out of nothing to enhance the story or to make a dramatic plot twist. As a viewer, I just feel cheated. This is poor storytelling. It's outright offensive at times. Considering this happens for a majority of the show, this is a big problem. \
The highly praised of the show really is on a pretty low level. It's a very simple question in ethics and isn't even handled all too well. It takes an kinda interesting phenomenon but does not explore it. This is especially shown in poor characterization of the whole cast, which may appear cool in the beginning, but does not have a lot of depth in general. \
Animation and soundtrack though are on a very high level. That may take a fun shonen show to an enjoyable level, but Death Note takes itself extremely seriously, therefore the focus lays on story and characters. \
Overall it's a poorly written show which is extremely pretentious and is lucky to have a big fan base which protects it with all its heart. \

    Better make sure you're wearing a seat belt, because this piece of knowledge may rock your world: I've never actually watched the Death Note anime all the way through before. I know, how dare I! It's still the most popular anime on MAL, remains one of the most popular anime in today's culture, and is continuing to get more interpretations than the Bible - which is kind of fitting given how many people today still worship the notebook's rules. Hell, I even championed it as one of those anime every newcomer to this medium should watch in order to get a feel for it -\
          \
        although I should point out that I also recommend Aria as well and I still have no interest in watching that show myself. The point is, Death Note has been one of those immortal anime every person should at least get an opinion on from the very moment it finished. You don't have to like it, but saying you never saw it is like saying you've never seen Evangelion at this point in time.\
Now there are a couple of reasons why I never got far into the anime. One was that I religiously read the manga as it was getting released in the States and ended up not enjoying it after Volume 3 or 4, yet finished it anyways. Two was I checked out the Adult Swim dub and thought it was so good that I didn't want to watch the show in its original language, but that was back in 2009-10 when Netflix only had the Japanese version and English dub files were hard to find because every streaming site (especially Youtube) that used it was getting sued for all they were worth. By the time Death Note's dub hit the platform containing the world's best TV, I wasn't really interested in seeing it anymore, especially since the anime is for the most part faithful to what I've already read. However, with the show getting taken off at the end of this month and the nagging feeling that there was a noticeable hole in my fandom resume, I burned through the thing with more desperation than Bruce Willis in every Die Hard movie ever.\
Now normally I'd describe the plot to you guys, but I think at this point that's like explaining to people that Lord of the Rings is about a bunch of travellers walking to a volcano in order to destroy a ring belonging to the evil Sauron, so I'm just going to focus on what still matters about the show by current-day standards. Fans who have not seen Death Note in a while will be pleased to hear that the visuals are still good, although the style definitely shows its age at times, especially when you compare it to Araki's more recent anime like Guilty Crown or Attack on Titan. The English dub is still as awesome as it ever was, with Brad Swaille making the \"potato chip\" line sound epic whilst still being stupid. And yes, L is still as sexy as you remember him, fangirls. Even when he ends up a corpse, you'll still find reasons to swoon all over him.\
It's worth remembering before I go on that Death Note is a Shonen Jump anime and like all things from Shonen Jump, it starts off mildly intriguing. The concept of a notebook that can kill by following specific rules that are almost untraceable by the police is something that'll appeal to most teenage boys, and Light himself is the opposite of most Shonen Jump protagonists like Naruto or Luffy in that he's a smart dude who has no qualms with killing if it means achieving his dream. He started doing this shit not because of some complicated backstory that can take up more than half a standard manga volume, but because he found his life as an overachieving Asian dull (which is a real thing that happens, as shown in a few studies you can find somewhere out there as well as Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow). It quickly becomes clear you're not supposed to sympathize with Light when he starts killing off cops and soon-to-be-married couples just because they get in the way of his \"criminal sentencing\", but he was still interesting in a \"becoming the kind of person he kills everyday\" sort of way, especially when paired off against L, an obsessive weirdo who pursues justice relentelessly even if his means are a little questionable but never to the level that Light's are.\
The problem with Shonen Jump stuff though, even in something as relatively short as Death Note, is that there's only so long they can coast on the goodwill brought about by their interesting starts before they have to start introducing something new to keep things from getting stale. And unfortunately, they seem to be under the illusion that more characters, more concepts, and more energy equals more story, when in reality it's just piling in more plot than the story can contain. You see, I know a lot of people say Death Note became shit after L died (and it did fall apart faster than any form of apology that comes out of Donald Trump's fucking mouth, don't get me wrong), but I got tired of the series way before that point back when I was in highschool, and that was during a time when I genuinely looked forward to the newest episode of Hayate the Combat Butler. More specifically around the time, Misa appeared.\
Yeah yeah, I know. Death Note is sexist. The author sucks at writing women. That really smart female detective was killed off really stupidly, and that's not even getting into what happens with Light's \"girlfriends\". Yadda yadda yadda. But more than that, what I didn't like about the manga (and the show) after her appearance was how unnecessarily convoluted the mind games between Light and L became. It felt like the writers were just coming up with more and more absurd scenarios just to get a decent length out of the thing, and the appeal of the Death Note lessened when they started making it more available to the cast. You know how Dragonball Z draws out its fight scenes so that a character only throws a punch about three times per episode (at max)? Death Note's mind games are basically a non-violent (sort of) version of that, and as much as I like Araki, I've mentioned before in regards to Planetarian that energy without momentum isn't going to keep my attention for more than five seconds.\
On top of that, I found Light's treatment of Misa to be too unlikable to find him interesting anymore. It really became clear at that point that he was just a serial killer and whilst that might have been fine if the series wrapped up one or two episodes later after that turning point, it went on for another twenty-four. Twenty-four episodes I was struggling to pay attention to because all I was seeing was empty energy the likes of which people complained about in Kill la Kill's last arc, so I ended up leaving the show on and reading One Piece manga all the way through the memory loss arc and anything involving Near & Mello, only to pay attention again at the final episode, which I'll admit was an improvement on the manga's finale in that it ended right when the show was at its strongest, and I liked the religious bent given to Light's eventual fate.\
However, I still stand by my opinion that Death Note remains as one of the essential anime every newcomer to this medium should watch, even through my tedious grind. It's one of the best entries into Shonen Jump stuff you'll ever see (apart from Fist of the North Star) as well as an over-the-top anime that'll appeal to Western sensibilities the most so as to ease you into what the East considers entertaining, along with just, y'know, looking good. And for better or worse, this is likely the best adaptation of the manga you're ever going to get given how godawful the movies, TV drama, and inevitably the American Netflix adaptation are. Not sure where you're going to watch it now that it's getting taken off of the legal streaming circuit, but that's your guys' problem. All I can do is continue to keep this franchise alive by talking about it for better or worse.\

    This anime.\
It had all the makings of a classic and if I act biased, I might as well give it 10.. And trust me, episodes 1-26 were a masterpiece! After that, it went a little downhill.. And my hatred towards a certain character compelled me to give it a 9.. Let's take a spoiler-free look at each of its components..\
STORY :\
Absolutely loved the premise.. Writing a spoiler-free review is difficult enough, but I'll make it easy.. The story was so gripping that I watched around 20 episodes without major breaks.. The cliffhangers were excellent and still give me goosebumps.. The problem is, after episode 26,\
          \
        the story takes a dramatic shift which I didn't like at all.. 9/10..\
ART :\
Good art here.. Nothing too special, but nothing awful either.. 7/10..\
SOUND :\
A very good soundtrack.. It made writing names on a notebook feel like the end of the world! The sound made for some exciting moments and it enhanced certain memorable scenes.. 8/10..\
CHARACTERS :\
The two main characters, Light Yagami and L Lawliet, are quite frankly, two of the greatest characters in anime history.. They're the driving force behind this anime's greatness.. Ryuk, the Shinigami, is a great (and much needed) addition to the anime.. Those newly introduced characters sucked though! Other side characters don't stand out much but those 3 are enough for me to give it a 10/10..\
ENJOYMENT :\
I enjoyed this anime thoroughly! I can watch it again and again and still not get bored of it.. Its that enjoyable.. The enjoyment level decreases after a certain event in the second half though.. 9/10 for this one..\
OVERALL :\
This is the first anime I watched with a passion.. I was absolutely invested in the story! So much in fact, that I wrote some politicians' names in my Death Note.. True Story.. Its a roller coaster of all sorts.. The second half pales in comparison to the first half but don't let it bother you.. I wholeheartedly recommend this anime for everyone to watch..",

    SPOILERS\
I'm disappointed in the ridiculous worship this anime series has gotten.  The problem is that the story has WAY too many fake contrivances.  Moreover, it suffers from perhaps the most common failing when a writer tries to write a story about geniuses...  Because the writer himself is not a genius, he will necessarily fail at coming up with believable strokes of genius.  Instead you get contrivances.\
Would a genius really think the way to make Earth a paradise is to implement the death penalty for all crime?  No, a genius, or even any pretty smart person, would realize that crime is\
          \
        a symptom more than a problem, and the harm from crime is frankly trivial compared to the harm of unfair allocation of world resources (so that millions starve while others throw away millions of tons of food each year), wars based on misplaced nationalism and prejudices, poor educational systems that spawn societies full of people who do not have the critical thinking skills needed to make democracy work as it was intended, and rampant environmental destruction, to name a few.  Seriously, no \"genius\" is going to come into possession of Death Note and then dedicate himself to wiping out crime.\
A number of really serious contrivances have to take place for Light to actually becoming the prime suspect of being Kira.  I mean, seriously, he can kill by writing a name down with absolutely no physical evidence linking the death to himself.  It is literally the perfect crime.  It should have been impossible for him to come under suspicion.  Even if the first few deaths led investigators to focus on an area of Japan, that is still thousands (tens of thousands?  Hundreds of thousands?  Millions?) of people.\
Or the contrivance that Light's father happens to wind up working on the international team to stop Kira?\
Or the crazy contrivances needed for L to go from viewing Light as the prime suspect, to then suspecting a famous model of being the prime suspect, then deciding neither is Kira, then Light and the model wind up dating...  Seriously?  Your two prime Kira suspects are a couple, and that does not make you suspicious?  \
How about the way that, in a world based totally in science like ours, when L and the cops realize there is a magic book that can kill if you write a person's name in it, all they can think about is catching the guy who has the book?  Wouldn't this require a HUGE amount of soul-searching, re-thinking everything you thought was real and phony?  Is the real mystery here who is using Death Note to commit murder, or HOW THE HELL IS THERE A MAGIC BOOK THAT KILLS IF YOU WRITE A NAME IN IT?!!!  Somehow that conversation never comes up.\
Oh, and basically every conversation between L and Light, it is as if Light is screaming \"I'm Kira!\"  Seriously, if you ask some one if they are Kira, and they answer, \"Well, if I was, I sure wouldn't tell you, right, so I guess the question is kind if pointless...\"  Uh, yeah, that guys guilty.  That's not how innocent people talk.  Every conversation, Light says stuff that is absolutely what you would expect him to say if he was Kira toying with Light, not if he was Light who was not Kira.\
No one bats an eye that this friggin' HIGH SCHOOL student is suddenly dating a celebrity model?\
What are the odds Light and L both are tennis gurus?  I mean, there are a lot of sports to excel at.\
What the heck is wrong with the model chick that she actually surrenders half her life to find Kira, and when she does she then agrees when he wants her to sacrifice half her remaining life again to further his plans?  What are the odds the finder of the second Death Note is going to be so incredibly ripe for jumping into slavish cult-like devotion to the first Death Note holder?  I'd imagine that personality time is VERY VERY rare.  Yet as it turns out Light basically NEEDED her to be like that to get himself out the ridiculous jam that he became the prime Kira suspect in the first place.\
Overall, the cat-mouse game between L and Light was not \"genius,\" it insults your intelligence because is so fake and contrived.\
Oh, and am I the only one bothered by Light's total lack of libido?  He's a teenager.  A top model is worshiping him, and all he can think about is his Death Note plans?  There is no explanation given for his total lack of libido or passion.  \
Lastly, if you watch, you'll notice that L and Light basically talk the same, in the same kind of faux-smart-person way.  The writer could not even come up with two distinct voices for them.\
\
This anime had a couple things going for it:  I very interesting, original and edgy premise; a high amount of wish-fulfillment (gee, main character is smartest kid in Japan?  check  Adored by model?  check  Had special powers?  check...  And add to that a very slick production.  Oh, and it 's quite short. \
When an anime series has only 37 episodes and people admit it really starts to drag somewhere in the 20's... Well, that basically confirms that this is not a deep anime, nor one that can stand the test of time.  It is a flash in the pan.  Now, when an Anime goes hundreds of episodes and is getting better, and fans are crushed when it ends....that can be called a great Anime.  \
Death Note is crap, and if you like it, you probably have not seen much anime at all.",

    * This review does not include any spoilers *\
Story:\
The story followes a college-student, Light Yagami who suddenly finds a Death Note. The Note was originally from Ryuk, a Shinigami, however, he was clumsy and the Note Book fell without him noticing.  When a full name is written in this Note Book, that person shall die. Light plans to become a God and he murders every single criminal. L, a very smart man tries to capture 'Kira' and he will have a mind-battle with Light. I was always thinking: How does someone come up with such a great story?  Unfortunately, this amazing build-up falls\
          \
        apart in the second half of the series. \
Characters:\
The characters all have their own personalities. They have their own characteristics, what I like. You will probably root for the villain to win for one of the first times. The character designs are simple, but they're well-done. In the second-half I didn't like the characters at all, however, there are a lot of people who did, but it isn't my cup of tea.\
Animation and sound:\
So, the animation of the show is done by Madhouse, probably my favorite studio. What I like is that they don't overcomplicate the animatinan and  they also focus on every little detail and scene. The soundtracks are nice, they fit well with the series and again, they have a variety of instruments. The first opening song was amazing. It has to be in the top 3 if not the top of my favorite openings. They start the opening really well and when I first heard it, I thought: It will probably lose it's pacing just like any other opening, but surprisingly enough it didn't.\
Enjoyment:\
I was watching Death Note in excitement, however when I started watching the second part, it was really getting boring, because of the new characters. \
Overall:\
I will give the first part a 10, but the second part a 2, because I just don't want to give it 1/10. So that will be a 6/10 for Death Note. \
If you like some good mind-battles and drama anime, then this is something for you! Let me know if this review helped you out and have fun watching Death Note, if you haven't done that yet!\

Death Note is hard boiled. It's not a mystery, because you know whodunnit. You follow the criminal's perspective. What is an antihero? Is it a hero with villainous qualities or is it just a villain who gets the story told from his viewpoint? Both probably.\
I think of Death Note as a study of narcissism induced by brilliance or just being a sociopath. In other words, we sometimes possess traits that by nature alienate us from people, leaving us to live in our own inner worlds. To some, mundanity is the death of the soul. Maybe we are such keen\
          \
        observers of the human condition that we can't bare to constantly see the subtext of insecurities that plague every day conversation. Maybe we are just so smart we can't stand being around other people's stupidity.\
Light is a narcissist. He just is. He looks like everyone else, acts like everyone else, but this is a farce. Most guys like him are never seen for what they truly are.\
We have no choice to believe that Light was born with something missing, that even a boy with a loving family, who grew up comfortable, can just be born wrong. We can't always blame the parents, or even society. Monsters are sometimes just born.\
Hard boiled supernatural detective story. Light and L begin a game of one-upping that often seems like it's going to break but doesn't. It begins to seem this might be an infinite story. As Light commits his crimes; L puts him in positions that should be impossible,(and unforeseen factors intervene) but Light adapts , his plans becoming more serpentine in the process. Something has to give.\
Light's God Complex contrasts with Man's Greed. Light's genius contrasts with L's genius. Light's darkness really does overwhelm any light. Any character who truly seems to solve crimes from a sense of heart, a desire to make the world better, seems quite irrelevant. Only those who coldly see crimes as puzzles cause change. The rest are pawns, serving grand masters.\
I debate the second half of the series, and how I feel about the introduction of new characters. That's why I decked a point for the critic rating, but couldn't for the overall. Overall it's still just so perfect to me. Something had to change to justify the series length. Just as I was thinking Light vs. L needed to end, something happened to make the number of episodes make sense. Still, I wasn't rooting for them, and their back story needed more fleshing out for me. I was curious to their connection to a main character. While some may say the characters needed to be cut, I disagree. I think they represent the idea of cycling generations, of how nothing lasts forever and yet everything repeats. They represent how the next generation can build on the work of those that came before them, of how achievement does not often occur in one lifetime but over many. This is life. We all want to change the world, but sometimes we just pave the way for the next person to do so. You may be able to fight one person, but can you fight generations. When you've learned one enemy so thoroughly, how quickly can you adapt to another? You are the same, but your enemy suddenly changes. From a storytelling perspective, it seems these new characters have an unaffair and unearned advantage. But really, don't we all get to take something our ancestor's accomplished for granted?\
I think one of the minor episodes was one of the most brilliant case studies in storytelling I had ever seen. When Light needs to get the full name of his next target to keep from getting busted, a ticking clock begins. He has to get her name before she contacts his father. The writing is like something for the stage, written in carefully controlled beats, that ratchets up the tension. No explosions, no big twists, not even a big plot point, just a slow burning pace that left me wondering who I was rooting for.\
The ending wasn't predictable until it happened. That's how engrossed I became. It pushed the proceedings into opera. The detective's great reveal was more than a genre convention; it was a god's lament.\

Ahhh yes. The ever so popular Death Note. To be honest I never understood what people saw in it. I was kinda never able to bring myself to watch it thinking that it was probably boring and dull. Well, I was wrong. \
Let's start with the story then. It's simple enough, we have a bored psychopathic high school student (Light Yagami) who finds a notebook (called Death Note). It's not just an average notebook though, oh no. This one can kill a human whose name is written into it. Naturally the first thing I though was great he's\
          \
        gonna kill everyone. However it turns out that Light is a man of principles and he wants to create a just world by killing criminals across the globe. Joining him is a shinigami by the name of Ryuk. He's a tall intimidating fellow, although he rarely gets involved in Light's matters. Actually the only thing he seems to care about are... apples. And so the duo sets out on a journey to rid the world of evil. The plot picks up from there and gets more and more interesting as the story progresses. \
The characters are very interesting and there are... phew, dozens of them. I'm not going to discuss each and every individual character because it would take me years to do that. Intead I'll sum up the three main ones. Light, L and Misa. Light, as I mentioned earlier is a high school student but he's not your avergage student. He is a genius, a prodigy. Brought in to capture him is L, another genius with an amazingly fast intellect. He can work out what you're going to say before you even think about it. Then we have Misa, a famous pop celebrity who also happens to posses a death note. She meets Light and finds out that he also has one. She falls in love with him and literally becomes his slave after that. I didn't like that development though. I don't mind a bit of romance and love but Light and Misa's relationship gets extremely repetetive and there is no development there whatsoever. A bit sad, isn't it?\
Sound and art are absolutely amazing. I thought the sound was composed by Hans Zimmer himself. It's overly epic. It'll squeeze a few tears out of you, trust me. Art is super epic. It's like Bleach meets Dragon Ball. I never knew writing something in a stupid notebook could look so amazing. The pen becomes an instrument, and the person writing with it is... a composer and the music he creates shakes the entire world, nay, the universe gahhhh! Something like that.\
In other words this is one hell of an epic series that everyone must see. But if you have read this far then you're probably wondering, if I like it so much then why did I give it a rating of 9 and not 10? Well, let me explain then. It's the ending. For an anime of this calibre, the ending is absolutely horrible. I'll be frank - it's crap. When watching the death note I was expecting a more meaningful ending. I don't know, some kinda of a recap on human history, some kinda of a philosphical explanation of  life narrated by the main character or something like that but... nada, the edning is completely meaningless. It will let you down a little, because you've come so far watching the series you'd expect some kind of a reward at the end. But instead of getting a tasty meal, you're left with leftovers. \
Therefore I had to lower my score by a point. Death Note is a great anime and deserves its high popularity, however because if its ending it will never be a masterpiece. All that said, I recommend this anime to everyone. It's very interesting and entertaining!\

    When an anime leaves you feeling that you have obtained a heightened sense of intelligence after viewing it, you know you have a winner. Death Note is a masterfully crafted cerebral volley that may perhaps change the way you think. \
Story: Any good story can spread from a single well defined and provocative plot element, in this case, Death Note. The death note is a notebook, containing a set of rules and blank sheets of paper, which kills any name entered into it. The rules stipulate that with regards to various time restrictions, the person entering the name can also write a cause of death\
          \
        as well as time and place of death, and other intriguing additions and exclusions. A shinigimi drops his death note on the ground near a school where a boy named Light finds it. From there, the story begins. I knew at this point that the concept had potential for huge success as long as the character controlling the notebook is reasonably complex and intelligent. But Light brought far more to the table than I had imagined. Additionally, the plot element that took me most by surprise was the relationship that developed between Light and his arch nemesis, L. As the story dictates, these two are intellectual geniuses in a league all their own. The \"cat and mouse\" analogy is a good way to describe there battles, yet does not adequately demonstrate the scale of cunning and cleverness utilized in their bouts. Few shows, anime or not, get me in that mood where I absolutely need to keep watching to see what one or the other is going to do next. \
Unfortunately, the story arguably overstays its welcome. This is both a blessing and a curse. After the climax of the first season, the second season feels a little bit more like an appendage of the first, rather than the second half of a series proper. Fortunately the show is so good that it welcoming to have more Death Note to enjoy. My problems were largely due to the death of a vital character, and the attempt that the story uses to make up for it. But they were minimal.\
Art: The art in Death Note is good. I would not go as far to say it is excellent, nor would I say that about the manga's artwork. However, the story does not particularly require the background scenery, action sequences, or even characters to be too extravagant. This is a cerebral adventure for the most part. A psychological battle between many minds. Still, the art perfectly captures intense decisive moments in the anime, successfully conveying the appropriate messages to the audiences. Also, we the viewers truly begin to witness darkness settle over Light, and was greatly enhanced through the visual work done in the anime version. \
Sound: I did not notice the sound to bee too intrusive, which is good. I would not sing its praises either. What it does manage to do is an effective job highlighting certain moods in the anime that need to be conveyed for the audience to pick up on in a nonverbal setting. It never made any mistakes, confusing the tone of the story, getting in the way, or being absent when it should not be. Nonetheless, it was not the best. \
Character: This story contains my favorite character in any anime I have seen or manga I have read, \"L\". Along with L, Kira (Light) is almost as equally enthralling, though I'm sure some will make the reverse argument. The entire story line comes to rest on these two's shoulders, and they do not disappoint. I must admit, I am a sucker for intellectual thrillers, but I find it hard to believe that most people would not agree upon the genius behind these two characters. I am partial to L because he is a bit more mysterious, more self-assured, and a little more human than Light. But they are fitting rivals and you may chose which ever side you like. Their methods of solving problems and thinking critically are amazing tools, and may even start getting the audience to look at their every day lives with a wider scope of understanding and reasoning.\
The supporting characters for the most part do not play substantial roles in the plot. However there is a subgroup of 4 or 5 characters that remain relevant the whole story. These characters are less structured than Light and L, but they serve purpose to the plot line. One notable character is Light's dad, who also happens to be the Chief of Police, but that subplot did not bore me for too long, and I enjoyed its conclusion. \
I would like to take a moment to discuss the role of the Shinnigimi in the anime. I very much enjoyed the portrayal of Ryuk, Rem and the other Death gods. They almost have a glow of subtle softness, innocence even, when compared to some of the other characters. They can be used just like everyone else. They identify with the humans enough where we begin to understand them, but ultimately they are Shinnigimi and possess motivations we do not understand. This was a beautiful portrayal in my opinion.\
Enjoyment: This is my favorite anime / manga series, and nothing has come along in the past couple years to change that yet. \

    I found Death Note to the anime that never really had the typical anime plot. It's a very serious anime about a man who ultimately gets consumed by his new capabilities. Now I won't really spoil anything but by it's name, there is a ton of death involved. By justice of a single man. I personally like stories where someone has had enough with society and does things his own way. Trust me, if you haven't seen Death Note, it's going to be likable by any anime fan.\

    Ah yes, Death Note. One of the few anime that I could understand that hyped. The popularity of this anime is not surprising, although I consider it's quality below that of the manga, which in many respects is better then the anime.\
What does surprise my about the popularity of this anime is the willingness and the amount of people that throw themselves over it, and the readiness to call this the best anime ever made.\
I'll agree that this is one of the better anime of recent years, and it's obvious that it's quite good, it even spawned a couple of similar anime (Code Geass comes\
          \
        to mind). However that's not to say that it's without faults, and the same goes for the manga, which has pretty much those same faults.\
One of the problems with the story is that the writer wanted to make it complex, and I do like what he did with it. It included some nice ideas like \"Doublethink\" (Read 1984 by George Orwell for what that means, and I really recommend that book. It's even clear to me that Tsugumi Ohba took some inspiration from 1984 and Brave New World) and had some good amount of plots within plots. However the story severely suffers when the complexity increases, even to the point that it becomes confusing of what happened with the story because of the overcomplexity of the story telling and all the plots going on. That doesn't quite happen with Death Note but it gets close to that at times.\
Another problem lies with the characters. Several of the main characters are given a beyond human intelligence, this causes several problems.\
One is that most of them appear as smug, arrogant, self-centred twats, which makes it hard to identify with the characters and at times completely propels the viewer out of the story.\
A second problem is that at times the characters seem to posses information and knowledge that they couldn't and shouldn't know or have obtained. A good couple of actions couldn't have been taken unless the character taking them knew what another character is doing at that time or will do sometime in the future. Of course you can predict that someone could take that action but that takes an extreme amount of knowledge about that character and the circumstances that take place at that time. It's practically impossible to do that unless you can see the future or have read the script. This again caused me to fail to identify with the main characters.\
Alright, let's get down to my scores.\
Story: 8\
The story is well written and well presented, it has a lot of depth and many unique items that have rarely been explored in anime, like the moral problem of having a villain type character as the main character.\
It however suffers from the afore mentioned problems of going the route of over-complexity and illogical actions of the characters that they couldn't have taken without knowledge of future events.\
However, all in all the story is very good and the issues presented in it are quite gripping.\
Art: 9\
The artwork is of a very high standard, very fitting with the anime and the type of story. There is hardly anything that I can comment on it.\
Sound: 8\
Fitting with the moods, clear and good choice of voice-actors.\
Characters: 5\
As said earlier, the super-human intelligence of the main characters are a major drawback on the whole experience. Another point is that the supporting cast is almost completely 2 dimensional, they have hardly any character development and can at most times be interchangeable, they just needed a character to take a certain action at a certain time and at most times it doesn't really matter which character takes that action. This causes the supporting casts to completely lack any depth since they are mostly there as puppets used for story progression.\
Misa is especially annoying and useless.\
Enjoyment: 9\
Even with all the above problems the anime is highly enjoyable and can easily draw in most viewers, even though it sometimes catapults them out of the story by inexplicable actions of the characters or downright stupidity.\
Overall: 8\
I'd have to say that even with the problems it's still is a very good anime, and among my favourites of recent years.\
A well presented story that has a good pace and hardly any fillers.\
Nice take on morality and a good psychological detective story.\
It's quite good, even though it has some faults, but then again, hardly anything is perfect.\

    First review ever so spare me ^-^ [Everything that sounds spoilerish is in the first episode]\
\
Death Note is among the 'godly' realm of anime, right up there with Full Metal Alchemist, Steins;Gate, HunterXHunter and Gintama. \
The thing that separates Death Note from the others is 100%; \
\
The Story.[10]\
The story, holy hell man, this is one of the only anime that makes a plot twist, hides it, and lets YOU discover it on your own. This story makes you question your own beliefs and can change your view on the world, and none of that was an exaggeration, I can assure you.\
Being slightly in the realm\
          \
        of anime watching, you've probably heard about Death Note. Even if you haven't, Death Note has found its way into western culture, and not in the most desirable ways. The story revolves around Light Yagami, THE brightest student in Japan. He discovers a notebook named the 'Death Note'; written inside are the words; 'those whose names are written in this book shall die.' sounds like crappy chain mail from the late 90's right? wrong. The consequences of those 10 words reak havoc throughout Japan and the rest of the world. All because of a goddamn notebook that some lazy-ass Death God (Shinigami) dropped, to have some 'entertainment'. I am glad this isn't real because damn, its some scary shit.\
[Manga] - compared to the manga, the anime trumps it. The manga had some story issues about halfway in and it got a bit boring for a few chapters, but the anime, they just gloss over the irrelevant shit, and they gloss well. Nothing is lost, and nothing is unneeded, perfect even.\
The Art. [9.5]\
Personally, I love the art, you knew what everything was, everything was almost identical to how Takeshi Obata drew it. The *only* thing not giving it a prefect 10, is that there are a few scenes throughout the series where the characters just look really strange, like its only for half a second or something but yeah it's not noticeable enough to waver your thoughts on the amazing animation done in this anime\
In the first episode, the art comes of as incredibly saturated, very bleak and very plain. In my opinion I see this as how Light views the world around him and as the series goes on, it gets brighter and more vivid as more of the story unfolds. \
The Sound.[10]\
Holy ambient batman. \
TRUMPETS, GOTHIC CHURCH CHOIRS, HEAVY METAL. EVERYTHING IS HERE AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT, the score throughout the anime was perfectly written and especially throughout the battle scenes, it didn't feel intrusive, it just felt so natural.\
The Characters [10]\
To maintain my spoiler free [exc. ep 1] review I'm just going to say a few things. \
Ryuk; easily a hilarious necessary addition. Comedy is spot on and really plays the whole 'are death gods actually bad though?' card very well.\
Light; INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENTLY written, he embodies our natural thought processes and seems like he does the natural, logical things anyone would do... \
The other characters that are revealed later on in the series are easily some of my favourite characters and I'm yet to see someone disappointed in how the characters are written in this show.\
Enjoyment [10]\
I thoroughly enjoyed this show, its philosophical, it provokes you to think about it almost every episode and its JUST SO DAMN GOOD. \
If you're hesitant to watch it YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON EVERYTHING, WATCH IT.\
OVERALL: [10/10] (Rewatch potential [10/10])\
Lastly; \
Impact on The World:\
Death Note has been banned in several places, most reason revolve around the 'Makes students take an interest in death' chant. As with video games, scapegoats are aplenty and this anime & manga series, being the 'controversial' story it is, is no exception. This should not be a reason to not watch the show, I REPEAT, DO NOT MAKE THIS A REASON TO PASS ON THIS ONCE A GENERATION SHOW.\

    Synopsis:\
Yagami Light is as perfect a hero as you could imagine--perfect grades, perfect public record, perfect looks--in every facet, his image is squeaky clean. \
This all ends one fateful day when the Shinigami known as Ryuk drops his Death Note out of the realm of the afterlife, into Light's schoolyard. Light stumbles across it and reads the directions: write the name of the person you want dead in the Death Note--with their image in your mind--and they will die in the manner you have specified in this supernatural journal. Otherwise, if the circumstance is not specified in writing, the victim will, within minutes, suffer a\
          \
        fatal heart attack. \
Thinking it a stupid prank initially, Light puts it to the test when saving an innocent woman from being assaulted. To his horror, it works. Could ridding the world of criminals be this easy? \
Inspired with a new renewed sense of justice, Light indulges himself completely in his newfound power, self-righteously declaring himself the bringer of a new, utopian future-- \
--one name at a time.\
Review:\
Probably the most anticipated anime of the 2006/2007 Winter season, and perhaps of the new year (Nodame Cantabile, maybe?) Death Note carries story elements and an intellectual integrity that is more commonly seen in your collegeate literary classics than your usual Shounen Jump title.\
First we have the Platonic \"Gyges' Ring\" scenario--in a discourse in Plato's Republic, the integrity of mortal justice is questions and sequentially deemed fundamentally flawed by sinful, finite capacity of man and their deeply ruooted sense of pride and self-righteousness. The lead character Light is the incarnation of this discourse, a once seemingly flawless character driven to obsession over the notion of becoming like a god. At first his intentions are decent--rapists, child molesters, serial killers--deserve to die, right? The world would be better without them, right? But putting such power into the hands of a mortal--as perfect as Light might be--corrupts, as history proves time and again.\
Accompanying the Death Note is its original owner, the Shinigami Ryuk. Rather than being morally bound to Light or serving as a conscience or guide, Ryuk hangs around simply to be a spectator--proclaiming humans to be \"interesting.\"\
While this itself makes for an interesting plot, what really makes Death Note a top caliber series are the characters who cause an obstruction to Light's mission. Topping the cast is the fan-favorite L, whose character is just beyond description. A shady, mysterious, but somewhat eccentric genius, L is probably the only mind that could match the scheming Light. The cat-and-mouse power-play between the two young men is enticing and riveting, making you laugh (not for comedy's sake) and keeps you fixed on every frame, soaking in all the details and anticipating the next move. The adorable, yet tragic Misa is another owner of a Death Note, and becomes pathetically infatuated with Light and obediently does his bidding, while at the same time threatening his immunity to the task force tracking him down.\
This is just within the first ten episodes or so. This series is simple enough for anyone to understand, but at the same time deep enough and clever enough for those looking for something really meaty to sink their teeth into. Additionally, this series offers something that not many other series do--a moral conundrum. What if we had a Death Note? Would we use it? How would we use it? Is it possible to use it without turning into what Light becomes? \
Its production values leave me with nothing to complain about. A top-selling series like Death Note, like Nana and other popular manga titles, have an obligation to its fans to give them something that is quality work. The animation is smooth, the character designs are loyal and really bring life to the characters. The music is fantastic, and some of anime's top seiyuu are among the cast, including Miyano Mamoru (Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club) as Light, Yamaguchi Kappei (Inuyasha from Inuyasha) as L, and Hirano Aya (Haruhi from The Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) as Misa. You really cannot go wrong with this series. And this is coming from a Christian--I am not at all offended by this series, it is a fantastic philosophical and theological scenario.\
How about looking at this series as social commentary? Any side of the political spectrum or anyone with any kind of religious affiliation can find hot topic issues that make for excellent discussion. This is a series that will make you think. It's more than just passive entertainment, though it is just what you make it. That's the beauty of Death Note. And fortunately, it shines bright through the ugliness that is undoubtedly to come to its characters.\

    In today's society, it's so difficult to find innovative, challenging and stimulating material that is also enjoyable. Death Note hits the nail on the head with it's highly appealing, informative, and complex storyline. It is truly unique in concept, and indisputably my favourite anime. Ever.\
I could certainly spout praise for the series all day, not to say it's ultimately perfect. \
Obviously the supernatural subject matter throws reason out the window, but an element of realism is lost. The detectives chasing Light make huge leaps - killings during the day? MUST BE A STUDENT - and though this may be pinned on their amazing deductive skill,\
          \
        it seems a little implausible. \
There are minor plot holes, but this doesn't detract too severely seeing as it contains such a complex, overarching story - an audience is pleasantly confused.\
Some emphasis on ideas is a little obvious; different views are sliced into the action with somewhat cheesy dialogue.\
Also, while the voice acting (English Dub) is usually consistent and indicative of the talented cast, we sometimes are subject to awkward transitions and vocal techniques that aren't behavioural of characters. Another thing I noticed (only because I have watched it sooo many times) was that actors of well known characters (Matsuda, L) voice minor characters such as news reporters and bystanders - but I suppose i'm being pedantic now.\
Well, that ends my list of what was not so good, the rest is good news, I assure you!\
One of my favourite things about the anime is the use of symbolism - the apple to represent sin (as in the Garden of Eden ordeal...), and the meta scenes where L and Light (and even other characters) are represented by different colours and openly fight each other. The creator's clever presentation of ideas allows the audience to search for a deeper meaning.\
And this deeper meaning is certainly prominent. Each episode highlights philosophical ideas - mortality, justice, corruption of society, good vs. evil, morality, sin, and so much more. It leads you to think about the world; would we be better off without these criminals? Whose job is it to \"pass righteous judgement on the wicked?\" Does killing exile you from heaven?\
Characters are another strength of Death Note. Ryuk and Misa will make you laugh, Light will make you cringe, and the empathy and rapport we gain with the characters make us hope and suffer along with them. Undoubtedly, you will take a side. Kira, or the law?\
I found myself routing for Light, his tactics, acting, and intelligence were pretty... appealing ;) Every action he would take, I'd be all like \"NOOO DON'T YOU'LL FALL INTO L'S TRAP!\" or \"OH HOLY JESUS YOU ARE A GENIUS\"\
The art is simply outstanding. Characters are proportional, environments are beautiful and detailed, setting is appropriate, colouring sets a distinctive mood, and the design is flawless and unique. The style is quite realistic for the anime convention - no crazy coloured hair or unlikely features - which really allowed focus on the ideas conveyed, and the seriousness of the story.\
Overall, I don't think I can really explain why I love Death Note so much. Everytime I watch it, I just marvel at the genius and artful masterpiece that was produced. I definitely recommend it to anyone with a love for mystery and a mentally challenging anime.",

    The Suspense Is \"Killing\" Me ~ Can you sign my Death Note?\
Death Note was the first anime that I have watched and from the first episode, I was enticed to watch more. The anime starts off with Yagami Light, A 17 year old student that picks up a notebook named the \"Death Note\". At first he thinks the Death Note's power to kill people is fake, but later finds out that it works. With this new acquisition Yagami Light has the power of god in his grasp, and uses it to kill criminals to make a perfect world without any crime. Killing criminals is ok\
          \
        right? Well L Lawliet doesn't think so. L is like a Sherlock Holmes to me, when nobody else can solve the case you go to him to solve it. As the anime progresses L takes on the case and tries to reveal who the killer is while Light tries to find what L's real name is. (in order for Light to kill L he has to know his real name)\
The scenery for Death Note was really impressing because it sets a mood of what the characters are going through and feeling. Speaking of the characters, they were also drawn impressively and according to their personalities. All-in-All the art was good, and gave more sustenance to the anime.\
What's up people? I just had to say that. No joke this is one of the songs from Death Note. The opening and closing songs was another thing that dragged me in and kept me watching more and more. The first opening and closing songs were made by Nightmare, which put a lot of passion into the anime. The second opening and closing songs were more intense, and you ask yourself why the makers of Death Note would switch the music up so drastically. It is a big change but it fits Yagami Light's pursue of making a perfect world and it also gives the anime a darker feeling. Where would Death Note be without the soundtrack? The soundtrack was very important in adding suspense and making the moment just right.\
Yagami Light and L Lawliet or L however both intelligent are different individuals. Light the protagonist is under serious pressure. If he gets caught and is found out that he is the killer behind all this the penalty will be execution. Light shows different personalities because of this. When by L he is really calm. If he's not calm he will get caught instantly. When writing criminal's names in the Death Note he shows the psychopathic side of himself. Both of his personalities draw \"you\" the watcher in because you don't know if he will crack under pressure or if he will achieve the status of god in his new world without crime. L is a very lovable character because he has a sweet tooth and sits differently than anybody else but all at the same time he wants justice. His personality differs from Light's because of the actions he takes. Light kills and L does not. Light wants justice by killing and L wants justice by finding the killer. Light is more psychotic and L is more pure of heart. These differences bring them together for a battle of wits. The characters of Death Note although I have only explained 2 of them are all well based and planned out.\
Overall I give Death Note a 10/10, it’s one of my favorite animes because it has great suspense and it keeps the watchers on the edge of their seat wondering what is going to happen next. One of the best things about Death Note is that it can be a good starting anime for beginners or it can be for experienced anime watchers.  I recommend this anime for any anime watcher out there, Death Note is truly great!",

    The story is fantastic. There are flaws in the logic, but they aren't glaring enough to detract from suspension of disbelief or overall enjoyment. \
The first arc (episodes 1 - 26) is the best, it does a great job setting up the rules, and hooking the viewer. The plans, plots, and mind games are all brilliant. They did an excellent job executing the scenes, character reactions, etc. Everything felt natural.\
However, the second arc (27 - 37) was not as good. The most glaring issue, in particular, was the terrible character development. One is an angsty teenager / I have a dark and tortured past cliche,\
          \
        the other is a boring androgynous copy/paste of L, that actively insists the thing that L only passively theorized without ever explaining her (?) reasoning, only \"I have access to L's case files\". It doesn't make sense because earlier on, all of that data was deleted in a tragic accident. It's weak. It doesn't have the same gripping suspense and charm as the first arc.\
While the second arc isn't nearly as enjoyable as the first, it does have some very good suspense at times, and a strong, satisfying ending that I am perfectly happy with. If you have seen Breaking Bad and Dexter to the end, you will understand my distinction between a good ending and a poor ending.\
And now I'll quickly overview the scoring points the site gave me. The site asked me to fill these out, so I feel an explanation is necessary for each. Note, however, that, and I'll only say this now because this is my first review on this site, they DO NOT represent my overall score. I didn't factor any of the below scores into my final score. I decided my final score before I'd even finished watching the show, let alone come here to review it. I wrote an explanation for that here: http://pastebin.com/8vzJvymf\
Story: 9/10. I very much enjoyed the story. From the moment L is introduced to the ending of the show, it was a wild ride. However, it was, by no means, perfect.\
Art: 9/10. I have no complaints. The art doesn't blow me away.\
Sound: 5/10. I don't care for the genre of music the show uses in its intros. It also clashes with the rather cinematic soundtrack used in the actual show. Feels very amateurish. \
Character: 7/10. I would have given it an 8/10, but \"N\" and \"M\" were just terrible.\
Enjoyment: 9/10. I enjoyed this show very much, aside from little things that irked me. No reason to give it anything less than a 9.\
Overall: 9/10. \

    Death Note, arguably one of the most popular anime, if not, THE most popular anime there is. Rightly so...\
Although I wasn't floored from the first episode, I most definitely addicted to this series soon after. The constant mystery and drama is unrivalled to anything I have ever seen, anime or not. And this is why anime, in my opinion is much better than regular TV shows. Death Note proves this where you will undoubted fall in love with some of the characters or perhaps not. The audience will be torn between the characters based upon their moral understanding and beliefs. This is what then, I\
          \
        think makes this anime special.\
Yes, yes I have heard a billion times that after episode 16 or 25, is where \"Death Note\" should have ended and I agree but that's not the point. The point is, that this anime pushes our emotional boundaries while we fumble for what we think is right. And that is beautiful. No anime is perfect (apart for Steins Gate) but this comes ever so darn close.\

    When I was about fourteen or fifteen years old, I thought Death Note was a masterpiece of brilliant writing. Now that I'm twenty-four, I look at it and realize that while its still far from the worst ever, its still completely worthy of the metric tons of mocking that it gets. And its hard to admit that because it does seem so brilliant on its face. But its time to take the red pill and face the facts: Death Note is just short of mediocre. \
The biggest picking point I have with the show is the story itself. Not the core story -- the idea\
          \
        of a single random person being granted the powers to kill anyone they want with a flick of a pen is in fact very clever -- but with its execution. Death Note is a story of conveniences that gets by on asking you to ignore the fact that when its actions are put under scrutiny, it stops making sense. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the fact that the story gets started at all...because they're suspicious that a bunch of guys are having heart attacks and somehow conveniently link this all back to one Japanese high schooler fucking around Tokyo. Instead of staying away from the police, his guaranteed enemies, our main character Light inexplicably decides that he should buddy up with the cops so they can have a direct profile of him to attach to any crimes. We are told that he does this because he is smart (but egotistical, remember that) but to me it seems like a directly moronic action and that when you have a tool that can kill anyone indirectly that the last thing you would want is to draw attention to yourself. \
We then proceed to introduce L, possibly the most overrated character in anime history, so he can make decisions so insane that they range from being sketchy to outright violations of the Geneva Convention. But the Japanese police don't let this bug them, preferring instead to stand at the sidelines with slack jaws marveling at how smart it is that L decided to handcuff himself to a teenage who they have no evidence against. Nice. Honestly the plot just lets this character do whatever he wants, with the justification of he's smart and he's trying to catch Kira so its okay, up until he (shocker) dies. \
Instead of maybe doing something new, we proceed to just replace L with two different Ls: Near and Mello. Or, more appropriately, albino L and angry L. As haughty as I am towards these characters, I actually do like them better than L because together the pair of them have a lot more  personality than L's ceaseless 'I am smart' routine did. Near is very similar to L but has a consistent, unabated sense of humility that manifests in his near constant admittance that he cannot do the task at hand without Mello--while Mello's angry, more criminal way of attempting to solve the case through more aggressive tactics add a more fresh tone to a show that feels like its revving its wheels in the mud. I like these two and honestly their story was more engaging that Light's hissy fitting, though admittedly only to a certain extent. Near still is basically a color palette swap of L and Mello is still just batshit insane. But at least with Mello they don't try to justify the flat out unethical shit he does with 'well, he's smart'. \
I suppose that brings me to the side characters, who...honestly, what do I say about them? Only one of the members of the police force actually matters in the end. The majority of them prefer to either stand staring in slack jawed amazement at the brilliance of the main character and his three aforementioned rivals, or just directly doing whatever these four tell them to do. They are absolutely nothing short of wallpaper. The only other character worth mentioning is Misa Amane, who may as well be renamed 'Plot Device' for as much as she actually contributes to the plot. She adds another Death Note into the mix, and frankly aside from selling a shit load of porn she doesn't actually add anything to the story outside of being Light's arm candy that he doesn't even seem to like that much. And the two Shinigami just kinda float around the background after they explain how the Death Note works. Only Ryuk really has any purpose or meaning in the long run. \
Which I guess does bring me to Light himself, who I have neglected to really address so far. Like L, the story lets him get away with a lot of stupid shit on the precedent of 'you just don't get it he's really SMART'. But unlike L the character of Light is supposed to represent something akin to the idea of a false martyr and how quickly that can go south. The problem is, he doesn't ever CARE. I get it, the guy is too smart for regular life and its a strain, but this guy immediately goes full M. Bison with cheesy catchphrases and evil villain faces. The idea of a false martyr being destructive simply isn't explored, since we get only get views of the effect of Light's actions on society from television reels and occasional public shots, and Light himself never seems to be stressed by the IDEA of being a false martyr, only that he might get caught. He never really develops beyond those three ideas in his head: that he is just, that he is smart, and that he doesn't want to get caught. And I'm sorry, you don't just hand a teenager a murder device with no visible evidence trail and just leave his internal conflict at 'welp I guess I'm god now'. Light is the antithesis of writing realistic characters. \
I liked the concepts of the story. Art-wise, the show is absolutely beautiful, thick with symbolism and just gorgeous visual shots -- though unfortunately in the animation, with a show that is reliant on dialogue, this also means we end up being subject to some of the most flat out silly sequences of animation trying to look important in the history of man. Lest we never forget Light and his potato chip. Even if the story WAS as perfect as its lauded to be, that scene alone should keep anyone from rating this anime a 10. It's just silly on its face and even worse, the silliness of the animation can sometimes draw attention to the contrived nature of the story. \
It's not saying anything, its not doing anything, and Death Note is ultimately an anime that spends 37 episodes and 12 manga volumes running in place to the tune of a vague and misunderstood attempt at social commentary and human nature. It simply just is not the show, or the manga that I remembered. \

    I was first inspired to watch Death Note because my best friend suggested it to me. When I saw how high up it was on the top anime list, it pushed me into actually watching the show and not just letting it sit in my Plan to Watch list. The anime revolves around a group of investigators searching for a mass serial killer known as Kira (AKA Light Yagami – who is the main protagonist of the anime), but little do they know that Kira is one of the investigators among them. Since I want to study criminology and justice when I go to college\
          \
        in a short few years, I was very intrigued with what this anime had in store. And so, I dove into the anime with high expectations, and believe me, I wasn’t the least bit disappointed.\
The overall story is absolutely unique and breathtaking – which is most likely the reason why it’s such a highly rated anime. The whole idea of a star-student becoming such a psychotic killer with just picking up a notebook is, well… insane! I can’t even put it into words how magnificent the storyline played out. The thought process that went through Kira and the investigators’ minds was so ingenious that I was constantly sitting in my chair, wide-eyed, thinking, \"How the HELL do they even COME UP with this sort of stuff?\" Adding onto that, the way Light was incessantly finding loopholes in the investigators’ plans to find out who Kira was had me completely flabbergasted. As an aspiring investigator, I LOVED the plot. And for those who are probably thinking it: no, Death Note didn’t inspire me to become an investigator XD. \
The art style was very clear and a pleasure to look at. I loved how they made the characters have features that made them look realistically similar to humans instead of using the traditional anime eyes and noses. It was definitely different than with what I have been watching lately, so that also kept me into the show. \
As for the music, I enjoyed it. I really liked the opening and ending theme songs. They really set the mood for the whole atmosphere of the show. I sincerely felt like the theme songs also reflected greatly with Light’s personality. Although the second theme song is indeed screamo – which I know not a lot of people are a fan of – it really shows how (excuse my language) fucked up Light is becoming with his ideals of becoming the world’s new god. And the final ending theme song that played once the show was ended fit perfectly and was a great way to calm the watcher down after all that happened in the final episode. The music that played within the anime was perfect as well. Much like the theme songs, they do justice on showing who Light is and what he is becoming due to the Death Note.\
Here we go with character development. The anime takes place over a duration of six years, so over that time, we get to see these characters grow, Especially Light, who starts off as an ordinary high school student, graduates and goes to college, and eventually ends up joining the Task Force with his father – while progressively becoming more insane along the way. It is shown magnificently how he picks up more skills when avoiding the exposure of his identity as Kira. As I previously stated, the loopholes he discovers in the investigators’ plans are amazingly intelligent, and they only continue to grow in creativity as the show progresses, and that, kept making me mutter phrases like: \"Holy mother fucking shit.\" \
My only problem with this anime was that at times things got so intense I had no idea what to do or how to comprehend what was going on. Another thing is that if you decide to watch this anime, you have to give it your full, undivided attention. Otherwise, an important fact could be missed, and believe me when I say there are a lot of important points in this anime. Other than that, watching Death Note was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you too!",

This review does NOT contain any major spoilers.\
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I didn't mind the 2nd part of this series. I know the 1st part was definitely the better of the two but the 2nd was also very good. In the end they could have done without the 2nd part, but by no means was it bad. I actually enjoyed it nonetheless, overall better than most anime series that I've seen.\
Putting that aside the overall story is unique and enjoyable. If you like stories of geniuses competing head to head in\
          \
        a battle of wits you'll love the crap out of this. It makes you think and it jumps out and surprises you again and again, if you are one of the people that figures out one of Light's many plans before it is revealed, you are one of the few and you will feel like a genius as well. That being said the replay value on this is shot down to a solid medium.\
Character development is one of the best of any anime I've seen. There's not much to say about sound, it fits. The openings and closings are good too, but the 2nd one is a little much even though it kind of fits. The art is fine especially for it's time but nothing special. I will say this though. These are the tallest anime characters of any anime I've ever seen! \
Enjoyment 10/10, you will not find many anime that will fit the 10/10 category in my books for this. It's one of those shows that will have you intrigued until the end. Even the 2nd part not being as good as the first will have you wanting more. Don't let the fact that the 1st part was a little better discourage you from enjoying the 2nd part as well. That being said you can just as easily stop watching in the middle because the 2 halves are split into almost completely different stories.\

    Death Note is the most popular anime on MAL, and one of the highest rated. The story follows Light Yagami, a guy who finds a book called the Death Note. If he writes a name in the Death Note, that person will die however the owner specified. \
For starters, the story is one of the best i've seen in an anime, and the show is very addicting. After each episode, your going to keep wanting more and more. The story does decrease in quality a bit in the final third of the anime. It seems as if it could have ended around episode 25, (if\
          \
        you've seen the show you know what I mean) but there are 12 episodes after that, and they don't live up to the previous episodes. The characters are extremely well written, and the show manages to make you care for them. Even though Light Yagami is a truly shitty person, he's one of the most well written anime characters i've seen.\
The animation/art is nothing special. I've seen better animation from shows that came out before this, and the show has a dull color palette. (though it does fit the mood of the show. The sound is pretty average as well. The background music fits well, but doesn't quite stand out. And while I loved the first opening, the second one is quite annoying. \
Overall, there is a reason Death Note is the number one most popular anime on MAL. It is something that will truly keep you interested the whole ride, even if the last 12 episodes are underwhelming compared to the ones that come before. \

    So, I was recommended this anime by my friend who's quite a weeb. Even though he kept telling me to watch it, I still avoided it and man I was so wrong to do it, I always thought anime can't be interesting as Real shows but this show went over all my expectations in the terms of story. Anyways, I've done too much chit-chat so I'll start writing my review now. It's Quite short tho cause I'll be just focusing on three things. Story, Art and Music.\
Story\
The main dish of this anime was its beautifully written story. Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata have explained the\
          \
        concepts of this anime and manga in a lucid manner. Most of the animes fail to adapt and manage many complex things of the actual source. But, this anime has beautifully caught everything that was presented in its manga from that little potato chips scene to Light's way of thinking. Both the characters L and Light has a different definition of the word \"JUSTICE\"\
Art\
It's art was not that different from all the other animes though I guess it was one of those first animes to use those blue-red effects, It was quite appealing to my eyes, tbh.\
Music\
The opening of this anime pretty good to hear and I think it fits to the theme of the anime. The background music that played during the intense moments were pretty dope and it kinds of gives you some intense feeling while it plays.\

    It really makes me happy to see a show with an interesting premise like Death Note take over the West by storm. It's something that breaks the norm and gets people to think rather than just to entertain. However the more pessimistic side of me underneath the surface makes me draw a skeptical eye towards something with a premise such as this that's actually this popular. So is it good? Despite how flawed and open ended that question is, yes. However it's a very tricky type of show to watch depending on your expectations. I went into the show and started watching it hoping to\
          \
        find an interesting gem about ethics and the implications of death. However as the show progressed it took off in a far different way with bits and pieces of the Note's philosophical implications scattered unevenly throughout. Given the fact that the initial premise was set up well enough to make both of these aspects of the show work, it's conclusion was underwhelming, and it's first and foremost a supernatural mystery thriller.\
Death Note is first and foremost a police story, not one about ethics.  It starts out as a story about a boy with a god complex and ends on the same note without much catharsis, but what's sandwiched in-between goes above and beyond the average mystery thriller. However instead of figuring out a mystery throughout the course of the show, it's all about the mental tension and conflict between the characters instead. It breaks the norm from other shows similar to it and focusing on Light trying to one-up everyone over solving the Kira killings.  This not only broke the norm but kept Light and L's mental battle interesting in the first half. Granted most of that happened through chance and internal monologues that ultimately don't uncover much, but Light and L's thought processes around the case were the most compelling part of the show, and I was surprised at how much creative power the writers put into each character. But I'll refuse to call the show a game between minds. The processes themselves are what interested me, not what plot they brought forward. While much of the plot is fun to watch much of what happens is all a little to convenient to be taken 100 percent seriously. Calling Death Note a show about mind games is like calling a lottery ticket a sodoku puzzle; it uses chances and coincidences to move the plot forward instead of taking a strand of evidence found by the characters and having the plot unfold from that. The chances and coincidences made the show interesting and compelling to watch, but the climax is just a boring game of jenga. Many of the plot devices don't lead up to a lot, and I was hoping for more answers about how the Kira killings were affecting society at large. I also wanted to know more about the Shinigami realm, because if they can put rules in the Death Note does their realm have rules too? Both were interesting aspects of the show that would have evened out all the creative brain that the show had with a little bit of message and heart.\
In terms of surface level stuff, Death Note is a very aesthetically sound show. It knows what it wants to do with it's art and sound and for the most part it does it really well. The characters designs are all creative in their own way outfit-wise and facially, and for a show that boasts quite the large cast of characters you always see more than once, this makes the aesthetic great through and through. Other shows tend to introduce more and more characters and their designs are generally carbon copies of each other or mirror characters from other shows, which make them feel like a weaker clone (for example L and Near) of the original than an entirely new character. And for a show in an urban setting where costumes and characters are more 'normal' it's noteworthy that the creators don't recycle character ideas often. The normalcy of the character design choices also makes the presence of the not-normal Shinigami even more even more jarring to the characters and the way the gods of death move the show along. They also make brilliantly mysterious and dark urban setting of the show grittier. The feel of the setting adds an extra layer of depth to the dark subject matter of the show. Even during the daytime and in the business meeting scenes there's an eerie filter over everything despite the obvious light sources.  However while the art and character design is good at reflecting the dark nature of the show, the choir singing during the action scenes was very cool but far overstayed its welcome. The music in the show isn't much to be praised, but the second intro is so good and plays reflects the chaotic nature of the second half of the show so it almost makes up for the repetitive background music.\
For the most part I really did like the characters. For me many of the background police officers and L were well defined as people. L is by far the most reasonable and fleshed out character in the show who is the most grounded in the reasons for is actions and why he's so peculiar. The fact that he doesn't get out much and is smarter than all the other characters is clearly established, makes the most sense, and makes him the most likeable character in his peculiarity. Same goes for Ryuk, he's a well defined, delightfully simple, and has a very Tim Burton quality to his character. However my problems with the characters lay in Light and Misa, as to why anyone would call either likeable is beyond me. Light in particular irritated me. He has this plan to be a god, but why? Its hard to not think of him as an angsty teen sociopath and possible Atlas Shrugged-thumper without giving him reasoning and introspection behind the more controversial killings of people who want to get in his way. It's even harder to like a character like that, let alone watch them go on said merry way for 37 episodes without some eye rolling. However the positive that both Light and L share is that they both have a full arc and are backed up by supporting and background characters that are simple, but aren't just names on paper.  The problem is that I can't say the same about major players in the second half like Mello and Near, who serve as inherent antagonists rather than interesting contributors for the story's sake. The imagery of the toys and trains did good to represent Near's childlike mind and brilliance, but like I said before there's all brain and no heart to he and Mello's rivalry. So while some of the characters are good, they don't bear full arcs that are relevant to the overarching story, and make the second half of the show significantly weaker than the first.\
While Death Note is flawed it's by no means a bad show. It could have been fleshed out far more and far exceeded with the brilliant supernatural drama that it tries to get across. The flaws of the show don't outweigh the pure originality invention engine that it is. The problem it suffers from is reaching for the cookie jar without taking the necessary steps to reach to the top of the refrigerator. Instead likes talking about how it's going to do it rather than taking the climb, but the plotting and talking sure is entertaining.\

    \"Death Note\" is one of those anime that achieved huge amount of fame as a manga, so its incredible success as an anime always had a feeling of inevitability about it. I first heard about it a couple of years prior to its release, when a few of my friends were reading the manga. Unfortunately for me, a couple of them discussing the \"Death Note\" manga right in front of me gave away a big plot point that occurs mid series. At the time I didn't mind, as I don't really read manga, but I was a bit peeved when I learnt about the anime\
          \
        adaptation. The information I had been made aware of is arguably the biggest turning point in the entire story, and I also remember my friends saying that they'd lost all interest in it right after that development. At the time, I was skeptical that one event could have such a big impact on the series, but now that I've watched the anime, I found that my friends were right all along.\
\"Death Note\" is an anime of two halves. Though saying that is a bit misleading since the two \"halves\" are unequal in size. The really good part of Death Note probably only extends as far as the first third of the series... and it's all downhill from then on. But, man, WHAT a good part it is! That section by itself is probably more than a match for the best parts of any anime I've ever watched, and is enough to catapult the anime into my personal A-list... and most other people's too, judging from its reception.\
The opening episode wastes little time in setting up the scene, and though the premises may be a little gimmicky, and the dramatising occasionally over zealous (the main character Light writes with so much aggression and vigour, you'd half expect him to leave blazing trails of fire behind his pen), the intrigue and potential are there in buckets, and I was hooked straight way. \
This probably isn't the first anime to ask controversial questions of justice and morality, of whether it's right for a person to take the law into his own hands and pass judgement onto others, but \"Death Note\" takes this concept and puts a fresh twist on it, and this twist comes in the form of the Light. Light is the protagonist of the show, but here's the catch - he's not the hero, he's the villain. He's a villain that unhesitatingly abuses that power that comes into his hands, and goes on a ruthless killing spree, all in the name of justice. And does the world become a better place as a result of his actions? It's a point that can be fiercely debated, but I actually think it does, and I think with some subtle changes Light can easily be portrayed as an anti-hero instead. Initially, he doesn't appear to be a completely bad guy, but power corrupts, and he seems to become less and less human as the series progressed, with his actions becoming more and more extreme. I think the series did a most excellent job at portraying his moral deterioration.\
Light's popularity amongst the rabid fan community is only matched (and perhaps even exceeded) by his opposite number L, the autistic detective prodigy, who is put in charge of the investigation to find the person who's been killing off all the criminals (don't worry, this isn't really a spoiler - this all gets set up within like the first 2 episodes). A fascinating character in his own right, L glows with a strange kind of magnetism despite being, put it bluntly, a bit of a weirdo. I get the feeling that L is more concerned with solving the puzzle and winning the battle of wits rather than bringing a criminal to justice. On the surface, Light and L are very different, however, underneath there are striking similarities between their personalities. Perhaps counter intuitively, they're on opposite sides of this battle *because of* rather than despite of their similarities - add their stubborn competitiveness to their similarities and you naturally get the effects of mixing two volatile chemicals together. In the interest of the anime, the two are like a pairing made in heaven. Sparks begins to fly immediately - even before the two meets face to face - and the series explodes forth at a demonic pace. About 8 episodes in, I was thinking to myself \"this is unbelievable... it's actually still getting better with each episode\". My friends shared the same sentiment - at the rate it was going, it was heading towards being the best anime ever by miles... surely something had to give.\
And unfortunately it did. Unable to sustain the astronomical increase in suspense and excitement, the anime soon peaked, and actually started going into decline before the Event-That-Was-Spoilt-For-Me... it's just that the drop was even steeper after that aforementioned event. Looking back on it, I guess it was inevitable, given that a lot of the fun parts came about because of the bizarre way the Death Note (the object, not the anime) operates, making Light fiendishly hard to catch. Once that trick is revealed, the anime was always gonna struggle to prevent the remaining story from becoming less interesting, even without taking into account the difficulty of matching the dizzying heights of the earlier episodes. Having said that, the revelation concerning the Death Note is not the culprit behind the anime's first sign of decline. The first decline was brought about by a development in the storyline that broke up the psychological cat-and-mouse game played between Light and L, a routine that had served the series so well up to that point. Instead, they went off to chase after some random villain that no one really cares about (this is also known as the Yotsuba arc). The whole mood of the anime changes for the worst from that point on. Not only had the tension almost completely broken, the anime also started fancying itself as some kind of cheap comedy, throwing in more and more \"comic\" moments, mostly involving that hugely irritating walking-fanservice-doll Misa Misa and that good-for-nothing Matsuda. Whilst previously, the occasional comic moments involving L seemed appropriate to his character and did not detract from the suspense, the new wave of comedy greatly grated on my nerves.\
The somewhat dull Yotsuba arc eventually ended, and was soon followed by the Event-That-Was-Spoilt-For-Me (not that I'm bitter or anything), and though the incident itself was executed extremely well (with the exception of the foot massage scene aimed to provoke high pitched screaming from the fangirls), the series really takes a nose dive after that. What exactly went wrong in the final arc? Well, it's hard to know where to start - \"Death Note\" pretty much deteriorated in all aspects: First thing to note is that both the opening and ending theme turns into screaming rage metal (or whatever pretentiously named genre that brand of \"music\" is classed as) songs (and I use that word loosely) that are painful to the ears. No doubt it's an attempt to make the anime seem more \"edgy\". What a disaster that is - it certainly made me more edgy, frequently putting me in foul mood even before the episodes properly started. After that, there's the story that becomes totally unbelievable. Granted, even in the beginning, there were occasions in the storyline that bordered on the ridiculous (the whole farce involving Light and his packet of potato chips for example), but in the final part the it becomes so \"out there\" that the whole series starts to feel little surreal - that monkey business involving a stealth missile that's untrackable by satellite and launches from some secret underground base is just... I'm actually at a loss for words that can describe how ludicrous that is.\
Then there's that set of oh-so-original new characters that gets introduced. Mellow and Near are just poor copies of L. What's with the \"eccentric habits\" that all these \"genius kids\" seem to have? With L, it all seems quite natural and original, but Mellow and L has to come along and spoil it all. Mellow's habit of munching chocolate is like a big sign saying \"hey look! Obsessively eating chocolate is my unique vice!\" Near is even worse, constantly playing with his toys despite his serious mannerisms. I mean, I can accept him playing puzzle games as those are mentally challenging to a certain degree, but... lego men?!? Whilst L's behaviour can be excused because of his childish streak, Near doesn't even look like he's enjoying playing with his kiddish toys. Like Mellow, it seems like he's only playing for the sake of doing something that would give him a distinguishing trait. Furthermore, L's methods for solving cases reminds me of Sherlock Holmes, because he explains every step in his thinking clearly and everything makes perfect logical sense. In comparison, Near is more like a character from some second-rate detective novel - a lot of the time he just seem to make mental leaps of faith without indicating how he made the logical connections. The overwhelming sense of intelligence and logic built up by the anime's fantastic early work starts to crumble at this point thanks to Near and his lucky guesses. Mellow and Near are just cheap copy cats that are inferior to L in just about every way - I had to nod in agreement when Light commented that they are nothing to compared to L. No doubt that, given the immense popularity of L, the creator attempted to replicate the success with these new characters. You know those bands that scores a huge hit with their debut single, and follow up with a couple of songs that are really similar to that first hit, but are no where near as good? Well, that's pretty much what Mellow and Near are. Just as those follow up singles often end up being flops, so too does Mellow and Near fall well short of capturing the viewers' imagination in the same way L did. \
Not only does the new characters fail to impress, many old characters got worse: I mentioned earlier that Lights seems to get less and less human... well, what I didn't mention back then is that he seems to get more and more stupid too (one of the main causes for the psychological warfare losing it's earlier potency) - maybe mentally duelling with Near's lack of logic caused Light to become more retarded. Meanwhile Misa Misa evolves into Ultra Annoying Misa Misa (I didn't think it was possible for her to get any more annoying, so hats off for achieving this epic feat), and L... err... through no fault of his own, L's image kind of got cheapened by the mere presence of Mellow and Near. Yeah, that's how bad they are.\
I guess all my ranting must have made the latter parts of Death Note seem absolute pants. But from a more objective point of view, it isn't. It did not fall much short of being decent even during the weakest points of the series. The series retained its strong dramatisation elements throughout. Epic background music aside, it often cleverly uses subtle sounds to create tension - one of my friends used one for his mobile phone ring tone, and everyone instantly recognised it... it just goes to show how powerful these little things can be. The fantastic use of colours to contrast between the opposing characters is still there, and the awesome artwork, especially the designs for the shinigumis, continues to impress. The disappointment is because the later parts fail to measure up against the lofty standard set by the first - the fact that it felt so bad says more about the utter brilliance of its first arc than anything else. By the sheer merit of the first arc alone, Death Note manages to justify all the hype surrounding it, THAT'S how good it is. If you haven't seen this yet, well, where have you been?!\

    When I first heard of Death Note I honestly didn't think I was going to like it. But I can honestly say it is an amazing anime. In fact it's probably one of favorites. The plot is great, and there are so many unexpected twists and turns in the anime. It's got an over all dark atmosphere but if you ask me there are a few funny moments in there too. Not to mention the graphics are great.  I highly recommend this to anyone no matter what your tastes in anime are.\

    Death Note is one of, if not the best suspense anime ever made. It's fanbase is quite a good indicator of how well this series is written out. Death Note is one of the deepest and exciting anime of recent history., and it brings out a lot of suspense that few might have experienced when watching an anime.\
Story: One of the reasons Death Note is a really popular anime is because of the unique story it offers. It may start simple at first, but as episodes continue to go, you can really get yourself hooked. It starts with Light Yagami, a college student, finds the\
          \
        Death Note and meets his shinigami, Ryuk. Realizing the power in his hands, Light decides to use it to punish criminals and create a world free of evil. Nobody can prevent him from killing criminals, except a detective named L, who becomes his greatest enemy in the course of the series. It starts getting bad, though, during the later part of the series when some changes were made to the cast. That arc really drew out the anime longer, yet it did not have the excitement the first arc really gave the viewers. Still, the story deserves a 10 for the unique way it was presented.\
Art: Art is very well done in the series. The color schemes, the way the characters are drawn, and the appearance of locations in the anime are really good. Death Note offers good effects and lighting which are quite easy on the eyes despite it being one of the darkest and most suspenseful anime out there.\
Sound: The soundtrack fits the series very well, from the opera-style background music to the anime themes. The opening themes really fit the mood of the anime. The first opening sounds like a typical anime theme and it represents Light's ideals and the power he gained from acquiring the Death Note. The second opening though, probably is the most intense anime opening ever made. There were heavy drumming and screams all over the song. This might not please some viewers, but I think it really gave a good representation of the mood of the show at that time, because that is when Light starts his descent into madness due to his power.\
Character: Character design and development are amazing in this anime. You hve Light Yagami, who is a typical college student, who wants to rid the world of evil by using his Death Note. Light acts in a \"The end justifies the means\" way in his quest to purge the world of evil. Next, you have L Lawliet, the world's greatest detective, who is also the person who keeps trying to catch Light as Kira for episode after episode. Those two are probably the most intellectual characters I have seen on an anime. Light has the Death Note and the popularity. L, on the other hand, is highly intelligent and has a lot of connections worldwide.\
Enjoyment: The series is very enjoying in its chess-like element. The series basically comprises of Light and L trying to outsmart each other. L tries to prove that Light is the Kira, while Light tries to prevent himself from being exposed. This anime will keep you on the edge of your seats. The excitement slows down during the second arc, though, with the major character changes made. Still, the first arc more than covers up for it. The anime also presents some questions that makes you question Light's approach. Is it right to deliver a quick justice to criminals by killing them immediately, which by the way, can also be considered murder. Can the criminals not change and not deserve a second chance? Death Note presents such thoughts that make you think deep.\
I would have to agree with the majority in one aspect of this anime: Death Note could very well be the best anime ever made. This anime does not have a typical \"good vs evil\" approach, since both characters can neither be analyzed as good or evil. Light wants to make the world a better place by killing criminals. L is willing to go through extreme measures to stop Light from continuing his work as Kira. The anime is really an intellectual masterpiece, and the realisitc settings would make one wonder if Death Notes really could exist. Death Note is an anime with an effective and unique way of creating anticipation and suspense through its many story plots and how Light and L think of their next move in their battle. Death Note is a top recommedation for anyone wanting to get into anime, and 9 times out of 10, you will not be disappointed. \

Edit 1: This was proven wrong by my friend Rachel. Rule XII and XIII clear this up. http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Rules_of_the_Death_Note for more. Ratings appropriately updated.\
(My strongest point has been disproved, more than anything the misuse of characters and lack of depth to most characters with only one unique characteristic about them is my biggest issue)\
The entire main part of the show is the highly constructed twists/developments and psychological battles. With almost every single episode however, Light would continue to demolish and adapt at incredible rates to every single problem with zero almost nonexistent hesitation. Put under HEAVY AS HELL FIRE constantly over 36 episodes he has full-proof responses to each and every single problem often even making split second decisions with impressive responses. Then you're telling me he cracks at the end out of the blue all because he's SUPER EXCITED it's all going to be over and jumps the gun early when he doesn't even handle it the way he explains and seeks out.\
\"Everyone who knows about the death note in one place, all will be dead.\" You're kidding me right... there's still one factor, Mikami is the wild card, he has shown his own desire (get to that later) and has failed multiple times. There's no way Light would trust more intellectual people than the dumb-witted half-retard Amane, even then, FUCK THAT BITCH KILL HER! He could have literally just instructed Mikami to write in his name as well and get to see the names well after the kill time and abuse Mikami's god eyes and wrote in all their names on his own when he had time and was comfortable.\
Could have kicked back and wrote all their names after. I'm a college dropout with no career path and dogshit intellectual power in comparison to the character of Light and upon seeing the last episode go through I couldn't help but feel smarter than this character I had held so high up with L. L's death was not something he himself didn't see coming, he was beaten and he knew he was beaten and it was extremely bittersweet but he would have had to break his own code to beat Light and in the end, he refused to. \
In the final, 4 people of US detectives and 5 people of Japan detectives meet up. 'N' tells light that there are 4 people, Light does not verify that and has shown ZERO EVIDENCE that he even knows any/all of the agents beforehand. 'N' could have hidden and brought a fake person in his or any of the agents place. How can Light be so sure? HOW? You're fucking kidding me right?\
You're telling me that this titan of mind games is thwarted with a swap, let alone bringing in massive amounts of undefined characters to create holes for Light's failure to succeed like Mikami's self thinking idiocy that should have been caught IMMEDIATELY UPON HIM STATING HIS OWN DESIRES TO KILL NEW TYPES OF PEOPLE SOMETHING THAT KIRA HASN'T DICTATED, HE'S WILLINGLY STEPPING OUT OF \"GOD'S WILL\" ON HIS OWN ACCORD, that shows he's a shit lackey. COME ON WRITERS... SERIOUSLY? \
Now a more nit picky issue is the fact that every single character in this show is SUPER FUCKING SIMPLE... none of them are that complex besides L and Light and even then are really not that unique. All the characters have a specific string they follow and never stray from.\
More than anything, this show's usage of the character L was extremely lackluster. There's a reason that many people drop the show after episode 24. The bullshit successor that is what.. a brother of L? All raised in an orphanage. The existence of Mello and N just felt so... god... just extremely lackluster and A N I M E bullshit introductions/designs.\
1-24 even with the terrible ryuk book issue giving vision: 7-8\
23-37 so many inconsistencies and retarded decisions by Light: 2-3\
Average of 7 is generous as fuck.\
All in all, disappointing especially for what this show could have been. If you can turn your brain off, you'll love this show even after 24\

    *Note that this is my first review so it may not be done really well*\
Death note, probably one of the most popular anime series out there, has continued to be a fan favorite even though it was released more than a decade ago.  For that time, it was regarded as a magnificent piece of fiction and made a huge splash in the anime world. It is often cited as one of the many gateway anime to bring people into watching anime and many people have paraded it as a masterpiece. However, it has been almost 3 years since I've watched it and now that\
          \
        I have watched a decent number of anime, I thought that I should write a review for it now since I now believe that my judging skills have improved.\
Firstly, if I had to mention what made this series so good great in the first place, it definitely would be thriller aspect of the series. Like no joke, even when I check out few clips few clips from the show when I'm bored, I get drawn in so easily that I start thinking I'm watching an anime episode instead of a small clip; and it manages to this time and time again. The episodes are so well written, they never feel to rushed or slow and progress at a good pace. Another one of the factors which made the episodes so great would definitely be the characters. It's always a joy to see the psychology of them and see how they think through the various situations. The 2 main characters in the first half are so brilliantly crafted that there is never a moment when you can't feel the atmosphere created by them. Light, the main protagonist of the series is probably one of the most complex characters I've ever seen in any anime. Getting to see how he thinks and approaches the many tough situations he's always put in is a treat to watch. The main antagonist, L, is no different as well; probably one of the weirdest characters in the show, he has a very childish demeanor while at the same time being the greatest detective in the world, instantly making him a fan favourite.\
The terrific writing of the show is also complimented by the brilliantly composed score. The tracks used in the show make almost each scene in the show very immersive, ranging from the monologues of the main characters to the dangerous plans executed by L throughout the series. Though some tracks were very monotonous and plain, all and all it was a delight to listen to. Along with the ost, the voice actors played their characters really well adding a sense of depth to them. The art is beautiful and there are rarely ever sections in the show which are unappealing to look at. Not to mention, the animation is also pretty fluid which is pretty impressive for an anime that was released in 2006.\
However despite all the good things this show has, I still it belive it is a bit too far to be called a masterpiece. Despite all the things it does right, there are few gripes I have with the anime specifically and will be addressing below.\
Now before I proceed, since this is my first review, I would like to say that I prioritize story and characters in a show and also how much I enjoyed the show. The reason I'm mentioning this is so that you, the viewer, can understand where I'm coming from when I present what gripes I had with the show\
To start off, the cast. Notice how I specifically mentioned the main characters above? That was because unlike the leads, the remaining cast are never really fleshed out and not very memorable. In a way, that wasn't a bad thing since the intensity of Light and L's rivalry never wavered in the series. However, this resulted in creating a plethora of characters who seemed to have no purpose in the story. Even though some of them contributed to advancing the plot at certain points, they were mostly underdeveloped and dull (basically one dimensional). This is especially showing in the second half of the show, where the writing was poorer compared to the first half. This in turn also effected the quality of the story; it felt like as if the writers weren't really giving their best and felt rather underwhelming. Along with this, certain arcs in the series were dragged out longer than they should have, resulting in it being boring. Complimenting this is the fact that the anime skimmed over many small details in the manga in the second half which took away from the overall experience. \
All in all, death note is a damn good show with good writing. Even with it's few problems, it still manages to stand tall as a widely appreciated anime in an era where anime is struggling to reach good levels of quality. It's accessible, thrilling and a really well done psychological anime and I cannot  recommend this series enough, especially those who want to start watching anime.\

    One of the most interesting manga titles to come around for some time, Deathnote presents the reader with some very heady subjects you might not expect, such as morality, the nature of good and evil and some great social commentary.\
From the pages of the manga to the silver screen and then to the small screen. Manga = breathtaking, Film = groundbreaking, Anime = phenomenal.\
Death Note the anime is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time. The storyline is amazing but not complicated or cliché. Like the film and manga, it depicts the cat and mouse hunt between L and\
          \
        Light on who will uncover one another's identity.\
Death Note is a cake; everything good about a cake; and therefore people should see this landmark. Overall, Death Note will remain a classic forever... \

    The most best quote that can describe this anime is \"With great power , comes great responsibility\" . The anime itself is showing us what could great power do to a human whose knowledge are godlike . Death Note make me watch the whole 37 episodes in one go . Enough said , its one of my memorable anime ever .\
Story:9\
The story start with a highschool student , Light Yagami , who discover a book that contains the power of death . This book grant its user the ability to kill anyone whose face and names that the user know . That kind of power\
          \
        give the user a big burden because human would always want more than just what he or she have . The story plot in Death Note were perfect . beside a few things that bother me a little , it deserve 9 from me\
Art:8\
The arts and animation are nice . Some animation are able to capture my interest . Some are just plain for me . But nonetheless , the arts does have a flaw but not much\
Sound:10\
The voice actor and actress were perfect . Nothing that stress me or anything . The OP and ED were flawless . It was so good that i instantly download it on my smartphone . A perfect 10 from me\
Character:\
Almost all of the characters did capture my interest . A few that capture my interest are Light Yagami himself , Ryuk , Lawliet L , Gelus and Teru Mikami . Teru is like L apprentice . Teru is almost as crazy as Light . While Light is too damn crazy if you ask me . The are also a few characters that almost capture my interest but it will just be a spoiler if i keep going . Every characters does have its background and a reason why it exist . So , a perfect 10 for the character plot\
Enjoyment:10\
I enjoy the anime . No episodes that make me stop watching or anything . There are a few comedy but not enough to make you laugh . There was a drama for me at the end of the episode . Those who adore Yagami will understand . It didn't make me cry but it makes me feel sorry for Yagami and his father . Poor soul :'(\
Overall:10\
Death Note brings joy in a maniac way . Where powers were given to a human whose knowledge are above mere mortal . Whose ambition is a bit nuts . Either way , Death Note is a must watch for me .\

    Death Note is one of the best anime's ever to have aired and it is correctly rated as one of the top 50 anime's of all time. It is an anime that you simply should not miss. It sent me on a craze for it. Though I have watched it after all this time, I realize that I shouldn't have waited this long. The characters have been represented incredibly and the storyline is what I would call \"The Plot Of The Decade\". Don't miss watching this. \

    I can safely say that death note is one of the best anime of all time and there will be hardly any anime that will ever rival it. \
The story enraptures the viewer from the start till the end. I have never seen a plot that is this exciting and damning ever. The story is well thought out with a pace that is not that fast that it makes the viewers doubt and not that slow that it makes it boring. It is just perfect.\
The best thing about this anime is that without you even knowing, it makes you root for the villian. \
The animation\
          \
        is alright and is what you would expect from any normal anime.\
This is an anime that will draw you in from the first episode and will keep you on your heels till the end.\
It is unpredictable in a good way and makes the viewer think out of the box. As this anime is shown from the perspective of a serial killer, it also helps in understanding the psychology behind his kills. And that is the greatest accomplishment of this anime. \
Overall, Death note is an exceptionally good anime and i would definitely watch it over and over again. \

    *This is a spoilerfree review*\
Death Note is one of the absolute best thriller/suspense anime I have watched to date.\
The story is so well written that you will never be able to stay a step ahead which is often possible in less thought out plots, and as you think you know what the next move will be, it will take you somewhere completely different and keep you on the edge of your seat.\
As for the characters the only thing I can say is that they truly are amazingly balanced and so, oh so intriguing. \
It is not everyday you find an anime where you honestly do\
          \
        not know if you are on the good or the bad side right up until the very end. \
In my opinion a great anime that needs to be given a shot by everyone!\

Summary:\
          \

I was so close to giving this a 10/10 rating but i just couldn't do it. The third act just drops it down a point for losing that flame it had, you know. I thought a lot about 'what if it just ended two thirds in the anime, would it had been better??' I came to this conclusion, no this anime needs a better third act and as much as the first two acts where masterfully crafted it wouldn't be enough on its own. Other than that this is by far one of the best anime ever created ( in my opinion ) Just the amount of moments it had me glued to the screen at the edge of my seat, captivated by what might happen next is enough for me to recommend this anime to nearly anyone. I am also pleased to say I felt like a God writing this review cuz I had the soundtrack play in the background, what O .O the music makes you feel like a badass with what ever you're doing . . . \

    I can't help but think that Death Note's acclaim came too early. Viewers should have waited until the story concluded before bestowing it with accolades, because the second half of the series completely falls apart after a brilliant start. The engine driving the show (Light versus L in a duel of the wits) breaks down, leaving the viewer feeling cheated out of what they were promised at the start. I will do my best to state my complaints without spoiling the progression of events, but it's impossible to discuss without at least alluding to it, so you've been warned. \
The first problem I have is\
          \
        mainly a matter of taste. The only female character in the series is the single most frustrating character I have ever seen in storytelling of any kind. Film, TV, books, videogames, you fuckin' name it. I have never wanted to put my hands around someone's throat more than Misa's, and I almost quit watching the series because of it. Every appearance she made, I would question myself: Why are you watching this in your valuable spare time? Do you want to spend your weekends and evenings angry? Some could argue that she is an excellent character FOR this reason--that she is written to incite these feelings and so she is a successful character. Frankly, IDGAF. She is hands down the most insulting female character I have ever seen and the strength of the story, in the end, could not make up for sitting through hours of her nonsense.\
This brings me to my second major complaint about the story which is impossible to discuss without spoiling things at least a little, so maybe just skip this paragraph if you haven't committed to watching the series yet. My complaint is this: A character dies and the story renders this moment utterly meaningless because the character is immediately replaced with an identical character who behaves the same and fills the same role. A character dies and nothing changes or is achieved by it. That's writing for shock value. That's writing to betray your viewers. That's not writing that gives your story what it needs. After that event, the story starts to crumble because the engine driving it is broken. The new characters serve as carbon-copy replacements, but the viewer receives even less insight into their decision-making processes, and as a result, the mental chess match starts to feel more like a magical telepathic guessing-game. Conclusions are jumped to without being reasoned through, and the believability of the story suffers. \
Further, the story rapidly gets out of hand around the middle of the series. Between the number of conditions, rules, and exceptions the viewer is expected to juggle in-mind and the number of times the Death Note changes hands, things get unnecessarily confusing and convoluted. I still swear there's a huge plot hole in there somewhere, but I'm never going to watch it a second time to pick it out. Suffice it to say that I think convoluted story-telling has a time and place (E.g., Baccano!), but that it's in poor taste to deliberately confuse your viewers. Confuse your characters and allow your audience to sort out the story through them as the characters learn what's going on, but don't keep your audience in the dark while all your characters understand what's happening. That's just inconsiderate writing.\
A final, surface-level complaint is that while the style of art is well-crafted, the series is visually quite boring. An enormous amount of screentime is spent watching the main characters stare blankly and think about stuff, and there's very little movement and dynamism in the rest of it to make up for this. I feel that this story was probably better-served by the manga than the animation. That said, the voice-acting is ace and the soundtrack is rad as fuck and I'm gonna listen to it more times than I'm gonna watch the actual show.\
In sum, Death Note is an excellent premise with emotionally-engaging characters that has a strong first half, but splutters out in its second leg. I recommend watching it once just to know what the phenomenon is about, but spend your re-watches elsewhere.\

    Presumably the most expected anime of the 2006/2007 Winter season, and the new year Death Note conveys story components and an intelligent honesty that is all the more generally seen in your collegeate scholarly classics than your ordinary Shounen Jump title. \
The story is about the uprightness of mortal equity guy who successively esteemed in a general sense imperfect by corrupt, limited limit of man and their profoundly ruooted feeling of pride and grandiosity. The lead character Light is the incarnation of this talk, a once apparently immaculate character determined to fixation on the idea of getting to be similar to a divine being. Right\
          \
        away his plans are conventional -attackers, kid molesters, serial executioners -should bite the dust and die, correct? The world would be better without them, correct? Putting such power under the control of a mortal- -as immaculate as Light may be- -debases, as history demonstrates over and over. \
Going with the Death Note is its unique holder, the Shinigami Ryuk. Instead of being ethically bound to Light or serving as an inner voice or aide, Ryuk sticks around just to be an onlooker -declaring people to be \"fascinating.\" \
While this itself makes for a fascinating plot, what truly makes Death Note a top bore arrangement are the characters who cause an obstacle to Light's main goal. Topping the cast is the fan-most loved L, whose character is simply past portrayal. A shady, puzzling, however sort of capricious virtuoso, L is likely the main personality that could match the conspiring Light. The feline and-mouse strategic maneuver between the two youngsters is tempting and arresting, making you giggle (not for comic drama's purpose) and keeps you settled on every casing, absorbing all the subtle elements and envisioning the following move. The delightful, yet grievous Misa is an alternate holder of a Death Note, and gets to be woefully captivated by Light and loyally does his offering, while in the meantime debilitating his invulnerability to the team following him down. \
This is just inside the initial ten scenes or thereabouts. This arrangement is basic enough for anybody to see, however in the meantime profound enough and cunning enough for those searching for something truly substantial to sink their teeth into. Moreover, this arrangement offers something that relatively few different arrangement do- -an ethical problem. Consider the possibility that we had a Death Note. Would we utilize it? How would we utilize it? Is it true that it is conceivable to utilize it without transforming into what Light gets to be? \
Its creation qualities abandon me with nothing to grumble about. A top-offering arrangement like Death Note, in the same way as Nana and other well known manga titles, have a commitment to its fans to provide for them something that is quality work. The activity is smooth, the character plans are steadfast and truly bring life to the characters. The music is awesome, and some of anime's top seiyuu are among the cast. You truly can't have a better arrangement. What's more this is originating from a Christian- -I am not in any way annoyed by this arrangement, it is a phenomenal philosophical and religious situation. \
What about taking a gander at this arrangement as social analysis? Any side of the political range or anybody with any sort of religious connection can discover interesting issue issues that make for phenomenal discourse. This is an arrangement that will make you think. It's more than simply latent diversion, however it is simply what you make it. That is the magnificence of Death Note. What's more luckily, it sparkles splendidly through the offensiveness that is without a doubt to go to its characters. Enjoyment has to be 10/10 for me and I would recommend anybody to watch this.\

This review is more fot the people who finished death note\
Story: 10/10\
when i started to watch death note i thought that it would be a super massacre anime like elfen lied or something. You see Light pick up the book and later shinigami's starts fall from the sky i mean you couldnt imagine it different. But than it evolves in a great triller. And even after the 26 episode you still see mastermind battler between Light and N. To put it short you are mind blown for whole anime.\
L (Lawliet):\
this is dedicated for you L. You are the real MVP.\
          \
        Through the anime L never cease to amaze me. His first scene already tells you that he thinks more like a alien than human. He finds out Light like a walk in a park. And even i didnt completely belive it. But when i checked again what he sad i was just stunned. Everything made sence. What im trying to say is that L is in my opinion the best character in his category (mastermind). We never knew much about L and in anime you never see flashbacks or memories of L. But thats not the problem cause as long L is alive you just wanna watch him. Every cutscene of him is like the best cake in the world. And even after he died he left behind another L but that one has more white hair than him probably older (jk is N dont hate him)\
L's dead to all the fans out there:\
Death note is not all about L. Even tho i just compliment him for 5 minutes its just not all that anime can give. Think like that: L was fighting Light. They were both smart just that L had the police power and could do much more than Light. Light on the other side couldn't afford mistake's. But Light has advantage death note. L has the police, Light has super powers. And we can all agree that L won the battle he won it all before his death. What coverd Light was his dad. If he wouldn't be around Light would die in  12 episodes and that would end death note. But in the end L dies witch leads us to N. So his death wasn't in vain. Or to be more straight anime couldnt continue. If light wouldn't find death note and would be stuck with L forever anime would never finish. So don't be butthurt cause L died\
Tnx for wasting your time or reading\

                          \
    While I was watching Death Note, there were many questions which kept popping up in my head, with the main one being, of course — \"why did it take me so long to get to this show?\"\
Since it first came out 10 years ago, I have not only heard about this anime and its concept (as well as its huge fan base), but have also constantly stumbled upon drawings, pictures, merchandise and many other things depicting L, Misa, and Light Yagami as well as the Death Note itself. Even though that should come as no surprise for a show that has managed to earn many\
          \
        awards (including cultural ones), beat a few records and top numerous lists, there has been many a time when I have come across an anime which was praised by pretty much everyone, but which I simply couldn't enjoy, appreciate, or even relate to in any way. This was not the case with Death Note, however. \
Beautifully unpredictable, masterfully consistent and dangerously addictive, Death Note is a show unlike any other. Although \"unpredictability\" and \"consistency\" may seem like contradictory terms, the former has to do with the plot while the latter has to do with the overall quality of the anime. Sometimes you see a show which starts out great then quickly loses momentum and essentially commits suicide (Sword Art Online)  while others you see one which takes forever to become even remotely interesting (Clannad, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, etc.) Thankfully, Death Note is neither one of those, for it manages to turn its compelling premise into a story that unravels at the perfect pace and in a gorgeous fashion, hence creating an anime experience unlike any other. \
While most will admit that the second half/arc/whatever of this anime was not as good as the first and may have even been created solely for the sake of prolonging it, it's still pretty entertaining and far better than most of the shows I've ever seen. Furthermore, I also appreciated the fact that the writers would occasionally change and spice things up by introducing new characters, removing others (whether permanently or temporarily), and even making them lose and regain their powers. Although there were a few times when I didn't like the direction the show had taken, it still kept me watching and on the edge of my seat during pretty much every episode. \
Given these changes as well as the constant plot twists and cliffhangers, it was impossible to get bored while watching it (and most of the time to predict what would happen, too). With a story so powerful, it would have been easy for the creators to \"not bother\" or simply \"be lazy\" about all the other aspects of the show (i.e. art, animation, voice acting, and music), but \"lazy\" is a word that is probably not in the Japanese vocabulary. \
Although I initially disliked the rather realistic art and the very dull color palette, it definitely grew on me as it evolved and developed over time. Besides the rather creepy-looking and disturbing shinigami, there were other characters and scenes (especially in the beginning) which I legitimately thought to be ugly, though a more precise term would probably be visually unappealing. Consequently, I greatly appreciated it when light and color were cleverly used to highlight certain characters or define certain moments (e.g. the graduation ceremony with the falling Sakura petals). Overall, the edgy art definitely complimented the edgy story and characters really well, while the special effects used for the writing, death, and other \"action\" scenes were subtle yet striking. \
Another aspect which was used subtly and cleverly was undoubtedly the music, for it added drama, suspense and emphasis to many important moments without being overbearing. The addition of choir singing as well as the sound of ringing bells was also lovely and fit in with the many biblical themes and references featured in this anime. As a result, the soundtrack and music used in this show stay in your mind as a great aspect of the show but not as its only positive or most important one (as in Madoka, for example). \
Furthermore, both openings and endings are also very appropriate and are likely to bring back memories of the anime whenever  you hear them. Again, I was not initially a fan, but as I heard them repeatedly, I really started to enjoy them and was actually sad to see the first opening and ending being replaced with the other ones. Although I would never listen to that kind of metal/screamo stuff on its own, I must admit that it fit the overall mood and tone of the show really well and was therefore tolerable. \
Last but not least, I would also like to point out the fabulous voice acting which made this show so great. Despite already being a fan of Mamoru Miyano before watching Death Note, I was pretty excited to listen to his work here as it has been praised by many and is deemed to be one of his best roles of all time. In the beginning, it didn't seem particularly remarkable, but as the show went on and Light started expressing more and more complex emotions and found himself in more and more difficult situations, Miyano's acting definitely shined through and made the character really come to life. L's character offers a nice contrast to this by having an almost  deadpan tone of voice most of the time, as does Misa's with her ridiculously sweet and sugary one. The rest of the cast are also pretty good, especially when it comes to creating a bit of drama with screaming, crying, and the like. \
Although I'm a hardcore subber, sometimes (when I'm seriously obsessed with an anime), I will go back and watch certain episodes in different languages just to see how they compare to the original. Since I was lucky enough to download a Death Note version which came with five different languages, I decided to check them all out after I finished watching the show in Japanese. Although the English dub wasn't that bad (and was far better than most English anime dubs I've heard), the pronunciation of several names and words did make me cringe a few times. Furthermore, the Light in this version did not manage to convey that great of a range of emotions and did not sound as natural as the Japanese one. However, I discovered that this was true for most other versions as well, hence further confirming the fact that Mamoru Miyano's vocal range and acting is on a whole different level and is practically impossible to surpass. Nevertheless, the L in this version was pretty awesome and sounded almost exactly like the Japanese one (as well as much better than the ones I heard in Spanish and French). Out of all the other characters, I'd say that it was Ryuk and Rem that always seemed to sound great in every language and didn't differ from their Japanese versions too much. Misa's international voices were also pretty good in that they sounded far more normal and believable, though I guess some might actually prefer her ridiculously high-pitched, childish and  immature Japanese tone of voice. (Fun fact: while the English, Spanish and Portuguese dubs all use the word \"shinigami\", the French actually use the literal translation, i.e. \"God of death\" in their own language).\
Since every aspect of this anime was clearly developed with much care and intelligence, it is no surprise that the show manages to be both interesting and intelligent too. Despite being an anime about death and murder, there is never any gore, and blood is seen very rarely (unlike in some shows which are supposed to be far more kid-friendly but feature way more depictions of it, like Kuroshitsuji). Combined with some difficult kanji, cleverness, morality issues,  biblical references and realistic art (the majority of Death Note characters have probably some of the smallest eyes I've ever seen in anime), this allows for a very mature mood and overall sombre tone. It is perhaps for this reason that the use of jokes and funny moments is also fairly limited, while chibi gags or any other signs of stupidity are nowhere to be found. Consequently, every moment of comic relief is one that is cherished and appreciated, not to mention enjoyed just as much as the plot progression and the character development themselves. \
The only downside to this anime would perhaps be the ending. Although it was far from disappointing, I believe that it had way more potential and could have been executed differently (or could have simply happened sooner and have involved different characters). Since the outcome of the story was evident from the beginning (it's even mentioned by one of the characters), this greatly diminished the shock value of the ending and made it less powerful. This could have probably been avoided by  doing it differently, but at least it wasn't an entirely bad or unrealistic ending (or one of those where the director simply hits the reset button like in Oreimo or Clannad After Story).\
Thus, the moral of the story is that a little magic goes a long way when combined with a lot of brainpower as well as some charisma to charm and manipulate people to your advantage. Besides toying with people's emotions, being smart and resourceful also helps you make the best of shinigami loopholes and use not only humans, but also Gods of Death to your advantage. However, I think it would be best if Light Yagami himself told you about that, so why not go watch his story instead? Because, ultimately, no matter how many reviews you read about this show, nothing compares to the amazing experience that is seeing this masterpiece for yourself. Prepare to have your mind blown (not literally, of course) and try not to wait 10 years to watch it like I did, for that time is probably better spent re-watching Death Note, writing bad people's names in killer notebooks, or making shady deals with shady shinigami. \

    I found Death Note to be of exceptional quality, both in animation and in it's content from beginning to end, and when I say 'end' I'm referring to episode 25. As far as I'm concerned, episodes 26 through 37 simply aren't relevant, especially when said episodes only serve to either dumb down the premise or even perhaps the viewer with a sort of 'shock and awe, look at me and my overly predictable plot twists!' It also doesn't help that the most interesting and intelligent aspect of Death Note isn't even present at the series conclusion, but rather replaced by an extremely annoying, younger knock\
          \
        off, and don't even get me started on the 'other one' and his stupid chocolate bars!  \
If Death Note would have concluded at it's logical closure point it would be greatly deserving of the mass amount of hype it's been able to generate (despite it's terrible television ratings here in America). But alas, the logical closure point was ignored, and thus the series ended on a rather (pardon my French) shitty closure point. \
I guess what bothers me the most is that there was so much potential to be had in Death Note, but in the end it was squandered for mediocrity. Not only is the official ending extremely rushed, it also leaves the viewer completely unfulfilled. Summed up, 'You mean to tell me that I waited 37 episodes for 'that'?'  \
...my sentiments exactly  \
Had I'd been reviewing only the first 25 episodes 9's (perhaps 10's)  would have been in order. I guess the best advice I can give to the viewer is this; Death Note is a 25 episode long series ;) \
On a related side note, seeing as I'm somewhat of a music snob, I can't help but comment on the atrocity that is the second opening theme of Death Note. I'm not against loud screamy music, not in the least bit, after all I avidly listen to bands such as Orchid and Ampere for Christ sake. However when it comes to Nu-Metal garbage like the opening theme in question I simply can't stomach it. All things considered, it is amusing how the f-bomb is dropped several times during said song, a much needed comic relief (why is cursing broadcast on TV so damn amusing?) much the same as the poorly executed blast beat during the final few seconds.  \

    I first came about Death Note when some of my friends started watching it and arguing who was better, Light or L? It got rather annoying, and for some reason, I planned to join in the argument by watching it... And also too see what makes Death Note 'this good'. Like me, I'm sure a lot people who have watched Death Note watched it because they were curious. Just a few warnings about the anime, there are some 'extreme writing' elements in it that would make you think that the characters were training for the sport of writing or something, and that Misa's voice may\
          \
        hurt your ears...\
Death Note... Certainly different from your normal plot. Simply put, a notebook that falls from the sky, is found by a student called Light Yagami. Now, just as anyone would think, once he saw the notebook, he instantly thought it was just a prank. But, just as humans would, curiosity got the better of him, and so he begins to see if it really is what it claims to be. What he finds surprises him, and he begins to use the Death Note 'for the greater good' and begins using the alias 'Kira'. The police start noticing patterns, they call on the legendary 'L' to investigate, and find out who is doing these mass killings, and how. Things start to become complicated for both L and Light, when there is someone else also claiming to be 'Kira'.\
Now, whether or not I have taken a biased approach to 'Death Note', I do not know. Death Note is said to be 'one of the best anime ever', and right now, I believe I can agree with that it is 'one of the best'. Death Note is an anime with a very well constructed plot, with many twists and turns. The characters and events have been well thought through, with it being difficult to find many holes in the planning. 'Death Note' keeps it's fast moving plot and storyline throughout the series and almost every episode ends with a cliffhanger, making you want more and more! One main thing does seem to disappoint me though. Once it became present that there was a second arc to the series, the tension and the excitement of the plot line seemed to drop (well for me at least) with the events occurring with Yotsuba Group. It seemed as though they may have just wanted to stretch the series for a bit longer, although it did pick up again with the introduction of 'Near'. The ending however, I found a little disappointing, and a bit cliche though...\
As much is hyped up about Death Note, it is not perfect. Now, the storyline, as I have said before, is very strong. It moves fast, and keeps you wanting more. The animation is exceptional. I do not believe that there is a noticeable slack in standard with the animation. The eyes and hair is detailed, character costumes and body shapes don't seem to be distorted, facial expressions seem appropriate etc. Sound? This, for me, seems to be it's only not so good side, although still very good. The soundtrack could have been improved in some areas with it for me starting to get a little repetitive... The 'godly singing' gives a nice epic feel to it, however it does seem to feel as if it gets a little overused. The first opening and closings I think could have been improved, as it didn't quite seem to match the plot. The second opening theme songs some people may find a bit offensive, however it does seem to fit the characters and plot line better. Nevertheless, the soundtrack was still very good, and the voice actors fitted the characters pretty much perfectly, with outstanding performances by Miyano Mamoru, Yamaguchi Kappei and Hidaka Noriko, playing Light, L and Near respectively.\
Despite the anime's very good plot, art, sound and character developments and characteristics, I did not seem to enjoy it as much as I thought I would have, which may be due to having over-expectations, however, it still does deserve an overall 9.4 out of 10 and is arguably 'one of the best anime' ever. Highly recommendable to those who enjoy crime-fighting with a difference, and also highly recommendable to everyone else! Whether I like L or Light better? Hehe...\

    Lion Tamers, I got a whole lot of stuff to say about \"Death Note\".\
Unfortunately, for the folks who actually liked this anime, I disliked it to the point of dropping it at episode 8. I realize this is usually a no-no; but there is no way I'm going to sit through drivel for 15 hours, after hating it for 3 hours already.\
First I want to talk about the stuff that was actually quite good.\
The dialog is written well, and performed above average.\
And the artwork is above average.\
Most of the characters did not disturb me too much, including the character named L Lawliet. While many didn't\
          \
        like many of the characters; for me, most of the characters were something all too rare. \
True to themselves.\
Next I want to unload on this thing about some minor problems and then get to why I really, really, really; learned to dislike the whole idea from an early point of the anime.\
First, all of the music's awful. I like a nice tune. If the song has lyrics; I appreciate them sang with some knowledge of that art. None of that is in evidence.\
Next, while the dialog is very important to the creation and the development of the story; most of the time it takes up the same space as the background narration in a 1940's crime drama. Yuch!\
\
Now I want to talk about the main reason for why I hate this thing. Light Yagami, makes a lot of mistakes. Not only of the logical and rational kind; but he even lies to himself.\
1). Does he not abuse his 'Death Note'?\
2). Does he not kill innocent people, in direct contradiction of his own stated principles?\
3). Does he not kill innocents in order to throw suspicion away from himself?\
4). Does he not turn the whole adventure away from his own stated goals of being a God on Earth, by delivering an ethically wholesome world; into a contest that ultimately makes of himself the very monster he decries?\
These few are just the beginnings of this numbskull's hideous lack of deductive reasoning skills. How anyone can consider this fellow anything but the dumbest 'smart guy' in the room is beyond my ability to fathom.\
He can be forgiven for the initial attempt to find him by \"L\", and that was to broadcast a news story that only got transmitted in Light's own city.\
But killing the FBI agent Raye Penber after Light actually finds out the Raye has ended his own investigation and is going to close the case without pointing fingers at Light, is bluntly inexcusable. An incredible blunder, which would be and is, the cause of another 5 episodes at least, in order for Light to figure out how to salve the minds of at least a dozen people, and steer their concentration in another direction. The tragedy here is that if Light left Penber alone, half of the story would have not been necessary, and \"L\" would have been left with nowhere to go.\
Moreover, Light had a terrific opportunity he didn't even use (and couldn't after killing Penber); and that was to use the Internet and look up the official website for the FBI; and then take note of the pictures and names of the top 5 people that run the place; and then execute them. The FBI would have withdrawn from the case within hours, yanked all their personnel without warning; and left \"L\" wondering what the hell happened. Since most of those people probably were not nice people anyway, Light could have held on to his moral authority awhile longer. He became his own worst monster, by his own definition; because he would rather take up the contest with \"L\". Contesting with \"L\" was so much more fun, lives became so secondary.\
Not a great reason to lose one's own conscience.\
I am sick of thinking about \"Death Note\", and I want the World to know why I dislike it so much. It is NOT a bad show, as a piece of entertainment. But I cannot stomach a stupid idiot being presented by the show itself, and by other viewers; as some kind of great thinker.\
He's not a smart guy. The viewers are much smarter than Light Yagami. All of you are.\
I give this thing a solid 6. If the art/sound was below par, Death Note would have received a 'never-before-used' 3 from me.\

    Well Well Well .. Death Note ! Even my friends that don´t watch anime already heard this name somewhere ... it one of the most known animes out there .. for good reasons but also bad ones :D. (For who saw knows what i'm talking about). \
I don´t want to extend this, so i will make a short review and try to say everything that there is to say. \
Story: (9/10). Nice plot, consistent, solid, fluent. It is simple, but at the same time it is complex due to development attached to it. The plot is interesting, it looks nice, it looks fresh. It isn´t\
          \
        something over explored, but i felt that it's not that original though. Instead of weapons or big armies, or crazy stupid guys that usually are ugly and had a pretty messed up past, we have a student, a smart and looking good one, with a note. Well the wish to command the world isn´t something new, what is new is the character being so young, and the way that he pretends to do it. \
Basically this anime is based on a mental fight between a detective and our main character, Yagami Light(in the anime he gets the nickname Kira, so let's call him Kira). The all concept is nice for it self, plus with the interaction between the detective (who name is \"L\") and Kira we got a super interesting anime. Normal conversations or normal tennis games became Epic. I don´t want to tell you the why otherwise i would have to spoil.  \
Art: (9/10). For the year when it was made (2005), gosh the animation is even better that some animes that are being released now ! The glow of the characters makes them look pretty nice. They are not flat, they are well shaped, all look pretty normal but at the same time, as we go trough the anime we start to realise how peculiar the design is, and how cool it gets. The background is also nice. \
Sound: (10/10).  What a piece of art ! Such wonderfull soundtracks, such amazing OST that i got pleased just by hearing it. The sound here has the same effect that the sound on AoT has. It makes the action look tons times better, more epic !. Everything is good here. And what about the opening? The second opening it's okay .. it is related to the plot and it gives us an idea of how Kira feels about humanity. The first Opening? Jeez what a piece of art ! The dark theme, the metaphorical meaning, the lyric and even the music style fits perfectly in the action, in the plot, in the characters, IN EVERYTHING ! This is one of those animes that made such a  good work that when we look up to other animes we just make them look worst from what they really look like. \
Character: (10/10). I'm getting tired to praise this anime but i have to do it. It is just outstanding. We have 2 main characters. L and Kira. Then we have a third one but no one gives a crap about it. Only 2 character. Although they were the best character i've ever seen besides Yuno. Great look, great development, great background story and, great interaction between them both that just make them even better. Basically both are super brilliant guys, but while Kira is organized and popullar, L is the oposite. I loved the contrast between them both, it just looks amazing. They both look like the same, but at the same time they look so different.. Each one has it's own personality and way to be, and they have special habbits. For instance L just can be sitting on his knees because it increases his brain capacity about 40% .. things like this that make them look so nice ! So original, so different from the rest. \
Enjoyment: (8/10)  What a failure ! That bad thing that i talked about right at the begining ? Well there it is. In the middle of the anime they made something that completely blowed up the anime. If it wasn´t for that part, the enjoyment it would be another 10/10 ... The first part, the first 25 episodes, it is just absolutely brilliant ! Brilliant i repeat. I couldn´t stop watching that, i felt sick i was totally sick while i was watching this. My eyes were glowing and my mouth was with a huge smile of admiration.. But .. it just gets lost. And personally, that end made everything even worst. This is based on my personall opinion. The end or it will be perfect, or if you are like me, it will suck for real. Some of my friends said that the end was trully amazing. For me .. taking in consideration what could have happened instead of what really happened, it was the WORST ending ever for me. It just makes no sense. Although it is a beautiful ending i have to say, it just didn´t pleased me. \
The themes trated here are really serious and interesting. They are explored in a realistic way. I reccomend this show for everyone since it is at my point of view, a piece of art that everyone must see. \

    Intensity. Psychological. Ultimate anxiety forth-bringer. \
AN EXTREME GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE. \
      That basically sums up the masterpiece which is death note. I was drawn to this anime initially, due to it's IMMENSE popularity. And let me say this now, it certainly lives up to it's reputation. \
      First off, the story begins in a very intriguing way, which captures the audience's attention, immediately. The use of a mixture of divine intervention and attractive art, which is the backbone for this anime, proves to be very wise on the author's part. This allowed for\
          \
        a much larger pool of audience to be drawn from; Fantasy lovers: check, Horror gremlins: check, Action junkies: check, those who crave a mystery, and a tale which flexes the brain muscles: check, AND even the romance addict, fan girls. All of these elements are present within the anime, leaving no anime connoisseur unsatisfied. \
       In every anime, there is a protagonist, and antagonist. In my years of an anime-lover, I've noticed that the bigger the fan-base is for each character, the more popularity it gains. Every watcher is quietly (or not so quietly) rooting for his or her preferred character to prevail, which in turn creates a much larger impact when important events occur. This is precisely the tact of Takeshi, and Tsugumi-sensei (writers of Death Note). The first few episodes are centered around our main antagonist, Light Yagami, (or protagonist, in his eyes), following the development he creates with his plans of utilizing the Death Note to create a better world. Kira is born. Many watchers, such as myself, are drawn out by his ability to bring to light /no pun intended/, our deepest thoughts, subdued by our sense of human morality. Finally, BAM\
      This mysterious character known as L, appears. If you are like myself, your response to his presence was sour, to say the least. \"An obstacle in Light's path!\" something along those lines. OR, you could belong to the category of people who were waiting for someone to knock this sociopath off of his high-horse. Nevertheless, as the story progresses, you start to get a feeling of attachment toward both characters. Not sure of whether you want our beloved antagonist to be caught, or melt into the temptation of Light's false sense of justice. This intense clash causes one to jump out of their seat with anticipation, heart beating faster with every episode.. unconsciously taking on the mind of a criminal. \"Will I be caught...?\" \
       This spectacle of a plot continues on for the entire anime, even with or without, one of the main characters. *no spoilers* xP All of this accompanied by a very intriguing sound track. I'll admit, the music is rather repetitive, but the reason it received such a high score from me, is due to it's amazing adaptability to the mood. It fits quite well, and adds to the suspense. \
        A teaser for all my lady, romance-lovers out there ~ (males welcome ;) The art is VERY good. Excuse the morbid appearance of the shinigami.. But the main guys, are quite the eye-candy, and excuse me for saying this, but look fairly nice together as well. BUT, that is for a different time. There is also, sprinkles of romance, not gender-biased.. Hehe, keep an eye out for that. \
        Overall, Death Note is an AMAZING anime. The only reason it did not receive a 10, is due to some minor fillers, that somewhat diverted my attention from the main plot, but nothing that caused too much a damper. Murdering, although we all know is wrong, this anime makes us ponder on what true morality is. Any show with that sort of influence, is definitely worth watching! \

    Death note is a real masterpiece, this is my first serie where I cannot tell anything bad about.\
Let's start with the story:  Light Yagami is boy of 17 that is frustrated in how rotten this world is. When he has found the death note ( rules:  1) The human whose name is written in this note shall die. 2) This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. 3) If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the\
          \
        person's name, it will happen. 4) If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. 5) After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.) he decided to use it to make this world a better place. So he planned to kill criminals with it, to accomplish his ideal. but already after a few day's that he uses the death note, his ideal has changed into: that he will  create a new (perfect) world and that he will become the god that rules over it. But his goal becomes much harder to accomplish, when L (the best detective of the world) gets in his way. from here it is a battle of the minds between those two geniuses. the principle is simple: the first whose identity is revealed will die.\
I think you can start to imagine how psychological this is. The main question is \"will light’s noble goal succeed or will the death note turn him it the very thing he fight against?\" but this is only one of the great questions they handle. another great one is: \"Is Light a good person or a criminal himself?\" personally i don’t had the feeling he was a criminal however i must admit when i thought about it clearly, i’ve decided he was one because of these questions: \"has one person the right to judge over everybody’s life?\" and \"is the death penalty a good way to punish?\". Of course you have to decide yourself, what you think of him and his judgement. However i found him a criminal, I still liked his thoughts and the way he fight for his goal therefor I couldn’t choose between light and L, since L is a wonderful character on it’s own. I really like the way he handles and how he thinks about judgement.\
Another great thing about it is how you get sucked in the story. I’ve watched the first 28 episodes without any stop and I would’ve finished it, if i didn’t needed to go to school that day. The way they make it exciting is unbelievable. The story as well as the music is built up so great that once you’re over 5 episodes it gives you the feeling you can’t stop. That doesn’t mean the first episodes aren’t good. I never was so excited from the first episode as this one. but as i said that feeling only grows while watching it.\
There are some that says that the second part is worse and that it should’ve stopped after the first. I personally don’t think so, I like the second part as much as the first. The story circumstances have completely changed and there are new wonderful characters, what keeps it interesting.\
Then one more thing, the drawstyle is magnificent. It really makes the characters who they are. And L is one of the most original characters (from design) I ever saw. \
So in my opinion the plot was insane, the characters awesome, the background music good, drawing style very good and the enjoyment is the combination of all of these together.\
Because of all of this I think this anime is a must seen. Not only a must seen for an anime watcher but one for everyone. \

    First off, let me say i'm didn't give this anime a 10. I wasn't completely amazed but people have different opinions after all and nevertheless i still think this is a show with few flaws and alot of enjoyment. It has a very nice feel to it and this is a great watch for those into the mystery genre especially. The show is hardly at times slow and usually packed with suspenseful and captivating moments, plenty of plot twists as well.\
Story (9). Right off the bat i'm going to say i think the story was the show's strongest asset. The whole tone in general is\
          \
        very grey and morbid, and I liked that. The tone collaborates with the whole idea of the story very well without it being depressing or feeling dull. The story itself picked up very quickly, pretty much getting to the point in the first episode with little exposition or build up. This is done to make you actually want to watch the show and (plot twist) it works! The story evolves well and there are very high points which happen to be very suspenseful and actually at times made me nervous to see what was going to happen. There are alot of unexpected turns in the story, part of this is due to the very well executed character interplay particularly between Light (the main character) and L. I will say though, a few episodes felt a bit slow and i was slightly uninterested at times, however high points in the story made up for that indeed. Whenever i thought the show was losing me, it griped me right back in again. There were no real plot holes at all and rarely times when you could guess what was going to happen next, which is good and allows you to watch and enjoy with little thinking. There were some emotional moments as well as some dark moments, but the times where there was alot of build up and suspense were the the best aspect. The ending didn't set well with me, mainly because i wanted to see a different ending but even so i'm not criticizing the show at all for it because the ending was well executed and gave good subtle closure.\
Art (8). The animation is dated of course so i can't complain about lack of quality or anything. The characters looked good and real while being unique at the same time. The environments looked grey which set well with the story and tone. The show's aesthetic was actually really nice and i liked it. Death Note has a very nice feel to it where characters and objects have a omniscient glow and light reflect them which looks pretty. Tense moments are animated very well, even when all that's happening is a character writing down a name it looks just very good and fluent. Effects like Rain and dark clouds help to flesh out the dark overall mood.\
Sound (8) The soundtrack fit very well with the series, having a classic horror/mystery/thriller style to it. During intense moments the music was beautiful. during dialogue scenes or build up scenes the music is added in well, not eclipsing what's going on in the story but at the same time making you enjoy listening to it. The first intro song is in my opinion the best, it suited the show rather perfectly and set the tone well. The second is a complete change to a heavy metal style song. This does work but it isn't one of my favorites. The ending tracks are a bit forgettable, the second one worked well but I honestly don't remember the first. The voice acting of the characters is spot on, all of them are portrayed well and the general sounds are crisp and clean.\
Characters (7) The characters are my least favorite feature of the show in my opinion. This isn't a bad thing and doesn't mean i didn't like them it's just that i couldn't connect with them that much and some are a bit forgettable. I will say as the series went on some of the weaker links are fleshed out more and that was a good touch. All the main characters worked and played their roles well, Light, Misa, Ryuke, and L were all solid interesting characters. Light's intensions are made clear from the start and you see how his character changes especially at the very end. Ryuke is personally my favorite, showing he has no intrest in taking sides in the dilemma of the story is funny to see considering he watches these sometimes terrible things happen without a care. His constant giggling was funny to me, and he's just a likable presence despite being a god of death and all. Misa did he job well, she was another likable presence and she had her moments. I can't say i truly understand her goals but I didn't have problems with her at all. L is another of my most liked characters. His interplay and chemistry with Light is the best part of the majority of the show. The whole dynamic between them is very interesting to watch, and L himself is very weird. I guess weird is interesting to me, nevertheless i really liked him. A few of the characters introduced later in the series were my least favorite, to me they were just kind of annoying and I didn't care about them at all. In all honesty i hated them but it's not because of bad writing I just simply hated who they were if that makes sense. The side characters like I said are the weak link. Side characters usually end up being my favorite but in this case they were a bit forgettable. Matsura had his moments and i did like him but the rest were nothing special but were functional for the most part and weren't useless.\
Enjoyment (7) my gripes with the show are simple and not much...The characters could've been a bit better, and the story went slow to me 1 or 2 times. Overall though, i did enjoy it. I liked seeing the story progress and build up over and over and I liked seeing the match of wits between Light and L. The chemistry there between those two was spot on. The story developed for the most part perfectly and had a proper ending. Despite the fact i said it didn't set well with me, i'm over it and realized it was a suitable ending. Overall all the way through i rarely found myself bored and was most of the time invested in the story.\
So in all this was a great anime and i'd recommend it to ANY Anime fans. Other people in general as well. I plan on re watching this again and for 37 episodes it's more than worth the time.\
Hope this helped, if you somewhat agreed with this give it a thumbs up (:\

    Well here it goes, my first anime review. And what better way to start than with a series I hold very high in regards to my anime viewing experience. Yes, Death Note is definitely one of those shows that most people can get into (whether they are a seasoned anime viewer or not) with quiet ease. This is a show that you can probably convince some of your \"normal\" friends to sit down and watch without explaining too much before hand. I believe it's this accessibility that garners the respect it has in most anime viewers eyes. At its core it is a very cut-and-dry,\
          \
        good vs. evil story, something that many people enjoy in storytelling. Its not to say that every single person who watches it will enjoy it, (the theme of death definitely won't sit well with more sensitive viewers) but I'd be hard pressed to find any of the people I've recommended it to that come back disappointed after viewing it. It's definitely one of the few shows where the premise is actually upheld by the plot quiet nicely. Be for warned, this show does have an addiction factor to it, you'll probably want to move on to next episode as soon as the previous is finished. Now for a quick breakdown of the specs:\
Story: 9/10\
As I mentioned above, the show does have a very cut-and-dry, good vs. evil plot. You've got two main players: Light Yagami and L, and they are in an all out battle of the wits. There is a definite back-and-forth to their battle, each exchanging blows, one after another. This makes for a entertaining cat and mouse game for the series that I think many find appealing. But then the second arc starts, and something gets \"lost\" in between. Its not to say that the second arc doesn't have the same cat and mouse dynamic to it, but game definitely changes. However, it all comes together for what I consider a suitable end for the series. Overall its a great story.\
Art: 7/10\
I feel like when it first came out, the art was pretty decent for the time. But it's not anything that people haven't seen before. They setting is mostly city scape anyway, so if you like looking at buildings I guess you'll have a hay day. It's not incredible, but not entirely crap either.\
Sound: 9/10\
Oh boy does Death Note have a good sound track! I remember downloading lots of the music to my Ipod after watching this. The opening and ending songs are great! (The second opening being one of my favourites) The music definitely does its job setting the tone for the series\
Characters: 10/10\
If there is one part of this show that hits the nail on the head, it's characters. Every single character in this show is memorable, each with a personality different from the next. Hell, one of the best characters in this show (Matt) has almost no lines and probably has fans galore! The interactions between characters provide some of the best dialogue I've ever seen in anime. At the end of the day, characters are at the very heart of any show, and Death Note treats its cast like real people.\
~ Final Thoughts ~\
Death Note is a spectacular anime, whether you like it or not. I will admit, the second half is alot different from the first, but the overall experience is enjoyable. If you looking for a show to get friends into anime, this one is a gateway drug. A definite recommendation for anybody who wants see anime at some of its best.\
Overall: 9/10\
Thanks for reading!\

    It's strange, don't you think? How in a world filled with otaku that crave action or moe, and sometimes both, that possibly the most popular anime out there is Death Note, a psychological thriller that spends 90% of it's time talking. Perhaps it's because it's a product of Shonen Jump, or maybe because of the directing style of Tetsuro Araki, or maybe because the anime itself is just that good. After all, over the years we've had plenty of anime trend and take up the majority of discussion on forums, Steins;Gate, Sword Art Online, and probably the biggest being Attack on Titan, but Death Note\
          \
        has stayed a major anime in the community for 7 years now. So now the questions are, why is it so popular, and does it deserve it's popularity? Let's see if we can find some answers.\
Story 8/10\
Our story begins with the introduction of Light Yagami, a genius high schooler who's completely and utterly tired of his daily life, finding it dull because of how easy the work he does is to him, and frustrating because of the \"rotten\" state of the world. One day his life changes completely when a black notebook with the words \"Death Note\" on the cover falls from the sky. He picks it up and reads that by writing the name of anyone in it while picturing their face, that person will die in 40 seconds of a heart attack, unless a cause of death is also written down. He originally tosses it aside as a twisted joke, until he tests it out for himself, and in a clever case of \"curiousity kills\", the Death Note appears to work and he's now convinced that it is real. The Death Note actually came from a Shinigami, or \"death god\", named Ryuk, who was just as bored as Light and tossed the Death Note into the human world for fun. Now wielding immense power in his hands, Light takes it upon himself to kill all the criminals of the world and create a new world which he stands as a living god. After making a name for himself under the alias Kira, this case catches the attention of Interpol and the world famous detective, known only as L. Now the battle is on between Light and L, as they both use their intellect and resources to try and find out the others identity and win in this battle of good versus evil. Though whether justice is Light, L, or simply whoever wins, is left up to you. One thing i can say about Death Note's story, that i so rarely get to say, is that the idea for it is quite original. Yes there are other anime out there that have very similar feels to them, such as Code Geass or Gankutsuou, i've yet to see an anime that took the idea of \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" to such extreme and creative levels. Concept aside though, this is a psychological thriller, specifically a game of cat and mouse, and Death Note never fails to deliver with it's twists. It seems as though every episode ends with a cliffhanger making you want to tune in to the next episode as quickly as possible to see what happens next. Even so this only works because of the rivalry between Light and L. I'll get into it them more in the characters section, but it seems these two are able to make such a seemingly dull story into an adrenaline fueled thriller, despite the anime being mostly dialogue. Actually, the anime is at it's best when it's focusing on the dialogue, particularly L and his uncanny ability to see the importance in everything, including things i wouldn't have even assumed were important until L pointed them out. In the rare occasion that the show does choose to show a shootout or a car chase i just want it to finish so i can get back to the talking. Light however proves to be quite clever himself as he's able to use the Death Note's many rules, and when i say many i mean enough to write a book on, to form long complicated plans, that when revealed you can't help but feel a sense of awe. The rivalry between these two is what made this show, which leads me to bring up the matter of it's last 12 episodes. Around that point, the battle between Light and L ends, for major spoiler reasons, and a new battle starts where it left off between Light and L's two successors, Near and Mello. Now anyone who's talked about Death Note knows about the infamous reputation that these last 12 episodes have, and quite frankly, it's not untrue. While i don't find them as bad as everyone else, i still enjoyed them to a degree, they are a major letdown compared to the show's first 25 episodes, with Near and Mello turning out to be disappointing replacements for L, and Light no longer having anyone of worth to bounce off of. Luckily, the ending was able to save the show. While i know that some people disagree with me, and prefer the original manga's version of the ending, i couldn't help but be amazed with how well they were able to end it and conclude the game between Light and L, and just how fitting it was. But there's also the issue of the game itself. The game between Light and L is that of good and evil, but is transformed more into that of a game of chess, with everyone else being used as pawns and the murder being played off as almost horrifically fun, and despite me not having any issues with this, many others are bound to be turned off by the idea of it. Still if you can get past that, then the story of Death Note is airtight and heavily engaging.\
Art (9/10)\
Death Note was done by studio Madhouse, who's name is quite well known amongst anime fans for it's, mostly, high quality of animation, with Death Note being no exception. The art for this show is very pleasing, being pretty yet dark and gothic, tons of shading and detail to both the characters and the background designs. The animation is usually very simple but nice. Death Note is mostly a talking head anime, with characters just standing around and having long dialogues and monologues, and sometimes both at the same time, yet there's such precision to every small movement that they make, it's actually quite impressive. However, every now and then, the animators are basically given permission to go nuts, and go nuts they do, with fluid, fast, and erratic movements, adding a sense of chaos to the show, very nice looking chaos mind you. This is most likely thanks to the director Tetsuro Araki, famous for other works like High School of the Dead, Guilty Crown, and most recently Attack on Titan. He adds a bombastic flair to the show that could never be found in the manga, really taking advantage of the fact that it's animation rather than just adapting the manga to a T. But what really makes him and his works, Death Note being no exception, standout is how well he knows his audience. He purposely puts over the top scenes in his shows knowing that the viewers will turn them into gifs and memes and share them through sites like Tumblr and Twitter, unknowingly bringing free publicity to his shows. Death Note seems to take advantage of that more than any other anime of his though, the over the top reactions, the obvious repetition of scenes, and of course, the famous Potato Chip scene. Some people may look at this as manipulation, but i look at this as the show standing out and taking full advantage of the privileges it's given, which is always a plus. The only issue i have, is that while the show still looks good, the animation is kind of dated now, but you can't really call that a fault of the show, just the times.\
Sound (9/10)\
You know it seems like every anime out there nowadays seems to think that nothing could possibly make for a better soundtrack than a good latin choir, Death Note being no exception. In fact, basically every song in this show is a latin choir, and you know what, it works. They do nothing short of put even the smallest even on some grand scale that keeps your attention in place, though i will admit, it does become a bit overused. The only two notable exceptions to this being the themes to Light and L, with Light's being sinister sounding electric guitars to represent his passion and L's being haunting sounding pianos to represent his cunning and precise nature. There's also the OPs and EDs of the show, with the first OP, The World, and ED, Alumina, being by a Japanese visual kei band called nightmare, and while they were great and fitting sequences, i couldn't help but be annoyed at times by the whiny tone of the vocals. The second OP, What Up People, and ED, Zetsubou Billy, on the other hand are done by a Japanese metal band called Maximum the Hormone, and despite popular opinion, i prefer these over the first sequences. The screamo lyrics are not only fitting, but also just different from most other anime, making them stand out as memorable and even catchy. So with a well done OST to match the well done art/animation, the only thing that could bring the production values up even more is good acting, and Death Note does not fail to deliver. Death Note is 90% dialogue, so the only way this could work is with talented actors, which both the English and Japanese tracks do not fail to deliver. For Light we have Brad Swaile for the english dub, and while he has issues at first, seeming to try to match the Japanese track, he eventually finds his own footing and really owns the role. But despite Brad Swaile owning the role, his Japanese counterpart, Mamoru Miyano practically invented it. Mamoru Miyano is a pretty big deal among Japanese voice actors, playing a wide variety of roles and absolutely nailing everyone of them, and Light is among one his best performances, capturing all the passion, the intensity, and the charisma that Light incorporates. For L we have Kappei Yamaguchi for the Japanese track,. He plays a more monotonous L, which adds a layer of intelligence while simultaneously creeping you out, which does fit his character. But unlike Light, i'm going to go with the dub performance for L played by Alessandro Juliani, who seems to encapture the role perfectly, blowing away Yamaguchi's performance, giving a sort of musicality and nuance to the character, capturing both what L says and what L truly means. The rest of the cast is done well on either track so you can't fail with either dub or sub for Death Note.\
Characters (7/10)\
Throughout it's 37 episode run time, Death Note provides a wide assortment of characters, from detectives, to other criminals, several Shinigami, the members of the Wammy House, and one bubby, yet annoying, pop idol. But they are hardly the focus, and are more present to add more allies and enemies for Light and L to play around with. There are some standout roles like Ryuk, acting as the in house audience member with a front row seat to Light and L's battle, Light's father Soichiro, who encompasses the ideal of what justice is, and even Matsuda, the idiot detective with the heart of gold, but they rarely act as the focus, and therefore get far less attention compared to Light and L, leaving them underdeveloped and lacking any true depth. It should also be note that Death Note is a tad bit misogynistic when it comes to their female characters. There are really only two female characters that actually play a large role in the game between Light and L, those being Misa Amane and Kiyomi Takada, both of whom's roles are to fall in love with Light with no reason, and do whatever he tells them two without any second thought. Though the worse offender is easily Misa, who is full on obsessed with Light to the point where she would allow him to kill her if that pleased him, which added to the reasons of why she is often hated by Death Note fans everywhere. But enough of the side characters, let's get to the real meat of the show with Light and L. Light is intelligent, handsome, and charismatic, but also manipulative, arrogant, and kind of an outright bastard. It's often argued what kind of person Light really is, a hero, a villain, or an anti-hero, and if he's a villain, whether it's the kind of person he always was or if he was corrupted by the power of the Death Note. I personally think that this question can be summed up with a quote from historian and moralist, Lord Acton. It goes, \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.\". What i'm getting at, is that no one is ever truly good or evil, it simply depends on how you look at them, and whether their actions meet the ends. At least, that's how i interpret it. Me personally i look at Light as a villain that was able to kill even those closest to him without a second thought and even go so far as to taunt those that fell victim to him, but others may find that his actions were justified and his goal was pure. L is, in many ways, the exact same person as Light, despite appearing to be his complete opposite. L is a notorious liar, and despite fighting on the more just side, often sees this as a game. He's an accidental sociopath, meaning his being was corrupted by the nature he grew up in rather than being born the way he was, often selfish, but knows better than to allow others to see the true him. He encourages his allies through talks of justice but never truly believes in what he says, he mourns when one of his allies dies but more out of fear that kira is closer to catching him rather than actually feeling remorse. He's in many ways, just as bad as Light, but far easier to support because he's fighting on the side of good. Despite the battle being good versus evil, neither of them could be called good because of their desires, but neither of them could be called evil because of the ends that their actions meet. It's actually quite gray. Yet while both of them are psychologically complex, emotionally they are rather simple. Neither of them really changes throughout the show, except for Light becoming more extreme and unstable, and are highly underdeveloped. There's also the matter of what the true nature of Light and L's relationship really is, but honestly i'm not going to even justify that idea with a response. Let's just say, that fujoshi have quite a bad habit of assuming that guys in anime that fight and have a habit of clashing, tend to swing the other way, and they've imposed their ideas far too much on Death Note. To wrap it up, all of the cast is interesting and entertaining in their own way, and Light and L are fascinating characters to explore, but you'll end up a bit disappointed if you go into the show looking for complex characters. \
Enjoyment (9/10) Overall (8/10)\
Death Note is a very fun anime to say the least, that grabs you and never lets go from the start until the explosive finale. The second half though, leaves a lot to be desired, and the characters were a bit too cold at times for my liking. Despite absolutely adoring Death Note on my first viewing, after gaining much more experience with anime, i've found this story done better particularly in Naoki Urasawa's Monster, which i can easily recommend that anyone check out if they enjoyed Death Note. Still, i must admit having a soft spot for this show, and for what it is, it's a great psychological thriller for the teenage audience. So i recommend that any anime fan out there check it out, and i also recommend it as a gateway anime for you new fans out there. Anyways, that's all for now, til next time.",

Story (10/10)\
This series was the only series that stood out from the rest. It not only create's a sense of wonder and mystery but at the same time it has a psychological impact on the viewer. This is one of the most interesting and intricate stories you can enjoy.\
Art (9/10)\
The art is intriguing yet subtle to the point that it starts to look better than most shows. It has the dark sense yet a bright mood to the way everything is designed and animated.\
Sound (9/10)\
Its first opening is fantastic but when it comes to the second it does drop a little lower. Both\
          \
        endings are excellent for their own reasons. When it comes to my personal reaction to the music it manages to make me want to listen to it more. That is why it receives such a high rating. \
Characters (10/10)\
In the beginning you could already establish what a characters personality is like and how he reacts to certain situations. Every couple of episodes usually more than one character has changed psychologically, emotionally, ETC. Each character has their set of traits that distinguish each other. There is much to learn about each one which is surely enjoying to see.\
Overall (9/10)\
This show has its ups and its downs but It is still one of my most enjoyed show so far It has one of the most intriguing story and the most developed characters of any show and its well worth your time.\
To the viewer,\
This is show not dependant on personal preference. Its more dependant on reaction if you decide on watching it or re watching it I would suggest not basing your liking of the show of your taste.",

    Death Note is one of the most popular anime of the mystery thriller genre. It's often praised as a masterpiece and other times criticized for the latter part of the show (episodes 25-37) for taking the story onto \"not as well written or executed\" stage. Many people will tell you this can't be a true masterpiece because of this.\
I disagree.\
The first 25 episodes were really well-paced and exciting, keeping me on my toes and thinking constantly. And then the remainder of the episodes were equally tense but this time you can enjoy the great protagonist after he has been fully developed. On the same note,\
          \
        yes, there are only two characters whom I consider interesting in the entire show BUT this shouldn't bother you, because the show is focused on the rivalry between L and Light, and it may even benefit from having everyone else just kind of exist and be manipulated by both L and Light.\
Overall?\
One of the best pieces of the thriller-genre to date. In my book, this holds a secure second place in my all time hall of fame, right under Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which I'm going to recommend to anyone who has been a fan of Death Note, Monster or any other resembling the two.",

    Where to even begin with this anime..\
Death Note is by far one of the most well known and loved shows in the entire anime community, and there isn't many people that would disagree with that statement. The series gets you hooked from the very beginning, which is something that, surprisingly, not a lot of anime (in my opinion) can do.\
First of all, the two main protagonists in Death Note are by far the best characterized and well made characters ever made in anime, EVER. Two geniuses, one an anti-hero and one a detective, make up one of the most dynamic and interesting rivalries I've ever\
          \
        seen.\
The animation and art style is extremely unique and is pretty damn good considering it came out all the way back in 2006; there's truly nothing like it. The story keeps you interested all the way through it's 37 episodes, even after a huge twist in the middle that damn near rips your heart out. It's practically impossible to stop watching since this anime does psychological thriller SO WELL. It has such an amazing soundtrack to fit with the theme and the setting the show gives off, and is just really the cherry on top of the cake. \
Overall, this anime is a MUST SEE, especially if you are someone just getting into anime. Now, I do not believe there is any perfect show, so that's pretty much why I didn't give this thing all 10s across the board, but this is a legendary series that almost anyone can watch and enjoy. 9/10.\

    Death Note is one of the best animes every, many of anime fans have heard it or seen it. It is just great, the story is so smart and fun to watch, the first 10 episodes are some of the best i have ever seen!!!! they are just fantastic. Light who is the main character becomes a God, he finds the Death Note and can write any persons name in it and that person will die for any reason he wishes them to, L the other main characers is also great. Its hard to explain the plot because every episode changes something, its more that\
          \
        Light tries to win over L everytime, its so good because of the writing and tension, you always wonder who will win and what the next move will be, the sound is great and the music adds  so much tension you sometimes will be flustered. The anime is very bleak and only uses dark colors, but its the point, the story is about morality and humans and justice, its not a fun story, nothing fun happens expept some scenes, its very good and hard to explain, just watch it its a 10/10 this review was hard to do lmao, but think how good fullmetal alchemist is and hunter x hunter , its that good.\

    Death Note definitely deserves all the praise it gets. I don't think it's overhyped at all. Albeit, the premise is a tad bit unrealistic. But that didn't prevent me from enjoying the anime. It's not like the show prides itself off it's realism. It's about a notebook that kills people, for fuck's sake. I respect the writers immensely, because they acknowledge that the premise is unrealistic. And by simply doing that, they turn a totally bullshit scenario into something more familiar. They use total fiction to invite more thought provoking and realistic ideas. So even though the literal plot might be a bit void of\
          \
        realism, it still manages to be filled with tropes that are intimate to real life. What I'm trying to say, is that by using a ridiculous premise (a notebook that kills people) and equally ridiculous characters (a 17-year-old genius who wants to play god), the show's plot eventually tells us, that in the end, no matter how good your intentions originally were, you're still just a bad person doing bad things. \
Through all this, this very unrealistic anime presents itself as an examination of the very realistic idea of human morality and what makes us \"good\" people. It's truly a deep anime, so much so that its meaning can be debated for hours. That's why I think Death Note is not overhyped at all. Underneath its shallow, cheap action-y surface, Death Note raises questions of ourselves and humanity's strive for god-like control. \
Philosophical nonsense aside, it does have its flaws in the conventional department. The soundtrack can sometimes be distracting. The animation style is sort of show-y, and sometimes I wished for a bit more subtlety. And the voice actor for Light sometimes put an odd emphasis on phrases for absolutely no reason, which was distracting (especially during dramatic scenes). And in later episodes, I began to question the quality of the plot arc we were going through, and what purpose it had to the whole story.\
Overall: What I can say for sure, is that it was a really enjoyable ride. I mean, what else can you expect from an anime staple?\

    Short introduction of me :D\
Hello,I will be trying to make this review as shortest possible and with almost no spoilers.This is for people who are doubting should they watch anime or not\
\
Short preview:\
Light Yagami is a highschool student,who wishes to change the world.\
He gets an opportunity when a Death Note falls from the sky which got dropped by Ryuk a shinigami.\
(Death Note is textbook who created shinigami or death god in english.If you write someone's name they will die.But it's not that easy you have to know\
the face and the name and last name of the person that you want to kill.Those are basics of\
          \
        the death note)\
Light Yagami starts killing criminals that are usually reported on TV.His allias was Kira (kill) .Government decided that they need to get involved\
and they did by hiring an private investigator L.This was tricky because Light's Father was working for the police and was involved in the case\
The story goes on with battles against Light and L and after new rivals come in.\
characters~( Important Ones)\
Light Yagami~ Light Yagami looks like a normal high school student,well that is at the first look.He posses the powerful Death Note  that he uses to\
kill criminals.He is psycho,but he thinks he is a god.He is very intelligent using every one he knows for his own purpose . He is basically\
an actual badass . His changes from \"normal highschool student\" to psycho can be seen troughout the anime.\
L(Lewis) ~ Lewis or allias L is a private investigator hired by government to find and arrest infamous Kira . He as same as Light Yagami is very intelligent on level\
same as Light Yagami.L likes to eat sweets,but never gets fat.Unlike Light Yagami Lewis is not a psycho instead he is a famous investigator who solved\
a lots of crimes for his age.\
Ryuk the shinigami(Death God)~Ryuk is one that dropped the death note into our world.By Light Yagami picking it up he now follows the owner\
of death note.He likes apples and says \"Humans are really interesting\".Ryuk can exchange eyes with the humans.Shinigami's eyes will give\
human ability to see age and name of the person he is looking at,but there is a downside.Human that took the eyes must give half of his \
lifespan to the shinigami.\
Misa Amane~ Misa Amane is and Light Yagamis lover,even tough Light Yagami doesn't love her he uses her as a tool.Misa Aname would do anything for Yagame LightI\
In some kind of yandereish way.She is not yandere,all dough if Light Yagami said to kill someone she would do it.She has the second deat hnote. \

    Death Note. One of the most popular anime out there, and that happens for a reason. And the reason is that this anime is just great! Many of you may say that i overrate it, but i think there are some factors that deserve to be overrated. It is also one of my favourite anime series.\
Story: 9\
Death note is about Light Yagami, who finds a strange notebook. It didn't take him a lot of time to realize that this is not a normal notebook, but it has the ability to kill someone just by writing the name of the person who Light wants to kill\
          \
        on the Death Note. Also, the pacing, the character development, the antagonists, the supporting characters are those factors who make Death note so special. And there are no filler episodes.\

Ralistic and beautiful art. Both on characters and landscapes. The art perfectly fits Death note, which remains awesome throughout the series. You may notice different eye color on some characters while watching the series, but that is not bad, at least for me.\
Sound: 9\
Great sound in every aspect. The voice actors are amazing and perfectly fit every character in the series, just like the backround music which also fits perfeclty the story and the atmosphere. I would have rated this 10, but the sound is too monotonic, still awesome though.\
Character: 8\
Despite having some awesome  main characters (for example L, Light), some of the secondary characters exist only just to make the series 'bigger''. Some of you may not notice this or even don't care about that. Anyway, you will see many memorable characters, and keep in mind that there is no narrator.\
Enjoyment: 10\
No matter some small flaws, i enjoyed the series! I never found it boring, and for all those who prefer reading manga rather than watching anime, this anime is also for you. Absolutely memorable series.\
Overall: 9 \
If you want to watch a series who has a clever plot, clever characters and good pacing, Death note is for you. NOT recomended for those who love watching fighting scenes in every anime they watch, but still death note does not depened or maybe does not even need fight scenes.\
Thank you for reading!\

    I liked Death Note becuase it's a ride all the up to the end. The exposition offers the viewer a great understanding of who the characters are, but leaves just enough that you are hooked into watching just to find out who these people are. Probably the most exhilarating parts are the plot twists that keep the viewer on their toes. The art style is perfect for this anime, it fits the overall feel of the story. The music of Death Note is just right for almost every scene. Overall, this anime is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of a darker\

    When a show is built on a concept as compelling as an otherworldly notebook that allows users to kill at will simply by writing in it, the challenge is to create characters that are equally as compelling because, ultimately, strong characters are necessary to drive a good story. In the absence of such characters, there is the risk that the concept itself assumes center stage, and no matter how novel or interesting a concept is, it cannot by itself carry a story. Death Note falls apart because of its reliance on a concept alone and its neglect of characters.\
Villainous protagonists are nothing new, but for\
          \
        viewers to fully get behind characters that would traditionally be classified as \"bad guys,\" such characters must possess an incredible amount of charisma and, ideally, a bit of depth that saves them from the pure-evil-ha-ha-ha-I-do-bad-things-because-I-can territory (see Michael Corleone from The Godfather, Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, and Tony Montana from Scarface). Light Yagami, to the detriment of the show, falls far short of meeting these demands. At first glance, he appears to be a well-intentioned extremist with potential for character growth; however, within just the span of a few early episodes, any hope of that is quickly extinguished, as his actions and thoughts clearly indicate an irreversible sinister psyche, and, true enough, he remains in that state for the remainder of the show. There are no opportunities to allow Yagami to develop his character, and although he is sufficient to drive the plot forward, he fails to truly engage viewers while doing so.\
The problems presented by a lacking protagonist can sometimes be mitigated by a strong antagonist and supporting cast, but just as it is from Yagami's perspective in the story, the show treats the characters as inconsequential and even expendable, seemingly always (1) making very little effort to give side characters meaningful personalities; (2) depriving the few actually interesting side characters of adequate screen time, either through abrupt death or some other means; and (3) crudely injecting cookie-cutter characters into the story with virtually no build-up. If Yagami were actually a compelling protagonist, this treatment of the supporting cast could be forgivable and understandable, as it would reflect how Yagami himself sees others, but because viewers have no reason to feel any attachment to him, it comes across as being unsatisfactory writing and nothing more. \
Consequently, the notebook itself is forcibly thrusted into the spotlight, and it does an admirable job of holding together the story—at least for a brief time. Basic rules of use of the notebook are established, and their limits are creatively tested with entertaining results. However, at a certain point, the burden of carrying the story proves to be too demanding of a task, and the notebook, along with the narrative itself, buckles under a convoluted mess of rules, loopholes, gambits, twists, and turns, and is mercifully reduced to a mere background device in the final act. \
Upon the conclusion of the show, one character reflects on the story's events and remarks that things were good while they lasted and, if nothing else, some boredom was killed, which incidentally, is a perfectly apt impression of Death Note itself. It is such a shame because what began with such an interesting idea could have grown to become something special, if not for the complete absence of fascinating characters.\

    Okay, I'll try this again. The last time my review got deleted but I will try it again this time. Leave a comment if you know WHY I like this anime. ;)\
Story 10/10\
Death Note is a fun anime, that's one thing for sure. I liked the plot a lot, just because the idea that such a notebook would excist, is awesome as hell. The pace was perfectly done as well, and every episode ended just where it should end.\
Art 9/10\
The most of the characters have a great design that fits them well. The background is dark and sort of depressing, and that fits the series\
          \
        great as well. I still give 9 points, because it was not completely perfect but still great.\
Sound 7/10\
This is for the Japanese dub, although I watched the English dub. and if I am honest, the Engelish dub would get 10 points. The Japanese dub had just too less emotions, and the voices didn't fit the characters well. L's voice in the English dub was just perfect. I loved the music, and that's why I still give 7 out of 10.\
Character 10/10\
I will be short abou this. I JUST LOVE FRIGGIN L AND LIGHT AND RYUK AND ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR DESIGN IS SO PERFECT AND THEIR ACTIONS ARE SO UNPREDICTABLE BUT STILL SO SUITABLE! Their actions are suitable with their designs, let I say it like that xD.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
I had fun the whole time with this anime. And all the jokes are timed so well. Just enjoyed the fact of the notebook with the rules that come by. It's so exciting!\
Overall 10/10\
Death Note is a anime worth your time, that's for sure. :)\

    Death Note is a big game of cat and mouse. The two main characters are Light Yagami, who finds the Death Note and uses it to kill criminals to create his \"perfect\" world (nicknamed \"Kira\" by the media) and L, which is the investigator brought in to figure out who Kira is. They are constantly trying to get one up on each other and always are one step ahead of each other. The story is great and the characters are amazing. If you like mindgames or detective stories, then certainly give Death Note a try. Hell, even if you don't like detective stories, STILL give\
          \
        Death Note a try because it is without a doubt one of, if not the best anime I've seen.\

    So my previous review for this was in short, shit.\
Time to give it an actual review after rewatching the show. \
Note: I will have * with a number placed inside which mean there will be some text at the very bottom that contains spoilers. So if you don't mind the spoilers you should check that. \
Story: Deathnote is about the best character of all time, Light Yagami. He finds a notebook and inside, it states \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\"\
Deathnote is one of a kind really. Very few stories I have seen come close to it, not even FMA:\
          \
        Brotherhood. It has great pacing thanks to the 37 episodes giving it the chance to be a true adaptation of the manga. Nothing feels rushed. Originally I had read a bit of the first manga volume and had the ending spoiled by my friends. This did not ruin anything. The story has great build up in every moment to that final point. The writing of it is superb and the concept is amazing. \
The show has lots of exactly as planned moments.*1\
Ending thoughts*2\
Art: Art is done by Madhouse who have made quite a few anime. The show looks good for 2006 and looks like the manga. \
I would like to give special mention to the Second Ending which contains the best animation Madhouse have ever made. \
It's top quality in short. \
Sound: I am one of those people who prefers the dub of this to the sub. It feels more natural to the characters appearances.\
As for music Nightmare provide the first Op and Ed which are wonderful to listen to.\
The second Op and Ed is made by Maximum the Hormone. The second Op is a mystery to me. As for the second Ed it is beyond perfect.*3\
As for soundtrack music there are quite a few repeats but these are mainly L's and Light's themes. \
Character: Light Yagami is the perfect model student. As the world’s greatest serial killer known as Kira.  \
L is the mysterious detective hell-bent on arresting Kira.\
The character development is excellent. You start to understand Light's thoughts. You will start to support him or root for his downfall.*4\
You go inside of both L and Light's thoughts as they think their plans through. *1\
Enjoyment: Despite having the ending spoiled for me I didn't see what happened/how it happened. The build up to the point was what was important. \
*1\
*2\
If you had this show spoiled or not it will not affect your enjoyment. \
Overall: Deathnote is my favourite anime and I doubt that will change. It changed something inside of me yet I don't know what. My life felt empty when I finished it.*2\
Deathnote is a near perfect anime with stellar art, sound and story. It is one that will go down as a great with the likes of Neon Genesis, FMA and Code Geass. \
Overall I would give Deathnote a 10/10. I would recommend it as a person’s first anime. \
For legal streaming you go can go to Netflix for the UK. I can not confirm but I believe you can stream it on Hulu for the US. \
Alternatively you could buy the DVD or the Blu Ray that is been released (I believe). In addition I would recommend getting the Death Note Manga which can be bought in volumes of 1 or Death Note Black Edition which includes 2 volumes totalling 6 books for £10 each.  \
\
\
Anything on from this point will contain spoilers for the show and my personal thoughts and feelings of the show. \
\
______________________________________________________________\
*1 Exactly as planned: These moments occur quite a bit. The most memorable being Just According to Keikaku. This is when Light has regained the Deathnote and tricked L into thinking he is innocent. During this point character development takes place between L and Light. \
Before this happens Light does not explain his plan other than that he wants to get rid of the Notebook.  He then flashes back and explains how he will prove his innocence.\
The main one is the ending showdown. In short Light tried to trick Near into thinking Mikami had the real notebook but it was actually a fake. He explains this in the final episode after proclaiming \"looks like I win.\" It was working until Mikami made a fatal error in revealing the location of the real notebook. \
There are other plans in the show as well. \
*3 Ending 2 \"Symbolism\": I have interpreted the 2nd Ed as Light's rise to being a God with the literal Stairway to Heaven. The elevator scene has great build-up and shows his rise to the heavens as God of the new world. But only for him to fall to the ground. \
Side note: The flipping of the notebook, writing the name and seeing Light in the watch is beyond amazing.\
*4 Kira: Kira is the \"mass murderer\" in Deathnote. His real name is Light Yagami. My normal thoughts on him would be that I would disagree with him because I don't think we should have a death penalty. But I didn't. I supported for Light because I realised this is the only way to clean the world. \
*2 The End of Kira: So the ending happened. I watched it just last night. Yes as the title says, The End of Kira, his downfall, his death.\
Well firstly I should say the only change I can recall from the manga to anime is the ending being changed slightly. \
In the manga Light gets shot and begs Ryuk to write the SPK and Taskforce's names down. (Just got the book at so I can quote it.) So yes. Light gets shot and is now crawling on the floor away from Taskforce. He is begging Misa, Mikami and Takada to write their names down. He eventually reaches the feet of Ryuk where he says \"Sure... I'll write it.\" And then reveals he was talking about Light. Here Light insanely shouts \"I DON'T WANT TO DIE!\"and has a flashback to when he first met Ryuk. Subsequently Light dies of a heart attack 40 seconds later. \
This is different to the Anime ending which you should have seen. Light peaces out and dies on some stairs. \
When I first watched I will admit I felt sick. It was a pathetic end for an amazing character. I assume you would have been disappointed if you didn't know beforehand. But was this foreshadowed? Ryuk told Light he would write his name in the Deathnote. \
Although I prefer the manga ending this one was complete and well done. \
The performance by Brad Swaile in this episode was excellent. \
Deathnote is a masterpiece. Nothing will come close for a long time.",

Death Note.\
It's a cult classic, widely beloved show, that holds a large sway in the otaku community. It is in essence,  an extremely vivid and well thought out story that redefines the meaning of the \
word \"justice\"...\
Spawning from the simple, supernatural/fantasy themed idea that by writing down somebody's name that you could cause them to die, comes an extremely intricate and entangled story that documents almost faultlessly, a psychological showdown that can be remarked as nothing less than epic. \
It's quite common for people to have imbued preconceptions of Death Note due\
          \
        to its prominent media showcasing. Myself included entered this 37 episode series with relatively low expectations, and needless to say from my overall mark, that i was completely wrong...\
Death Note.\
It's anything BUT simple.\
While the premise of having a human wield that fateful notebook, and therefore wield a responsibility equal to the mass to Earth itself may seem quite straightforward... This show is simply genius in the way that it NEVER runs out of new revelations, discoveries, countless, countless, countless deaths, and countless, countless, countless plot twists to leave you breathless. (kind of like the breather you're taking now after reading that long sentence) Death Note is a great example of a show that is easy to underestimate. While it seems obvious that from such a responsibility-oriented premise, a theme of chaos and corruption should emerge, Death Note instead takes a more unique approach, and puts YOU in the front seat.\
It couldn't possibly use any more dramatic irony to empower you. To familiarize yourself with the rules of a God of Death. To familiarize yourself with with your friends, your enemies - You become death itself. And therefore particularly during Death Notes early phases, the complexities of baring such a power begin to envelop you. While on the one hand justice is to be fought for, on the other is the moral obligation to never kill a human being. Death Note thrives on the concept of conflicting morals. The endless friction between two mastermind forces fills the show's atmosphere with unending frustration and tension that genuinely can be felt, and related to.\
This is an psychological war. So expect ample plot twists...\
\"Who's the good guy?\" That is a question that will likely baffle you even after seeing everything, so does it really empower you at all?\
As i mentioned earlier, it's the sheer amount of interesting, thought-provoking content, as a result of a premise that could be summarized in a sentence that really stood out for me. The seamless integration of all of the perspectives and information down to the tiniest detail fit together perfectly - like in a beautifully intricate mystery. This brings the far fetched story down to Earth, down to a much more relatable and appreciable, realistic level that can easy resonate with a wide audience, anywhere from the technical grounds of super-weapons, to much grayer areas of morality itself.\
It's the game of chess between two geniuses, of arguably equal levels - and so one of the best aspects of Death Note is its complete unpredictability, which coexists with the twists of fate, to make it a level and heated battleground that always keeps you on edge.\
Despite its repetitive nature it fortunately strays far from being bland, and like a crescendo, it always seems to be trying to reach some form of climax - which never seems to fully emerge - and so the escalation in tension and complexities continue. Even more deviously deceitful and obscure techniques become part of the tribulations, and one minute it may seem that the world is with you, the next, you're lying unconscious underneath it.\
And so Death Note really does possess an overriding \"GENIUS\" aspect to die for. The story is as i say, really well thought out, whereas the characters is perhaps where i come to see one flaw... And this is kind of light how Shingeki no Kyojin is one-dimensional in the way that it puts an entertaining plot through the gears of production - covering the main progression non-stop. \
While i'm obviously not promoting the use of tangents here, that fact is that Death Note never seems to take a break from the suspenseful mystery solving. This is why i really enjoyed the very first phase best for it being the most down-to-Earth, \"everyday life\" styled. Whereas towards its conclusion, the heavy atmosphere is quite relentless, and leaves little space for non-professional character development. Nor for the viewer to catch their breath. Obviously this is the most common war of them all in a lot of media mediums - that of Story vs Characters, and it's impossible to get the perfect blend - so for the most part, Death Note is still something of a masterpiece in my eyes.\
Eyes?\
Ears?\
Sure they're good elements to consider for a review too, though i like to stay away from formulaic, rigid technical summaries... You'll be pleased to know that Death Note has some respectable audiovisuals. While strictly \"new anime\" viewers may take an episode or two to appreciate the art style, and while metal/death metal haters may not agree with the OPs. The presentation is colourful - where needed, and bleak, dark... where needed. Its main strength is the Story by far!\
I found Death Note thoroughly enjoyable, as it's one of the single most vivid, betrayal and deception infused, psychological wars out there, to which only one can emerge.\
Which one? See for yourself...\

That WOULD be a shame...\

    ***Spoiler Free Review***\
I've been wanting to review Death Note for a while now, since it's a personal favorite of mine, so let's get to it.\
Death Note follows the story of Light Yagami, a high school student who's bored of his everyday life. A fateful day he discovers by mistake a magical notebook with the power to kill humans just by writing the individual's name on the notebook and picturing his face in your mind. This is where it all starts.\
The anime shows Light as a person tired of this world's scum individuals and wanting to get rid of them, but has no means to do\
          \
        so. The notebook was a godsend for him. He tasks himself to rid the world of criminals and evil people, and become it's new ruler (or God) to guide it. \
His archenemy is L, an the world's greatest detective (sorry Batman). He prefers to keep his identity concealed for his own safety and has never failed to crack a case. \
L's struggle to stop Light is spectacular. Two geniuses battling it out with their minds. Plan after plan, each one of them seeks to destroy the other, the battle of good versus evil.\
The reason I enjoyed this anime is because it makes you choose sides. Each side is presented with a strong reason for acting they way they act.\
Story: 8.5/10\
The story is very interesting as a premise. It is well written (at least during the first part) and well paced. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what crazy plan Light or L will come up with next. This lasts up to a certain part of the story (not gonna say which one, because of major spoilers). After this part the story kinda slacks off, get a different pacing and feels a little rushed.\
Art: 7/10\
The art is good, nothing too special, the animations are okay. The reason I'm deducting points here is because it did not impress me visually and also because the anime has no HD version of it, only 480p and below. So if you want to watch this anime, and you usually watch animes in HD like me, sorry, you are out of luck.\
Sound: 9.5/10\
The sound is great. The first opening is pretty cool, but the second not so much. The soundtrack used in the anime captures the spirit of the show perfectly, ranging from suspenseful music, to dramatic and epic. Light's and L's main theme are my favorite soundtracks.\
Characters: 8/10\
Light and L are fleshed out properly as characters. The Shinigami Ryuk, who follows Light around, is also a very interesting character that along with Amane Misa and Touta Matsuda provide a comic side for the anime which I really enjoyed. The other supporting characters do a pretty good job and are interesting.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Even though this anime has flaws, some would argue that they are big ones, I really enjoyed it. It kept me interested and invested in it.\
To sum up:\
(+) Interesting characters\
(+) The notebook itself is a very interesting concept.\
(+) The battle of minds and intellects will keep you interested until the end.\
(-) The story kinds falls off after a certain event in the anime\
(-) The art is nothing impressive and there is no HD version of the anime, only upscaled 480p.\
(-) The characters introduced after the aforementioned event in the anime are a little bit lacking and feel a little out of place.\
Overall: ~9/10\
I totally recommend this anime for anyone who enjoys a battle of minds and ideals.",

    Death Note... When I first heard it I was hoping for a life note eventually appearing in the series.... But I can tell you that there won't be. This is one of those animes that get you confused about which side to root for. It plays with your mind. But it isn't scary at all, its enjoyable seeing people's wits.\
Story\
OK, For this part I loved the entire concept of it. The pace is good as it slowly creeps up to you the confusion of which side to root for. \
Art\
The art in this is not one of the best nonetheless it is still good as\
          \
        its art style really compliments the psychological part of this part of the anime. It doesn't make your skin crawl. It makes you contemplate.\
Sound\
I can't really rate the sound part of this anime but  I can tell you not to watch the dub\
Character\
The Characters were just amazing!! I mean really AMAZING! Even though we can't really think like them ( since they are geniuses ) we can still imagine them doing their actions. Not only that, the MC develops throughout the entirety of this story which really is rare \
Enjoyment\
At some point of this anime I actually felt bored, I don't know why... but at some point of this story the pace was to slow... \

    Well, Death Note. A name pretty much everyone who watches anime knows. This series is great and will keep a viewer interested almost nonstop.\
Story: The story is completely original and was one of the coolest stories ever. A 17 year old finds a notebook that kills the person of whoever's name is written in it. Sounds legit. The story is honestly very cool, but it can be confusing at some points during the middle of the series. But, one complaint I do have is the weakness of the second season after a tragic event. Pretty much every watcher can agree the second season was OK\
          \
        compared to the first. But, the pros here outweigh the cons. 10/10\
Art: The art is very well done. All the characters look clean and crisp, and the backgrounds were drawn in amazingly. Overall, the art is great. Not much to say in this section.\
Sound: Ok, I loved the sound in this show A LOT. The first opening was cool and sweet, showing us pretty much every character that appears in the first season. The second opening is Japanese screamo witch is also freaking awesome, and this time, showing us every character in the second season.  The BGM was all very cool, and each main character had several themesongs and all of them fit the corresponding characters perfectly. 10/10\
Character: The characters were the best part of the show. Light was a cool character although he honestly was a jerk to everyone. All the other minor characters were very cool and I liked them. Then...L. By far my favorite male character in any anime series. He is the coolest character in this show and almost anyone can agree on that. L's students, Mello and Near were okay. I liked Mello more because he was violent, and Near was...strange. 10/10\
Enjoyment. I give this area a 9/10 because the second season really lacked for me compared to the first season, and I guess my expectation for the second season was too high. \
Overall: Death Note is a must watch for anyone, anime lover or not. The story draws you in very quickly and continues to until the very end. 10/10\

    Death Note is a anime that you either love or hate it. The story starts out simple enough, (normal person gets powers etc), but then takes an immediate turn. Light is an exceptional character which believes that his way is the only way to \"righting the world\" and toward the end, you really start to want him to succeed. The story line has many little (or not so little) strategic moves that is almost representative of a game of chess. The constant mental battle between Light and L really keeps this anime on its toes, at least in suspense wise. I highly suggest this anime\
          \
        to anyone out there looking for something different then just your regular battle anime, for this anime requires you to sit down and use your brain.\

    Death Note. This is one of those anime series that had me riveted from the beginning. Sure the story kind of moves slow. There is some times a lack of action. What is lacking in action is more than made up for with intelligent story telling, and a very psychological intense scenario. A high school kid finds a note book, if he sees a picture, and knows their name, he can write it in the book and kill them, and write how it will happen. This power corrupts. The story gets intense as they call in a special investigator who is as witty and intelligent\
          \
        as the killer. The two battle in a chess match of death.\
For sure this is one of the best anime to hit the shelves in the past 10 years. If you are into intelligent story telling, and character driven anime, I highly recommend this. This is a very cool dark and Erie series. Perfect for us weirdos. Check it... I give this a 10 out of 10........I enjoyed everything about this anime\

    Death Note is one of those animes you will have to rewatch several times to get the full story and understand the full story. And even then there will be quite a few things that still have you puzzled.\
The main character, Light Yagami, a stellar high school student, comes across a notebook called the 'Death Note' dropped by a shinigami named Ryuk. The whole story is of Light's image of creating a world cleansed of all evil using this notebook, and the detective L's attempts to prevent him from doing so. Because after all, is it just and is it right to kill other people\
          \
        who are labelled as 'evil' in order to create a 'non-evil' world? And surely the person doing so is 'evil' themselves?\
Dealing with the illogical and slightly dark side of morals and ethics, Death Note is a fast-paced story that will have you puzzled at times, and having to rewatch episode after episode just to understand what is happening. But I guarantee you will enjoy every minute of it.\
The music, composed by Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi, is perfectly matched to this anime. I adore L's theme part B, having bought the soundtrack myself. Beautifully done and fits brilliantly with the anime.\
I'd recommend this anime to anyone who wishes to watch a cult-classic of animes, which sets the bar for all others. Towards the end, the plot does seem to spin out of control, but I gave this a 10 on the sheer brilliance of the beginning half of the episodes.\

    Death Note is by far the best anime I'v seen.  The story line is simply superb.  Characters are very well developed and their Voice acting is so good that you can feel their emotions.  The animation, sound and music are all at their best.   This anime has some of the best moments I've ever seen. Episode 25 (you know), episode 36 and a lot more.  \
The story is a game. It is a battle of two great minds.  Light, the criminal and L, a very well known detective.  Light gets his hands on a Shinigami's death book\
          \
        and whoever's name is written in the book dies.  L wants to find the identity of the person who is behind this all, i.e. Light. But Light is much smarter than this and catching him is not easy.  It's a story that will definitely keep you entertained as you can never predict what Light's and L's next move shall be. ",

    Story Summary:\
The story in death note revolves around Light Yagami, and outsanding student (smartest of Japan) who is pretty bored by school. A Shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk drops his Death Note in to the earth world. The Death Note is a notebook in which you can write names to kill people in whichever way you like. Light finds the book and tries to use it to kill every criminal in the world to make the world a better place. Soon, the best detective in the world mysteriously named L finds out about the killings, and sets up a task force to catch the\
          \
        killer. After that it becomes a battle of L finding Light and the other way around, containing all kinds of plot twists, and never stops entertaining.\
Story.\
Although the story revolves around a few set main characters, the side-characters switch constantely through the story. Although the plot-twists sometimes go a bit to far in my opinion, that's about the only negative thing I can say about the story. The suspense is amazing, as the plot-twists keep you on your toes as nothing is impossible. The battle between L and Light is a battle of two extremely smart people, and therefore lots of really smart plans are plotted which adds to the suspense even more. This makes the anime very exciting, from beginning to end. Also I must say that it's outstanding that the story is evenly good all the way, it has no ups and downs.\
Visuals.\
The visuals are one of the best, if not the best I've ever seen in a series. Dead-on quality animation combined with extreme eye for detail. It clearly shows the expression of every person, which gives you a clear idea of what they are feeling and thinking. A great example of this is Light when he is handling the notebook; he looks really angelic when he talks to others, but when he's on his own he looks like the devil.\
\
Voice Acting\
Original: The voice-acting in the original are done beautifully. Light and L express the emotions very well. Again Light has the possibility to sound very angelic, but when he's alone he speaks of his \"new world\" with a lot of evil sounding passion. The other side characters are not all as well done as the main characters, but no one is annoying or bad. In general the voice acting differs between some of the best I've ever heard and just very good.\
Dub: The Engish dub is not as good as the original, but that does not make it bad by any means. Light takes a bit of time to get used to, but when you are he's still pretty good. L is dead-on, and so are some of the side characters. In the end I recommend the Sub over the Dub, but if you want to watch subs (because you watch at night, or you have problems with reading or anything like that) I wouldn't say you shouldn't watch it at all, just get the dub.\
Sound.\
The Sound in Death Note is the best sound I've heard in anime. The sound always adds to the suspense. Also it's never annoying or in the way of the story or visuals, it just perfectly fits in.\
Re-Watch Value.\
The re-watch value of death note is there to some extend, however it is one of the weakest points of death note (not that that says anything). You surely want to see the series another time, however not more than once or twice. The reason to rewatch it is because you can only see the real beauty of the story after the second time, also you'd want to rewatch it because of the ingenious plans the main characters make. However the problem with the story is that the plot twists and therefore the tension is gone after the first time.\
Recommendation.\
I recommend everyone to watch Death Note. Even if you are not an anime fan, you're probably still going to like it. If you haven't seen it (which is unlikely if your on this site) go watch it. NOW!\

    Story:\
One of the best things I love about this anime is that it lets you pick who the real hero is. Kira (Light) is a person who thinks that death is the ultimate solution for crime. L is a person who thinks that criminals should be tried then imprisoned, and just thinks of Kira as a lowly murder. The perspective of the story is told from Light's view, but you will get to see from L's perspective from time to time. About little over half way through something happens and the plot takes a turn for the worst until the last two episodes. The last\
          \
        two episodes were simply, epic. Now that word is over used a lot nowadays but, I am confident that you will think so too.\
Art:\
Greatest art style I have ever seen, amazing detail. Awesome character models.\
Sound:\
Not only are the last two openings awe worthy if you like metal, but the music in the anime perfectly sets the mood perfectly.\
Character:\
All characters  are designed well and each have their own unique personality. Misa is the happy-go-lucky girl with a feeble mind, but makes up for it by being Kira's girlfriend and greatest worshiper.\
Enjoyment:\
As I said before the story is the absolute best until blank Dies. It just gets boring for this portion of the anime, but the ending makes up for it all. And my favorite character is introduced during this period.\
Overall:\
Regardless of the dry period, this is my favorite anime ever. It will be very hard for an anime to get better than this in my opinion. \

    when reviewing, I only review anime that I think is good. I don't review anime that I don't like, because I think it's like sticking your finger in the ass of a person you really hate and then tasting it. then you proceed to put your finger again to his ass and savoring the taste to make sure you are tasting real shit just to confirm it is shit.\

    This Anime is by far one of the best I have seen. Amazing story, and for the most part it stays close to the original storyline in the Manga. What I also love about this Anime is there is no antagonist or protagonist. There's no set 'good guy' or 'bad guy'. It's like you, the viewer, get to choose who's side you want to take. \
Just like with sports. Here a lot of people say 'Cubs or Sox?' well for me it's 'Kira or L?'\
The story kept me interested and if I ever missed an episode of Death Note when it first aired I would\
          \
        frantically search for it on the internet and watch it. If you miss one episode of Death Note and don't watch it, you might not get a clue whats been going on.\
The art is very amazing as well. I love how L turned out although at some points I wish he could have been better drawn. Light seemed to look good all the time though, same with Ryuk. \
Soundtrack wise it's good but I was hoping for more of a rock type soundtrack if you get what I mean. Mello's theme is my favorite mainly because it includes well....COOL GUITAR STUFF....YEAH.\
The characters are amazing. We have Light who turned out to be surprisingly evil. I liked him at first but then he just got...too insane for my liking. And then there's L. Most girls seem to like L because he's 'hot' or 'awesome'. I for one like L because of the way he thinks. It's just so freking amazing how he thinks and takes apart every little piece of information.\
Overall if you don't watch this Anime or at least briefly see one clip of it, you're totally missing out. Death Note has claimed number one Anime in my heart and I hope that this review will be enough to convince someone to watch it.",

    Introduction\
How far would you go for justice? Would you throw away your ideals if you had the chance to \"cleanse the world of evil\"? What even are your views on justice and just how far would you go if you suddenly had the chance to make those thoughts come true. As it has once been said before, \"Don’t judge a man when he has nothing, give him power and that’s a true test of his character.\"\
Death note is an anime that can be classed as a mystery, thriller type show but in actual fact it explores many more themes. It is a show that will\
          \
        challenge your sense of morality and will make you answer some very tricky questions as to what extent you can justify them in certain situations.\
Short summary\
The show starts off with a notebook that falls out of the sky and our main protagonist, Light Yagami, just happens to chance by it and picks up the notebook. This is no ordinary notebook however, as it is proclaimed within the notebook that whoever’s name is written in the notebook shall die as long as certain rules are met. This notebook is known as the \"Death Note\". One other thing is this, when you pick up the death note only you can see the death god to whom the book belongs to. Ryuk is the death god aka Shinigami, that Light can see and he is one of the most sly of the Shinigami. While quirky and jumpy on the outside, he is really quite dark and uncaring, as you would expect from a Shinigami. For Ryuk the events that unfold are all really just a cure for his boredom.\
Light Yagami himself is a university student and ranks amongst the best in Japan and is an aspiring police detective with a strong sense of justice, his own father being the police chief of the Japanese police. Light tests out the notebook to find out that it actually works and from this point on, he believes that he is the chosen one, the one who must cleanse the world of evil, even going as far as proclaiming himself to be god. He starts off killing smaller criminals and eventually begins to upscale his targets, at which point the killings cannot go unnoticed and this is where the main plot starts to pick up.\
Someone needs to find this killer, but when he can kill using simply a notebook, it isn’t so easy and many detectives give up. There is one detective however who keeps at it, introduced simply as \"L\", and the rest of the plot revolves around how Light and \"L\" are locked in a battle where Light tries to keep killing, while \"L\" has to figure out who he is. The scenarios that follow are extremely satisfying and at points awe-inspiring as both men are pitted against each other in a battle of wits and guile – often resulting in some very unexpected situations. This game of cat and mouse is enthralling, in fact calling it \"cat and mouse\" might give off the wrong sort off idea of how the whole finding the killer situation pans out. Put plainly when both your own father and L are after you, it adds a different dimension to the whole scenario. For most of the anime, Light and L are usually in contact and it is here that the unique twist kicks in. It’s as the saying goes, when you’re looking for something, you may look far and wide, but you will always miss the things right and front of you and this saying has some bearing on the show. Where other detectives would be left dumbfounded and unsure of themselves, L instead comes as a breath of fresh air, completely different to the typical detective and so much more quirky (with an undying love for cake). L is a man who knows to look at a situation from almost every angle and combined with his razor-sharp instincts, he is a man to be feared once he is after you.\
Characters\
Since the show is spread over 37 episodes, there is plenty opportunity to really flesh out each character. Death note achieves this straight of the bat, Light and L are both extremely well developed throughout the show. However on top of that, the other key characters such as Light’s father, Misaki, other members on the police task force and even the Shinigami themselves are all extremely well developed and help to mould the story as it goes along. What is really helpful however, is that each of the different characters fulfil their roles extremely well, each of them add their own twist to the story and are often instrumental in the way things pan out. There are people from all sides and all allegiances and the way they are scripted, it means there never really is a dull moment. In fact calling them side-characters feels like an injustice, in Death Note, the show really is made by the entire cast.\
Music\
The OP and ED are very rock heavy and involve loads of screaming. It’s mostly down to personal taste but I found them to be ok, except at certain times I found the shouting to be a bit much and as a result found myself to be skipping the OP pretty much every episode. The music that is used to enhance the scenes however is great, it does the job and does it well and that’s all there is to it. Many scenes actually tend to omit the music and focus on the sharp, witty dialogue and in a way the lack of background music works much better, helping to hold the tension in the air.\
Art\
For a 2006/7 anime, the art style is rather nice. The colours aren’t too in your face nor is it overly dreary-given the overhanging dark theme, they’ve balanced it just right. The characters themselves look fairly realistic for an anime and the backgrounds are always very detailed, giving you a much fuller and richer experience.\
Overall Satisfaction\
The show was certainly one of those which leave you completely empty at the end and wanting for more because it was just that good. It’s a classic show which will give you the \"void\". The story is really what drives this show and it’s one of the best, most original shows you can find out there. It’s one thing having a good story though, and it’s something else to execute it perfectly.\

    Death Note is one of the best series of all time. I won't say it's absolutely the best (for example I liked Higurashi no Naku Koro ni better), but still on top.\
Imagine chess and then add awesomness, and you'll get Death Note. This is the best way of describing it. But now I'll end glorifying this serie and try to describe why it's this good.\
This anime contains of two parts, and you'll know when one ends and the other begins. I will call them halves. I liked the first half way better than second. It's like this for me: at first I couldn't believe it's\
          \
        this awesome. Main character  does whatever he wants  with style. And then second genius gets introduced making this anime even more awesome. I lived from one episode to other, can't wait what they'll do. Then another important character gets introduced. Just for the couple episodes around this event this serie deserves being on top of the best anime list. But then there's one accident, we get a few rather boring episodes of not knowing what is happening and a couple of them without this tension and stuff. Then we finally get what we'd been waiting for, there's about two \"old style\" episodes, and... accident ending the first half happens. I didn't like much anything after it. We get two more characters, but they're just lame. And this anime goes like this, without the old tension nearly to end. I'll be honest - I stopped watching this serie few times, but returned to it there. And there's the end: three last episodes that are just too good. They're like all epicness that second half should have got released there. If anybody had made a serie this good and with 12 episodes, the world wouldn't bear the amount of awesomness, and would end. I personally thought Death Note has 36, not 37 episodes, and when 36th one ended on cliffhanger I nearly got heart attack. Seriously.\
The first half and the three last episodes are the reason why this anime is scored so high. Go. Watch. Enjoy.\

    Death Note's point of view is, of course, that the protagonist is actually Light's Moriarity to L's Holmes. Having a villain as an entertainment centerpiece is nothing new; just look back at Shakespeare's Richard III to see an ignoble main character who addresses the audience as he schemes. More modern examples would be The Sopranos, Pulp Fiction, or even the strikingly similar Showtime series Dexter. Indeed, it is not Light's prominence as a megalomaniac lethario that compromises Death Note as a series. In fact, its viewpoint is so rare in the anime world that it's refreshing.\
What makes Death Note deeply problematic instead is its total\
          \
        lack of a moral compass. The manga's creators have said that the intent of the series was never to explore the ramifications of Light's actions; it was to present a dramatic thriller with a cat-and-mouse game. I can accept that Tsugumi Ooba and Takeshi Obata weren't going to create a philosophical manga for Shonen Jump. But Light is presented as a hero. Even members of L's team often admit that they aren't sure if catching Kira is the right thing to do because he's doing so much good at cleaning up the world. L himself isn't interested in the justice aspect; he just wants to get his man.\
Death Note becomes not only morally unstable but unrealistic as it progresses. As Kira's work continues, wars stop. Crime plummets. Across the world, people are living in peace. Sounds great, doesn't it? But as we learn within the series, the Death Note only works when its owner knows the name and the face of the person to be killed. Could Light/Kira stop crime in first world countries where the names and pictures of those on trial are published every day? Perhaps. But wide swaths of the planet are not first world. Countless countries around the world, many with some of the highest corruption rates and amounts of lawlessness, are essentially \"off the grid.\" Nobody publicizes when a village is stomped down in some rural part of Africa. Nobody knows the names of the thousands of soldiers in some wannabe dictator's army going around indiscriminately murdering. For the Death Note to work, you've got to have media. No media, no luck. Talk about a logical hole in the plot!\
Even worse is that Kira is never wrong. No one wrongly accused or convicted ever dies. Even when he kills off \"good guys,\" it's always to keep from being caught. Only in one fleeting moment of the show do we see the fact that even the worst outlaw has family and friends who care about him. What about the stories of the families of those officers he kills to make good his escapes? Never told. All of this makes it look like Light is not only justified in doing what is morally reprehensible, but deserves his status as a near-god.\
All of that is bad, but very little of it is relatable to a teenager. No one's going to be able to kill criminals with a Death Note. Now if the audience were made up of adults, Death Note might be seen as presenting us with a moral conundrum to debate. (In fact, I've had a really good discussion over at THEM Anime on this series, and it shows that adults can have much more stimulating conversations about this show than many others that are just fluff.) However, there's another side of Light's personality that I haven't yet mentioned, one that's very relatable to teens, and that's his willingness to lie, cheat, and deceive in order to achieve his objectives.\
Perhaps the best example of this is episode 7, which nearly made me stop watching. By this episode, Light has killed an FBI agent named Ray Pember. His fiance, a former agent, wants to meet with the investigating team to discuss her husband's death. The majority of the episode involves Light walking around with her while the audience hears his inner monologue as he schemes how he can find out her real name so he can kill her. By the end of the episode, he succeeds. Lying to get your way works. Now murder by notebook might be impossible for a teen, but the show presents immoral means to get what you want as very attractive, very successful, and consequence free. If Light is a moral exemplar, which the series does not refute in any way, then why not act accordingly? For an adult with a fully formed sense of right and wrong, the episode was nervewracking and disturbing. But for a teen who hasn't given it much thought? It could seem very appealing.\
Before my review sounds completely judgmental, I have to say that Death Note is intriguing and engaging. Despite my lack of warmth for the show as a whole, L quickly became a favorite. His personality quirks and unique style -- and the fact that he is the real hero of the show -- make him a memorable character. There is a surprising amount of humor that lightens the otherwise grim tone (and not in a perfunctory or inappropriate way). The world of the Shinigami itself is creative, and while the show fails to capitalize on it, the \"what if\" concept of the Death Note is a philosopher's dream. I thought the morality presented was flawed through and through, and it has other problems such as a reliance on overused shonen tropes like internal narrative and an amazingly baffling plot twist two-thirds of the way through that nearly wrecks the final third -- but the curves and turns along the way kept me engaged throughout.\
The long and short of it is this: Death Note is wildly inappropriate for the Shonen Jump audience for which it is intended. Middle school and early high school teens are going to have a difficult time sorting out the good from the bad. (Heck, some adults do!) The creators may have wanted to make a simple thriller, but they built a world that cries out for ethical explanations. Giving none is inexcusable. My rating balances the facts: it's an effective thriller, but one that could be morally detrimental to the crowd it seeks to seduce.\

    Death Note is definitely worth your time.  This is true if you are completely new to anime or if you're a seasoned veteran (in which case you've probably already seen it).  It follows Light Yagami, a teenager who happens to find a magical notebook dropped by a God of Death which grants the user the ability to kill a human by writing their name while mentally visualizing their face. Light decides that he wants utilize his newfound power to rid the world of those he finds to be evil or detrimental to society.  Death Note follows Light's interactions with the authorities as\
          \
        he attempts to become the \"god\" of a new world.\
Story (9/10)\
The story is quite intricate at times and can best be described as a battle of wits.  Practically every action taken by a protaganist/antagonist (however you define them) is meticulously planned and thought out.  The story can be compared to a game of chess, but unlike chess, both players do not have perfect information, making their positions much more interesting and complex.  The one and only qualm I have with Death Note, however, is the ending of the story.  Despite the ending being logical and inevitable, it is oddly unsatisfying.  Mainly due to the fact that the viewer is not entirely sure if the information that the characters portray about the ending is indeed accurate.  We are given an explanation of occurrences by one of the characters, but we do not actually know if what they're telling us is completely accurate.  This has lead to various theories and does leave an air of mystery surrounding what actually happened.\
Art (9.8/10)\
I absolutely love the art style in Death Note.  It does not fall prey to incessant fan service but actually takes the opposite approach and pours an exorbitant amount of detail in more mundane clothing and objects, such as suits and pencils.  Additionally, the characters are all very unique visually and easily recognizable.  The manga had a dedicated artist and a dedicated writer, which I believe was quite uncommon at the time. I haven't kept up with manga trends recently, but it does serve to illustrate the fact the a lot of effort went into the art as well as the story.\
Sound (9/10)\
I am rarely impressed by soundtracks, but this one is fantastic.  Madhouse has an uncanny ability to make even the most mundane tasks or events seem absolutely epic and this is achieved largely through the soundtrack.  However, there is one specific track that tends to play in the background during the more intellectual moments or during a character's scheming/planning.  It's certainly not a bad track and it's quite fitting, but it does start to stand out after a while. Also, can we give a standing ovation for Mamoru Miyano's voice acting? Absolutely stunning. I recommend that you watch the sub, for that experience alone.\
Characters (10/10)\
Death Note houses a wide variety of characters whose personalities all contrast each other.  There is the visionary narcissist, the paragon of justice,the awkward yet genuine loner, the love-smitten loose cannon, the dedicated disciple, the no holds barred criminal, the calm and rational analyst, and lastly, the neutral observer. Among all of these personalities, there has to be at least one that the viewer can relate to, right?\
Enjoyment (9.5/10)\
This show is just a thrilling ride. Even if some of the battles are just mental battles, they are being played not only with the participant's lives on the line, but also the lives of many others.  When faced with death, one's true character shows itself. Many of the characters are lovable and many are easy to hate.  I enjoyed myself simply rooting for certain characters to die or survive.  \
Overall (9.5/10)\
The only way that somebody could not like any aspect of this show is if they think its ugly and they hate thinking. There's something here for almost everybody in addition to raising some pretty serious and legitimate philosophical questions. Should we be able to kill people who have demonstrated a lack of respect for others through mass murder, serial rape, etc.  Is it okay for a citizen to take the law into his own hands when the government fails him? These are generally the types of questions that make people uncomfortable because there is some legitimate consideration.  It's just a classic that I recommend to anybody interested in anime. \

    Ok, so this is my first time writing a review.  I decided to do Death Note just because it was the first alphabetically on my list, lol. There will probably be minor spoilers but nothing major... We'll see. So I guess I'll start with an overall gist I got from the show.\
Death Note is a show about a boy who finds a 'magic' book in his school courtyard... Within the first 5 minutes of the show. When he gets home he reads the inside cover of the book. Apperantly, writing the name of someone kills them. He wants to see if the notebook is\
          \
        just a prank or something, so he picks a mainly small criminal from the news. It works? It does! He decides he wants to be the new 'god' of Earth. And I gotta admit das a pretty c00l goal to get to. But standing in his way is the detective known as 'L'. Shenanigans ensue.\
/STORY- 5 OUTTA 10 EDGES\\\
So I 'summarized' Death Note up there. ^ **Here's where most of the spoilers in this review come in, so you have been warned.** So I thought the story was pretty... Ok? I guess? It's supposed to be a mystery, but I didn't really think it was considering we saw from the antagonist's point of view. I mean, obviously it's the detectives trying to solve the mystery of how so many people are being killed and who's doing it, but it wasn't as engaging as you'd think. Scooby Doo was more engaging than this. Which reminds me- that was one of the things I actually did like about the story- the perspective. I really like how we saw from the 'Bad Guy 2006' perspective. And I know it was supposed to be deep too but it just felt convoluted in the end.\
Oh, did I mention Death Note is separated into 2 parts?\
So we have part 1- which was the summery of what I gave above. It lasted for about 30 episodes or so. BUT then at around ep 30-31, I feel the story became 10x worse. I mean the story was pretty solid up until here. It was like a solid 7-8/10 at least... But it took a turn for the worst. The ladder arc may have been benifited from a 52 episode series- but from what I can tell it may have then been too stretched and filler-y. All in all, the second arc/saga really detracted it for me.\
/ART- 8 OUTTA 10 DEATH POST-IT NOTES\\\
Alright, so the art was pretty 'Anime Standard' if you know what I mean. The art was a little different... But in its own way. Now, this isn't JJBA where the art is super different BUT still manages to look amazing. Basically some scenes make the colors black and white with only the important things vibrantly/saturated color (I.e. Apples, a motif of the show, or hair to represent character) which I liked. The simplicity actually worked very well. But there isn't much more to say, it's a typical 'shonen' art style. It wasn't goofy or anything though- this show did have 'monsters' (I'll get into that in a bit) but the humans did have proper color hair and whatnot (what I mean is this is a shonen technically but it isn't Soul Eater with pink and blue hair). The colors weren't super vibrant, but rather, more of an in between feel that comes from the mid 2000s.\
/SOUND- 7 OUTTA 10 LINKIN PARKS\\\
The sound for this show was pretty average. I find it a bit hard to remember, which means it obviously wasn't 'fantastic' in my opinion. BUT it did sound ominous and fit the feel of the show. The first opening was great. Like without the show I still would have liked it. I don't remember much of the first ending... It was ok I guess. Now the first intro... It's... Special to say the least. The visuals got really spiced up. You could really  feel the show taking a different arc. Ah yes, a less well made op for a less well made arc. Excuse the meme, but it just felt... 'Edgy'. I guess I really don't know how to put it. Same with the second ed. It was ok overall.\
/CHARACTER- 4 OUTTA 10 SHINIGAMI\\\
Characters are where Death Note suffers the most. They just feel... Boring. Boring like the story. Maybe the characters made the story boring? Or was it the story that made the characters boring? So I guess I'll go over them 1 by 1, since I don't really know how to do it otherwise.\
LIGHT 'KIRA' YAGAMI: Bland af. I'm not starting this character list off with him first because he's the main character, no, because he is the WORST character, The thing he suffers from the most is underdevelopment. We don't know who this guy is and where he comes from- he finds the Death Note within the first 5 minutes (maybe not even that) of the series. Did he always have a strong sense of justice? Was he always very intelligent and good at planning? Did he always need to get his cranny in check? These questions don't get answered, so he had no development. And don't even get me started in how he acts in the last episode. But I won't 'spoil' the 'fun'.\
RYUK: Cool guy with a cool design. All the Shinigami look fun and interesting. One of the maybe 3 likable characters in the series. He was pretty funny at times and I DO like the way he was in the last episode. Not much else to say.\
L: L is the detective put on Light's case to catch him. He's apparently the best detective in the world. You know, just saying. He's like that with a total of 0 backstory. He's still pretty kind of likable though. I mean, maybe I was only cheering for him because I definitely WASN'T cheering for Light. He has a food motif going on and it's pretty legit. L is one of the major reasons this show should have ended at the end of the 1st arc. No spoiler tho.\
MISA: Sort of forgettable. She just really liked Light in the beginning... But was one of the more fleshed out characters by the end. And her Shinigami was pretty cool too but they all are. Rem I think it was? I don't really think he did anything though...\
But maybe my memory is just faulty.\
NEAR: Ugh this is where the show got trashy. He's some kid who bears many similarities to L (i.e. toy motif vs food) for some reason. There is a reason but it wasn't fleshed out enough to actually matter to me. He also has a rivalry with Mello to catch Kira first. Now Near was basically L, just 10x blander. That's it. I keep saying 'that's it' a lot but I mean it. There isn't much to it.\
MELLO: So when I was watching this show I couldn't help but think of mello yello soda every time I heard this guy's name. Seriously I couldn't. Aside from that though this was another pretty forgettable character. He was apparently the leader of a Mafia like group- and they were pretty successful. He actually gets his claws on the Death Note for a bit. But like the rest of Arc 2, he goes no where. Honestly, no real reason for him to be in the story aside from 'buliding (if you can call it that)' the backstory for this part of this show.\
MATSUDA:Dankest one. Definitely the one I could 'self insert' into the best, as well as my favorite character. He was the most like \"oh hey look a bunch a' crazies.\"And in the finale, I think I would have done the same thing as him or something similar soooo..... \
yeah.\
/ENJOYMENT- 3 SNORING PEOPLE OUTTA 10\\\
As you may be able to tell from that subtitle ^ I found that this show to be extremely boring. Like soooo boring. I literally fell asleep at times. This was one of those shows where you had to watch like 5-10 minutes at a time then give yourself a break because it was that much of a pain. Parts that weren't filler felt like filler, honestly. Now you might be thinking to yourself, or maybe even leaving me a message that says: \"TEHN Y DID U CoNtINU DIS SHO\" Well, I'll answer that. Because everyone was telling me 'oh it's a masterpiece' or 'watching its so well done and deep' and most of all 'death note is really famous get more involved with the community and watch it'. Alright so I'd di all those things, and, sorry, I didn't see it. To me, enjoyment is everything. But wait! You might also be thinking to yourself, \"Is this guy serious right now? He gave Death Note a 5 but SAO a 7 and 9? What the hell is he thinking?\" Well good reader, I will answer that one too. It's because despite how stupid that show was, I at least got a good laugh about it. Hey, at least it kept me awake. All in all, most of Death Note felt like pointless drivel.\
/OVERALL- 5 OUTTA 10 KIND-OF-TRYING-TO-BE-HORROR-BUT-NOT-ACTUALLY-HORROR-ANIMES\\\
\
So, I wouldn't recommend Death Note to many people. I would recommend it to some (I.e. A twelve year old who thinks he's cool) but it's not for everyone. Who knows? Maybe I'm just too dumb to see this was a real masterpiece. My whole problem was the whole second arc, but also how overrated this show was. Seriously. It's been seen as one of the main representatives for years when it doesn't really need that spot. Now, do I think it would have benefited from a sequel? Yeah, definitely. There were many loose ends- maybe not loose ends to say but it just ended ubruptly and was unsatisfactory. Maybe they could have actually shown some backstory in a prequel also. \
I hope you enjoyed my first review! \

    \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" - Harvey Dent\
This quote, I believe, fully matches Death Note. What a brilliant anime. It has a very unique story: a god of death drops a notebook into the human world. A boy, Light Yagami, picks it up and discovers it has the power to kill anyone with only a name. He resolves to become the God of a new world, free of crime and corruption. He is constantly opposed by L, the world's greatest detective who has made it his goal to stop this murderer dubbed \"Kira\".\
Throughout the entirety\
          \
        of the anime, you feel for just about every character. The plot twists are incredible, the story flows very well and each episode leaves you wondering what comes next. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially with the godly voices.\
Overall Death Note is an anime that I have loved watching. I personally will not be watching it again as it is an extremely long anime at a whopping 37 episodes, but I would highly recommend it to anybody.\

    This anime was a big disappointment for me because I heard great things about it from my friends and got told to watch it because it was great. Although it did start out as a great anime with a very interesting plot that gets more exiting as it goes along it falls off real hard when one of the characters that is really important to the story dies. From there on it just goes downhill and never gets better.\
Story- Like I mentioned above, it started really great, learning how the death note works and how the police are tracking down Kira. It was really exiting\
          \
        because Kira had someone great to oppose him and it was the best rivary I have seen in a while in a animebetween Kira and L. The story falls off by the second half. It feels like is another anime or at least another season, they even changed the themed songlike really?\
Art- It looked great but nothing special.\
Sound- Loved the first theme song but not the second one, love the tone it gave in different scenes, nice sound editing.\
Character- Kira, Kira father and L and the Shinigami were the only interesting characters in the whole anime. The others were needed for the story but you don't really care for them. You are only invested in knowing how this rivalry between kira and L would end. That was the best part of the anime.\
Enjoyment- Had fun with this untill like episode 20 something around there. It just goes downhill from there. This is actually my first review that is a bit negative and although I'm naming a lot of flaws with Death Note I still think it was good. When you watch it you'll know what i'm talking about once you get to the second half. I recommend this to all anime fans but don't get your hopes up for this one. \

    Death note review (9.5/10)\
(This aims to be a spoiler-free review. However, if included, any explicit spoilers will be in a marked off section at the bottom of the review.)\
Story:\
Death note has a quite original concept behind it; a book in which you can write peoples' names to kill them. Death note is a mature, intelligent anime which displays a battle of wits between the main characters. You get thrown straight into the story with in 5 minutes and the action really does not let up for at least 10-15 episodes. \
The engaging battle between Light and L dominates most of this period, starting with an\
          \
        epic opening encounter. This conflict is made so good by the detail and logical approach with which each of the two make their plans and how their thoughts are conveyed to the audience. There are some great tense moments with unpredictable and clever uses of their resources as well. It is clear that both are geniuses to be reckoned with and both have the same goal, to find out the other's true identity. Furthermore, both characters are made to be likeable (some people would disagree for Light) so that you are not really sure which side you are supporting, especially as the main character, Light, is technically the evil side.\
The story takes some interesting twists, coupled with introductions of new ideas and characters. Most of my favourite episodes were the ending episodes of each arc which were made to feel really intense.\
The first 25 episodes almost equal my favourite anime series I have watched so far. The story has a near perfect pacing, not becoming repetitive at any point and it brings together a lot of interesting concepts. The last 11-12 episodes were weaker. The pacing was slower and less detail was given into the plans and logic of the main characters. And the dynamics between the characters was less enjoyable. It was still a good run though just wasn't as perfect as the start. The ending was a bit disappointing and was probably the worst execution of a battle between the main characters in the series, which had so much potential in the circumstances. \
Characters:\
The main characters are well written with their motivations well set out and their weaknesses subtly shown at different points in the series. Light with his superiority complex, seeing as himself as a worthy God, fit well with his goals to judge the world. Ultimately most of the time he had the intelligence to back up his arrogance and his central goal stays quite consistent. \
L presents himself as one who has a strong sense of moral justice, which spurs him on to try to solve the case. However, his methods of investigating perhaps show a different side of him and at times it does seem as if he is a detective to get a feeling of fulfilment by solving cases. Even though Light and L are very different there are clear parallels between them, which is most evident during the middle few episodes. The secondary characters are focused on less but you still feel emotionally connected to them and understand their feelings and most of them play important parts in the series, each contributing to at least one major plot event. There is not much character development in the series but different aspects of each character are explored in more detail in different arcs.\
Overall Light and L are two of my favourite anime characters.\
Soundtrack and art:\
The soundtrack is spectacular and fits in very well with the setting and events of the series. L's and Light's theme have multiple remixes, all of which set the scene well and kyrie and low of solipsism are a few more of my favourites. The art style is nice and the variation of the drawing of Light at different times and circumstances in the series is great. L's character is a great presence to have in any scene and you always understand the emotions of the characters.\
Enjoyment and conclusion:\
As much as I consider the other categories in my rating, the most important thing for me is my subjective enjoyment of the series (which does somewhat depend on the above sections). During both my first run and my rewatch I wanted to continue to the next episode straight away almost every time.The cliffhangers and plans which span out over at least a few episodes makes it easy to rewatch, allowing further analysis and appreciation of how well written said plans are.\
For this reason, I believe death note is a true masterpiece and deserves a 9.5, even if its last episode run is a bit weaker. Anyone who enjoys a thriller with supernatural plot points or an epic adventure with psychological aspects will enjoy this anime!",

Summary\
Death Note is about an average high school kid with above average intelligence named Light Yagami. Light finds a book on the ground with the title ‘Death Note’ inscribed on it. The magical book has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in the book as long as that person’s face is being pictured in the mind of the writer as they jot down their victim’s name.\
Light soon goes insane with his newfound power and starts to rid the world of all criminals. His ideology is that anyone who commits a crime shall die and that he shall be the God of his\
          \
        new world and supposedly peaceful world.\
Light’s main antagonists are a team of Japanese detectives led by a super genius who goes simply by ‘L’.\
Upsides\
\9Death Note is filled with non-stop action in every episode. There are always deep, psychological battles happening as the detectives try to capture Light.\
\9There is also a great blend of fantasy that is mixed into this anime with the involvement of a Shinigami that comes with the Death Note and it works out really well.\
\9Another major pro to this anime is Light relationship with his father who his on the team of detectives bent on stopping Light.\
\9Death Note is most certainly a major accomplishment in the anime genre and is definitely a masterpiece.\
Downsides\
\9As mentioned above Death Note is a masterpiece and therefore has very little if any flaws. If there is one flaw in Death Note it is that most of the action occurs in psychological battles rather than physical ones. However this shouldn’t turn anyone away as the psychological battles are as entertaining as any physical battle.\

    Anime ratings are based on the parameters of Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall. While I've given Death Note near perfect scores in the first 4 categories, the last two categories contain a score of 8/10. People who have already seen and even written reviews about it can probably guess why. \
I've finished the show recently (yesterday), and I can say without hesitation that the Good and Bad about this show can be split right down the middle of the episode list. Before I get to the bad stuff, lemme just say that the first half of Death Note is perhaps THE BEST FIRST\
          \
        HALF OF ANY SHOW... period. I had to take a breather and put the show on hold so that my mind could recuperate from all the orgasmic MIND F**K that I had subjected myself to. \
Picking up where I left off, I found that new characters were introduced but somehow the overall intensity and pacing of the show had gone slack. Don't get me wrong the second half is good, the problem is that it doesn't hold a candlestick to its AMAZINGLY ORGASMIC first half. However, it's not even the second half as a whole that is responsible for me giving my overall experience a mere 8/10. \
 The fact of the matter is, that with AN AMAZING first half and a pretty good second half (most of it) the ending of the show leaves a lot to be desired. I shall say no more because I cannot give you any context without spoiling things, but the poor handling of the ending is the only reason this show is not up there in my personal favorite list with Brotherhood.   \

    *Anime (Dub) Review* \
I quite enjoyed Death Note. \
The story was told well, although paced a bit slow at the beginning. The episodes were a bit complex though, there's a lot of internal monologue and a lot of thinking involved. The plot was pretty unique, and I found each episode fulfilling, and almost no filler episodes occurred. One thing I liked about this series is there really was no romance or fanservice. I find many anime could do without romance and fanservice, but don't get me wrong, it fits excellent in some anime. The ending of this anime was satisfying, but unexpected (at least for\
          \
        me). I wish it would've had an alternate ending, but I'm happy it ended when it did. \
The art and sound in this anime was just OK. I watched the Dubbed version, and I'd say that the voice acting is pretty nice. Everyone's voice fit their personality. I also loved that each character had their own beautiful theme music. The art was rather gloomy, which fit the series, but it wasn't the best I've seen. What I will say about the art, however, is that all the characters looked different, and I liked that a lot. \
One thing I certainly loved about Death Note was that there weren't really any tropes, but there were a few cliches, such as sitting in the back two rows next to the window.\
Overall...\
I think this is a great anime for newcomers, or veterans. It's a great and memorable series. \
*I would also recommend re-watching this anime. There's actually a lot I missed when I first watched it, and it's more enjoyable the second time around. \

    \"Death Note\" is simply one of the best anime series from the recent years, having an outstanding animation, very interesting characters and a magnificent plot, filled with many unpredictable and surprising plot twists, keeping a high level of tension from the beginning until the ending of the story.\
The main premise of this series was pretty attractive and very well developed, making a great use of some supernatural elements in a realistic context.\
The motivations and psychology of the characters are portrayed in a very convincing manner: Their complex personality's serves as the main core of the plot development, resulting in one of the most fascinating mystery\
          \
        series ever made in the history of television.\
The animation is simply excellent: Not only the character's designs are beautifully made (Having all those designs many subtle details which are able to combine realism with the stylish characteristics from the anime aesthetic) but also has a flawless atmosphere, which captures perfectly well the overall mood of this series. The use of colors and light effects is equally brilliant, keeping a high quality level in all the episodes. The voice acting and the music are pretty effective, complementing the greatness of the plot and the animation.\
\"Death Note\" deserved all the hype and praise that it received, being one of the most brilliant television shows that I've ever watched. It would be the perfect series if it wasn't for one little detail: Misa Amane. She is one of the most annoying characters ever made, and she feels totally out of place in the context of this series. I know that there is too much hate directed toward other characters (Such as Mello and Near) but none of them were so irritating and dumb as Misa. Maybe is just me, but I feel like this character were from a completely different anime, and that's the main reason why I don't like her very much.\
Other than that, this is a magnificent series, which I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this yet.\

When I became obsessed with this show and recommended it to some of my friends, they dismissed it, thinking that anime was somehow childish, and would be stupid, so I made them watch the first 2 episodes. Of course, they became hooked- it's impossible not to.\
Light believes that the world is rotten, and so vows to create a world without evil, using his 'Death Note'. The mood of the series is dark, and it follows the chilling battle of wits between Light, and a detective known only as 'L'. The sheer brilliance of both characters\
          \
        creates a mind game that will have you shaking with excitement as strategies and plans unfold.\
The show also challenges ideals/moral values and you'll have to think hard about your idea of justice as you pick a side- or are unable to.\
The only negative I can think of is that it felt forced after the 25th episode, but don't let that stop you from watching- it truly is an incredible series.\
Note: watch with subtitles- the English voice acting simply isn't as good as watching in the original Japanese.\
*The Verdict* Death Note is a dark psychological thriller and you will enjoy watching characters make impossible deductions and work their way out of impossible situations. By far one of my favorite series, I absolutely recommend Death Note as a must see.\

    Death Note.  One of the most well-known animes in existence with its unique storyline, unique characters and overall plot.  ...I hate this series.  \
Story (8/10): For those of you who DON'T know, Death note is basically an anime featuring a crazy man that self-proclaims himself as god and a detective that can make Sherlock Holmes his bitch, chasing around each other with overly complicated plans with insane amounts of resources, trying to find out each other's identities so they can bring the other person to justice.  While for the most part this anime does do well with its concept of its\
          \
        cat and mouse chase, it falls very flat with its final 8 episodes by changing one of the key characters and making it drag out in the most BORING way possible.  While there is fairly good pacing, the anime does stretch itself too much sometimes.  \
Characters (8/10): First is Light Yagami.  As the \"protagonist\" of the series, (I use protagonist lightly), he starts out as a very bored character.  Until one day, a magical notebook with the ability to kill people by simply writing their name down falls from the sky, his life changes forever.  With the mindset to be god and bring all evil villains to justice, (oh, the irony), his personality drastically changes to a more chaotic evil.  And finally, we have L.  As the \"antagonist\" of the series, (Again, lightly.) L always has a calm way of approaching any situation, and does not hesitate when he finds a potential clue.  With an addiction to sweets, L is a rather interesting character with the uniqueness that he holds.  Beyond these 2 main characters, the rest of the cast is filled with generally well-done supporting cast that mainly play a role as the 'toys' for the main 2 characters to use and play around with, so that they can succeed in their goal.  Overall, the quality of the characters are more well done then what I have seen in previous animes that I have watched.\
Art and Sound (8/10): As many people may know, the art style in Death note is a very high point.  With a more, 'realistic' feel and a very dark scheme of colors in the very detailed background, death note becomes a more standout anime from an art point. Next, sound.  For sound, Death note has a very interesting soundtrack from it's energetic first opening to its somewhat softer first ending, and its taken by surprise second opening.  \
Personal Enjoyment (3/10): Now, just by the rating for personal enjoyment alone, I know for a fact that I will get a lot of hate.  If you must, post a comment.  As I had said in the beginning of the review, I don't like this series.  The main reason?  My brain CANNOT understand what the hell the characters were saying.  For the most part, Death note is mostly dialogue and in order to understand what exactly the characters were saying one MUST read or listen to every part of the plan as the characters are explaining it, in order to fully comprehend what they are precisely explaining.  If you're an idiot like me, it basically means that you have to listen to them talk and just watch on to see their plan in execution.  For me, this series was really boring and I was painfully watching every second of it to finish it.  I would recommend this to people who want a unique experience with a completely original anime or, to people who have a higher IQ then I do.  (That really shouldn't be hard to achieve.) \

        many people, it's their first exposure to the wonder of anime or at least the first one to take them on a high-octane, wild ride. Just like Billy, many viewers become enthralled by Death Note because it showed them the joy of riding a bicycle with no hands. It's one of the most well-crafted anime in history, but like every show or movie, it isn't without its flaws.\
STORY - 13/15\
Death Note's plot is deceptively simple: \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\"...and a genius highschooler happens upon this notebook and decides to take God's judgment into his own hands by killing off criminals. Throw in equally genius detectives, dozens of additional Death Note rules, and lots of dramatic flair and you have a bona fide cat-and-mouse game wrapped up in an engrossing psychological thriller. \
The writing is over-the-top but fits the adrenalized tone perfectly, aside from a few questionable lines (e.g. potato chips) that might have gone a bit overboard. Careful pacing from start to finish of each episode and melodramatic dialogue make for a rapidly accelerating rollercoaster. The latter half of the ride gets a bit bumpy with certain plot points, but the writing stays on point from beginning to end. \
Often times, people talk about how large a show's cast of characters is or how much death there is as if that alone serves to improve the story. As one might imagine, Death Note has quite a bit of death in it. The problem with death in stories is that it typically serves to create emotional turbulence within the viewer's heart, but it's very difficult to achieve this without taking the time to develop the character before killing him/her/it. The bulk of the journey, Death Note hits the spot, creating very interesting and volatile dynamics between characters. It falters towards the end by introducing far too many pivotal characters for one to digest so quickly. By the final episode, the show does pick up the pieces to construct a fairly satisfying conclusion, but perhaps not upon the same solid foundation it began with. \
VISUALS - 10/10\
From a technical standpoint, Death Note stood in the top tier of animation when it aired. In terms of the fluidity of things happening on screen (i.e. FPS), it's still better than many anime airing at the time of this review. To reiterate, not in terms of resolution since it isn't natively in 720p or 1080p, but just talking about pure animation in the same way that Cowboy Bebop still trumps many modern anime in fluidity and detail. Studio Madhouse is well-known for their skill in creating very intense and suspenseful scenes through simple changes in camera angles and light distortion effects, both of which Death Note is a prime example of. Some people may criticize the liberal use of color filters and the tweaking of characters' hair and eye colors, but this was purposefully done to create the exuberant drama and suspense that are cornerstones of the show. \
SOUNDS - 10/10\
The soundtrack crackles and pops with the twists and tension of each episode. It knows when to come in loud and boisterous and when to simply flow along with a quiet or somber scene. There's a variety of electronic and orchestral tracks with multiple versions of many of them depending on the tone and pace at certain points in the show. \
It's hard to talk about the music without mentioning the voice acting that compliments it greatly. Everyone from the main to the supporting characters have been cast very well. In such a tumultuous and suddenly evolving anime, the voice actors succeed in expressing an array of emotions that produce meaningful, thought-provoking moments of silence in between all the dialogue.\
FINAL THOUGHTS:\
Here is an anime that takes a simple premise and expands upon it tenfold and in multiple dimensions of thought. Aside from the mind games it thrives on, it poses some real questions about morality and power. Complete with superbly consistent and fitting animation and a soundtrack that compliments it with its boldness and subtlety. One might almost be able to look past the few rushed and questionable plot points and lapses in characterization, but they must be taken into consideration. Certain parts of the show, namely the first half or so, do have a clearer sense of direction and tend to stand out more than the others, but it's important to weigh the entirety of the show on the same scale.  \
TOTAL - 33/35\
NOTE: Point systems are far from perfect and shouldn't be taken at face value or compared between anime alone. To get the full picture, the review should be read since it contains the reasoning behind the score and that reasoning may not resonate with everyone.

    Death Note was the first anime that I watched and knew it was 'real' anime. That was one hell of a transition, from watching Dragonball as a kid, to delving into the cerebral universe of Light and co. Simply put; Death Note is a sophisticated journey through the human reactions to Godly power, its characters range from phsychotic to completely logical, yet all of them have an array of diverse motives.\
The story itself is consistently brilliant, too often you'll be watching a series and know almost exactly what's going to happen. That never happens in Death Note unless they want you to. Art is realistic\
          \
        but not stunning, voice acting is above average at worst and great at best. \
I may be biased because of the nostalgic value of it being my first real anime, but Death Note will be making you think long after the finale wraps-up. Not just about the plot points, but also about what you would do with that kind of power. The moral questions raised throughout the series are a layer of sophistication that few TV series, never mind anime alone, have.\
The great thing about Death Note is that it never shoves that sophistication in your face, it never becomes obnoxious and still has a healthy amount of action. \
I know I'm putting hefty praise on Death Note, but it deserves it. I've run out of adjectives, so I'll end it here.\
Sublime series. Go see it.\

    \"No matter how gifted you are, you alone cannot change the world...\"\
What if you could? What if you were given the opportunity to change the world? How would you go about doing this? It could go either way, you could change it for the better, or for the worse. However, at first this question seems unrealistic, very few people have been able to do it. Just like the quote says, a single person cannot change the world. In most cases, this is true. You'd need the help from thousands of people in order to make something that has a lasting effect on the entire world.\
          \
        It's a good scenario to run through in your head, but that's all it's really good for, a mind game.\
However, every once in a while, someone will attempt to make a change on the world. For example, Adolf Hitler was able to take control of Germany and cause one of the most devastating wars on humanity, all because he had the idea he could change the world. There are others, too. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Alexander the Great... these people were extraordinary. Granted, Adolf Hitler didn't exactly help the world in any way, but he was given the opportunity to change the world, and he did.\
This anime is the perfect example of this question I have brought up. A story about a student in Japan who has been given the opportunity to change the world, for better or for worse... I present to you, Death Note.\
Enter our main protagonist/antagonist (whichever way you want to go), Light Yagami, a teenager who has realized that the world we live in is full of evil. Murder, rape, theft, any kind of crime you can think of, the world is full of it... and then one day, he finds a notebook of death, that causes the person who's name is written in it do die. Seeing his opportunity to change the world and become a God to everyone, he starts his journey to rid the world of evil, one name at a time.\
The story itself is one you can't just multitask to. You need to watch and listen to it well in order to understand what's going on. It's complicated and detailed, but it makes the story that much better. Full of twists and turns, love and loss, partnerships and betrayals, Death Note has it all. A truly unique and original story, with an ending that will leave fans satisfied or upset. Either way, this is Grade A screenwriting.\
Death Note was brought to us by Studio Madhouse, and let me say, this studio gives anime a realistic point of view in terms of artwork and visuals, which is a nice change from other anime with cool, yet unrealistic, art styles. The characters were designed with realism and perfection, and the scenery had a dark, yet satisfying feeling. A good break.\
English Dub VS English Sub... I must say, that in terms of the English Dub, Death Note has one of the best casts you can find in America now a days. Each voice actor and actress fit their roles perfectly, giving off a feeling that they were born to play their characters. It makes me want to hear more of their voices in other anime, especially Alessandro Juliani, who voiced L. He has very few roles, but he played an excellent L. As for the subbed cast, I can honestly say I prefer the dubbed, even though both versions were quite well done.\
4 characters will be talked about in this review, due to the fact that I probably wouldn't be able to talk about any more than that amount without giving too much about the series away. First off, we have Light Yagami... spoiler alert, HE'S KIRA! Light is a genius, which makes him the perfect role of the God of the \"New World\". He has every criminal investigator after his head, and he's been able to figure out how to stay out of their line of sight, and he is excellent at doing so. Next up is L, or Ryuzaki if reading the letter \"L\" is too tough on the eyes. Ryuzaki is the #1 criminal investigator in the world, being able to solve every unsolved case he's been faced with. Within a matter of episodes, he's able to pinpoint what location Kira might be hiding in with very little information. A good match against Light if I do say so myself. And then there's Ryuk, the Shinigami who dropped the Death Note that Light now possesses. He is, in my opinion, the comical relief in this dark series. His love of apples and terrifying, clown-like appearance, makes me enjoy seeing him every time he comes on the screen. Not to mention he kind of scares the crap out of me. I like that in a character. And then, there's the one character I had a problem with, Misa-Misa. A supermodel with the same power as Light who is just begging to be hit whenever she comes on screen. She was a key character in the series, and I'm okay with her role in terms of that, but frankly, she was just so... annoying. Without her, Light might have had a bit more trouble keeping out of trouble with the police, but at the same time, she causes about as much trouble as he would without her... Other than those few minor things, the list of characters in the series were all excellent.\
Death Note, without a doubt, is an anime that should be watched by both anime lovers, and those who don't care for anime but enjoy a good mystery/supernatural series. A great and detailed storyline, stunning artwork, great voice acting, interesting characters, and 37 episodes of pure excitement is what makes Death Note a keeper if you ever see it for sale on Amazon. I guarantee a lot of Death Note fans will agree.\

    Alright bros, time for a heads up. The first 25 episodes of Death Note are goddamn V.I.P. quality material. You want plot twists? Done. You want to see two chessmasters continuously one upping the shit out of each other? Check. You want to see some fucking intense notebook writing action? Double check. You want to see some L x Light foot action? Well, you're a sick bastard, but yeah, it's in here.\
As far as the plot is concerned, the basic premise is this. A shinigami named Ryuk is bored with life living in the shithole shinigami realm, so he decides to drop a death note\
          \
        into the human world so he can watch some bitch ass losers get jocked on. Model student Light Yagami finds the death note lying on the ground and passes it off as a bad prank, but takes it home anyway. He soon discovers that the shit is legit, and that he can kill anyone he wants, in just about any way that he wants, just by writing their name down in the death note and imagining their face while he does it (along with a slew of other rules which come into play). Light's only desire (revealed to you through a series of cheesy \"I WILL BE THE GOD OF THE NEW WORLD\"-esque lines) is to use his new found power to bring about a peaceful world. The only thing standing in his way is ace detective L, who is dead set on wrecking the shit out of whoever's responsible for the recent string of criminal deaths.\
But yeah, just, the first arc in general is badass as hell. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, and it sure as hell isn't apologizing for being over-the-top. Xanatos Gambits will be pulled, psychological mind games will be played, cheesy lines will be shouted, names will be written into notebooks in intense manners while ominous Latin chanting goes on in the background, but this is how shit gets done in the Death Note universe, and I'm not complaining. However, the biggest problem this anime has is that the second arc blows in comparison. The previous problem Death Note had with pacing only gets worse after the time skip. Everything grinds to a halt, and the decrease in writing quality leads to serious Flanderization problems. Everything just feels rushed and tacked on.\
Art and animation are well done. I think the character designs were made to appeal to yaoi fangirls, but it's forgivable. Sound is done nicely as well, although both OPs and both EDs are pretty terrible.\
When it comes to characters, you'll most likely only really care about Light and L. Both of them go through sufficient character development. The main problem is that the other characters are just sort of there as plot devices waiting to be utilized, and most of them either don't develop at all or develop unrealistically (Matsuda comes to mind). A lot of the careful development the characters underwent in the first arc was totally fucking wrecked in the second arc though, because the writers started making everyone act out of character to further the plot along. Mello and Near were hardly in the story long enough to get fleshed out, and Matt was introduced and then got stomped by haters in like two scenes. I mean, was it really necessary to even write him into the plot to begin with? Surely his place could've been filled by some random goons or something.\
Anyway, it may have its flaws, and it's definitely not the greatest anime ever, but it's still pretty fucking cool.\

    I have just rewatched this Anime recently and have seen it a total of three times and every time I watch it the more I love it!\
The storyline was very interesting and the characters were very well thought out. Light and L in particular were two of the best characters that I have probably come across in Anime.\
Although, a small point I also really liked the music that came with the Anime.\
Overall, it was a decent dark Anime with outstanding characters and a decent plotline, however I was disappointed by the last episode (but then it is always sad to see a series draw to\
          \
        an end)\
Defiantely worth a watch! Or even multiple watches!\

    Death Note features a deeply engrossing plot which comes across largely as an isolated battle of ideologies. What starts off as a suppressed story of a school-boy elevates to a battle of epic proportions with your tension verging on the overbearing. As the series progresses, it slowly loses the great momentum with which it rose and settles for a beautiful yet modest climax. Death Note is a celebration of the human spirit which deserved well more than the climax it has - however, it will continue to scour the top tier of animé for the sheer quality of its deepest thoughts and questions raised.\

        sketch: 9/10\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
The series rides on it's brilliant character sketch - see how the characters ride on their highs and fall steeply in their lows - contrast the various characters introduced and explore the series through their eyes.\
> Music: 9/10\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Death Note has music that brings out the emotions behind a scene better than words ever can. Quite simply put, the background music deeply settles the events portrayed in the series in your mind.\
> Animation: 9/10\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Many scenes of this series hinges on the brilliance of plot portrayal through it's animation - a job done well by it. Simple animation without excess clutter greatly helps in absorbing the rich plot of the series.\
> Enjoyment: 8/10\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Death Note's progression,  considering the force it started out with, is disappointing. It begins to feel increasingly forced and unplanned as you progress into it, and the later episodes certainly lack the elegant grace of plot revelation that the initial ones had. Averaging the scores of the episode through the series would roughly result in an 8/10 for the enjoyment that it provides.\
> Overall: 9/10\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Death Note is very often first suggested by anyone mildly into animé-watching to an animé newbie. This is not without reason - the sheer brilliance of portrayal of distinct ideologies and the techniques used for the same are a stand-out feature of Death Note. Watch how excelling in the above parameters helps Death Note to transcend from a mere fight between humans to a towering battle of ideologies.\
> Re-watchable: YES\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
The first half of the series has a high re-watch value. However, the series begins to lose re-watch value after that.\
> Why should you watch it?\
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
Death Note starts off with a bang and sports a finesse unrivaled by most other animé, which quickly engrosses you in the plot. For the above reason, Death Note is a great animé to watch for those who haven't watched animé before. Death Note features legendary mind-games which are a treat for those who like to think.\

    This may not be my first review, but this is my favorite. Why? Well because it is my favorite anime series of all time. Death Note is a beautiful blood bath of death and suspense. This anime has kept me a fan since I started watching till I burned out on it 3 years later, and it only took a week away before I was back watching the epic tug-of-war storyline that keeps twisting and pulling you back in. This anime is the best suspense anime I have ever seen. The characters are so well made that you start to truly pick sides in the\
          \
        conflicts just from their ideals alone. The Art work is amazing at conveying the intensity of this anime. From the insane laughter and craze of Light, to the calm and collected thoughts of L. You will love the characters, even the idiots. Death Note's music boosts the intensity of every single moment and it holds true on that statement even after you've finished it. L's theme gives you this instant feeling of drawn out suspense coupled with this deep thought provoking sensation. Also this anime holds the record for having my favorite OP or ED and that is Zetsubou Billy by Maximum The Hormone, this song is my favorite for it's metalcore and heavy metal sounds. The concepts and story of this anime are so crazy that the best way to describe them is a roller coaster without breaks. Everything is creative and suspenseful, and by any characters death, you will feel for the character. I highly recommend this anime to ANYONE. This anime is a gem in the anime world, and anyone who hasn't seen it, I feel sorry for you. You are sorely missing out on a wonderful experience. \

    When I first heard of death note, It really didn't interest me. An anime about someone with a note book which can kill people. What's the fun about that? Nothing. But I just had to give it a chance. Because all my friends were watching the anime. And so I watched the first episode.\
The story got me! It isn't about someone with a notebook just killing people, no, the whole essence of the story is about morality. When is someone good and when is some a bad person? If you get divine power, would you use it to clean up the world by people you\
          \
        judge to be bad? And is killing bad people a bad thing to do? At first I thought it was a good thing to do. In the begin you follow the deathnote-owner and you totally understand his thoughts and i kind of agreed with them. But when the policeman simply called 'L' came in the picture I began doubting the ways of Light (the name of the guy with the deathnote). \
Death Note makes you think about morality and just keeps getting better. Altough some people don't think the ending is cool, I did. I can't spoil too much so I'll just say: the ending might be dissapointing, but for me it wasn't. \
So what's so oustanding about the characters? Everyone who plays his part in the serie is just so freaking smart. Light and L try to outsmart eachother with exciting plans. There's not much action in this anime, more ratio. But I wouldn't call that a bad thing, since the ratio just left me with a happy grin on my face!\
I would recommend this to every anime or manga lover who doesn't necessarily needs a lot of action in his anime. \

    Death Note... The most popular anime, Death Note... The controversial anime that some consider overrated, others consider average, and a lot of people, the greatest anime ever. After watching 400 anime, I am going to declare that Death Note is one of the greatest anime ever. I'll try not to spoil anything at all about this masterpiece, but if I accidentally do I apologize in advance. Oh and if you don't like \"themes\" and \"AP Lit symbolism\" far-fetched crap, then I'd say you may not consider Death Note a masterpiece like me. I literally like a loser analyzed the entire story, and found it quite\
          \
        amazing and symbolic, but if you just want pure enjoyment, Death Note isn't boring, but isn't all that exciting either. \
Before and after you watch this anime, you must consider what you believe life, death, justice, and evil truly are. As people grow up do they experience events that change their views of the world that we live in? Is this world rotten or pure? What makes a person evil, receiving the power to kill? Or were people just born with hatred? Can't we just live in peace without any crimes...? Is the death penalty a fair form of punishment to those who have committed a crime? What makes a \"crime\"... a crime? Is it worse to fail at something or never attempt it in the first place? To what extent do you shape your own destiny, and how much is down to fate? Well, Death Note has it's on perspective on all of these questions. The anime starts off with a Death God, Ryuk who is bored of \"his world\" (Hell? Heaven? Nothingness? We never find out, it's for the viewers to decide where the dead, or death gods live/exist) and purposely drops his Death Notebook into the human world in search of something entertaining (escape from everyday routine, another team). Light Yagami, a genius high school teenager, who views the world as boring, unjust, and filled with corruption/crime conveniently finds the dropped Death Note which can kill anyone whose name is written in the notebook. After confirming the notebook's true power, Light vows to use the death note for \"justice\" and he sets out to cleanse evil, and create a new world where only \"good and pure\" people will live in.  How will he decide if a person is good and pure? Who knows, those terms are different per everyone's belief, but one thing is certain, Light truly believes that HE is justice. But once the government (police) notice that all the criminals are dying one by one, they catch on that the death's aren't natural and that someone is murdering them. Here comes L, the world's most genius detective, Who claims that HE is justice... And L sets out to catch the murderer and protect the world from \"evil\". Now, is Light truly an evil person because he's murdering people? Do you think L is a pure person because he's working under the law? The plot is designed to make the viewer decide for himself/herself. And so, the godly \"Justice\" Vs \"Justice\" chase begins. Who will win this ingenious death chase... Justice? or.... Justice?\
The story relates to many stories from the bible, such as \"Adam and Eve\" and the story of Judas Iscariot (You don't have to be christian to understand the message behind these stories). Not only is the plot unique and interesting, it's the most deepest story I have ever read (Symbolism, for example the use of the forbidden fruit, representation of the main characters names, and crow feathers on Ryuk, the Death God). Light mostly represents Adam. The Death Note is the forbidden fruit. Ryuk, the Death God is the serpent. When Light wrote in the Death Note, kind of like taking a bite of the apple (shown in intro), his eyes were opened, knowing good and evil, and he was deceived into thinking he could be like God, And just as Ryuk warned, Light would not live a happy live for making that mistake, thus, the fall of man due to sin (Book of Genesis). He also can represent Satan (masqueraded Angel of Light, Father of Lies, etc...) and even Judas to a degree. The color symbolism in the anime was intriguing as well. The way Light's hair and eyes become red, L's hair and eyes become blue, and the black/darkness of Ryuk. The anime is exciting and epic without any actual fighting at all!!! After every episode, the main characters, Light Yagami and L Lawliet leave me dumbfounded. If you actually pay attention to the thought process that goes through their heads, you are in for a roller-coaster ride to GENIUS-Ville. I know a lot of people that have watched Death Note started to dislike the anime after episode 25, but the plot continued to amaze me as Light Yagami continued to fulfill his crazy dream. Sure, it seemed like Light Yagami was now just trying to survive instead of actually eradicate evil from the world and serve justice... But it's in human nature to want to survive before worrying about anything else... Death Note is the only anime that I've found NO plot holes that affected/turned the direction of the plot. Did I mention that the pacing of the story is perfect? There's a nice balanced start, followed quickly by \"brain games\" which eventually creates a grand climax, and then the \"downfall\" in the end. All in all, this plot delves into a deep psychological game between 2 geniuses who have the power to change \"justice\" in the world. \
The character development in this anime is so amazing. Not only does the anime delve deeply into each character's mind process, and background, but also each character is a symbolic character that symbolizes a hero/villain (Are they both heroes? Both villains? One-One? That's for the viewer to decide depending on what they viewer believes is \"right\"). Although Light Yagami and L Lawliet are enemies, facing each other in a legendary psychological battle, we understand the friendship and companionship that develops in the dark between them. Also, the viewer has no choice but to cheer for both sides, because both Light and L want to change the world for what they believe is \"better\" (neither are trying to ruin the world, and neither are annoying, they are both geniuses). On the other hand, the other main characters Misa Amane, a popular pop-star, and Ryuk the Death God are both important and very symbolic characters that the plot uses in order to show the innocent and disgusting side of human nature. Sure, Misa has an high-pitched squeaky voice and can be annoying a lot of times, but her chemistry with Light Yagami and her importance in the story is just... amazing. Misa is another character who exemplifies the term \"human nature\" and really the loss of innocence and purity. Ryuk's just as important as Light and L... In fact, Ryuk is really the one dictating the entire plot. Ryuk is the invisible figure that spectates how our human world revolves every day, and we, the audience throughout the anime see through Ryuk's perspective of how interesting, yet repulsive we humans are. Misa and Ryuk have some symbolism going on as well. \
Ryuk giving Misa an apple from the Shinigami world, which Ryuk claimed tasted like crap was pretty symbolic. This is referring to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The evil witch tells Snow White that the apple is a magic wishing apple, which can make all of her dreams come true. However, the reality is that the apple is poisonous. Get it? Misa bites the apple by using her own Death Note, and falling in love with Light, but that \"apple\" (death note) is \"poisonous\". Hence her fall.\
L mainly represented Jesus. He came, served, cared, and wanted to protect all people, without discrimination. He was odd and unsocial, as opposed to Light, who was beautiful and quite popular. Very few actually trusted him, though it's understandable since he never reveals his true identity to anyone. He even cared about the very people who hated him and betrayed him. I must mention that the church-bells ringing in L's head throughout the anime really beguiled me, it was really symbolic. \
\"I am Justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil. I'm the one that will become the god of a new world that everyone desires!!\"                   \
                  - Light Yagami\
Allow me to explain why I find Light Yagami very intriguing: Often in great literature, the main character is an morally ambiguous archetypal \"hero\" whose failures send a message towards the viewers, which is just what Light Yagami is. Now, I see Light Yagami as 3 things. He is 25% Jesus, 25% The Devil, and 50% So very human. 25% Human inside of him is a naive dreaming teenager who is bored of life, and disgusted with the way human beings are living nowadays and wants to make the world a better place (Same as me). Why is he naive? His dream to kill all vermin (criminals, and people that get in the way of his dream) and become a god is impossible. That's something that cannot happen in reality, but his temptations got the best of him. Why is he disgusted with the way humans live? Have you seen all the murders? Rape? Injustice being served? Crime is flowing along like there's no police anywhere. Following the law? Please, think about it. If justice follows the tight law, how will it ever put an end to evil? Here's where I pity and relate to Light sort of... Well then again, what is evil?... How can we get rid of it? Light will show you in his own way. The other 25% Human is a psychopathic murderer who will kill anyone in his way, why? Because he wants to survive, just like all humans do. He is a psycho, no doubt. But it's human nature to want to live and achieve your dream. He has a dream to change the world and he won't just let anyone interfere. Now, the Jesus figure, he wants to become the God of a New World, pass righteous judgement on people, and make the world a safer, better place to live in. He wants humans to finally evolve into their greatest potential stage. He wants equal freedom, no corruption in politics, a justice system where justice can actually be served (clearly in today's society, justice is not being served well). He wants to be the protector of the world, unfortunately humans are mortals, there is a limit to what we can do. The Devil figure, he was corrupted by power and became evil, there's not much more to say. He was willing to get blood on his hands and kill, yet he was unwilling to sacrifice his own life (unlike Lelouch in Code Geass). All in all, his character really fascinates me, the stories from Adam & Eve, Betrayal of Judas, and all the other deep motif stories included in his life has me memorized. \

The voices for this anime were great. I usually like Sub- Voicing for anime much more than Dubbed, but in Death Note's case, they were both great. Not only was the voice acting great, but the entire soundtrack was GODLY. Go and listen to \"Low of Solipsism\", and \"L/Light's Theme Song\" and you'll see what I mean (EPIC). They also fit the dark mood of the anime perfectly. Now, the openings for the anime were certainly strange and unique. Some may dislike them, but I loved them as they were symbolic in their own way. The lyrics in the first opening, were along the lines of \"I'll show you a new world\", and the second opening, \"Is your life boring?!\". You'll understand why those lines are symbolic if you watch the anime. The animations in both openings were very symbolic as well. In the 1st opening, there was a picture of Light on top of the world, biting an apple, which later changed into a Death Note (Adam & Eve reference). Not only that but Ryuk had crow feathers that left blood stains (Crows represent bad luck and death) and around Light, there were white roses (represents purity and innocence) that quickly turned into red roses (represents death). Furthermore in the ending, Ryuk was sitting on a tree alongside a thousand crows, and crows wait for a person or animal's time (death) to come, just as Ryuk sits around and waits, during almost the entire story, to see when Light's time of dying will come (Once again the \"Light\" name symbolism, A Death God is waiting for \"Light\" to die out). Then in the 2nd opening everyone going crazy and glass breaking (Chaos, Unbalance, Corruption). The soundtrack/openings is arguably the most epic, and well-fitting music in an anime ever... But most importantly, the symbolism in the music/opening was brilliant! The art is old style art, making the entire anime seem even more realistic in a sense. My favorite type of art.\
\
I cannot explain to you in words how much I've enjoyed this anime. After every episode, I was left speechless and dying to see more. When the anime ended, I could not believe it (By the way, the ending is great, and very realistic... Serves a life-lesson about temptation and not being able to go back after getting blood on your hands). Let me just say that no matter what kind of anime you like, you will not dislike this anime, unless you are living proof that a man can live without a brain. And it's pointless for me to write anything else insulting of people who dislike Death Note because it will take haters the rest of the century to figure it out. As you can clearly see from how much I've enjoyed the anime, I can officially say that it's a Must-Watch, once in a generation show. Don't miss out, and I hope you found this review convincing at all, because it'd truly be a shame if you missed out on a masterpiece such as Death Note. Do your life a favor and watch it. \
After you watch the anime, make sure to think about all the questions I mentioned at the beginning of the review. and think to yourself what you believe is right/wrong, what the \"morale\" way to go at things are. No matter what religion you believe in, think about your role in life, and what will happen to you after death. Perhaps Death Note will change your perspective on things like it did for me... Or... I may just be over-thinking things... Anyways, if you haven't seen it, just watch it and judge for yourself..\

    Death Note was very disappointing for me..\
I came in expecting strong psychology and enjoyable character development only to be met with a childish game of hide and seek. \
Light and L are both a pair of immoral sociopaths trying to outmaneuver each other and care only about their own cleverness(lol).\
To them, the game between them is infinitely more important than the greater context of the world. It is a matter of ego, of proving superiority – and that's it. That's all there is to it.\
The entire show is more like watching one player play chess with themselves.. There are no stakes in this fight, because\

        there is nobody to cheer for.\
When two more opponents are introduced, they are just as materially identical. There are some differences in the basic method, but they're all technically the same basic person. The storyteller can't even manifest two different characters, let alone four.. and the funny part is that the story considers them as interesting enough to carry the entire plot\
The story itself wasn't bad.. however I expected a lot more from this show.\

    *WARNING SPOILERS IN THE REVIEW*\
Story: The story to Death Note is unique, and original. The story is about a High School genius named Light Yagami, as he was sitting next to the window in the last row like every other High School student, he saw a book falling from the sky called the Death Note after class he picked it up and put it into his backpack. When he got home, he decided to use it to cleanse the world from evil and make peace. But then he let power corrupt him, and became insane. I won't spoil the end for you, I recommend you\
          \
        see for yourself.\
Art & Sound: I must say the anime does do an outstanding job with the art style and sound, so I give it a 10/10. The voice acting is great as well, especially the dub, I don't know about sub.\
Character: The characters are great, except for Misa Misa she was annoying with her constant rubbish talk. Light was the most original character I've seen as same with L, Light starts out as a genius which is great. And L is one of my favorite characters too. \
Enjoyment: My enjoyment with the series was awesome. I enjoyed watching this anime, everything about it is awesome and totally deserves a second one which I highly doubt will ever come back.\
Overrall: My overall for this series is a 10/10 fucking amazing.\

    Death Note Review \
10/10\
So here, after watching it for 3-4 times I think? I 'll make a review for this anime series. Well, it really excites me to the point that I repeated it multiple times, it's obvious right? So here it is.\
PLOT: 10/10\
The plot really keeps me going. I love how each other side planned everything, look into every sides, analyze every details of any incidents and the like to arrest or to know the identity of that certain someone who criticize their beliefs. The story somewhat mirrors the reality as it shows the habits and doings of an average or common people in\
          \
        real life. How their life sucks and how every work and things they've done is useless, senseless, and has nothing to be gained upon. However, as we are unique people, we do have different point of views and principle in life and that is what this series showed us. How people stand in their own belief and fight for it, without thinking of the consequences and the weigh of the things they've been doing. How their soul vanish into darkness because of power and greed. And how there are still people who will be there to trust you, believe in you, love you and will try their best to turn you to the right path. One of the best concept I've love in this anime series is how it successfully portrays the human traits which is certainly one of the reason why this world sucks.\
CHARACTER: 10/10\
As for the character, they're all awesome. I don't want to be exaggerated but that is how I feel. I think, they've all successfully express the role that they need to show us. Every character is unique and every decision they made is humane. It has a basis. It comes from a human perception of what is wrong and what is right. Every character is fighting for what they believe. Well, there are different type of decision a human will take at a certain incident and time. That's how it always work. Any side of the character and how they act is, I think, justifiable. And sad to say, we can find the traits of these characters in our reality.\
SOUNDS: 10/10\
I don't really know how to rate sounds. I love the first opening song. The title is The world, I think? I also don't see any problem with the voices of the actor who did the dubbing. Great job? For me, they did portray in their voice what the character really is trying to portray and what the emotion on their voice should be.\
ENJOYMENT: 10/10\
I did enjoy watching this. I've repeated it multiple times, like I've said. There is no episodes that I find boring to watch and again, this anime keeps me going.\
That's it. I'm really sorry if there's a wrong grammar in here. I'm not an expert in English. I just want to give a review in the anime I've watch so yeah, here it is. I don't know if you also like the anime series but I really love this kind of genre. So I will really appreciate if you recommend something like this. Thank you!\

    Death Note\
Review By: John Fragglepuss Evans\
Death Note is a popular anime and it is easy to see why. It is a quality show that has plenty of character development, a complex storyline, good animation, a quality soundtrack, and a realistic setting combined with supernatural aspects. The show involves a lot of death so the immense popularity does somewhat surprise me, but then again, Attack on Titan is one of the most popular anime out there, and it involves just as much death and maturity.\
As previously mentioned, there are a lot of positives to the show. The characters and their development make you feel strongly toward\
          \
        them, whether it is love or hate. The Shinigami in the show are interesting and enjoyable to watch. The line between good and evil is difficult to see at times in this anime. Who is the hero and who is the villain? I found myself asking that question repeatedly throughout the series.\
You might enjoy this if: You want a unique story that will have you hooked from the first episode. This is not just a quality anime, but a quality show of any type.\
You might not like it if: You do not have the patience for a 37 episode series.\
Note to the Viewer: Be prepared to pause before and after the commercial breaks. They show the rules of the Death Note.\

    Baktığımız zaman konu orijinal, iyi işlenebilecek bir konu. Konuya giriş de fena değil aslında. Ölüm Defteri bulan liseli bir genç, dünyayı suçlulardan arındırarak, yeni bir dünya düzeni kurmaya çalışıyor. Nedenini anlayamadığım bir şekilde sempatik gelen Ölüm Meleği Ryukk ile birlikte Tanrı olma ideali için çalışıyor. Şimdi bu kadar güzel bir başlangıçtan çok güzel felsefi derinliği olan bir anime serisi olabilirdi. Yapımcılar sağ olsun bunu alıp bir güzel ergen savaşına dönüştürmüş.\
Animede en sevmediğim şey izleyicinin aptal yerine konması. Bunun nedeni ise başkahramanlarımızın olağanüstü zeki olarak resmedilmeleri. Light Yagami ve Ryuzaki (son sezonda Near ve Mello da buna dahil) karakterlerinin aslında zekadan uzak atışmaları animenin temelini oluşturuyor.\
          \
        Bunu yapmak için diğer karakterleri köyün delisini oynuyor elbette. Söylenilen her şeye ağızlarını iki metre açıp \":O\" ifadesi yapıyorlar. Yahu koskoca adamlarsınız iki ergenin sözüyle oyuncak oluyorsunuz, ayıp. \
Serinin bu karakterleri dahi göstermek için saçmaladığını söyledim. Anime boyunca şu tarz diyaloglar gördük:\
L: Bu gece ölürsem bilin ki sebebi Light'tır!\
- Hı?\
L: Üstelik iki Kira var. Light birinci, Misa ikinci...\
- Bunu nereden çıkardın?\
L: Çünkü çok zekiyim.\
- :O\
Abartmıyorum, diyalogların en az yarısı bu şekilde seri boyunca. Şu şekilde işliyor: Bir önceki bölüm veya sahnede önemli bir bilgi görüyoruz. Devamında ise L'in (veya Light'ın) ağzından bu şeyi birebir duyuyoruz. Bunun sonucunda bu karakterlerin çok zeki olduğunu düşünmemizi istiyorlar. Hiçbir düşünme yöntemi yok. Bu yolla L; ölüm meleklerini, hatta elma yediklerini bile söyledi. Light'ın Tanrı olmak istediğini biliyorduk da öncesinde ikisi de peygamber olmuş, vahiy alıyorlar. \
Diğer bir konu ise seride hiçbir karakter derinliği yok. Yan karakterlerin çoğunun zaten ne amaca hizmet ettiği belli bile değil. Ana kahramanlarımız hakkında ise fikir sahibi olduğumuz tek şey müthiş zekaları. Bunu da bir önceki pragrafta belirttiğim şekilde yapıyorlar. Bir de tuhaf hareketleri var elbette. Sanırım sempati duymamız için tasarlanmış bu kişilik bozukluğu olayı bana bir yerden sonra \"ayy tamam en değişik sensin\" dedirtti. Üstelik karakterlerin başarılı olduğunu söylemek zor. Ryukk'un sempatik olması dışında tüm karakterler fazlasıyla yüzeysel.\
Bir de serinin kendi içinde tutarsız olduğunu eklemeliyim. Bunu direkt bariz bir örnek vererek açıklıyorum. Misa'nın deftere tekrar sahip olduğu bölüm, L'in ölmesi gerektiği için tekrar göz takası yaptığını görüyoruz. Takip eden bölümde ise böyle bir şey olmamış gibi Light, Rem'in kendini Misa için feda etmesini sağlayarak oldukça dahiyane bir plana imza atmış oluyor. Misa halihazırda yarılanmış ömrünün yarısını neden harcadı peki? Tabii ki Light'ın cilalanıp parlatılması için. Seri boyunca bu tarz kurgu eksiklikleri de var.\
İlk paragrafta değindiğim gibi, anime Light'ın tanrı olma yolunu işleyebilirdi. Buna değinin ilk birkaç bölüm, kusurlarına rağmen, çekilebiliyordu. L ve Kira çatışmasına dönünce hikaye ilk darbesini yedi. L'in Kira ile tanıştığından sonrası ise ilgi çekici özelliği büyük ölçüde gitti. Üçüncü sezonun neye hizmet ettiği ise muamma. Final bölümü ise fazla kötüydü ve yine mantık hataları barındırıyordu.\
Özetten, potansiyeli olan bir konuyu \"fan service\" zımbırtılarıyla doldurup, olabildiğince mantık dışı kurgularla doldukları bir anime benim için. Gereksiz uzunluğu ve animenin yolundan sapması ise tamamen dibe batırmış. Bunu bırak başyapıt olarak görmeyi, iyi bir anime olarak bile görmüyorum. Elbette zevk, renk falan filan...\

    DEATH NOTE. WHOA! What can I say? Simply one of the best animes of all time. \
It's a true masterpiece. As you watch the series, you get to question your own morality; you don't know if you are going to root for L or for Yagumi Light. It's very suspenseful, artistic, bizarre, intelligent and surprising as well. Kudos to the animation team who made this anime possible. It's heart-stopping scenes are all to watch for. You can't get enough of an episode to the next because you are undoubtedly curious on what is going to happen next.\
For Summary of the story, it deals with wanting\
          \
        to create a peaceful (crime free world) and Yagumi Light was given this opportunity by picking up a notebook called Death Note. The notebook has guidelines on how to use it but the bottom line is that whatever name you write, as long as you know how they look like, will die.\
You will never regret watching this anime.\

    Death Note is something that I think every anime fan should at the very least give a chance. It's something that I've personally found to be a bit of a masterpiece in media, let alone anime. \
Death Note has a fairly unique story, that to many is a simple bad of good versus evil, and without spoiling to much for anyone that possibly still hasn't had a chance to experience it- I personally have a different take on the anime's subject matter. I find that Death Note is as far from black and white as you can go, and it's actually a good questioning for\
          \
        the mortality and the differences in what some people find right and wrong. \
Am I digging a little to deep? Perhaps. But that doesn't change the fact that this anime had me raising real world questions. Things like, who truly does have the right to decide who is worthy of life and who deserves death. It's an interesting topic- for another time. You're here for an anime review after all.\
Death Note has a superb soundtrack, every character theme giving a distinctive and very unique feeling, almost hinting to you at what kind of person they are completely from audio feedback alone. Now as for the Art and animation, I think it's sadly the weakest part of the anime. It's not bad by any meaning of the word, but there's nothing extra special about it. They use it very effectively though. Several symbolical effects and scenes are spread all throughout, and many of them are very religious themed. \
The characters are also fantastic, and I can't really say I thought anyone in the anime with actual importance had a bad personality or a terrible character arc. Everyone seemed interesting, and everyone had their own goals, ideas, and motives. It's humorous to me that someone with a letter for a name could leave such a lasting impression. \
Overall, I find this to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable anime I've seen in my entire life. While I personally find it to be a masterpiece, there are several small issues in this anime that keep me from giving it a perfect ten, but I still really recommend this anime to anyone looking for something maybe just a little bit different, and more filled with depth from the usual anime.\

    I just finished watching the series and it amazed me until the very end. I actually don't watch animes with long series of episodes, however, when I tried watching the first episode, the plot caught my attention to look forward on what will happen next - causing me to watch all episodes one after another. It took me several days to recover from the heavy feeling of my heart caused by the ending. Overall, it's brilliant!\
My Thoughts:\
1.) Yagami Light's major mistake that caused him to lead to failures is his countermeasure to his encounter with Raye Penber. The bus incident he prepared was proven unnecessary\
          \
        since Raye Penber no longer have suspicions on him due to his facade of a normal highschool student. Though I wouldn't know what the alternative future might be, he shouldn't have interfered with Raye Penber. It caused him to reveal his ability to control acts and death process of the target, and let them trace him easily by deduction. Until the end, the incident with Raye Penber was used against him.\
2.) Kira's loss to Near, though it's due to the plot, does not necessarily mean that Near or/together with Mello beat him. Both parties have great ideas that could overwhelm each other, however, the difference is that Kira blindly orders his followers while Near fully controls his companions. If they were to hold a battle where they are in equal ground, who knows who'll win.\

    The most popular anime of all time for a reason.\
A masterpiece in terms of story, plot, and character development, side by side with incredible OPs and EDs makes for a perfect, all-rounder (albeit with a few 'ridiculous' moments, but those are to be expected of every anime, as they are, after all, fiction.)\
Light Yagami is the protagonist of our story who happens upon a weapon of mass murder, and uses it to make himself God, creating a 'new world' full of only good people, ironically, leaving the only bad person, to be him.\
Misa Amane is NOT the typical female sidekick. Misa genuinely interests me, even\
          \
        though at times she is dozy and clingy and 'hyaaaaaa!', you know what I mean. Misa is the right-hand accomplice in the plot to create a whole new world with genocide.\
L Lawliet is such an integral part of the show that I can't believe *spoilers* that they killed him off half way through. This is the only downfall of Death Note. L created the whole 'cat-and-mouse' game between L and Light, the most interesting part of the show , and it slightly floundered after L's demise, but shortly brought in new enveloping characters such as Mello. Near, however, wasn't that interesting, and dampened the show. I would have loved to see L and Light facing it off at the end, as they had promised they'd do all along.\
I shan't leave a huge review as there are thousands that do it justice, but I would recommend Death Note to everyone and their mothers, no matter what kind of story you're into, Death Note can appeal to anyone.\

    Death Note is a complete masterpiece. All the way through. Some of the people out there say only episode 1-25 are the good ones. (Insert spoiler here) After that, people begin to lose interest in the show. But, I am one of those people who went all the way through the anime, and never lost interest.\
Why do I think Death Note is so good?\
Death Note has an incredible story to begin with. I'm not going to explain the story, considering you should already know it. The soundtrack in Death Note is amazing! You should listen to it when you have the chance. Or just watch\
          \
        the episodes again and listen to the amazing background music.\
Death Note is incredibly enjoyable if you are interested in supernatural, psychological anime. I, for one, am one of those who are interested in psychological, supernatural anime. I will watch others, but I'm most interested in those ones. I haven't watched much anime, but I began my journey of anime not long ago.\
Death Note's characters are all, uh... I don't know. Light Yagami, for one is the anti-hero of the story. Some call him a crazy sonuvabitch, but I call him the anti-hero. Light is bored out of his mind, so what does he do?\
Kill all them criminals.\
Badass, if you ask me. Now, in anime, the one thing I admire most is the badassery of the characters. Now, before any further information... I don't know if badassery is even a word. Ryuk is one of those characters who are just awesome and you don't really know why. Misa is pretty annoying, but lovable... I think. Or likeable. One of them. L is probably the best character in the entire series, Matsuda, the others, I don't really care about the rest of the task force. But, I have to admit, Aizawa is pretty cool.\
Now, enough chitter-chat, thus ending my review. This is my review, I haven't really wrote a review for an anime yet, but this is my review. Overall, I think I'd probably give this a 10/10 outstanding, wonderful, marvelous anime.\
Now keep calm, grab a death note, and kill some criminals!\

Introduction: Death note is the most popular anime according to this website, which shouldn't really shock anyone, but not only is it really popular it has a high rating.\
If you don't know me I like to start by rating the least significant feature of an anime to the most significant: (Sound>Art>Character>Story + Enjoyment>Overall.\
Sound (7/10): What can I say? The sound/music is really good, however it's nothing out of the ordinary and I believe it's not unbelievably good enough to be highly rated.\
Art (7.5/10): What can I also say? The art is good for a 2006 anime,  it focuses on the settings, the character, however\

        just like the sound, it's not unbelievably good enough to be so highly rated.\
Character (9/10): Even though there aren't too much characters that would interest the general majority of the anime fan base, there are definitely at least 2 that stand out (L the best detective, not your ideal guy when you first see him in a dark room, a person who shows near little emotions and sits on a weird position which gives him his brain power) and Light (a top grade achieving student, who has a strong sense of justice). It could be argued that these two highly intelligent characters share the same level of intelligence, and these are the two titans that go head to head, (well not physically). There are a few other characters are have some importance, such as the 2nd L, but I'm pretty sure no one really liked him and thought of him as somewhat of a replacement, which no one really got a long with.\
Enjoyment/Story (9/10) (9.5/10): At first, when I heard of the death note, I felt like I knew what was going to happen, he kills of criminals, and to him it wasn't enough and eventually turns insane. I was some-what right, however it isn't as cliche as you think. Sure Light turns some-what insane in the end, but you end up rooting for the guy, well I did at least, I wasn't really interested in detective and mind games, but this anime made me somewhat interested in those genres, and gave an entertaining and interesting insight of how really intelligent Light and L are, from Light using minor traps to detect if anyone has been in him room to L slowly figuring out and using percentages to show how sure he is of something. However it wouldn't be a 10/10 without a few set backs. Firstly, I didn't like the fact Light's dad had to die, in my opinion it really messes things up, and makes me question how Light's family is doing, and the extremely disappointing ending.\
Overall: In conclusion I'd give this anime a 9/10, specifically a 9.5/10. The reason why it's away from a 10, is the extremely disappointing ending (SPOILER AHEAD), Light loses in the end to the 2nd L \"Near\", but I guess you can consider him losing to the original L as well as Mello. What really disappoints me is how L loses, L was able to be steps ahead of the original L, but he loses just because his \"right hand man\" made a mistake. It could be argued that my support of L made me bitter about the ending however, I would of been happier if the original L was alive the whole time and defeated Light, not this bad replacement. In addition to prevent this, even an average person could of came up with just ripping paper off the death note to prevent any complicated switches. \
TL:DR 9/10 or 9.5/10 the reason why it's not 10/10 is because of the extremely disappointing ending due to the end result and how the end result was caused.\

    death note is one of the most popular anime in the main stream anime list and generally it is the 1st anime you recommend to your friends to enter into the anime  world. BUT i feel like this anime is bit overrated i mean its good for starters but it will not as good for a regular. \
story(6)\
not much special there in the story still its pretty decent . I feels like there just more fancy things which might entertain you like some thrilling moments and feud between L and Light is really entertaining, but after watching some 15 episode i feel kind of\
          \
        bored coz i cant feel the characters in the story. Character development is really important part of the story and this is where death note is lacking the most. In short i can say that its more like a cat and mouse story rather than a real crime story with supernatural contents in it.\
Art(9)\
death note feature some best quality of direction and backgrounds its really well directed and u can praise the studio. though its not has animation quality on the level of like fate series or  its still one of the best directed anime out there.\
Sound(10)\
THis is where death note shines the most . As i discussed earlier its one of the most well directed anime so find some of the best sound quality in anime . 1st opening is really one of my favorite anime theme.\
character(5)\
Its my personal opinion but if the story is not that decent if it also got many plot holes if anime got good character development and influencial characters i can ignore what story lacking. Here death note really sucks I mean I really feel dissapointed after watching this story. Other than Light Yagami which I feels one of the best villains in anime rest all characters sucks.Ya many people argue are u for gotten about THE GREAT L which is 2nd on MAL popularity . ya i like L but who is L some super genius thats all . there is no character development not at all he just simply chasing after Light and we know nothing about him. Ya many characters are mysterious but they have there weakness inspirations personalty and there backstory which feel really important coz it connects characters and audience you really needs to feel for characters if its protagonist you admire there thinking you idolize them you love them you feel sad if something bad happen to them or in the case of antagonist a feeling of hatred is there( i mean light is really son of a bitch).\
I cant feel anything for L during whole series He is just there as Light play material which i feels really dissapointing . there are many support characters who can be great but light carried the whole anime and I watch whole anime just because light is there.\
enjoyment(7)\
ya i enjoy this show at least 1st 15 episodes . so its pretty dencent show and you can view this as a Binge watch.\
overall(7.6)\
As i say again its bit overrated and incomplete but its good for starters and kids because its plain and simple with amazing direction and animation. But if you are an anime junkie I dont recommend you this show.",

    Story:\
It is very welldone, the pacing is nice, since it is almost the same as the manga (in actuality, a light novel) that has perfect pacing. It is very suspenseful and clever, with excellent use of cliffhangers. Is is a battle of wits between Light and L (and some others latter on), that really differs from your usual shounen. It is nice to say, too, that Light is totally and completely the villain, and an excellent, sadistic, maniacal, bad person villain. And yet he's the main character, our point of view in the anime, which is nice for a change.\
Soundtrack:\
Oh my God, it is awesome!\
          \
        Since the opening, till the ending, and it really heps set the mood and heighten the tensions and suspenseful atmosphere with excellence. I just don't like the second opening and endings. The dub is also really nice.\
Characters:\
They are not very deep, and yet they have much flavor in them. The only character I particularly have a problem with is Misa Amane, she really does bring down the cast of the anime, she doesn't fit in.\
Art:\
Awesome. Takeshi Obata's art is very rich and sofisticated and translates well to the screen. It has many nice little touches here and there, with clever use of visual metaphors and little-to-none fanservice. It is also very cinematographic and intense.\
In general, all of the aspects blend really well for a nice complete product.\

    This anime took me a while to really get around to and I do regret not watching it earlier.....somewhat. This anime started off very slow for me to a certain degree due to the fact that I did not understand how the story would expand on the context of the deathnote. However, once i got through a few episodes I simply could not let go of it. It got really emotional at points where i had not anticipated, and the overall feelings i had towards the characters were raw and very real. \
I found myself pulled into the story itself which made me feel like\
          \
        i was in the world where my name could be added to that worrisome Deathnote. I sometimes find my mind wondering when watching television and start doodling about with stuff around me, but this show basically took hold of my brain and forced me to watch it seriously and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, though sometimes my emotions and energy were taxed heavily, it felt like running a marathon and winning it. You tire from the running and need to pace yourself but once you cross that finish line you feel quite satisfied with yourself.\
In terms of characters I found that I got really attached to them, especially Light and L, be it in a good or bad way, and they evoked very genuine feelings in me,especially some of the more human explorations by them which did not necessarily relate to the action of the show, quite surprising and funny at times. The secondary characters all have such big personalities and their interaction really gives this show some of its most epic and compelling moments. \
The visuals are very dark and dreary which is quite perfect for the premise and action of the show, which also makes for very complementary and juxtaposed situations involving the characters whose actions are highlighted by it.\
Overall, I loved Deathnote as it provided such an immersing experience and such great characters and story. However, I would advise watching it in a paced manner, when it gets too much for you just stop for a bit and watch teletubbies or something, and then get back on the horse, its really worth finishing that race!!!!\

    Imho Death note is a Masterpiece. Very thought provoking.\
Story/Plot: Most of you have probably read the synopsis so thats  already taken care of. Death Note is a very thought provoking anime and the story just keeps you intrigued through the whole series. The thing i love about it, is how it views on both the protagonist and antagonist's perspective and way of thinking. Another thing is that you really have your own opinion on who is the protagonist or antagonist depending what moral you support. It just keeps you on the tip of your chair wanting to know who is right or who is\
          \
        wrong if there even is a right and wrong.\
Character: Funny thing is the characters remind me alot of Tom and Jerry how they two always bash and go at each other sometimes the cat driving the mouse into a corner and sometimes the mouse driving to cat into a corner. Its very interesting on how the two characters think so alike and have the same intentions of justice yet have different methods sometimes written either bad guy or good guy on their face. You're always going to cheer for the one who you believe is right and since Light and L are both equally intelligent & think alike it just flares up your curiosity on who's perspective is justice.\
Soundtrack: I think the sound track is just amazing how it blends in with the story so well and creates such a Death note like mood and atmosphere somethings sounding like gibberish opera LOL . I loved it and thought it was literally one of the main reasons why i loved Death Note.\
Art: The art for me is very good though its not something amazing but at least they don't have the ridiculously huge eyes that scares the jeepers out of you or the tremendously long exaggerated legs. Another thing is people don't walk around in hot pink hair and people viewing it as normal though sometimes you just gotta love purple. The author did an outstanding job on drawing the characters of how Light and L can loo kand act so different yet are so alike. The characters are drawn sort of darkish if you know what i mean just not like happy go-getto and i thought that it really matched with the theme.\
Overall: Death Note was very enjoyable for me up until the second arc that is but that's out of the question. I don't think there's another anime out there that just blends so well together like Death Note does and although some part just repeats the strategies used its very amusing watching Light and L try to win over the other without even knowing each other in the first place. You should definitely at least give it a try I promise you won't regret it and if you do then I don't know you LOL thanks for sitting through this awfully long and at parts boring review!\

    Death Note is one bloody epic anime, leaving you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. These are the animes, that want to keep me watching into the early hours of the morning. A dark anime, that blends really well.\
Story - The basic storyline starts of like this. Light Yagami is a 17 year old boy but he is extremely intelligent for his age, so intelligent in fact that he has helped NPA (National Police Agency) solve multiple cases. Anyway, he does find his life boring but one day, he stumbled upon a diary (or book whatever you wanna call\
          \
        it) called the Death Note. At first he thinks the Death Note is just a joke after reading the rules. But all that changes, after he sees the Shinigami (Death God) named Ryuk appear before him.\
Art - The art presentation is superb, while it may be a dark anime, it does have colour, but not these bright and vibrant colours. \
Sound - The sound is great, everything works with the particular scene, there are no out of place tunes. The sounds consists mainly of the keyboard, guitar and high orchestral latin, gothic music for the intense, edge of your seat moments.\
Character - Okay, now I might carry on in this section. Like I said before, Light Yagami is very intelligent, and he wants to rid the world of evil by using the Death Note to his advantage. On the other hand, there is L. This is an interesting concept, Without spoiling anything, Light Yagami can be seen to people as the anti-hero of the series, but L believes what Light is doing is wrong. Yeah I will stop myself there, before I go on and on ranting and adding spoilers :P\
Enjoyment - I throughly enjoyed this anime from start to finish, every little twist and turn added in, the unexpected thing happen every now and then, just makes this show that much more epic. \
Overall - From episode 1 to episode 37 was one helluva thrill ride. So many suspensful things pop out at you and really does a great job at making you feel closer to Light and L. You get to see things from there perspective and they are characters, you end up caring about and get a better connection between the two. \
The only real grievance I had with the show is the ending....which is debatable even to this day. I won't say why, watch it for yourself :)\
Perfect 10 from me :D \

    This is my first review so I apologise for the quality of it :3\
Death Note is, without a doubt, one of the best anime ever created.  It tells a unique and enjoyable story, to the likes of which I have not seen with any other anime of the same genre. I feel I can confidently say that it is one of the best anime out there, if not, then without a doubt one of the best I have ever seen.\
Story:\
 The concept of the story is rather simple, a notebook falls from the sky with the power to kill whosever name is written in\
          \
        it (there are some rules but the anime tells you about those).  Yagami Light, who gets this unearthly power to kill, hopes to use the notebook to rid the world of evil and create a Utopia on earth with himself being God.  In this Utopia there would be no evil, only good, but can we say that this is right? Should people who have wronged be allowed to live? Or can they be reformed? Death Note gets the viewers to think about questions just like this, which, in turn, makes us challenge our morals. \
However the main focus of the anime isn’t to judge our own morals. The way that the story is told and the pure genius of the plot always keep you on the edge of your seat, the strong game of cat and mouse that Light Yagami must play with the greatest detective in the world, L. Due to both of them being geniuses, it isn’t an easy task for one another to persecute each other, and due to their characters you will want to cheer for one or the other.\
The brilliance of the story declines once we reach the second arc of the anime, which although also in the manga, seemed like a way of dragging the story out more than it might have needed, but I can’t complain too much as it was nice to get away from the stalemate between Light and L.\
Characters:\
Light and L are by far the most interesting in the anime, they are both geniuses and have certain characteristics that make you like one more than the other. Light is very charismatic he is able to execute his plans with much confidence and determination without over reacting too much if something were to go wrong. L on the other hand is… strange and despite looking rather unintelligent, he is quite the opposite.\
Art/Animation:\
Well, what can I say? Madhouse people, Madhouse. But in all seriousness the art is brilliant; it’s gives off dark vibes which really go with the concept of the story.  The animation is also very well done, despite there not being all that much to animate, I would imagine the most animated scene was a car chase, this isn’t a bad thing, just the anime does consist off plans on trying to outsmart each other so there isn’t much to animate. By far my favourite scene was… THE POTATO CHIP SCENE. That was perfect.\
Sound:\
The sound was amazingly done as well, having opera which fitted perfectly with Light’s ambition to become the new God of Utopia. With L having music which I can only describe and being \"policey\" I don’t know it just sounded like something you’d hear on a police show or something. I can defiantly say that without the music I don’t think that I would have given this a 10/10 I’d possibly give it an 8 or 9.\
Overall:\
Overall this is one of the first anime I ever watched, outside of Naruto, and it was one of the anime that really got me to watch more anime. I loved the story, always keeping you thinking and on your toes, the characters were brilliant, personally I preferred L, I think that Light’s character changed in a way that I didn’t like as much by the end. However I highly recommend this anime to anyone of pretty much any age, although it can get quite confusing in places. You also don’t have to worry about it only being in Japanese this anime has been dubbed in pretty much every language… So go watch it!\
I give this anime 10/10 ",

    This anime though. Honestly, I truly enjoy it. This may seem weird but I love both the protagonist and the antagonist. Yagami Light is a very erudite student that was bored with his life, waking up to the same old thing. He picked up a book that fell from the sky called the Death Note and was amused by it. He didn't actually think that the book might work but what the heck, he started writing a criminal's name and the criminal was killed. He was taken aback by the result and experimented with other criminals. As good as he is, he eventually became obsessed\
          \
        with the book and was getting pleasure by killing other people, thinking he was doing justice to the world by eliminating bad guys. L, on the other hand, is also a very interesting character. He might be just as smart as Light. Looking at his appearance, you wouldn't believe that he is the legendary L. Both of them befriended but at the same time, they are rivals. An anime wouldn't be perfect without a main female character and in this anime, that girl is Misa. I wish I could tell you more but I might as well accidentally give you spoilers. One thing I could guarantee is that every episode will leave you wanting more and more. To say that this anime is overrated would be a crime because Death Note deserves every single recognition it's getting. \

    Death Note is on of my personal favorite. The first time when I heard Death Note I was with a friend, but she didn't explained the story very well to me so I was confused. But then I gave it a shot and I loved it. When I got the real idea of Death Note I was minded blowed. I love this anime so much.\
~STORY~\
The story was well planned and very unique. I liked everything. The only problem I had was the parts when a few people started talking about political stuff which bored me. But I know it was part of the story so\
          \
        it was okay. Overall I loved the story plot. 10/10\
~ART/ANIMATION~\
Death Note has one of the best art/animation I had ever seen. I give a lot of credit to the animators, they did an amazing job. Everything was beautifully animated. 10/10\
~SOUND~\
I loved the Death Note OST. Especially the second opening, the song is one of my personal favorites. The music gives a lot of feeling to every scene. From an average day to a very dramatic insane moment. The dub was well done also the sub. So you don't have to worry if the dub is horrible because it's not. 10/10\
~CHARACTER~\
Evert character was pretty good for their role. The only problem I had was that some characters were forgetful. But the bottom line is I liked every character, even Misa. Yes I think Misa is a great character and she is adorable. With Light I think he is insane, which is a good thing. And L is the best characters out of all of them in my opinion, I kind of developed a small crush on him. 10/10  \
~ENJOYMENT~\
I enjoyed Death Note a lot that I would re-watch it again and again. I would definitely recommend it to people. I loved everything of Death Note, except one part which I'm not telling because I would be spoiling a part of the show. Over all you should go and watch Death Note.\

    Oh Death Note. How much i love thee. Death Note has to be one of the Greatest works of fiction ever created. The story is pulse pounding with it's main characters progression from an incredibly smart teenager, who turns into a cold hearted psychopath. This show has some of the most absolutely intense scenes i've ever seen, and most of them are just with two characters talking! How?! Well it's because of the ingenious writing put into this spectacular crime drama. The greatest part of this show is the rivalry between main character Light Yagami and the worlds greatest detective, L Lawliet. These two, own\
          \
        every scene they are in (Even though they are there practically every scene,  still.) Every time one is two steps ahead of the other, the other gets four steps ahead. It's incredible how a show can make writing in a notebook and eating a potato chip looks so damn awesome. Interesting themes are also brought up in the story as well. Is it right to kill just in the name of justice? How far does one go to achieve success? The music deserves some special praise as well. From it's laid back guitar riffs to it's mind-blowing orchestral pieces, the music could have you listening to the soundtrack on YouTube for hours. The second part of Death Note, though not as engrossing as the first part, is still suspenseful and in my opinion, done well given the fact that an important character dies that was essential to the plot. With all of that said, Death Note is intense. It's characters are awesome, the story and plot are great, and the presentation is fantastic. It hooks you in with every scene even if most are of dialogue. It's remarkably different than other Shonen series. (Yes this is a Shonen, i know it's crazy)\

    Death Note.\
Death note, one of the most popular anime ever. There are an incredible amount of people saying it is a masterpiece and declare it as the best anime ever, others say it's proper shit and a waste of time. So today I'll be talking about some arguments from both points of view. This review is not spoiler free but I will tell you before I get into major spoilers if you don't want to hear them if you have not already been spoilt to it already. This is the Youtube video version of my review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx7kIMEew30 \
Beginning.\
The great thing about Death Note is that\
          \
        you don't have to wait 5 episodes before it get's interesting and all of your questions from the beginning regarding how the death note ended up in Light Yagami's, our main character, hands and why are answered immediately. A shinigami got bored and dropped his notebook into the human world to get some amusement out of it. The names that are written into it will be killed when you picture their face whilst writing it. Shinigami are in some ways just tools for the plot that is proven by the fact that the writers of the manga originally designed the shinigami to be a goodlooking guys with wings but changes that to not distract the viewers and readers from who the real main characters are. At the beginning of the series when Light picks up the Death Note he pretty much doesn't know much more than we do at this point so for us this is very convenient because we're finding out what this death note really is by him finding out and asking the shinigami the questions we as an audience are also having. Sometimes I think it's better to let the story do the telling instead of having this Q and A between characters but in this story it works out in it's favour because they're presenting us with this game. The facts are given to us, you know the rules now let's play.\
The story.\
Even though Light turns into this self proclaimed god of justice and turns into a power lusting maniac he doesn't start out this way. Once he gets how the notebook works he starts killing off all the big criminals shown on tv. At the beginning he shows remorse in some ways or at least he's not entirely sure if what he's doing is really okay. He still had some standards and morals that made him unable to eat or sleep and made him have nightmares. But he quickly gets a change of heart when he starts looking at the world and his actions from a different angle self justifying what he has been doing and will continue to do. He genuinely wants to make the world a better place. But you can ask yourself can the world really become a better place when it's coming from one person's perspective? I found it interesting that Ryuuk tells Light: Once all the criminals are killed off in the world the only bad person left will be you. When Light gets a taste of praise and finds out people are worshipping him as a God and savior he gets even more into it. \
People call him Kira which comes from the word Killer only Japanesed up. In the meanwhile the police are wondering why all these criminals are suddenly dying. They have no idea why this is happening or even how or whom. This is when they decide to rely on the best investigator ever, L, who solved countless seemingly impossible to solve crimes. It's then announced that L had already noticed all of this and was already looking into this himself. L is never seen by anyone and no one knows his full name. He only works on investigations he's interested in. We already knew the rules of the games but now we know the players too and it's time to get started. L has a hunch that Kira is from Japan so comes up with the idea to broadcast on Japanese tv only in different regions at different times while making it seem it's a global broadcasting. So that he knows when the person speaking in front of the camera is killed where Kira is from. Light falls for this and kills the spokesperson who is pretending to be L's real identity. At this point Light seems to be an amateur but he wasn't careful enough because he didn't have to be yet but L added fuel to his tank by saying that he will find him and kill him. Light's father is working on his case which is both beneficial to him as dangerous as he gets certain classified information about how far they are with the investigation and how close they're getting to him but this also makes him more suspicious by using this information. Light however, is ready to kill his family if he has to. L and Light play with each others minds as they keep provoking each other as to say just come out and play just one misstep and I'll have you. They tend to not only think one step ahead but think a whole march ahead. Instead of bending the plot to the convenience of the story we always get to see beforehand what the set in stone rules are of this Death Note. Like this one example when Light tries out different ways of killing people with it we find out what exactly is possible and where the Death Note is limited. When Light gets pushed into a corner he starts killing off innocent people as well when absolutely necessary and we see his personality slide down to a darker and darker state. We're never really sure if L or Light will win because it's not clear who's in the right or wrong because Light might be a maniac for killing so many people without as much as blinking an eye, fact is crimes are getting fewer. \
This anime and manga chooses to pay more attention to suspense than flashy action sequences. This is a bold move by the mangaka's who wrote this since it was published in Shonen Jump that has an audience that mostly consists out of younger boys around the age of 15, at least that's what it's aimed at. This story is a lot more mature than most stories in it and may seem boring for people who just read it to see action sequences without having to use their brains. Light is a smooth operator manipulating people whether they are close to him or complete strangers he always gets out of the bad situations and suspicions because he always tries to solve his problems by looking at it from every possible angle while L is very blunt but still a genius who thinks everything through deeply. L starts suspecting Light to be Kira after he comes to the conclusion that Kira probably has some close ties to the team working on the Kira case and he starts to keep track of the movements of two of the families of the people working on the case. Light figures out they're watching his every move and tricks them into thinking that he's a perfectly good student while still killing new criminals. L finds the suspicion in him being a little too perfect. So then L decides to reveal his face to Light and ask him to help work on the Kira case. Light agrees to it to an extent since he has no other choice if he doesn't want to be found suspicious and it holds some benefit for him as well as he gets more inside information and could get to mislead them. L of course benefits from this because if Light is Kira he's bound to mess up somewhere along the line, no matter how small he's sure to notice it. And on the other hand if he isn't Kira he's brilliant enough to help them getting closer to the real Kira and help with the progress of the investigation. \
More Kira's.\
Another Kira shows up. This one is a lot more amateurish though. Second Kira finds a way to contact the real Kira and shows up at his house one day. Her name is Misa and it turns out Light had killed the murderer of her parents no one cared to take care of. She's so thankful she would literally do anything for him even die. She asks him if she can be his girlfriend. Misa made a deal with her shinigami. She gave away half of the span of her whole lifetime to get shinigami's eyes. This means she can kill people by just seeing their face instead of having to find out their names because she can already see them. Light finds an opportunity in this and he agrees to play the role as her boyfriend only to use her as a tool to realize his own twisted dreams. He also plans to kill her once he doesn't need her anymore so she doesn't get in the way. Light thinking to himself he can't develop any feelings for her tells us Light is not completely frigid. Killing her might prove to be more difficult than initially thought because Rem, Misa's shinigami claims she'll kill him if he kills Misa. Misa is personally my favourite character of the whole series. I see why some people hate her guts because she's obnoxious and tends to get in the way a lot but she has a moodlifting personality and she gives it a lot more colour. She's very pretty but also a lot smarter than she looks. She may not be a genius on the level of Light and L but she's certainly not stupid by any means. She may have developed an obsession with Kira in the time she wasn't able to put a face to him yet but once she's met him in real life and find out he's young too she really seems to love him. When Light tells her they're trying to make the world a better place she even tells Light he is more important to her than the world. Her love for him is out of the ordinary but beautifully loyal. Right when Misa has finally found out L's true name and it would've been easy to kill him she gets captured because of some evidence she left by some slip ups she made, making it clear she's the second Kira. She then gives up on the ownership of her death note and loses her memory of all that comes with it. So even if they keep questioning her she can't possibly give them an answer because she simply doesn't know any of it anymore. Light then reports himself and says he may be Kira on some subconscious level and wants to rule that possibility out by being in a cell with strict surveillance for a while. While he's in confinement he makes Ryuk dispose of the death note and then he also doesn't remember a thing. This makes him have a clear conscious as well. Meanwhile Rem gives the death note to a third person to make sure people will still be dying in the meantime. Light and Misa get released after a long while but still aren't completely in the clear. They however still have no memory of the death note whatsoever. By this we get to see the contradiction of Light after receiving the death note and after. When L asks Light to get close to Misa to gain more information Light refuses because he doesn't want to play with her emotions like that. Then follows a part in the story where the death note stays in the hands of the other person who's actually a business man and uses the death note for his own profits. He's also bribing the government so that the government demands the police department to stop investigating the Kira case. Light is working on the Kira case together with L genuinely wanting to solve it and the team keeps helping too even though they were told to stop and are no longer getting paid. Aizawa is the only one who steps out because he can't afford to quit his job because he puts his family first. So then we're left with only Mogi, who hasn't really been in the spotlight very much, Matsuda, who is basically the clumsy and dumbsest one of them all, Light Yagami, the evil genius himself, his father, the goodhearted trustful leader and L the brilliant detective working on this case together with the occasional interruption by Misa. Two con artist come and help too. To me this was just irritating like it were fillers and I was just waiting for the death note to return to Light's hands. It was like they wanted to show us that when you give a man power they become a monster but to drag it out like this really isn't necessary. In the beginning Rem states that humans are ugly beings. I think that statement was enough to make that point. People will do a lot to have people look up to them and get influential and rich. Eveything that is going on is all in Light's brilliant plan and they go through a lot of trouble to have the notebook landed in Light's hands again. I do appreciate the effort and thoughtfulness and tight writing that went into this idea even if it's hard to be considered believable to me they could've come up with a way more simple solution like have Rem give the death note to someone who was going to die soon anyways and then have him return it to Misa and have Light dig up the other note. Instead he had to go through a lot of extra trouble because when they capture fake Kira a lot of others touched the notebook resulting in them being able to see Rem. I will now get into majoy spoilers so feel free to leave or skip to the \"ost\" part. Now  Rem has to be killed. The only way to kill a shinigami is have them fall in love. If a shinigami ends someone's life to extent the life of the one they love they die giving the remaining time of their life to the one they love. Light sets everything up in a way it's likely Misa will get captured if L stays alive. Because Rem can see L's name it's easy for her to kill him. And then Rem does kill L. Which is kind of heartbreaking since Light causes L's death and even though they're each others enemies Light was L's first friend ever. \
L's death.\
The thing about L's death is that it was right on time. It was still in a point of the series where you're still curious for what's going to happen next in this battle between L and Light. Even if the whole arc of Light not remembering the Death Note was somewhat boring it did serve a purpose and it felt all the more satisying to have him regain the death note. If L's death would've happened any later in the show it would have felt like it had dragged on for a little or like they milked it. When a show gets boring and one of the main characters dies it tends to feel unnatural and unrealistic. I know this is an anime about people killing other with a notebook and that's not realistic either but you can either take the aspects of a fantasy fiction and make it dull by making it too unrealistic so that it's not even relatable for anyone anymore at one point because you can bend the show any way you want it to and label it under plot armor but is basically plot convenience or you make a show with fantasy aspects but you convey them in a way that you almost start believing it could've been a real thing, so much that you start rooting for certain characters as if you crawl into their minds and connect the dots they haven't made yet for them. Getting back on the subject of L dying if he would've died in a later stage of the show when it starts getting less interesting, like, even if the writers didn't run out of ideas there's only so much you can do to a plot to make the people who already like it keep liking it without it getting either repetitive or too different than the start. If L would've died later on it would feel like the writers were like: Oh this is getting boring there's no need for this character anymore let's just kill him off. Luckily they didn't go for this option. The downside of L dying is all the fangirls shipping L and Light are dying as well on the inside. No seriously I don't care about them I mean you have an anime full of ideas and reflection of society and the fine line, the tiny barrier between what is right and wrong and all you can think of is what a great yaoi fanfiction could be born out of this? I would be lying if I said I wasn't kind of sad about L dying. Light is an arrogant prick but I found him interesting because of his ideas and his outlook on the world if a little twisted. It made me wonder what made him to turn into this person and if he just was this way because if a man gets the power to control the world by killing off bad people or people that are bad in his eyes or the media he turns into a monster. Or are there deeper lying emotions in him a deeper sense of justice or maybe a twisted judgement that has grown into his heart. So if I were to choose sides between L and Light I would've picked Light's side because to me this was the most interesting one to follow but in terms of overall personality my personal preference was with L because I really liked his personality as a whole. The fact he likes cake and other sweets and playing with his food and sits in his chair in an oversized shirt thinking. The manga of Death note was actually written by a team. According to the creator of the art of this manga the writer is always sitting in his chair the way L does for a long time while thinking deeply and making up stories. I don't know if this directly means the character is loosely based on this mangaka but thinking so makes him an even more interesting character since no one knows what this mangaka looks like since he keeps his face, real name and even his gender although assumed male private. Even if it wasn't based off of a real person, these characters feel real. L may be a genius in an unrealistic way his humanly traits make him a real person instead of an overpowered machine, like Kirito. So when L died it was really saddening and felt like an actual loss. \
Life after L\
When L dies it's so easy for Light to manipulate the remaining members of the investigation team because they're so eager to trust in him. It's almost too easy. Light kills the two con artists with the death note. Light takes L's place and Aizawa joins heir team once again and Ide who's been working with Aizawa on the Kira case on their own when Aizawa initially left joins the team too. Light then continues to rinse the world of evil and many people start to actually stand of Kira because they think the world is in fact becoming a better place. Crimes are lessened and people start being friendlier towards each other as a result of the fear of getting the punishment of death. Then L's successors come into play. Near and Mellow are both chosen to be L's successor. Normally L would've been the one to choose one out of the two but since L isn't alive anymore they are both chosen and they are told to work together. Mellow doesn't agree to this because ever since he's known Near and him had always been competing and had always been on the losing end. So Near gets a team of investigators to help him and they start looking for Kira. Mellow on the other hand goes into more illegal grounds and also tries to find Kira using somewhat unorthodox methods in order to beat Near to it. So now it's a game of three. Kira, Near and Mellow. I must say this is way less exciting because L was presented to us as an incredible mastermind and got so close to revealing Light as Kira so whoever would've taken his place would be a downright weaker version of him. There are some things in the second half that I do find interesting though even if the show as a whole kind of disappointed me by the second half. Like at the beginning of this new arc Mello kidnaps Chief Yagami's daughter. He'll give her back to him if he gives him the death note. He now has to decide to either save his daughter and give the notebook to an unknown person which could possibly resolve in thousands of innocent people dying or let his daughter die with in mind that the person who wants the death note only needs it for research. So he has this inner battle of what he should do if he should act like a man, a police officer or as a father. There comes a point in this anime where even Light's father owns a death note and tries to kill Mello. At least that was the plan. He has the shinigami eyes an gets the chance to kill Mello but instead of listening to Light he then asks Mello to drop the bullshit in exchange for not writing his name in the death note. His sense of justice and the desire not to kill anyone gets the best of him as he gets shot in the back and Mello stays alive. Light was willing to sacrifice his father but the fact he didn't write Mello's name in the death note is what really angers him. He doesn't even pay mind to what his father says to him at his death bed. He doesn't even care his father is happy because he thinks Light is not Kira. No remorse whatsoever. I must say this part got me pretty emotional. Another thing I found interesting was when Matsuda starts doubting if Kira really is all evil. If Kira is fighting evil he can't be that bad right? When on the other hand people he cared about died to solve this case so he has to be against Kira. Other than that the plot becomes a little shaky and very chaotic and overall just not as interesting.\
The ending.\
The more we get to the ending of this series the more people actually support Kira and start worshipping his as a god. At the same time some of the people who are close to him start suspecting Light to be Kira and together with Near and Mello they slowly start closing him in. Light passes Misa's death note onto Teru someone he has especially chosen. We get to see Teru's reason for worshipping Kira and we understand his motives for wanting to support him and carry on the work of Kira. He had always been one to fight for justice ever since he was little but every time he did he got many people against him, beating him up and justice was never gained. Up until Kira came into the picture. Unlike the first time there was a fake Kira this is makes for an interesting development since this person also has the Kira ideals so the plot could go anywhere instead of it being doomed to fail from the start. He's also very OCD which makes him very systematic but that also leads to his downfall because the patterns in how he lives his life become predictable which makes it easier to find a hole to catch him. Because Teru is always carrying his notebook and bringing it it would've been to obviously stupid and was merely bait. When Teru wrote down his names he contacted someone else to do the actual killing. Near figured as much and figured there had to be a real notebook too. So then he takes that notebook and changes the notebok pages with normal pages. Then Near tells Light he wants to meet him face to face in real life. Light agrees and tells Teru to secretly come as well and write the names of the whole SPK team as well as Near and the investigation team he has been working with all that time in the real notebook he never used before. With that he would've killed everyone who knew about the notebook that were opposed Kira and he would've been able to keep on being Kira without having them all on his heels. Light assumes Near replaced the pages of the fake notebook while Teru brought the real notebook. So when Near tells them to not pay mind to Teru writing their names because they won't die Light thinks Near stepped into his trap. When the 40 seconds are almost over Light declares that he has won with an evil smirk but then no one dies and they capture Teru. It is then shown that Light is the only one who wasn't written down by Teru and Teru refers to him as God so all of them know that Light is in fact Kira. Then the desperation begins. I think it's not very cool how Light is found out by Near who's a far lesser version than L but it's forgiveable sine Teru is the one who messed up by not noticing the difference in the notebook. Light would've noticed it for sure. Other than that I absolutely love the ending more than anything in this series. We get to see someone who's always keeping his cool and is as cold as ice when it comes to killing hundreds and thousands of people screaming in desperation. We see him begging for help. He tries to convince the others the world is better with Kira in it. People are rotten and the only way a new clean world can be achieved is by Kira taking care of all criminals. And the criminality has reduced 70% since Kira started killing. But on the other hand Light has become nothing more than a self righteous cold blooded murderer who is feared by people. People would always have to live in fear of Kira. And one person would never be able to change the world by himself. History of human reigning has already shown us just that. When Light takes the little piece of notebook he has inside of his watch at all times out to write Near's name in it it is Matsuda who stop him by shooting him multiple times. Seeing Matsuda do this is something that seems right out of character especially since Matsuda had never really been sure if he was 100% against Kira. But the fact that Light let his own father die in cause of finding Kira when Light himself was Kira was all Matsuda needs to see the bad in Light. Even Teru turns his back on him saying he's not god but just scum. Everyone turns his back on him, even Ryuk. Ryuk writes Light's name in his death note because Light has lost the game and it's time for him to die. Light screams out that he doesn't want to die as he dies. In the manga we see Misa together with a lot of people walking up a mountain like pilgrims lighting candles and praying to Kira their savior. In the anime we don't really get to see what happens next to Misa and it is open for interpretation but it seems like she's about to commit suicide. The music used in the last scene those last minutes give you that lonely feeling as if you're the one losing. \
Plot holes.\
Okay so I'm gonna go into some spoilers but before I do that I must say that the script is pretty tightly written so even if there are a few things that don't make sense that is inevitable. Although it sometimes seems too unrealistic too be believable Ohba's ability to remember everything he's written down so far and tying all those knots together is very admirable. Now let's get to the plot holes supposedly plot holes. In the beginning when Light gets his notebook he can see Ryuk. When he comes into contact with Misa he can only see Rem by touching Misa's notebook because a shinigami can only be seen when the notebook owned by the shinigami in question is touched. Later we find out Ryuk didn't give Light one of his own death notes but it belonged to another shinigami named Sidoh. So how can Light see Ryuk? Maybe Ryuk touched Light with his own Death Note but that still doesn't explain how Misa would see him after touching Light's Death Note. Something you could also ask yourself is why does Light when he doesn't own the Death Note ask someone with the shinigami eyes his life span so he'd know when he'd be killed and worm himself out of it. But a shinigami's eyes can only see the original life span not the one effected by the notebook and since Light is using the notebook on pretty much a daily basis it'd be no use to know. I know that's not a lot but it was all I could think of.\
Ost.\
The first opening is okay. It's nothing too flashy but the visuals really give a true impression of what the show is like and the song had the ability to be stuck in my head for a good while which might be considered both a good or a bad thing. The first ending is okay too nothing too impressive, nothing earbleedingly bad. The second opening of this anime though… I don't have any words for it to be honest. It was like it was trying to be a metal but it didn't sound like actual metal but more like Japan is in serious need of anger management. Like seriously what's is it you have against white people? I much preferred them to stay with the first opening with different visuals but others think it's a good way to cue the audience that shit's about to hit the fan. The second ending is less bad but it still feels like it's trying way too much. The ost used in the anime itself is incredibly good though. The dramatic vocal choirs and classical music attached to it give the scenes a lot more emotional depth and sometimes help keep you on the edge of your seat.\
\
Art.\
The manga and anime mostly rely on conversations and monologues so we'll see a lot of talking. In the manga the artstyle that goes with this story fits perfectly. Even though there's a lot of dialogue it's never the case that the drawings aren't of any importance this is also proven in volume 11 chapter 97. There's about 8 pages without any dialogue or monologue going on at all it's just telling the story by showing us. The dialogues are always interesting and sometimes it feels like reading a novel instead of a manga but it would never had the same impact without Obata's drawings. He's amazing at drawing and the different angles he uses all the time even in dialogues is impressive and makes it more interesting. He doesn't show off how amazing he is by drawing unnecessary details that would distract us from the story but it's not overly simple either. It's a pleasure for the eyes to say the least. The anime adaptation was done by studio madhouse who have produced some awesome anime over the years. Lots and lots of them. The dark themes in this anime go well with the dark colours used in this anime. The scenes are done overly dramatic but it's not a bad thing. Despite all the talking in the anime the art never gets boring making everything look mysterious or epic. Up to the point that even eating chips seems like the darkest thing you could do. Even though I personally prefer the art in the manga madhouse never changed too much. I thought Misa was a little cuter in the manga but my judgement could just be clouded since I couldn't really stand her squeeky voice in the anime.\
Dub.\
The dubbed version is okay. For me to say that is kind of a big deals since I always think art is supposed to be enjoyed in the language it was created in. If a book is written in german I'll read it in german, if a book is written in dutch I'll read it in dutch, if a book is written in french I try my best to read it in french and if a book is english I read it in english. That's how I learnt to speak english in the first place. So I like my anime in japanese. But in all honesty I think that L's voice was better in english. Light's voice however was just aggravating for me to see in english. The Japanese version is done by Miyano Mamoru and he's brilliant at it especially if he goes nuts and laughs. No one in the world could do it like he does. The way he changes his voice on different occasions is brilliant.\
Bakuman?\
There was a murder case with a copycat murder of murders in death note and in belgium was one of them. The killers wrote \"Watashi wa Kira des\" on a piece of paper. The desu was written wrong which is really stupid. And that also gives us a hint that these murders weren't committed out of passion for the manga or anime itself. Later on they confess it was something that happened after they had words with someone and after they failed to dissolve the body or couldn't hide it they went with this cheap solution. They hoped t would distract them to find out how and why the person was killed so they probably didn't have a very high IQ. It reminded me of what happened to the characters of bakuman. Bakuman is a manga written by the same artists that wrote and drew Death Note. It gives you a look into the world of making manga. We can assume that some of the aspects in the manga also happened to these mangaka's themselves. So let's assume they also used this particular incident in their Bakuman manga. In the manga Bakuman the main characters come up with a detective story called PCP and this gets a series. At one point people start copying the crimes in the manga and it shocks the main characters and depresses them a little because they're bringing something bad into this world instead of just being entertaining. They then make a good solution by using the next chapters to write about a copycat criminal but then inform it could only be a fake because the real ones would never do something that is an actual crime an always keep it innocent. In Death Note when a second Kira appears they start killing innocent people too and the manga reassures us that it has to be a fake because the real Kira wouldn't do that unless he really had to. The authors probably felt bad about the copycat murder but they didn't actually influence the murderer to do this crime so it's all good. In some places of China Death Note was banned because students started altering their notebooks to look like Death Notes and they would write teacher's or other student's names in the book because they wish they'd die. But that could hardly be considered a real crime even if a little harsh.\
Conclusion.\
All in all Death Note is not a bad show. It might not be to your liking, you may find it boring but it isn't bad. I wanted to put all the bad and good things next to each other more clearly but I didn't have enough bad things to talk about other than my own preferences. Death note was not my favorite anime ever. And yes there is a lot hype around it but for once the hype isn't around something mindless like Naruto so I'm okay with the hype. If Death Note is the only anime some people know it's a lot more acceptable to me than having them just watch Attack on Titan and think they know everything about anime. I dislike it when simpleminded anime get way too much hype for their own good. Ohba and Obata are people who really deserve this hype though. They've worked hard on making a tight plot that is easy to understand for everyone but still make it complex and bring out themes to think about. I actually went in making this a negative review because the last time I watched it I remember not really liking it for it's second half and thinking that it's a great concept with poor execution but upon rewatching it, reading it and reviewing it I have come to the conclusion Death Note is good!",

    Death Note is the perfect gateway anime for anyone who isn't even interested in anime and my personal opinion of the show is that it is the best anime ever. Now i know that the second half wasn't as god as the first but even so I enjoyed the whole trip but one fault with the show was its ending and that's where most people would have argued that the show lacked or to say more clearly episode 25. Now lets get onto the good stuff, the characters in death note are astounding *wink wink* L.....\

Deathnote is a dime of a show that looks good, reels you in, flirts, has good manners, blah blah blah, until halfway through the date. Then, as you're driving back to your house, it starts dropping in quality. It stops listening to your boring life, its boobs start deflating, it gets more and more pro-feminist.

Story:\
High School genius Light Yagami picks up book that kills people. Instead of using it on Chad, the cunt that threw glue at him during 4th grade art, Light uses it to kill criminals he sees on TV, trying to cleanse the undesirables (Hitler at least had the decency to call them jews) and become god of a new world. While he's enjoying his crusade, it becomes obvious that bad guys are dying as they are broadcast, so enter L, a quirky genius detective. \
And for about 25 episodes we have a badass cat and mouse game where L and light try to discover each other's identity so they can kill each other and change/save the world. w0w so cool.  Good premise, smart writing, fast paced story.\
And then shit happens and two characters are introduced and light becomes about as stupid as the plot. Shit writing, shit plot twist, shit ending,  \
Overall 8/10\
Art:\
Cool gothic art. Everyone looks slick and smart and edgy. The opening has a scene of glass smashing and light catching an apple. Truly post-modern edge. Animation is good and smooth, no supersaiyan 3 rasengan bankai action scenes to eat up animation budget so consistent throughout. Also lots of internal monologue where scene pauses and camera focuses on one character and that character's hair lights up to show they are thinking. It's a good technique. Keeps the monologue from being boring. Actually a lot of scenes that would be boring are entertaining due to smart directing. Kid writes names in a notebook? Lets shake the camera and play uptempo opera music as if this were a shonen scene. That scene where Light eats the potato chip is so over-the-top epic a la supersaiyan 3 it's probably why Deathnote is featured in shonen jump. \
10/10 throughout\
Sound: \
Like the art, sound is very edgy and gothic. Opening is hardcore and the screemo. Ending is emo. Fits the setting of the story.\
9/10\
Character:\
L, the true title character, who everyone loves and roots for. Full of quirk, his screentime is golden and (obviously) is the propeller behind the fast-paced plot. Favorite character by far.\
Light is a tragic hero. I wasn't really rooting for him, nothing about him was particularly captivating. He should take notes from lelouche. Of course, the chemistry between Light and L is what makes deathnote so good. \
Misa's voice is annoying. Her shinigami is annoying. Her introduction is annoying. Her story arch is annoying. Her plotpowers are annoying. If she were hot all of this would be ok but she's not. Misa is annoying. \
Bunch of side characters. Despite writer's attempts to develop them at the end of the first and start of the second season, they remain 1 dimensional. On the bright side they take up no major screen time.\
Near is the cancer that killed steve jobs. \
7/10 because near\
Enjoyment:\
TBH enjoyed all of it, even the trainwreck season 2. The ending was shit and cringey, but it was enjoyable. It was like spectating a pair of asians on their first date.\

Overall 8/10  \
If it's worth my time to watch it's worth yours. Give it a shot next time your on tilt in league of legends or you get bored of rewatching the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Even if it's a total waste of your time it's not like you lost anything valuable. \

    This is probably one of the three best anime I have ever watched, perhaps the very best. The complex yet addictive story-line portrayed with the amazing soundtrack, animation and characters made for a great series. I feel as if I have to speak about all of the aspects of the show to appreciate it.\
Story:\
The story of Death Note is very well though out with twists and turns that make you want the show to never end, yet you want to find out how it ends. The tragedy and still beauty of this animation are largely evident in the story. You have to give the writers\
          \
        of this show a very big gold star. \
Art:\
The animation is very well created with the movements of the characters being necessarily dramatic with a crazy flare that make the show as I said before, addictive.\
Sound:\
I can only say that the music and sound, not to mention the voice acting for this show were breath-taking.\
Character:\
The dark sides of all of the character's and their brilliant minds and personalities were amazingly well-developed. Though Light's girlfriend Mina was somewhat annoying at points I believe that it was necessary for some events in teh show. \
Enjoyment:\
I strongly believe that anyone would love this anime.\

    The general plot of Death Note is an outstanding representation of extremes. Yagami Light shows us what happens if we have the abilities of god and misuse it for personal uses even though the original intention was meant for the good. What would happen if the Death Note falls to someone like Light? This story is an possible interpretation that would happen if such thing did occur in which someone such as Light had an strong sense of justice and happens to take it to the extremes in which one would go crazy such as Light having the overwhelming power of God himself. The character\
          \
        L also brings in interesting part into the main story. The conflict between Kira and L is very interesting even when Light being Kira is helping L but also is secretly planning steps ahead of him. \
The themes of the art represents the anime to its whole. The darkness and shade matches and suits the anime perfectly. Many people would agree that the pen animation was very cool to watch and showed Lights deep sense of justice. The also increasingly change of Light's expressions show that he is getting more corrupted until the very end. \
The characters of Death Note are the main components to the show. Light, the genius, with his tactical strength along with the Death Note take on the world of destroying criminals using his code name Kira against L who is mysterious but equally smart man that is trying to stop Kira. The use of cleverness throughout the characters make the plot interesting with many tricks that deceive each other and other characters. However Light's strong sense of justice mixes in with corruption that takes over him until the end.  \
Death Note puts on a great soundtrack that has both characters' themes that match both up perfectly.  It provides a good background and brings us to understand the intensity of what is going on in a scene. \
I thoroughly enjoy Death Note. The characters were made very interesting and made me choose between which side, Light or L? It was hard to think Light was the antagonist through the story because I enjoyed Light's cunning moments until the very end. Light's corruptness throughout gaining the powers of god also projects the abuse of his power which is one of the morals throughout this story. \

A smart psychological anime that starts off amazingly strong and gradually declines. Some characters are good(most of the good ones die though), and one character in particular is the most annoying character in any anime I've seen.\

    I'm pretty sure everyone on the planet who's seen any anime has seen Death Note. It's a staple and it might just be the best game of cat and mouse story where neither one knows which they are. Well worth a watch, deserving of the hype, and a solid gateway show if you've seen a few movies but never watched a series before.\
The premise is simple, write a name in the death notebook and they'll die the way it's written. That's a pretty simple story mechanic, but it opens up a lot to explore. What if someone lies about their name or hides it altogether?\
          \
        The book is useless. What if you could trade half of your lifespan to be able to see people's names written above them, would you do it? Finally, what if you had a stalker obsessed with you who might kill you rather than lose you with the powers of a Death Note? It's a constant state of escalation, where the stakes rise until someone falls. The main characters, the killer of killers Light and the mysterious detective \"L\", are some of the best developed in anime, their motivations and ideals are expanded on as their silent war unfolds. One wants to be the god of a new world where there is true justice and the other thinks no one is above the law and murder can never be justified. The world isn't big enough for the two of them.\
There are a lot of great elements to this story, from the discovery of the death note to figuring out its rules, from being investigated by the police to forgetting everything about it in order to hide from their search, to the showdown of finding out the true identity \"L\" and changing the world, for the better if not the worse. The pacing is phenomenal, the first two thirds of the show are pure gold. Not to spoil anything, but given the level of escalation building for over 24ish episodes, no ending could hope to live up to that hype train. Saying that, it's not like the show becomes bad at that moment, but it begins to get spread a little thin on characters because as the name says, there is a lot of Death in this show. There's suspense, intrigue, plotting, downright scary world views, romance, obsession, and betrayal all wrapped up into this neat little package. The soundtrack on this is probably the best anime soundtrack I've ever heard, and I'm a huge Bebop fan. This has 3 CDs worth of fantastic guitar and bass riffing that sound great even if you've never seen the show. It's something like 37 episodes long, so it is a little bit of an undertaking, but it is well worth the time you'll invest into it. You will also feel the need to own a black notebook after watching this show.\

    So stuff iv heard about this anime:\
-it slows down in the middle\
-stop watching around episode 25 (its bad after that)\
For the most part I do agree that this anime does slow down around the middle but the more you watch the more it makes sense and it adds to the impact the show has later on. Now the big thing. The episodes towards the end. This is the most talked about part and the part that divides most audiences. Once again I can understand why. However (No spoilers) I thought what they did to carry on the story was rather clever. There are new characters\
          \
        that are introduced and a lot of people do not like these certain characters. I feel this is because they get compared to characters that we have learned to like over the first 25eps and then imminently tend to not like the new guys. The way I see it, the show does take a turn but not for good or bad. It carry's the story along and I was still completely invested. Saying this I feel the sudden change and the last couple of episodes could have been something they could have saved for a second season and maybe left the first season on a cliffhanger. However this anime as a whole is still fantastic. There are twists and turns throughout with fantastic characters and an awesome story. I believe their is a element in every character you can love especially \"Ryuk\" (love that guy) I can understand why its one of the most popular anime out there. I think the last couple of episodes is no reason to dismiss this series and you will get hooked after the first episode. I would highly recommend this anime.     ",

    Okay, Death Note is my favorite anime of all time, and there are a few reasons why:\
1. Story: The storyline was amazing, although it did have its flaws in ways. The idea of the battle of geniuses with the introduction of the supernatural was brilliant in concept and portrayal. Each of the characters are well-developed (even L, despite his mysterious character). Although I did still rate it a 10, the story had some major pitfalls in my opinion. First, the whole mystery concept of the anime was thrown out the window. You as a viewer don't have to solve anything... You follow both Light and\
          \
        L, and each step of their plans is carefully and brilliantly explained (which is good and bad). You just have to sit back and enjoy. Plus, once you get past about episode 16/17, most of the storyline is extraneous and quite frankly unnecessary. Could've ended there, but it didn't... You start progressing further into the anime, and you can tell something's off the entire time. Then the last episode hits. Although the tension is thick, everyone still seems pretty calm. AND THEN EVERYONE LOSES THEIR FUCKING SHIT! Then it's over with some half-assed cliffhanger. Part 1: 10, easy. Part 2: 8.\
2. Art: Inconsistent. Sometimes the art was brilliant, and each of the characters had all of their distinctive attributes, and it was good. Ryuk and L were my favorites in terms of appearance. But when the illustrators were doing groups/expansive scenes, it fell off. Almost as if they weren't trying at times. Art: 7.\
3. Sound: Good. Soundtrack was really great at times, and the voice acting was on point. Easy 8\
4. Character: Obvious high point of the anime. Everyone was unique and brilliant in their own way. L (a fan favorite, as well as mine), Light, Ryuk, even Misa Misa and all the other supporting characters were well thought out and awesomely portrayed. \
This was made to be an enjoyable anime, and it succeeded. Lots of highs with not many lows. Nothing was bad about the anime, and a lot of it was really great. Overall: 10\

    It's hard to write a review of this series without adding in spoilers. I'll try my best not to. The overall anime was very enjoyable, but stressful in a sense. It was filled with a lot of suspension about what would happen next. The first 20+ episodes were very good, but I felt that after a certain point in the series, it felt dragged on. The ending felt sub-par like the writers took a cheap way out to end it. Overall, I would recommend watching it. Near the end I struggled to finish it because of certain major events that had transpired to the point\
          \
        that the anime was feeling like it was being dragged on. \

Story: 9\
Death Note's story is as good as they come. It has everything you could ever want out of one: twists and turns, tragic events, cliffhangers that make you want to keep going and a fantastic ending. There is a slight problem however. Without spoiling anything, after certain events occur, the show's story starts to crumble like a cookie. While I never had any problem with it, I have to say that the quality of the story dropped quite a bit towards the end. Let's be honest though. You can't expect it to be at this high of a level for 37 episodes, and quite honestly I prefer the direction the anime took instead of all of the ones that the fans wanted. I feel like I just had to mention this though, as anyone who watched Death Note has basically the same opinion on those episodes. Overall I don't feel like the story had me dissappointed at any point, even with the quality drop.\
Art and Animation: 8\
Art is okay. Some scenes go above the norm and few character designs stand out. Other than that there is not much to say about it. It does it's job well. Animation on the other hand is really smooth. The movement of the characters is fluid and it feels surprisingly natural. There are moments where they don't feel like that, but those are intentional.\
Sound: 9\
It's rare to find such a fitting OST. It really feels as if every piece was written with intent of using it in the specific scenes they were in, specifically the chants, that send chills down your spine, and that's hard to pull off. Also, extra points for the openings. They are awesome in so many ways. Endings are good too, but my goodness the openings.\
Characters: 10\
This show's characters are so believable that it blows my mind. Maybe they are not realistic, but predicting what a person would do in any of the situations presented by the anime is impossible. Sure, people may shit on the characters from the last episodes, but I found even them believable. I will not talk about any of the characters that appear later in the anime, but they are all great and they make you feel exactly how the anime wants you to fell about them. Instead, let's talk about Light, who is one of the best anti-heroes I've ever seen. His development as Kira is truly a feat to behold. For the whole time you don't know if you should root for him or againts him, and because of that every event leaves a huge impact on you, since you don't know how to feel. If I'll say more I feel like I'll spoil someone so I'll just stop at this spot. The characters are amazing that's all.\
Enjoyment: 9\
I adore psychological thrillers, and Death Note is easily one of the best ones I've ever seen. It does everything with so much care, that it blew my mind. If not for few mistakes it would probably be right up there as my favourite. But even with them I enjoyed watching it immensely.\
Overall: 9\
Death Note is a must watch. No matter if you don't like the genre, no matter if you don't think you will like it, just give it a shot. I can guarantee you will not be disapointed. I feel like this anime should be seen by anyone in the world, no matter if they like anime or not. It's that good. While watching it, I felt like I was watching an adaptation of some Stephen King book. That alone is something that should make you want to watch this anime if you haven't already, even if I told you to do so at the beggining. What, are you a rebel or something?\

    Death Note tells the story of Light (Raito) Yagami, a seventeen-year-old genius whose life drastically changes when he chances upon the Death Note. The black notebook, despite its unassuming appearance, has the deadly ability to kill, requiring only a name and a face. Dropped in the human world by the bored death god (shinigami) called Ryuk, the Death Note proves itself a most destructive weapon when Light decides to use it to kill criminals, intending for himself to be the god of the new world he will create – a world purged of evil.\
Distinguishing itself from the run-of-the-mill stories of heroes who possess hearts of\
          \
        gold, Death Note introduces Light Yagami, the cunning young man who will stop at nothing to make the world a better place. Light is intelligent, disgusted with how the world is turning out, and bored out of his mind. That he seeks to punish the wicked using the Death Note is a noble intention by itself, but his method of passing judgment is hardly orthodox, and gains the sympathy of neither the police nor his adversary, L.\
Playing opposite Light (at this point dubbed Kira by the public), L is the mysterious detective in charge of the Kira investigation. World-renowned for his unparalleled ability in solving cases (and taking only those that interest him), L takes Kira head-on, and challenges the latter to a mind duel – a clash where the one who is found first pays with his life.\
Fast-paced, suspenseful and gripping, Death Note sets the bar high for the anime of the generation. With its compelling characters and well-contrived plot, Death Note keeps its viewers on the edge of their seats each time Light tries to draw the suspicion away from himself while trying to find out just who exactly L is. Light, despite the terrible things he has done to get away with what he's doing, doesn't fail to deliver with his strategic mind and measured smiles. L, despite his peculiar, deceptive appearance, never lets down with his likewise brilliant counter-offensive. Both manipulative, cold and calculating - Light and L dare each other with an almost childish, egotistical desire to win. It's the striking combination of similarities and differences between them that makes their characters believable and interesting.\
Yet, without this already compelling rivalry between Light and L, Death Note still manages to fascinate. Through the development of Light's character alone and the presentation of his choices when he takes possession of the Death Note, the series shows the ultimate peril of having the Death Note: It can destroy the one who holds it.\
The realistic portrayal of Light and his descent to madness in search of justice is an interesting perspective to consider. That Light begins as an innocent and virtuous young man illustrates that some evil come forth through good intentions; and that some good, through bad. Those same virtues and ideals, no matter how good they are, ultimately caused Light to choose the path he treaded and take the course of actions that he did.\
The death god Ryuk, with his odd sense of humor and obsession with apples, does not fail to make light of the grim atmosphere in the series. In a direct contrast to his considerably good nature, he fittingly ends the series by writing Light's name in his notebook. With this, he keeps his promise that he will take Light's life when the time comes.\
Death Note ends in a cruel loop; Kira was born because of a death god's whim, and Kira dies because of the same god's whim. While not intended to symbolize anything, these circumstances underscore Light's unsuccessful attempt to become a god himself - because from the very beginning, his fate has been in the hands of the same god he wished to equal.\
What he wished to change changed him, and ultimately, Light Yagami lost himself to the Death Note.\
Death Note is a remarkable glimpse at the human folly, a look at the nature of man and a twisted concept of justice that sprung from the righteous ideals. Prompting its audience not only to choose sides, it also initiates one to think and reason with himself for or against the alternatives that face the characters in the series. Thought-provoking and a very intelligent watch, Death Note is undoubtedly genius at its finest, and while it does not answer its questions about morality and murder point-blank, it imparts with its audience a message worth thinking about:\

    Captivating from the first hit, death note is a thrilling, exciting, huge mind game, and we get the front row seat.\

What\\'s also fascinating is that you can even alter how the person dies. With this being known, Light finds a new hobby when obtaining this notebook, and gets a great idea: Why not cleanse the world of all of the bad people?! and create a new world with only good people that he can judge. Really, he wants to become &quot;God&quot;.\
It\
          \
        sounds absurd, but throughout this series, he seems to appear that way in many aspects. When he encounters people like L, who try to spoil his plan of a new world, it gets even better, you don\\'t want to stop watching it! Anyone that wants to watch a good anime, this is definitely worth watching, and from my opinion even re-watching. I will admit.. at some points the whole &quot;killing people for a new world&quot; plan gets a bit drawn out, but then new characters like Near, and Mello join the scene to complicate, and make Light\\'s plan even more interesting to watch.

    Why did I give 7 to Death note and placed it under my favorite anime?\
Simple...\
episodes 1-25 = rate 10, episode 25-37 = rate 6, average = 8, but due to extreme rate failure, extremely boring and unimaginative episode, it doesn't deserve 8.\
Therefore, its 7.\
Story\
Its great, really. Anyone watching this anime can clearly see it has one great story with lots of upsets and wonderfully made events. Its never boring to watch it, because something happens all the time. And episodes 5-24, and constant \"conflicts\" between L and Light are so good I couldn't stop watching those episodes.\
Art\
Nothing much to say. Nothing special, not bad, not\
          \
        awesome. Death scenes are somehow repetitive. Not too much blood, I like it, its heart attack as #1 death reason in here after all.\
Sound\
To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to sound. I did like the soundtrack for first 20 episodes, at least the intro song, didn't like the later song at all. \
Character (possible spoiler)\
This is where it gets really fun. L is one of the greatest characters ever, and even though I hated him for his methods, I really missed him in later episodes. It simply wasn't as fun without him. Misa is standard woman in love, kinda confusing, but nicely done overall. Light is my favorite character in this anime, and for many reasons: 1. He is smart 2. He understand that sacrifices are required sometimes  3. Did I say he is really smart?\
Enjoyment\
I will not comment this one. Every person has its own sense of enjoyment. As I said in the beginning, I loved episode 1-25, and really didn't like 25-37.\
Overall\
It is a great tv show. Definitively a must see. Some late episodes just ruined it for me, it just wasn't it in the end, it was boring and it didn't keep me begging for more like first episodes. Once again, it is important to know this is my own opinion, so many people will disagree with this, that's normal.\
If this was split into 2 parts instead of one with 1-25 being first season, and 25-37 second season, it would be great original with bad sequel, this way it is just another great anime ruined by late episodes.\

    You like brilliant plans? You like plot twists? Many times shows will have one, which is pretty much the serving size for the entire series for the main plot. Not Death Note. Death Note has a huge supply of brilliant schemes and they're thrown at you every episode. They do not skimp in this area!\
What can I say, whenever i talk about epic animes or someone asks me my favorite, \"Death Note\" is always at the tip of my tongue. Now I am aware its shortcomings in a couple of points, but I really can't knock down the entire series for them for a few\
          \
        points in a couple of departments.\
First of all, let me say that there seriously needs to be more animes like this. Where they unfold amazingly genius schemes and tantalize your brain, not just \"oh hey let's fight using my super powers and once we kill the evil enemy with my hidden super duper super power at the end for the big boss and done deal\" That formula is getting so old, while there is a severe shortage of shows of the kind of ingenious mind-bending strategic style that Death Note is (which some call the genre of \"bran-fuck\").\
(To those also noticing the lack of \"brain-fuck\" series, may I direct you to One Outs, Akagi, Kaiji, and possibly Umineko Nakukoro no Ni)\
Back to Death Note. The show isn't so much about shinigamis as much as it is about the intellectual battle between one trying to kill while not getting caught and one trying to catch the killer. To make things more interesting, the two end up working side by side to catch the killer! So you can surmise just from the setup the kind of intellectual tidbits the killer will have to do as not to give himself away, and yet still go on with the killings, and deal with his pursuant. As the dance progresses, the ante and stakes get bigger and bigger just as the level of moments that make you say \"wow that's brailliant.\"\
Oh, you can compare it to Dexter, the TV series, but Death Note delivers intellectual candy at a faster pace.\
The anime runs a bit deeper than just unfolding juicy tactics, which I am supremely biased for, if you can't tell already (haha). The characters' endeavors themselves pose philosophical questions to the audience: \"Are humans, capable of weilding so much power and not going corrupt, even if you take a super smart, competent specimen, and he has noble aspirations to stat off with?\" Granted it's all fictional, but the series is more than just sweet strategies after another. It touches upon many other deeper themes of the morality and capacity of humanity.\
The plans Light hatches to gain leverage on L, as well as the strategies L throws at Light will have you piqued and thinking.\
Now for the negativity and criticisms I have that does not give this series a perfect mark.\
The ending is a bit unsatisfying. They also drag it out 20 more episodes than they should have, and in the 2nd half of the series, the wellspring of brilliant strategies clearly dries up. From the perspective of the producers and writers, it's understandable that they would want to include the extra characters, as well as possibly drag the series on for more episodes, but imo, it becomes very DBZ-like (in terms of the quality of episodes due to the decision to drag it out) in comparison with the first half of the series. There is a movie version of Death Note, and you will find that ending extremely satisfying. I always fantasize, \"what if the anime series was cut in half, and had the movie's ending? sigh, that would be the perfect series.\" And i really probably would give it perfect scores (in the appropriate departments).\
Sound: \
The Intros and endings, as well as all the in-anime suspense music paint the feeling extremely well. you'll just have to experience it to know what i'm talking about. Just know that they fit well and are very good. \
2nd intro theme. i'm not a fan of death metal at all, but i can see sort of the connection with light at this stage. If you read the lyrics of the first ending, Alumina - Nightmare, they depict a guy who decides do things with his own power, his own way, having been broken (no absolute truth) and confused. He's still holding onto his ideals. One cannot help but draw the connection to Light. The 2nd death metal intro song, however seems to paint Light's more depraved state, having gradually deviated from his just world ideal, and more enticed by being the ruler of the world (for power and to be god) as well as the victory of outwitting and eliminating L. But maybe i'm just mad and reading too much into the songs. =]\
So all in all, despite critical decisions for the series that drags it out, resulting in fallen quality than what it started out with, i still give this series high marks overall, for the first half was truly amazing, and the story is great. It's merely the execution that faltered a bit. I can't knock it down too much for that. It just prevents it from getting perfect marks.\

        being detected. While this alone could be a central concept to be explored throughout the show, Death Note takes a different route. In the first episode it is established that the protagonist, Light Yagami, will be using the book to initiate his own version of justice upon the world. However, in the second episode the real story begins; a detective named \"L\" arrives to foil Light's plans. Thus begins one of the most intense and entertaining, back and forth, cat and mouse chases as Light tries to get rid of L while L does everything he can to find Kira (the name the people give to the invisible murderer; aka Light). \
If you've ever read a Goosebumps book, an Agatha Christie novel or a similar kind of \"page-turner\" book, Death Note would be the anime equivalent. The ending of each episode feels like a cliffhanger and it will compel you to keep watching until you find yourself marathoning the series. There are twists and turns in every episode and due to how convoluted and complex Light's and L's plans are, each episode feels unpredictable. With the show being presented mostly from Light's point of view, there is no real good or bad guy. Instead, Death Note aims to entertain its audience by showing the methods Light uses and his thought processes during his attempts to defeat L. \
The themes of the show take a backseat to the mind games between L and Light. The technical aspects of Death Note really enhance the show. Even the most simple events are portrayed in the most intense and dramatic manner. For example, writing names in the death note is depicted similar to striking with a sword. There is plenty of imagery used to depict the mind games between Light and L; most of which are accompanied by an internal monologue from Light. This gives an epic feel to what is essentially a guy thinking to himself. As for the sound, the voice acting is spot on and the soundtrack is appropriate; especially the use of the choir during Light's scenes. \
One minor issue Death Note has is its supporting cast. While they do enough to be interesting, at times they bend too easily to Light's or L's will or are too naive to question either character's motives. The biggest issues in the show come in the last ten episodes. There are new characters introduced that are weak copies of L (eccentric detectives), the pacing is a mess and some of the better characters of the first two thirds of the show are almost forgotten; the most notable being Ryuk. This does not mean these episodes are not worth watching or that the show is ruined. It is just a drop in quality that is quite unexpected. The final conclusion to Death Note is still just as memorable and as high quality as the first two acts.\
Death Note is one of the most accessible anime created. It is not deep and it never tries to be. It doesn't try to answer any questions about justice and it won't force you to support either of the main characters. The series manages to create a story that is gripping and suspenseful from beginning to end. For anyone who wants something entertaining and straightforward, or simply wants to watch something to get into anime, this is one of the best shows to watch. Will this be the best anime ever? For most people, no. But, it is almost guaranteed to be satisfying as a crime thriller and that is all that it was ever meant to be. \

    Death Note is one of those anime's where your on the bad guy's side or anti- hero's side throughout the whole show and everything the protagonist does just blows your mind and leaves you hungry wanting more of Death Note.\
The Main character Light Yagami is one of my favourite characters in any anime and he shows why with his intelligence and his ability to have things go his way. (Like Lelouch without the geass)\
The art style is dark and fits perfectly with the whole dark thriller atmosphere the show gives off and leaves you wanting to be the \"god of the new world.\" \
There was\
          \
        never a dull moment with Death Note, each episode leaves you with wanting to watch more  episodes it just kept you hooked and it never disappointed....... well except the ending.\
The ending was alright and I don't want to spoil it but its an ending I didn't want, other then that if you are looking for an anime to watch you gotta watch Death Note is a must see anime.\

    (EDITED: OH MY GOSH I WAS SO TERRIBLE AT WRITNG/SPELLING/TYPING A YEAR AGO, I am so sorry) \
  I absolutely loved Death Note to be honest, even though the story got....less exciting after a certain episode further into the show. I thought that the fact that is was a psychological battle between Light Yagami who seems to be a protagonist in the beginning completely turns around and you soon figure out he was an antagonist. I also loved this series because a notebook which has the power to kill just by writing their name down, come on. That's awesome. Now L comes a few\
          \
        episodes in and is a major detective... but no one actually knows what he looks and or sounds like, working in the shadows of justice. (Sorry to all Light ((Kira)) supporters no offense intended).I quite liked it! It was very interesting! When I first saw Death Note I didn't want to watch it, thought it would be awful. I ran out of anime to watch and i finished it within a few days. I've re-watches the series multiple times and enjoyed it every time. I cried on a few episodes as well but not everyone is as emotional as me. Why I like it? It leaves you wanting more the way everything happens in the story, and way the characters relationship's develop further into the show.\
So Overall\
Story: 9/10 \
The story line kept me attached to the series I couldn't stop watching with all the twists, kept me on the edge of my seat :D\
Art: 10/10\
I personally thought the artwork was outstanding the backgrounds were detailed for the most part and the characters were just amazing!\
Sound: 9/10 \
I loved the music they would play throughout the episodes but sometimes...they would play it... Just a little to much, and the voice-acting was great I loved both subbed and dubbed but personally I prefer the dub. The voices fit them a bit better in my opinion.\
Characters: 10/10\
I LOVE the characters! They develop relationships, crash, and burn them. The way the characters grow throughout the story just completely intrigued me! My favorite character honestly is L. \
Enjoyment: 10/10\
As I said I love Death Note its just an amazing anime! If you haven't watched it I HIGHLY recommend it \
Overall: 9/10\
Not perfect for me but very, very close.",

    Oh the great Death note what hasn't been said about this anime?... To be honest Death Note in my opinion its everything people said and more. \
The story starts out simple, but later you will have to pay a lot of attention to details as things become much more complicated and a bit harder to follow. That might be a problem for some people, but like a said if you really pay attention you'll be a lot more interested in this characters and get familiar with them. Personally, I found it to be really interesting the way the story unfold, and came to an end.\
The\
          \
        Art and Sound in Death Note its beautiful and dark really following the concept of the anime and giving this characters a perfect atmosphere. I really like the way the drawing from this characters was and how the attention to details was on both the characters and environments. The sound of Death note its made of Heavy Metal for both the openings and endings and ambient noises as background music. The music fits very well and give the anime a sense of sorrow and bleakness.\
The Characters in Death Note are very interesting themselves, but mostly you'll be focusing on two characters Light Yagami AKA Kira and (L) both are very interesting characters, but I happen to like (L) more as a character. I found (L) to be very smart and kind of funny at times in a very sarcastic way. Also, he was a very determent guy who always came with great ideas and He wasn't afraid to face Kira himself. Light Yagami on the other hand was pretty much everything that (L) was and more. While (L) had a very lonely personality; Light was also a very lonely guy, but he was also very successful with chicks. I also like to add that I really hated Light, but for all the right reasons. He was using everyone around him and he didn't care about anyone. His sole purpose was to become the god of the new world he will create, and everyone who opposed will suffer the consequences. For all those reasons I hated this character, but in the way he did things made it all that much interesting.\
I have to say I did enjoy this series a lot and most of this enjoyment came from the well crafted dialogue. Yes, there was also some action here and there, but what made this anime was its excellent and intelligent dialogue.\
Overall, if there is anything wrong I can say about the show its probably the fact that there was a few episodes that weren't as good around the middle of the show, but that is a very minor complaint and nothing to take away from the experience. I also thought of that perfect world Light try to create and how wrong it will be because no matter how you try to change the world it will never be perfect. One example will be Religion and how each Religion wants to create this perfect world of peace, but there has been a lot of wrong with Religion as they have created a lot of wars, and also you see how each of then criticize each other even if they followed the same god.Good and Evil will always exist  and corruption its something that will always exist, we see it in: Politics, Religion, Wars, TV, on the Streets its everywhere. I know I deviate from this review on this last paragraph but I wanted to compare real life experience with the concept of this anime. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this show and by the end of it I was very satisfied with what it has offered me and the way it concluded. We humans can make this a better world, but we can never change the nature of every individual.\

    When the Devil rebelled against God, he was cast out of Heaven and made to suffer in Hell. When Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, they, too, were cast out of paradise and exiled into a life that ultimately culminates with death. Though ostensibly dissimilar, the sins of man and the Devil are, in fact, the same: they desired to put themselves on the level of God, and for that they were punished.\
In many ways, this is the basis of the Faustian archetype. A man desires to become God only to find himself destroyed by the story's\
          \
        end. If you think back to all the characters from all the media you've consumed who have had god complexes, you'll find that few, if any, turn out to have a happy ending. I'm reminded in particular of Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\" -- the story of a brilliant man who sold his soul to become god on earth only to find himself dragged to hell at the story's end. The Faustian archetype is not an antiquated one, however. I like to think that Paul Thomas Anderson's \"There Will Be Blood\" is, in many ways, a Faustian tale. I also like to think that \"Death Note\" follows a similar Faustian vein.\
Now after walking the horse around the barn about five times, I arrive at \"Death Note\" -- one of the most popular works of anime ever made (according to myanimelist right now, actually, the *most* popular anime ever made). Spanning 37 episodes, \"Death Note\" tells the story of Light Yagami, an exceptionally intelligent Japanese high school student who one day stumbles across a notebook that claims to possess the power to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. Light takes up this newfound power with tremendous gusto, swearing to eliminate the wicked, build a better world, and proclaim himself the god of this new world. With countless soon dead, an urban legend soon crops up around the unknown perpetrator as authorities and civilians alike bequeath him the title \"Kira.\"\
Now, I've never been a big fan of magical realism. The premise is rather fantastical, to say the least, and the megalomaniacal Light doesn't seem like the sort of guy you'd sympathize with -- though as the story progressed I did grow to pity him. Despite this, however, \"Death Note\" succeeds by way of its meticulous, masterful plotting and the staggering battle of wits between its two main characters -- Light, who I've already mentioned, and L, a genius detective working to catch Kira. Seeing the two of them duke it out as they consider, reconsider, devise, revise, and enact their schemes is a thrill to watch. A solid cast of supporting characters accompanies them, but the real ticket in town is this battle of two cerebral gods. Without them, this story falls apart, and they're both so masterfully crafted that they make sure this never happens.\
And as much as I hate to admit it, Light is by far one of the most brilliantly conceived characters I've ever encountered. I loathe him, despise him, sympathize with him, and pity him in equal measure. His boundless intelligence and astonishing charisma would elicit the support of many, but the power of the Death Note brings upon a descent into sociopathy that is by turns tragic and infuriating. For a man who aspires to be God, he really seems to encompass only one side of the essence of God. How does that old verse go? \"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away?\" If God exists, He is, in many ways, both creator and destroyer -- the one who gave birth to this world and so will take it to death. Indeed, God often seems like a rather contradictory figure -- creator and destroyer, an arbiter of both justice and mercy, light and dark, kind and cruel. Light, however, captures only one side of that dichotomy: he never creates, he rarely shows mercy, his very name belies his true nature, and he develops so little regard for human life that the mere suggestion of kindness from him is laughable. And yet, one can't help but wonder what he would have been like without the Death Note's corrosive influence. Hence my introduction with the Faustian stuff. A man who wants to become god slowly corrupted by his own ambition. His tragedy is a compelling one, and it's a tremendous testament to the writing that I can't call him outright \"evil\" -- merely misguided and so corrupted.\
Overall, it's a tremendous work that has earned its popularity. I can't go into any further detail regarding Light's character and my thoughts on \"Death Note\" without spoiling anything, so I'll refrain from writing anything further. That being said, if you haven't seen \"Death Note,\" I would advise that you do so immediately. Chances are, you'll enjoy it; even if you don't, it's one of those things that just shouldn't be missed given its notoriety. You'll more likely fall under the former than the latter, though.\

    It's hard to judge this \"masterpiece\", even more me, since everyone hates my opinions. I'm probably a tad' late to the party too. But let's keep on.\
Death Note somehow got that amazing golden armor that dodges 100% of any criticism that comes to it. I'm amazed people actually gave this a 10, when to me it is probably a 8 (and being generous), maybe it's my personal taste, or maybe it's just the first 12 episodes that gave it an extremely strong first impression.\
[Story]\
If I could describe the story of Death Note is that is starts off amazing, until it gets to the second cour\
          \
        where the quality gets a lil' bit off, then it reaches the third one... oh my. At this point the story dropped terribly, it was hard to keep up  in any of the episodes, to the point I just dropped it. [6/10]\
[Art]\
The art on the show is not amazing, but it is pretty good. The characters designs are cool and I can tell them apart, each character has its own noticeable quirks that shown on the art, and I felt like it was detailed enough. Now to the downer points: most of the backgrounds (not all of them but most) are incredibly dull and edgy and the way some of the characters are drawn gets really tired after a while. [8/10]\
[Sound]\
Sound is great, the soundtrack wasn't that amazing but it is not bad either, and sound effects the same. Both OPs are pretty good, I personally prefer the first one but the second one eventually grew on me, it is mostly if you like the music style of boths, in which they succeed.\
The first OP is perfect as well, oh my. [9/10]\
[Character]\
It's hard to judge character when you dropped a show since you didn't watched it all and don't know what the show does with them in the long run, but sincerely, I think I got to a reasonable point of the show where it shouldn't develop them any further and instead show how they're working. I mean, develop them even further after 33 episodes and so close to the end?\
So here is it: Light is an amazing character, L is an amazing character, the rest are 'oh okay' or 'nice' characters. The third cour is hard to judge but I guess the two other detectives are good too and it's just personal taste that I completely utterly hated them. [8/10]\
[Enjoyment]\
I strongly recommend the first two cours, the first one is amazing and the second one while inferior to the first one is also pretty good. But the third one is incredibly fucking BORING. And no, it's not personal taste, there are lots of people that agree with me and even if it is it's my review so I don't care.\
Anyway, it is an enjoyable experience until a certain point, the guy that directed this (that I don't remember the name and my internet is too shitty right now for me to search for it) is extremely talented (EATING RUFFLES LIKE A BOSS), even on the third cour where things got awful you can see he is trying his best to work with it. Want more of his work. [6/10]\
[Overall]\
Death Note is a solid experience from the first episode to the en-- episode 26. Even when the plot goes to shit, the technical aspects of it are still pretty good, looking at this that objectively maybe I have been way too harsh at it.\
I recommend the first two cours to everyone and if you became a masochist fan maybe the third one. [7/10]\

    death note is a show that is often compared to a game of cat and mouse, except you never know who is the cat or mouse at any one time which leads to a rather gripping show and honestly would be worth scores of 9 or 10... however, there is on MASSIVE problem that many fans simply overlook or maybe they are just blinded by episodes 1-25 because after that the show, which is standing proudly on the peak of anime greatness, comes crashing down into the abyss. this is the problem i have with people giving this show 9 and 10 because episodes 26-37\
          \
        are just torture, no spoilers but they really ruin things in episode 25. because of these 12 episodes iv awarded a score of 7/10 for the story because 1-25 is AMAZING but this review includes those cursed 12 episodes so.... tough.\
the animation is nothing spectacular, it what i would call average honestly however this show dose not require impressive visuals so this isn't really important. no complaints from me really so i give it a score of 7/10 \
the sound is one of the high points of the anime, i LOVE the first into. its amazing, there are some other tracks scattered throughout the anime which were not bad ether. id recommend dub over sub however be ready to pull your hair out whenever misa misa is around. 8/10\
oh the characters... how i am torn on this one. we will start with the good: L is one of my favorite characters of all time, he's on my top 10 list on my profile, he is amazing ... saying anymore will release a bubble of rage from inside me for spoiler filled reasons so we wont go into that here.\
Ryuk is an awesome addition and helps make light bearable for a while and even manages to make him a good interesting character at the start till he lost it.\
rem is kind of interesting however NOTHING can make misa bearable, trust me.\
ok now we are going to start with the bad:\
light is one of the most unlikable, psychotic and delusional main protagonists iv ever seen. he has the ability to make some situation dull with his constantly frowning face and average appearance. his personality is non existent all that left is a unlikable psychopath with genius level intelligence which is his only saving grace. i think my opinion is a very rare one so you may want to judge him for yourself. \
misa is unbearable, dumb, blind and infuriating she is probably in my top 5 most hated characters of all time list. cant stand her.\
nate and mihael are trying to fill a gap they couldn't hope to fill in a million years and nate only really does anything HUGE via luck!!! they are just bad.\
with all this in mind i give it a 6/10 because there are a lot of character i didn't mention and they were all ether good or ok.\
like i said at the start episodes 1-25 were superb!!! light was a good interesting protagonist until episode 26 were he becomes unbearable as well as the introductions of nate and mihael who are just bad. but episodes 1-25 are so good that i grant it an overall score of 7/10 and a recommendation to ONLY watch episodes 1-25 otherwise you will be cursed with the same anger as i am cursed with.\

    Death Note Review \
Overall (9.2)                                      [Rounding of scores]\
Genres - Psychological thriller\
 Death Note is definitely At popular series on all sides of the ocean from Japn to the West, so much so it actually has a good Dub (Sub is still better in my opinion but finally a good dub). The anime aired in 2006 and from then on has just kept gaining popularity and is arguably one\
          \
        of the best series yet.\
Story (9.1) - The story is very unique and captivates the audience. The basic strory line is that the Shinigami named Ryuuk accidentally dropped a death note (a book what kills the person whoes name is written in it by the user, normally through heart attack) into the human realm. This is picked up by Yagami Light as he wants to erdicate the world of criminals and play god after holding onto it for a while and comfirming its powers. This created interesting concepts of what is right and wrong? Is capital punnishment right? Should vigilantes be able to take law in their own hands? Can criminals be rehabilitated? And so on. The story evolves into two sides Light's and L's who are trying to find out who is who and get to them first. That element drives the story for the first half lrading to some ironic moments. Thats allo can say without giving much away. \
The cat and mouse game is gripping and is at the top of anime greatness but be warned after ep25 the second half takes in. Don't get me worng is teh second half good? Yes, by all accounts its good but no where near as good as the first half. That is why the story is not closer to a 10.\
\
Characters (9.0) - All the characters are great for the most part i wonk go into them all but the ones i fell are necessary.\
Light and L - the most intectial and interesting partners and enimes i have ever seen in anime and the character designs are great.\
Mello- No worst character in the series glad he fades out into obscurity\
Near - he gets a lot of flack but he is probably the best antagonist in the second half and is decently interesting opponent for Light.\
Ryuk - very interesting and pleasing charcter in general and is a great acquaintance and partner for light. \
Misa - nice distraction and puppet for Light to use and does get some flack that is deserved but has quite a few redeeming qualities.\
Side- all geart for teh screen time they have and as all ways there is nit picks with the and some i wish wasnt here at all and some i get confused between as they look sligtly similar.\
Sound (9.3) - Yet another great sound track, opening, and ending to go down in the best of the best list. The epic sounding orchestration formthe music is splendid, Yoshihisa and Hideki both out did themselves.  I think if the sound track was not present the anime would not be comsodered where it os as it adds so much to the decision making and tension especially in the cat and mouse half. The only down side is that if your not a fan of the orchestra and epic music with a Latin quire it may sound same-ish.\
Japanes voic acting was splendid and fitted the characters perferectly not much more on that just great. The English dub is one of the best i have ever heard and would reccomend every one watching at least the first half ahain with the dub as it is rare nowadays to have one this good. Although there are problems with script changes and for the actors to get into their roles after a while.\
Art/Animatio (9.1) :amazing.  The dark colour pad suits the anime almost perfectly. The character designs for the mains and great no real complaints. However, the side characters on the task force could use some more detail to tell the apart. In general the scenery is still but looms amazing all the same. Eventough lots of the animation should not be taxing as it just involves lots of talking and thinking they still made it have a special look that was so pleasing. Hell, the even made writing hundreds of names down looks amazing and cool with the soundtrack as well.\
Overall: The anime is great a must watch for anyone. Its just amazing i cant say much then what i have already said with out going into spoilers. I guarante after light and L have their first confrontation over a tele prompter you will not stop watch\

    I thought this anime was fantastic. It's a story of hubris and arrogance and extremism and how what seems positive at first can lead to injustice and the betrayal of one's ideals... the \"tyranny of good intentions\".\
I like that the story authors simply showed Light's actions without condemnation or apology, allowing the audience to form its own conclusion.\
The philosophical question at the heart of the story is profound: What would I do if I had this power? Who wouldn't be tempted to use it?\
One can draw interesting religious questions from the story, too, especially at the end. If \"God\" commands you to murder his enemies\
          \
        simply because they dare to oppose him, then how can you continue to worship such injustice?\

What a mindblowing piece of anime. Incredibly smart plot, heart pumping action, characters that feel real, story and plot flowing smoothly and dangerously.\
I can't praise this anime enough. Any adult should enjoy this masterpiece.\
I'm 28 years old, watched this one with my 24 years old wife who NEVER watched an anime before. She absolutely loved it and could not believe that \"cartoons\" can get this good and serious. \

    [Introduction]\
Death Note is a very unique anime. It is not every day that you find an anime, or any television show for that matter, that keeps you on your toes for multiple episodes.\
The plot picks up pace with the entry of The World’s greatest detective, called L. While the premise was already interesting, the entry of L provided a different perspective to what Light was doing. From the eyes of Light, he was cleansing the world of evil. On the other hand, L believes that what he was doing was extremely childish and stressed the fact that he had no right to take somebody’s life.\
This\
          \
        dynamic between Light and L is the highlight of the series. The psychological elements of the series are among the best ever made. The battle of wits between Light and L is an absolute treat to watch.\
\
[Review]\
Starting with a strong point of the anime, the plot. The anime is fast paced and highly unpredictable, in a good way. The various schemes plotted by L and Light to outwit the other account for some really good plot points and twists. The conversations between the Japanese police force and L (whom they refer as Ryuzaki, to conceal his identity) are very entertaining. The extent to which Light goes to throw any possible suspicion of being Kira off him is mind-boggling. The addition of Misa Amane a little later accounts for some fun plot development as she makes the image of Kira vulnerable by killing insignificant people. The way Light tackles the problem is again very interesting (and unpredictable). Some of Light’s schemes do start looking really far-fetched and the fact that they always came to pass (even though they were countered by L) wasn’t something I was a big fan of.\
However, the plot begins to suffer down the line. It becomes a lot less interesting than it was at the beginning. The main motive of the series was lost somewhere in between and by the time it ended, it had long outlived almost everything entertaining about it. It seemed as if the author started too many plot lines to actually keep in pace with everything and to wrap everything properly for the end. And many of these plot lines, though very unique and creative, were unnecessary. It still had some good moments, but all in all it was much better when it started than when it ended.\
I did feel that they could have touched upon the Shinigami world a bit more. \
The characters are once again a very strong point of this anime.  The best characters of this anime are without a doubt Light and L. They both are among some of the best anime characters ever.\
The portrayal of L as the great detective, his mannerism and his nature make him a very good character. And the fact that the author paid attention to very minute things is pleasing to see. One instance in particular I would like to mention is the time when it is revealed that the world’s second best detective and the world’s third best detective are also aliases used by L. That is something that would actually be beneficial for the world’s greatest detective and also something that he is likely to think of.\
Light is again, a very good character. We can see how he transformed throughout the series very clearly. The portrayal of his psychopathic behavior is brilliant. Even in the end, when he was completely helpless, the way he reacted to being cornered was shown very well. And another brilliant aspect of his character is that we get to see how he could have been, had he not been corrupted by Death Note. It provides a contrast, something we can compare and clearly see the difference in.\
Near and Mello are two characters that enter nearly after two-thirds of the anime as successors of L. Mello is a pretty interesting character. He is different from all the other detectives in the series as he can be very reckless in order to get things done. Near is also a fine character but he was never someone who could replace L despite his pseudo-L behavior. It was entertaining to see him play with his toys though.\
Ryuk was a wasted potential in my opinion. In beginning he was fine, but as the series kept going on, his motivation seemed really lackluster. The rest of the support cast support the main characters fairly well. Light’s father was especially a good character, playing an-ever-the-hero police detective. He is the type of character we usually see as a protagonist.\
Coming to the art and animation, the dark tone was befitting for the series and provided a good touch to the setting. Other than that, it wasn’t something out of the ordinary. Sound track was another area where they did well, especially in the first half. The background music played in the scenes where L and Light do their plotting and execution was perfect. But later on the same BGM was used on scenes that weren’t really suited for it, making both the BGM and the scene look really cheesy.\
[Conclusion]\
Death Note is a very good anime, although it could have been a lot better had it not been for the lull in its last third. Being lackluster in the end leaves a bad taste and is a lot more detrimental to a show than being lackluster in the beginning.\
That said, it is one of the best anime ever made and is recommended for everyone, whether you like anime or not.\
[Key Points]\
+ An entertaining and immersive plot.\
+ Characters are well written.\
+ The atmosphere  and suspense is very well developed.\
–  Story is lackluster towards the end.\

    I have to say, after finishing the show yesterday, I couldn't reflect accurately upon what I had just seen. It was an amazing show that made me feel like I had taken a spectacular journey in only 37 short episodes. The last 10 episodes aren't as thrilling as I had hoped perhaps, but still, looking back on this journey I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. \
Even the last 10 episodes gave a necessary conclusion to a show that I think many of us didn't want to see end. My only wish for this show that kept it from being a 10,\
          \
        is that the lore wasn't explored enough. Certain elements of the show lacked depth, where it could have gone into detail and really raised the bar on storytelling in anime as a genre.\
Enjoyment was 10/10\
But objectively, I can't quite call this 10. Still, a must-see if there was one in this medium.\

    Death Note is one of the mainstream animes that people who start watching anime will typically try and avoid due to this case, but it is an anime that is mainstream for a reason. Many people have heard of it even if they do not watch anime and many people who don't watch anime have even seen it. For people who do not like anime and typically steer away from it quite often enjoy Death Note due to is fascinating characters and story line.\
Death Note has an amazing story line that keeps people watching and keeps people needing to see what happens next. The characters\
          \
        are all so well thought out and each have their own personality and so much detail has been put into each and every one of them. \
L being my personal favourite, his voice, the way he looks at certain things, the way he sits and stands and eats and his whole persona in general is just an outstanding character to watch on screen. Light was another very interesting character. Seeing the way he changes as a person in just 37 episodes is quite amazing to see. Not only these two but all the other charcters are fascinating.\
The art style is really nice to look at and the sound quality is quite good as well.\
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime. Even if it took me longer to watch, when I was watching it it was very interesting and I would definitly recommend this anime to anyone who is just begining to watch anime.\

    In my opinion, Death Note is an anime every anime lover should watch or at least try watching at one point. I’ll try to make this straight to the point and not too long, if it’s still too long just go ahead and skip to the conclusion, haha. \
STORY: 7\
The plot is very easy to understand and follow, from the very start of the anime. Not only that, it’ll keep you wanting more. At the end of each episode, I found myself continuously clicking the next episode and then the next, and then the next. So, I was in LOVE with the first portion of\
          \
        this anime. However, at the last ten episodes it goes from this amazing anime to just… ‘eh’. I can’t go too in depth of why this happened without spoiling it, but the story didn’t have that cunningness it did, and it felt half-assed. \
CHARACTER: 8\
L was amazing, period. I loved his character and the quirks he had. Something in Death Note that is interesting is that even characters I despised (*couth* Misa), I felt like they all had an important role in the anime, there wasn’t a character that made me bored. Personally, I didn’t have a problem with Near or Mello but you might absolutely hate him haha. Also, not any character development really, so keep that in mind.  \
SOUND: 8\
I think the OP’s and endings worked well! At least in my opinion, but if you hate heavy metal then there’s a high likelihood that you’ll be turned off by the openings. The voice acting is good, no complaints from me on the dub either. I personally preferred sub (you definitely need to watch the chip scene in the dub though!) Background music can get a bit too dramatic sometimes though, to the point where I found myself dying laughing.\
ART: 10\
The animation in Death Note is more realistic than some of the animes with super dramatic features, which I think fit this anime perfectly.  The backgrounds/scenery were pretty sick too. No complaints here!\
ENJOYMENT: 6\
I only gave this section a 6 because of the last 10 or so episodes, because I feel like they could've been much better. \
CONCLUSION: \
Just go watch it, but don’t go expecting this to be ‘the beST THING IN THE WORLD!!11’ like some people say and you’ll have a blast watching this anime! \
[This was my first review so hopefully it wasn’t too crappy haha]\

    CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS\
Death Note, Death Note, Death Note. I can't even remember the number of people who had suggested this anime, and claimed this to be the best of them all. Fair enough, I gave it a watch. Dropped it the first time after 20 episodes, can't really explain why. That was a few years back; maybe I wasn't ready for such genres yet, as I, like every other adolescent boy, was happy watching typical mainstream shounen.\
So, after improving my anime knowledge over the years, I finally decided to give it a second chance. This time around, the impression it has left me is slightly\
          \
        better.\
The story tells us of Yagami Light, who obtained a supernatural notebook, the Death Note, to kill the evil and crooked, in order to establish a perfect world free of crime and suffering. The protagonist, or rather antagonist based on how you see him, is pit against this genius mysterious young detective, L, who had never failed to solve even the toughest of all cases. So Kira (Light) vs. L , who will come out on top?\
PROS:\
1. The concept itself is pretty appealing and new. I mean think of it, a Death Note, which can kill people by simply writing a name in it!\
2. Shinigami (God of Death). 'nuff said.\
3. Yagami Light and L. Both the protagonist and antagonist (or vice versa depending on personal opinion), are great. Smart, ruthless, with a strong sense of justice, it can be said that they are two faces of the same coin. Brilliantly sketched with amazing voice acting, you will come to appreciate the sheer brilliance of these two characters.\
4. Pace. Neither too fast, nor too slow, each episode has a lot of material to be absorbed.\
5. Story. No loopholes whatsoever. Be prepared to get your mind fucked, with the sheer amount of plot twist after plot twist. It will make you curious, and wanting to watch the next episode.\
6. Sound. The opening and closing soundtracks were absolutely stunning. Apart from that, the sound effects throughout the anime gave it an eerie atmosphere.\
7. Suspense. It's full of it. Even till the end, the mysteries surrounding L have not been fully revealed.\
\
CONS:\
1. Some characters might have needed a bit more to them, as they felt empty, and served mainly cameos.\
2. The story fell off in the second arc. Felt slightly rushed, with the plot becoming more apparent and less interesting. A bit disappointing, honestly, especially because of the way it had built up the first part.\
3. Following the time skip, Light's smart acumen seemed to have had a major setback. You'll begin to question some of the decisions he makes later on. You can say he had become careless.\
4. L's successor(s) were not that intriguing to watch. They could have used a bit more development, if they were to be projected as successors to the almighty L.\
\
Overall, the anime was fairly decent, and a joy to watch. Was it a masterpiece? Not in my eyes; I can name a fair few anime that have been better, from my limited knowledge of anime so far. Is it overhyped / overrated? Maybe, maybe not, depending on how you view it, and how you enjoyed it. For me personally, Death Note was unique, but not epic.\

    This was the first anime I ever watched, so in no way am I an anime expert considering I still haven't seen enough to consider myself an expert. However, you do not need to be an expert or even an avid anime watcher to appreciate this piece of art. This is a perfect gateway anime, or even for someone who has seen hundreds of anime. The art is great, the opening song (the first version) is amazing, but the most amazing thing are the characters and plot. Each character is so compelling and have such strong personalities, you find yourself caring for all of them.\
          \
        And of course the entire premise of the show is great, especially if you are a fan of the mystery and thriller genres like myself. This anime is in no way overrated, and it deserves all the praise it gets. \

    \"Death Note\". The name itself is used as the gold standard for greatness in Anime. To say \"Death Note is a must see for Anime fans\" is like saying that \"Oxygen is a must breath for human beings\". I don't doubt it's greatness. But, I don't think it's perfect. \
The show is as well written as any TV show to date (that includes all TV shows) and it features characters that have transcended the Anime world and are now part of pop culture itself. I didn't need to see the show to know who L or Light Yagami were. And a lot of others are\
          \
        the same way. They may not know Anime, but they know \"Death Note\" is good (or at least insanely popular). \
The art itself is very good, but it doesn't need to blow you away with visuals when the plot has your heart beating a mile a minute and I should mention that this may be the most binge-worthy show in Anime history. If you're going to watch this show, get some food, some caffeine, some privacy, turn off all phones, and just watch. You'll thank me in the morning.\
The Sub vs. Dub conversation is something of a draw. I think it's a mix especially when it comes to the two main characters. I like Mamoru Miyano's performance as Light, but L was done better by Alessandro Juliani in the English dub. Overall, I'd say the Japanese cast was better, but not by much. \
Now, why after all that praise is the show not perfect? Well, I think the show gets a lot of accolades due to the audience that watches it. For most, after they're done with Pokemon, DBZ, Naruto, etc. their tastes develop and almost all immediately go for \"Death Note\" and get blown away by it's superior quality. For the rest, \"Death Note\" simply *is* their first dive into Anime and therefore all future shows they watch will be judged up against it. \
I myself waited until the hype had died down and watched many other shows before \"Death Note\". And I think it's great... until you get to Episode 25. The show by then had run it's course. The ride was over. Then, we get taken on another one. It took us to the finish line and while it certainly wasn't bad, but was a slow and steady decline. I wasn't wowed by the ending and was more glad that it was over rather than ecstatic about the journey I had been on.\
Reviewing this show is an exercise in futility. Everyone has. My opinion is probably the same as thousands of others. I think it's a touch overrated and suffers from a second-half slump. But, make no mistake about it, this is a truly great TV show and not just from an Anime stand point. Anime fans must watch it and form their own opinion. TV fans should just watch it because it's better than 75% of what ever else is on right now. Cheers! \

    Before I begin my review, I'll tell you a funny story on how I got into this show and started getting more into Anime. I follow one of my favorite YouTubers named \"Vannamelon\" (vannananabanana on MyAnimeList) on Twitter, and I knew she loved anime, so I asked for a recommendation, and she said her favorite was \"Death Note\", so I ended up buying the complete series on Blu Ray and once I put the first disc in, I was hooked. Too hooked; like I want to buy the manga, live action films, director's cuts, etc. Thanks a lot, Vanna... ;)\
\"Death Note\" shouldn't just be known\
          \
        to people who watch Anime, I think this is a show that mainstream audiences should watch. Uh oh, I think I may have made a mistake in saying that; now everyone will be hooked on, and it won't have that handful of fans anymore... I compare this show to \"Breaking Bad\", where both shows almost deal with the same kind of main character.\
The show follows a high school student named Light Yagami, who one day after school finds a notebook lying around the school area that reads \"Death Note\" on the cover. Once he touches the notebook, he happens to see a devil-ish creature known as a Shinigami, named Ryuk. No one can see or hear Ryuk but Light, unless someone else touches the notebook. This creature reveals to Light that this notebook was misplaced in his world, and accidentally ended up in the human world, and is now in the possession of Light's.\
This notebook turns out to be a deadly weapon as writing a single person's name in the notebook, will lead to a certain death to that person in 40 seconds. That person can either die of a heart attack if the name is only written, or that person can die in another way if that certain death was written right next to their name. Light uses this as an advantage to try to make the world a better place and eliminates every criminal near his hometown, and later follows up with every criminal around the world.\
The world is astonished by this; as governments from all around the world are trying to figure out what's causing these deaths, as they feel some God or Devil is doing this. Internet and the media give this God or Devil a name called \"Kira\", and they happily track all of the victims that have been killed by Light. A strange, yet unique individual known only as \"L\", gets hired by the government to try to track down Kira and end this once and for all.\
This show takes a lot of twists and turns along the way, while keeping you moving throughout. All of the characters are so clever that you never know what they're gonna do next. It's so addicting, you'll binge watch it nonstop and you'll be asking for more. And the animation is so good for an anime, it just keeps moving in areas like you're watching a live action movie.\
\"Death Note\" will keep you guessing and make you entertained throughout. And whether you love or hate the characters in the show, it's hard not to admit that they are smart and clever. This show made me get hooked onto Anime even more, and I loved every single minute of every episode.\

    Death note is an all time classic and one of the best and most beloved anime ever. The story follows the high school student Light Yagami who loathes the world since it is filled with criminals and the shinigami (God of death) Ryuk who is bored of the shinigami lifestyle. Light discovers a mysterious notebook called the Death Note that says that if you write the name of a person and picture their face in your mind that person will die within 60 seconds. Doubting it's a prank, Light tests it twice and is convinced it's real after both people died. He then meets Ryuk\
          \
        who tells him he dropped the notebook to stir up events in the human world. Light states that he'll use the Death Note to create a criminal free world and be the God of that world. Eventually, the police starts realizing that the series of criminal deaths isn't a coincidence and hire the master detective L to catch the cause of the deaths.\
The animation of the series is brilliant and low saturated colors are often used to enhance the tone of the series. The soundtrack is arguably the best anime soundtrack of all time. All characters are brilliantly designed and have clear motives. The anime is packed with plot twists and drama that'll keep you hooked most of the time. Death Note definitely deserves all the praise it gets even though it may contain minor weaknesses.\

    I have to admit, in a good way, that it wasn't what I was expecting. Death Note has a pretty big score on MAL, it's also palced no.1 on Most Popular Anime and I kind of can understand why it is\
Story:\
In my opinion it has a great foundation for a great story although it became a bit predictable what would happen in the end when it started getting closer to it. I did get a bit disappointed because I think it started with a great energy and a great intensity, specially for this theme, but after a certain character died, I think the intensity died\
          \
        down quite a lot, it started getting intense again only after two other characters came and where well in there way on the investigation, I don't know the exact number of episodes but I would say around 5 to possibly 6 episodes without that intensity that had pulled me in, when it started again, that's when I was left with two possibilities of what would happpen and it came true, I wasn't expecting it to be the way that it was, but I was expecting it to happen.\
Art:\
I thought it had a good art, not my favourite kind but I think for the theme/story it matched very well, so that's why I'm giving it an 8.\
Sound:\
Personally, it didn't have an ost or endings or opening that I really liked, doesn't mean it didn't matched to anime though, because it did and I think very well\
Character:\
I don't think the characters had a big development, I do think that they were already so developed by their inteligence that the only think that could happen was the most inteligent characters \"facing each other off\" with the help of the supporting characters, but no big development for any of them, although there was one of the supporting characters at the end making a huge turn that I was not expecting, even if it was out of rage or fear or watever I can clearly say that I was expecting everyone else to do what he did, except him, I was also very disappointed with Light I considered him one of my favourites along with L, but Light ended up disappointing me, not because he's the main character so he has to win everything, but because of the position he ended up putting everyone around him in.\
Enjoyment and Overall:\
I don't think it was a waste of time, in fact I quite liked it, that's why I gave it an 8 even in my score, like I said in the begining it wasn't what I was expecting and I do mean this in a good way, I think it's worth a shot watching it, but you do have to be ready for a very dark atmosphere which is only natural, after all the main theme is death itself.\

    *Light spoilers*\
Death Note really brought something intriguing to savor in the anime universe: a notebook that can kill people. The concept must be appealing to most demographics who crave enjoyment. Once the underlying theme is set, the other designs fall naturally into place. Such is the case with Death Note.\
It started with lots of promise, with two geniuses facing off against each other with the 'Shinigami' providing added swirl to the intensity. Its a lot like Sherlock vs Moriarty and I enjoyed every minute of their logical reasoning which took place at a speed faster than any normal human. The first 3/4ths of the series\
          \
        was seriously interesting and I was certain to give it a 10/10.\
However due to some crucial and frankly outrageous plot twists towards the 3/4th mark, i felt disenchanted and disconnected from the anime. The rest of the anime went by without inciting any major interest and I was just glad when it was over. Sherlock vs Moriarty came to an abrupt and unwelcome stop and that frankly killed the series for me. Even though the ending compared to the overall setting of the story was satisfying, the experience was marred by those defining plot twists that left me with something close to a bad taste in the mouth. \
Soundtrack was varied in intensity and theme and was welcome most of the time. The animation was pretty decent, with the cold color saturation lending credit to the darkness of the anime. Character development was top notch, with all the characters getting major screen time and backgrounds.\
Overall, Death Note is an excellent way to discover the dark side of Seinen genre,with its dark and morbid setting sure to excite your mind. Lots of dramatic writing animations which certainly didn't feel cheesy. ;)\

    Death Note... ah yeah... Death Note didn't really go down so well. \
The simplest way to put it is that it's about two high school then college kids who attempt to outwit each other in games of strategic internet keyboarding. \
Right! Sounds like MAL eh BA DUM TISHHHHHHH\
Ok sorry. \
Anyway, the biggest thing to note about Death Note is that like everything happens in the  first few episodes. In that span we go from someone who has the power of life and death over all kinds of people and what that might entail to a cat and mouse game between an ace detective and\
          \
        a clever high school student. \
The problem though is that it became kinda hard care about either one of them after a certain point, they admit at certain times simply to being bored, self-possessed, hating to lose, and otherwise go to great lengths to hurt and destroy the other (even if it means sacrificing other people in the process)\
In other words, it's hard to take the messages about justice and light and L very seriously once they've killed so many people.. textboxes and internet messages being their weapons of choice. \
It seems Death Note was animated by the notion that society is too permissive of crimes in general and indecisveness, but that's pretty backwards! No Death Note that's not right! It's often far too harsh. It seems to me even Light realized that, hence the severe interruption and transformation of his goals into one of simply evading capture.\
Light wanted to show that he wasn't afraid to take a stand, but I get the sense he also kind of realized he was going too far at times.... or maybe he just wanted to show he was capable of these acts and it would take someone like L to stop him. \
One way or another, Death Note just wasn't very enjoyable, it had the back and forth of something like Dragon Ball Z but without any of that extra-intensity solar flare chaos that DBZ can summon out of nowhere, no Kamehyahya, just, texts and emails. \
The fact is, Death Note really amounted to initially a kind of extreme moral system, if you are guilty of a crime, and in a justice system of some kind, anywhere around the world basically, you deserve to die. If you aren't, you don't, it's a strange concept really, I don't know if that's what they were saying.. but that's what it seemed like. \
Really,though,  instead of Death Note, you could just watch a good Batman movie or something and watch the villains go at it because that's more or less what  DN is all about. \
But I'm not going to pass judgment so harshly in this form of live or die in the way of Light and L, right? RIGHT.\
In fact, Death Note was kind of fun at times! I think once it moved away from Light and L and big struggle it was just about like sillier stuff like L's addiction to candy (something I can definitely relate to mwaha. er ^_^)\
That would be simply taking Death Note's messages a bit too seriously, the rather frequently false idea that everything rises and falls on that brilliant chess play, instead I would say it wasn't super exciting, but not the least fun, just, a 5. \

    –NO SPOILERS–\
First of all I have to say that this was my second anime (after DB/DBZ, so basically you could say the first real one), so I might be a little partial, but if I am, then so is everyone else here. This anime is in my opinion in its own league, and very few animes I watched came even close to it after the pinky cloud flew away after watching them.\
One thing you must know though: if you're looking for action, move along, seriously, now is not the time to watch it (and be let down because of you anticipation), but when you feel\
          \
        like using your brain while watching something you MUST get back to it.\
Without giving anything away the story is about the \"detective war\" of two similar and yet incredibly different minds. The fight is going on behind the scenes, and you can never know who will win, until in the end someone eventually does.\
The best thing besides the brain-factor is the two main characters. I'm sure you will find yourself totally supporting one and hating the other, but it's entirely up to you who you're cheering for, both of them have understandable motivation. It's even possible to cheer for one, and then change your mind as the story develops, it happened to me (oddly enough not during the story, but after my first watch).\
I guess I didn't say anything useful, but seriously, there is no way to tell you guys anything that isn't going to spoil something. All in all, if you want some smart entertainment and this wasn't the first anime you've watched, then by all means go for it, you're not going to regret it!\

-the misa character can be quite the mood-killer...\
-the near character just seemed like a pointless repetition...\
-the shinigamis are just... ugly...\
now that those minor bugs of mine are out of the way lets get to the positive side;\
-love the sort of *battle of the geniuses* theme. if you really pay attention there are so many little details to the plot that make it un-fold into a wonderful mystery-detective sort of thing.\
-i'm quite the fan of the very dark, psychological drama\
          \
        shows, and this show is very very dark, and very very psychological...\
-in most shows you kinda know what you want to happen in the end, like if it's a love-polygon you already know who you want the main character to hook-up with in the end... with death note, i had no idea what i wanted to happen, i was clueless to it, which meant that what ever turn the show took nothing ever phased me and made me say \"noooo not that!\" ... i suppose this is a great way to get swept away into the story\
-this show is great in the anti-hero department, it really puts you inside the head of a criminal\
so those are all my positive and negative comments, now down to regulation;\
-story : though the story is somewhat of a cliche *some guy goes crazy with power* it's also very well-done. sort of like if i took the *saving the princess from the dragon* cliche and fleshed it out, and gave it a very refreshing style, then turned it into the best fantasy adventure story you ever heard. : 9\
-art : the art was obviously very high-quality, though some of the facial expressions seemed very odd to me, but i assume this was to add emphases. i really liked a lot of the things they would do with the art to effect the mood, like giving everything the red tint, or whenever light was giving off that *evil* aura they would turn his eyes bright red. : 8\
-sound : in regards to voices i had watched the dubbed version. i remember thinking a lot of lights little sister's lines sounded kinda forced, but she doesn't talk very much anyway so it's not a big deal. other than that i thought it had very well-done dubs. *i watched the first few episodes with subs, i liked the dubs better =/ that's an opinionated matter though*. in regards to music i was really pretty oblivious to it. i didn't really think it was anything special that i would go and get the ost for, but it certainly wasn't bad and there were plenty of neat tracks. : 7\
-character : this is certainly the most \"wow\" department. this show does such a wonderful job with interesting characters and as i said before really puts you inside their head. i find it hard to put it into any other words than \"wow\" ... : 10\
-enjoyment : i flew through this series in two days and just couldn't get enough of it, the only reason it loses a point here is because the second arc seemed like repetition...  : 9\
-overall : 10\
* i feel bad when i find myself giving something such a high grade... but ... i tried as hard as i could to not be \"that die-hard fan\" but it really is just *that good* ...* so definitely, definitely give this show a try if you haven't already!\

    I  asked someone for a great psychological anime like Serial Experiments Lain and this was there first recommendation. The series is very enjoyable but have some tranquillizers or beer on hand because the suspense never lets up.\
The first half of the series (L's Arc) is masterfully done. L's Arc definately deserves all 10's. I felt it was on par with a Robert Ludlum novel (not the movies). The constant intellectual attacks and re-posts were very believable and had me in astonishment the whole time. The characters are all developed very well; there are characters to love and characters to hate. The story is well\
          \
        developed and thought out as well.\
The ending arc of the series was really not on the same level. The new characters are not developed well (hence the 7). The intellect was diluted down into a lot of 'I knew you'd do that, so I did this'... 'Well I knew you'd do that in response to what I did, so I did this'... I can only take so much of that before I ached for the strong foundations that were given earlier in the series (hence the 7 in story). Even though the traps didn't have as strong of supporting evidence the suspense was still there. But I really wish that L's Arc either continued to the end or that the ending arc was comparable to L... even though the new characters admit they are not as intelligent as L; that doesn't mean the storyline's depth and complexity should slack off as well.\
The art is great and what you've come to expect from anime.\
Music is great and the opening sequence of the first half is awesome. However, the opening sequence of the second half is a bit to much Death Metal for my liking.\
I enjoyed this anime very much but I thought the last Arc and ending could have been much better given the artful execution of the earlier storyline.\

    There are many paradigms about who the real heroes of the truth. Some say he is the person who has super strength, he is a policeman, he is a soldier, he was a detective, he was the one who makes the rules, people are intelligent or even a Shinigami (death god). Anime Death Note will provide a bit of views on how it is we live to see it.\
Death Note is so phenomenal even ranked first in the MAL in the category \"Most Popular\" and even raised in the Live Action is not only that even many countries that dubing. It is undeniable anime is\
          \
        categorized as \"Genius\" because the intelligence of the author makes this anime is unpredictable plot, unpredictable characters, and so many mysteries that are hard to solve because we will be faced with how to think Yagami Light (main character) and the action of Lewlitt. L\
Interesting from this anime is a battle between Kira (Light Yagami) and L (Lewlitt.L) where most of the anime fight scenes are always drawn with super fights or power struggles. But in the Death Note clashing their intelligence and strategies that could be called Psy War battle. The greatness of the Death Note is to invite the audience to think and reveal what is actually planned by Kira.\
The greatness of the Death Note is not only of the characters rather than story development. Where it all began with just a book in which death by writing their name and remember the person face will have a heart attack and die within 10 seconds. But the authors know that just like that only it will be boring so he adds another function of the book.\
Story: 10/10\
Starting from Light Yagami (the protagonist) finds a book that falls from the sky and the words \"Death Note\" and he read a function of the book and take a joke, but when he tried did indeed occur. At first I thought the story dull because the protagonist is only human and he only kills bad guys in television and newspapers. But the arrival of L and Light began to challenge the extraordinary scene occurred. They started fighting each other in strategies where L and Light attacks persist. I was challenged to continue watching this anime because there is always a different story in each episode and the unexpected surprises arise that make this anime is not boring.\
Reminiscent of the phenomenal cartoon \"Tom and Jerry\". Where L is the figure of Tom who pursue and make a trap for the Light (Jerry), but Light has always escaped the trap and eventually won the battle and make L Light dies in his lap and managed to seize power.\
There are more than the value of this anime that is where the Shinigami who described horrific and feared by humans because he could kill anyone he liked. However, because of the ingenuity and foresight of Light in reading situations to know how to beat him and prove Shinigami will sacrifice himself. From this we can deduce the strong man is not necessarily invincible\
Art: 9/10\
It is no doubt there are so many fans Yagami Light from among the girls due to the design of the character Light Yagami perfect where he is depicted with tall, big, handsome, and quiet. If you look at the overall design, there is no significant difference in the general anime other, because it takes place in the present so there was no imagination about the changing environment and natural surroundings. But what makes a plus here is the design of successful Shinigami character portrayed by the figure and the creepy image of the world also adds to the greatness of the Shinigami of the corner of the graphic arts ..\
Sound: 7/10\
To judge by their own terms of Sound, Death Note anime is not so prominent because it only focused on the terms of the story alone. We can only hear the opening and ending soundtrack of music genre \"Rock\"\
Character: 8/10\
Death Note's success is inseparable from the success of the characters in the play. Light is plotted as it is known to be a smart guy, cunning, ambitious calm and managed to play all the better. Lewllit who plotted a smart guy, a perfectionist, cool and mysterious also successfully played its role well. But it was a pity only two characters that stand out while others like a walk-on. Though there are two main characters, namely N, and Misa, but I think that guy looks like a normal N that was predictable character and just continue the fight L and Misa just an ordinary girl without having a characteristic, she is only pursuing Light and willing to do anything only.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Not for one moment my eyes off of the TV screen while viewing the Death Note, because there are many mixed flavors ranging from the curious, guess the continuation of the story and wait for the final outcome of the story. Death Note anime was smart and train intelligence in scrutinizing each plot\
Overall: 9/10\
Most people say anime is only a spectacle for the \"Kid\" but Death Note is to prove that view wrong by proving that the anime could attract the attention of many people. Death Note the overall success of the mystery genre and Psychology. Come for you lovers of mystery series, watch this anime guaranteed no disappointment ^ ___ ^\

    Story:\
Well developed. Well written, and held consistency throughout the entire series. Character actions were consistent with their profile. Plot was well laid out. The story drops a little midway, but to me, it makes up that drop because of its consistency and idea. So maintains a 10.\
\
Art:\
Mature animations (not cartoony). Well fitted for the story.\
\
Sound:\
The BEST part! It was well chosen, and the added an extra dimension to the anime. \
The worst thing one could do to an anime (or any work) is to add a silly score to exciting/serious part or add a piece that interrupts the feel of the segment or exclude a\
          \
        musical piece leaving a lot of silence zones in between segments.\
\
Character: \
 As with the story, well developed. There isn't a part where I would say 'Why The ****, would he do that?' They are also a bit more believable as the strengths and flaws (e.g. arrogance, or intuition) are clearly shown.\
\
Enjoyment:\
Still watching it over every so often! Even got my mom watching piece of the beginning too. (She was wondering what I was watching) She commented that the plot was well written and even pointed out a few moral points like the fact that there would always be some downside (selling your soul kind of thing) to power attained like that, and the runaway-trolley thought experiment (is it right to kill some to save some). \
\
Overall:\
Overall, it's just interesting. I'd recommend it to anyone. Not kids though, which is probably why some people have it so low in their ratings. It's also a good idea not to take the story line too deep. It just entertainment. ^.^\

    Discussion:\
I'll start off by saying Death Note is among the most exciting television to watch. The confrontations between the characters are absolutely exhilarating. Even by their very first confrontation in the second episode, you can see that the two lead characters, Yagami Light and \"L\", are genius, devious, and at least partially insane. Yagami Light, who works under the public alias \"Kira\" to punish criminals with the Death Note, and \"L\", a world-renowned detective who has solved several cases previously deemed impossible, close in on each others true identities at an even pace throughout the series - a race that means death to the loser.\
          \
        The competition keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation of the next time they clash. It is a battle between genii with absolute ideals and the determination to realize them. The winner determines the fate of the world and neither will back down until the other is dead. As a psychological thriller, there is nothing that tops Death Note - it is a 37 episode duel that will completely blow your mind.\
And that's where I get to my main complaint for the show: that it is only a 37 episode duel. As a viewer, I took little away from this show beyond \"That was freaking epic.\" The characters were interesting in how they used their skills, knowledge, and resources to battle each other in the open world; however, very few characters compelled me to care about anything other than their elusive goals of 'changing the world'. Most problematically, the protagonist is absolutely impossible for me to empathize with. Of course, I was compelled to want Yagami Light to overcome obstacles for the sake of the show's continuation, but his lack of emotion and unsurmountable ego make him unlikeable, if not detestable. Other characters in the show besides Yagami Light, his primary opponent, and his 'love interest', seemed only to exist for the sake of furthering the plot. Although I wanted to empathize with many of the minor characters, they were never shown in scenes which did not relate ultimately to the duel between Yagami Light and L. Although the plot of the story is amazing, and it is clear that a lot of effort went into developing it, its disregard for the stories of characters besides Light and L, and the unpalatableness of the former, killed a lot of its character value.\
The most interesting characters by far are the detectives working against Light. The trio headed by L, later followed by Near and Mello, are given a good deal of attention by the story. I personally found Mello to be the most interesting of the three, because unlike the other two, he appeared to be driven at least partially by emotion. His motives are not bound by his opinion on the fate of the world as much as L and Near, and his personality is more compelling because it isn't made up entirely of righteous logic. As for Near, there isn't much to say, other than that he has awesome hair. His character growth is extremely stunted by the fact that he is an inferior L - this was explicitly stated in the show. In most respects, he and L are basically the same person, except L has a more interesting relationship with the actual Kira. I honestly am not sure why it was necessary to bring Near into the show. L himself is an interesting enough character. His brilliance and creativity matches, if it doesn't exceed, Yagami Light's, and every scene with the two of them present is filled with tension. He is one of the first to become suspicious of Light, and as they begin to know each other in-person (under pseudonyms), he becomes very attached to the idea that Light is Kira. I found this interesting because it seemed to imply that L wanted Light to be the one person that could rival his intelligence, and there is definitely a rivalry appreciation between the two of them. Although L has no motives other than catching Kira, and \"because it's his job\" isn't a very compelling motive on its own, his interest in the case, which continuously grows with personal investment, makes his character more dynamic than anyone else in the show.\
Beyond L and Mello, very few characters are compelling at all. Among them, the chief of the police force stands out thanks to his interesting relationship with Yagami Light. Though his motives throughout the entire show are somewhat confusing. Mostly it seems that he remains diligent on catching the real Kira because he doesn't want to believe they are actually Light. Matsuda is an curious character because he isn't entirely sure of how he feels about Kira's methods, but he nonetheless continues to pursue him out of duty. Matsuda is also one of the only dynamic characters. Perhaps the biggest qualm I have about characters in this show is that with the exception of Misora Naomi, there are almost no strong female characters. Misora joins the search for Kira out of personal vendetta, and I thought her arc was among the most interesting in the story. However, Death Note has a tendency to mitigate plots which are not directly related to the battle between L and Light. Although she could have been a very intriguing character, her presence is reduced to a plot device by the need to focus the story on Kira and the investigator trio.\
This segues directly to my next criticism: this show is ridiculously sexist. And I don't mean in the passive anti-feminist way; it isn't that there is an absence of strong female characters, it's that major female characters are not given any motives which are not based on impulsive emotionality. The most notable female character, Misa, could have been very interesting. After Kira eliminates the criminals who murdered her parents, Misa begins to seek the actual Kira. What's off about her character is that after meeting Yagami Light, she instantly falls hopelessly in love with him. There's almost no sense to it, because Light shows no emotion at all and has nothing to offer (other than being Kira). No one can pretend to understand how love works, but I can say with certainty that it's not the way Death Note makes it out. Love at first sight is possible, but the way it's written for Misa is absurdly disempowering and unrealistic. Her earnesty is at least interesting in the contrast it sets with the rest of the show, but that's only because all most characters are nearly completely in control of their emotions. What I find most problematic is that her disposition to emotion is cast as a weakness which basically can't be helped because she's a woman. On some level, it's even set as comic relief, which bothers me further. In a show where the excitement is built off of many characters being extremely sharp and logical, why is it that the one major female character is being made fun for lacking such rational abilities? The writing is consciously sexist, and that detracts from my enjoyment of it. Misa could have been a much more intriguing character if she was given some power over her own emotions.\
All of this could add up to at least a decent score for characters in the show if there was just one more element: a sympathetic protagonist. But the fact is that I have no emotional attachment to Yagami Light. Perhaps that's biased partially because of my opinion on the death penalty, and not everyone will share the exact same detachment from him as I do; however, I think it was an oversight in the writing that there was no one worth rooting for if you weren't a follower of Kira. Rooting for the investigator trio could have been made more of an option, but the show isn't told told from their perspective as often and the writing encourages you to root for Yagami Light much more frequently. However, it wouldn't be fair to say I disliked Light only because of his ideals. Personality goes beyond beliefs, and what really matters is who the person is. And Yagami Light is a complete dick. He has absolutely no regard for anyone else's emotions or life and is self-righteous to the point of self-deification. He manipulates and uses people, won't hesitate to kill anyone who poses a potential threat to him, and has no problem whatsoever lying to all of his friends and family about his identity. I won't say that he wasn't justified in taking on the burden of becoming a god for the sake of a more peaceful world, because it is definitely a sacrifice he made at least under the pretense of selflessness. However, this part of his psychology was not sufficiently explored. If he was transformed, then what was that process? I would have liked to know more about the Yagami Light from before he became Kira - although this element is not left out of the anime, the character development it could have created was not capitalized upon, and thus Light/Kira remained a shallow character throughout the series. Characters that develop megalomania can be very interesting if their transformation is believable and sympathetic, but there is an almost complete lack of an outside perspective to make this possible.\
As for the plot, the story moves along pretty smoothly throughout the first season. Everything is driven by the conflict between Yagami Light and L. That being said, episodes which involve Light and his opponent are extremely interesting, while those absent of such conflict were pretty bland. It would seem I'm contradicting myself, because I've complained above that minor characters do not get enough attention. The fact is that they do get attention, but only as pawns of Kira and/or L. It is these episodes, which do not involve direct conflict between the masterminds, but layered ventriloquism, that cause the show to fall into a temporary rut from time to time. There is a period of three or four episodes that I found pretty tedious towards the middle of the series. During that arc, there is literally no direct confrontation between L and Kira, only very elaborate maneuvering by both sides which isn't even explained until after the arc has passed. After this arc, the excitement again escalates, but then there is an abrupt break in the story that throws off its momentum. The second season is interesting in its own regard, but the head-to-head confrontations become less exciting. The intensity resumes for the last few episodes of the series, and the plays made by each side are absolutely thrilling. Although I disliked the taste the ending left in my mouth, the thrill factor in its conclusion is very well done.\
Ultimately, what is there to learn from the story of Death Note? I can't say it has very much literary value. The one moral that stands out strong is fairly obvious, and it feels a bit like they're beating a dead horse the entire time: anyone who uses a Death Note will end up without happiness. I thought this theme was occasionally handled quite well, while at times it was just sort of left on the burner and not given any special attention. I believe the writer of the original manga said that he did not intend for there to be any themes in the text, so it doesn't surprise me that there are no other takeaways. While you can have pulp fiction be very exciting and enjoyable, a disregard for the message that a piece of art would convey can severely detract from one's appreciation of the series. I found the ending very unsettling because it was unclear what the author was trying to say with everyone's final fate. Ambiguity can be interesting if it manages to leave the viewer with several theories about the meaning of it all; however, it's downright depressing to not have any theories to go on. If you don't care about taking messages away from an anime, you should disregard this section. Death Note is extremely exciting, but all that I took away from watching it was a severe drop in my faith in humanity, and if you decide to watch the show, you'll understand why.\
\
The Verdict:\
I give my reviews out of 100 points. For this purpose I divide the final verdict into 10 categories, each allocated with 10 points. If you believe certain categories are more important to you than others, you can weight them accordingly to derive your personal review based on these observations of the show. \
Plot - The plot of the show is reason you should watch it. With the exception of the occasional breaks mentioned above, it moves along its timeline very smoothly. The order in which plot points are revealed is well done, the continuity is air-tight, and every twist in the storyline is a roller coaster. The main criticisms I have are that characters will occasional act unrealistically for the sake of the plot, and the story really loses steam whenever there is a cessation of direct confrontations between the detectives and Kira. This deserves an almost perfect score of 9.\
Characters - This is subject that I ended up talking about most in the paragraphs above. There are a few interesting characters in the show, and I particularly found L and Mello well-written. However, due to the perpetual disregard for characters not involved directly in the main plot, the use of many characters as devices in the plot rather than characters with human motives, blatant sexism, and lack of a sympathetic protagonist, this category earns a low score of 4.\
Emotional Investment - As explained above, it is easier to become emotionally involved with those trying to catch Kira than with Yagami Light. Since the plot pushes you to support Light and his actions are often reprehensible, it is hard to become emotionally involved at all. Any salvaging of this score is thanks to the other strong characters in this show who aren't completely emotionless. This is one of Death Note's weakest categories with 2.\
Action - Easily the best thing about this show. The action is exhilarating, and mind-games are incredible. Like I said, it's a 37 episode duel to the death, and it's... I think the proper term is \"freaking epic\". 10.\
Thought Provoking - This show definitely brings into question some very interesting issues. At the very core is the concept of the death penalty. The value of retribution, revenge, and pre-emptive measures, alongside what it means to take the life of another human being, were all analyzed to a degree. However, like any themes that could have been present in the story, these questions could have been teased out a lot more than they were. I can't deny that it brings into question all sorts of dichotomous ideals, and the concept of a Death Note in and of itself is a very intriguing thought experiment. I give this category a 7.\
Themes - Themes exist in Death Note more or less by happenstance, as stated by the author. The theme of 'No Rest for the Wicked' is heavily implied heavily by the nature of the Death Note. Megalomania and self-deification are obviously present, but they aren't discussed as motifs as much as plot developments. The concept of Love is used as a plot device, and the question of what it means to value someone else's happiness more than your own was briefly explored. However, the story was clearly written with the intention of being exciting, not literary. Things happen because it is necessary for the plot to be exciting, not because the author is trying to make a statement about anything. Major events in the plot feel unfulfilled because there is no purpose behind them - they're just events. This makes the otherwise fantastic story feel pointless, from a viewing perspective. Thus, I can only give this show a Themes score of 2.\
Emotional Direction - This show offers a pretty good emotional roller coaster. Even if there's no reason to care about Yagami Light, there are many moments are specifically written to make you feel fear, anxiety, excitement, happiness, remorse, heartbreak, and despair. It isn't outstandingly good at it, and there are many anime that do it better. However, it deserves a solid score of 7.\
Originality / Surprise Factor - The premise is fairly unique and there aren't a lot of shows that can do protagonist serial killer to the extent that Death Note does. Plot twists keep you guessing the whole time and the story seldom becomes predictable. I feel like I may be overselling it a little, but I was constantly surprised by the turns the show took. 8.\
Animation - The artwork is pretty good. I didn't find any of the human characters particularly attractive, but the designs of the Shinigami and their world were very cool. The image of a human's face successfully conveyed their character, which is always important. Action scenes were very well done, of course. Reactions were done extremely well - the facial expressions could tell the story even if you were watching the show on mute. Internal narratives for Kira and L were enhanced by depictions of each side in contrasting color schemes - Kira being Red and L being blue - which helped build tension and contrast their ideals. On occasion, it seemed the animators got a little too carried away in killing someone, and the instant replay effect was used more times than necessary. The artwork is overall good, but not outstanding. 7.\
Soundtrack - The background music used well to set the mood and build tension for the purposes of a scene; however, it became pretty repetitive as they used the same bgm in almost every episode. The first opening offers a nice insight to the psychology of the show, though you won't enjoy the second at all if metal/hardcore isn't your genre. The lyrics for both are relevant, and tend to say more than the dialogue ever does. I found some musical themes worth looking forward to. Others get old fast. Although the soundtrack seldom detracted from the experience, because of its repetition and simplicity, I give it a score of 6. \
\
All things balanced, I give Death Note a cumulative score of 62. This is the percentage derived by adding up the score of each of the categories with a scalar of 1; this is of course adaptable to what you value in an anime.\
Since 62 probably seems like a low score, I'll point out that I grade deconstructively, and even my favorite anime wouldn't get a perfect score. I very much enjoyed Death Note for the reasons explained above, but I will always be as critical as possible in my reviews. If you want something rich with literary value, this is not the anime for you. If you value plot, psychological thrill, and high stakes mind-games, you will probably enjoy Death Note. \

Death note... A compelling mellow anime that brings emotion towards every character in the story. Many of the characters bring such depression and sadness towards one another and at the same time, energetic political people. Light Yagami is a genius of a student in college and finds a notebook called \"Death Note\" on the floor, of his curiosity  he picks the mysterious book up and finds himself wondering what the book is. The book is the whole entire anime, if there was no book, there would be no interest in this story and the Shinigami's bring hilarity to the story. The mystery of\
          \
        the story is what Yagami does with the book, he is playing god in this show and can control peoples life with the book, only to lead them to death. The mellow tone of everyone brings the story into a more mysterious type of show and since the anime is about solving a case about the killer of all these weird cases is named \"Kira\", the story revolves around Kira and Yagami being a detective against the Kira, but also he himself is the Kira. I will have to say, since the start of this I was very interested and left with cliff hangers every time the episode ends.\
The story is very compelling with a lot of mystery and mellow tones towards everyone. It was great overall for a depressing but also cliff hanger story that was about death, the story also is graphic in death wise, but blood wise there's no gore.\
The art is very deep and sad, bringing out the cliff hangers and mystery to every episode in the show, if it didn't have such a dark tint of an art style, It would not be a good show overall.\
Sound, it's very technological and dark but in the 2000's, I would have to say  that the sound effects of the show are pitch perfect and nailed everything that needs to make background noise.\
Character wise, I'll have to say every character has a part in the story, some are used for background and other are main characters that are very different from others. \"L\" being one of the characters that is supposed to be the best detective in the world, has a very weird type of personality that is not like any other bureaucrat in the story. Yagami is a genius in the story and brings characters that are related with the government have mysterious types of traits like being afraid or being dead on a master of political power that strives to find justice and retribution.\
I very much enjoyed this anime because every episode was very well put for mystery and action. Each episode left me with a cliff hanger wanting me to watch more of this show, but sadly it has ended at 37 episodes.\
Overall, this anime is very well put together and has a good type of style to it, more of this type of style of anime would be hard to come by since none are as good as a mysterious type of action with super natural powers held all in a book, \"Death note.\" I will have to say that I would give this a 9 because I very much enjoyed ever part of this anime and would love to have more of this shown, sadly it has been ended.\

I am definitely in the minority with my opinion/review of this show it seems but let me try to justify why i disliked this show so much.\
Deathnote was an anime that could have been one of the greatest ever made yet it made incredibly poor decisions regarding key plot points (killing off certain characters) and had an ending that was extremely dissatisfying. The first season was magnificent all the way up until how it ended. The ending was horrifying as what happened should have been part of the conclusion of the series as a whole, not a first season\
          \
        imo. The events that happened (in particular a certain character being killed off) would have been acceptable if it had a bigger consequence on the plot. This particular character dying would have been acceptable if it was in conclusion of the story/show.\
Moving on to season two i was very skeptical how they would keep the show together and my worst fears were realized when the new characters introduced were extremely unlikable and out of place. The conclusion to the show was the final nail in the coffin, it felt like a big 'FU' to anyone watching the show.\
Overall Deathnote disappoints me so much. When i first started watching this show i was mesmerized by it but after finishing it i am disgusted by it :\\\

    This is my number 1 favorite anime. I re-watched it at least 3 times. \
When I first heard of this anime, I thought \"oh it's just another popular anime without much going on in there\". That was a very wrong assumption. Once I've given it a chance, I couldn't stop watching.\
Story: Amazing, original, outstanding. Whoever came up with the plot is a pure genius. There are no words to describe the atmosphere it gives while watching.\
It has many themes in it. \
If you love crime- this is for you. If you love mystery- this is for you. If you love philosophy, supernatural, comedy, horror, sad\

        stories- this is for you.\
Art: Outstanding. I can't get my eyes off the main characters. They are all well drawn. \
Sound: Awesome soundtrack for awesome anime. It delivers the right feeling for every single moment. \
Character: Just for creating Raito I'll give 10 out of 10. The rest of the characters are fine.\
Enjoyment: If there would be a new word for fun it would be Death Note.\
Overall: Perfect.\

    A never before seen, amazing anime. Truly a masterpiece. What can I say - the best and most honest thing that I can do for this anime is to give it a perfect score. And to write a fantastic review (as fantastic as I can). I mean, the story is unbelievable, like nothing you have ever imagined. It takes us to a place where anything can happen. The plot twists change every time and keep us hooked from the first minute. The art is so swift and smooth and has great quality of expressions that have been amazingly drawn. The songs are just great, simply\
          \
        well suited just for this anime and the background music is made to make us come to the edges of our seats with anticipation. We feel the same way the characters feel and it connects us with everything that happens in the scene.The characters are fantastic. I love L. The struggles, problems they have and how they face them are very different to each character. I enjoyed it to the fullest and am watching it again. Don't miss out on this anime. Trust me, you won't regret it. It's a brilliant anime. One of the best - superb!\

    What can I say about Death Note that hasnt already been said? Well when my friend told me to watch it I never expected that I would be watching a show of such incredible quality...\
Story: Death Note has definitely one of the BEST storylines I've ever seen in an anime, almost every single episode was very intense and incredible and would leave me wanting to see more. The plot twists thrown and the battles of intelligence between the two main characters was outstanding and the way they would try to regain control was definitely something worth watching. Sadly the last few episodes were not as\
          \
        good but they were still above average.\
Art: For being such a dark show Death Note's animation was REALLY well made and it was very detailed and neat. Ryuk's face always pops up in my mind every now and then, it was so well made! ^_^ The way the camera would some in the note writing scenes was also really good and fun to watch.\
Sound: I usually never pay attention to the soundtracks but this show definitely knew when to play the right songs at the right times, like when Light is writing names down and the evil music is playing, how can you not love that? Miyano Mamoru really outdid himself playing Light, and I'm a sucker for Aya so I also loved Misa >_>\
Character: This is IMO one of the best things on the show, Light vs L is definitely something that I will always remember, the epicness of it was just of the charts. Light has great personality change from his regular high school days to his slow turn into a more maniac character, Light is one of the best at being evil too. L was a character that had a more silly side but also a very serious and cool side when facing Kira. The other characters in the show are also developed quite nicely (how could I forget to mention Misa?)\
Enjoyment: Boy I had a blast watching this show, it left me almost sweating at times because of how intense the story and developments were. This show is definitely one of my favourites.\
Overall Death Note is an amazing show that EVERYONE should watch and not miss, the whole genius vs genius battles between Light and L are something outstanding and I dare say was something perfect. This is one show I definitely will never forget.\

    I thought a lot about this anime show. It really keeps you thinking. What would happen if you had the power of Death Note? How would you use it? What would happen if it fell into the wrong hands? Would everyone die? It remains a mystery to me.\
Story: 10/10\
The plot is great. It is about a student who one day saw a Death Note on the ground, dropped by a death god named Ryuk. He picks it up, and thought it was a mystery. Then he decided to try it out if it was for real. And after testing it out, and it actually does\
          \
        happen like what it said in the instructions, he got the most bizarre idea ever, that no one else would come up with. He decided to use the Death Note as a tool to execute all he deemed as criminals. He plays as a god, and wanted to create a \"New World.\" It's an outstanding story. I would totally want a Death Note.\
Art: 9/10\
The art is great, I liked how they drew Light, and you can really tell that he's gonna be up to no good when he smiles that evil smile and writes in his notebook. I didn't really like the way they drew L though, because of his messy hair and his posture. I also liked how they drew Near, really detective-like.\
Character: 8/10\
I liked Light Yagami the most, because I agree with his thinking. Don't judge me, people! The reason why I agree with him is because I don't believe in a world of cruelty and crime. The only part that I don't agree with him in is not giving them a second chance. But other than that, yes, exterminate all the bad guys! And also Misa... I didn't like her at all. She was a whiny baby who clung to Light all the time. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Overall, I really enjoyed Death Note, it makes you think about reality. If only the world was perfect, free of crime! If you had the power of Death Note, would you trade it for short lifespan? I really recommend this anime, it's an anime that's worth watching!\

    A little late in writing this review but that's OK.  What can I say about Death Note, this Anime is truly one of the best ever made in all of Anime history.  With it's excellent story and characters how can you not like it.  \
Story:\
Light Yagami is an ace student with great potential, but he is fed up with crime and evil in world.  When he finds a notebook called the 'Death Note', everything starts to change from him and the world around.  He soon learns that the notebook can be used to killed anyone who's name is written down\
          \
        with in the notebook.  Now Light has the power to get rid of the world of evil as he claims himself the 'God of the New World' and Kira, but as each criminal is killed one by one, the authorities send in the world's greatest detective L to solve the murders and caught the one know as Kira and put him to justice.  Now it's a game of cat and mouse to see witch one can caught who and rid him from world.\
Animation:\
The art is purely fantastic.  Each Character is draw perfectly like in the Manga and the background art truly does shine with the buildings and stretchers.  Some of the best that I've ever seen.  \
Sound:\
The music of Death Note is done really well with L's Theme and Kitai but sometimes the OST can be dull sometimes.\
Character:\
The Characters of Death Note are really fun to watch.  With the main cast of Light and L is a real treat and ever Matsuda is a good character (I'm serious).  As for the Shinigami's, I would say Ryuk was the best out of all of them, just beacuse he looks like a grim reaper. \
Enjoyment:\
The enjoyment scale of this Anime is very high.  With it's unexpected twists and excited story telling, I guarantee you'll love it.\
Overall:\
Final score, a solid 10 out of 10.  Death Note was one of the Animes that helped me become a Anime fan and it truly deserves a spot in the Anime-Manga Hall of Fame. \

    The premise is fantastic and up to about half of the show I was totally onboard and found it very entertaining. But then half way through, as is common in shonen anime, I'm not sure what happened, but it almost felt as though the show changed writers or something. It began introducing a lot of repetitions and the twists in the plot, which before seemed exciting, were just \"yet another\" chance for the author to show off how fantastic and amazingly intelligent the characters are. It became boring and I felt like we were just going round and round in circles watching the same thing\
          \
        without ever getting anywhere, just so the author could add a bunch more episodes to extend the longevity and excitement created around this series. I wish they would've just cut out the fillers and gotten to the point, as the idea of Death Note is really fantastic, but it lacks in its execution.\

    ~ No matter how gifted you are, you alone cannot change the world ~ (Death Note)\
Story: The world is full of injustices. From the beginning of time, strong has always preyed upon the weak. The young guns are full of hope and dreams. One of them is Yagami Light, a high schooler who had this desire to wipe out the evil from this world. Since his journey to become the \"god of the new world\" begins. \
It is a highly refined story which show two brilliant minds battling it out for what they believe. On one side it was Yagami Light who is killing criminals\
          \
        in the name of Justice. He believes world leaders failed to implement Justice in the world and he took it upon himself to do their dirty work. On the other side it was L who is renowned for his investigation skills. L believes that killing murderers is still a crime. The real evil is the power to kill people. No matter how you anyone use it, anything obtained by killing people can never bring true happiness.\
The story is narrated beautifully with plots one after the other. The story might seems to get a little dull after Yotsuba Arc starts. But it was only a setup for what is about to come. A part from that it was almost flawless for an anime. The most intriguing thing in this anime will be the back and forth cheap blows between Light and L. When L gets an inch closer to finding who is \"Kira\" (people gave the name to the culprit who is responsible for killing criminals), Light makes it a miles apart. The unpredictability is what will get you hooked up on this anime. The excitement never cease to end until the final episode. One of the things which makes it different from other animes is that the story was narrated from Yagami Light's view even though he is the villain!\
Emotion: Death Note never fails to put a smile in you face or makes you cry. It makes you jump from excitement. The unpredictability make sure that you would say \"Didn't see that coming\" like a million times. The emotion on your face will change along with the plot. Moreover the characters also depicts the emotion perfectly.\
Music/Sound: The background music suits well with the anime. It helps to generate the emotions perfectly. The background music plays a major role in telling a story and expressing feelings.\
Uniqueness: As aforementioned, Uniqueness is one of the major thing to look for in this anime. It is pretty unique from your everyday anime. Most importantly it has the \"IT\" Factor which will make you hungrier for more and more. The Ending of the anime is also very good. Since no spoilers is included, you have to watch and see the difference between most of the anime and Death Note.\
Own View: I really enjoyed this anime. I don’t usually like dark animes but Death Note made my face glued to the screen until I finished all the episodes. And most of all, this is my favorite anime so far. So I highly recommend anyone who watches anime to check this masterpiece. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.\

    It was a good anime, that's about it. \
I enjoyed my time with the anime, however it felt like the premise of the Death Note could only keep my interests for so long. It overstayed its welcome, and the characters that felt like uninteresting side characters stayed along as uninteresting main characters.  The series should have been shorter and the characters more flushed out. \
The music and art worked very well together. Very dramatic, intense, and beautiful to listen/look to/at. It's a delight. If you half watch it you're doing it a disservice. The way it can hold a dramatic tone is awesome and\

    STUNNED. That was my reaction after finishing Death Note. I watched the first 20 episodes sporadically, wasn't too interested in it -- I mean, the setting and grey tones were intriguing enough, the sheer power of the Death Note and its ability to kill anyone. No wonder it's no. 1 most popular on MAL, and for the same reason, why Attack on Titan is no. 2. We as humans are fascinated by the morbid. There is a lot of death in this anime, and the premise alone lends itself to many a moral question. Is it right to possess such a notebook and kill criminals,\
          \
        to purify the world and make it better? Is that the right way?\
The remaining 17 episodes, however, I marathoned in one sitting. Yes, I'm surprised looking back that I was able to do that, I haven't done such a thing perhaps since marathoning Guilty Crown. Death Note does slow down a bit around the middle of the show, but once certain things happen... oh my, it was a hell of a ride from there. The writing in this anime is pure brilliance. The one-on-one battle between two characters, both of which appear on MAL's top 5 most favorited characters, is just insane. These guys are damn brilliant, they're geniuses to the very definition of the word. One of them especially, L, is quite the character, quite peculiar and strange yet very rational and SO SMART I mean like the nearest comparison to these two guys is Lelouch from Code Geass, but I don't know -- L and Light are geniuses to the very word. You're always, always left wondering who will triumph, and what someone says and really means, and the use of wire and audio taps, is utilized superbly. This is a detective anime, done extremely well, one of the best detective stories, if not the best, I've ever encountered. Thus the dialogue is crucial. Every word is important, every scene, every shot, plays into the interplay of words and information circulating around that fell book that came from the world of the Shinigami -- the Death Note.\
If there were an Oscars for anime, this without a doubt would win Best Adapted Screenplay. Heck, Best Picture too, and Best Leading Actor, Best Cinematography... Everything in Death Note was done perfectly. The only flaw, and I mean the ONLY FLAW, in Death Note, is that I wasn't riveted for all 37 episodes. But you can't expect all 37 episodes of an anime to enthrall you, not even Attack on Titan captivated me for all of its episodes. Other than that, it's perfect. The animation, kudos to Madhouse, with its dark and shadowy shades and hues and the quick camera movements, is good enough for even a live-action film; the soundtrack matches perfectly with the scenes; the character, as I already mentioned, is genius. Yagami Light and L. You will never forget these two names after watching Death Note. This is one of those anime that leaves you constantly thinking about past events and what will happen in the future, I mean, I was all tense and still on my chair while watching this masterpiece, after I finished I just got up in a sort of daze and walked around muttering to myself words like \"so awesome\" and \"holy shit.\" I was amazed, stunned, blown away, blasted to the very firmament itself.\
What does it mean to play God?\

    -Story (10/10)\
The story goes about a high-school genius student, Yagami Light that finds a mysterious notebook on the ground. He later finds out the notebook has an ability to kill people simply by writing their names and while doing so, thinking of that persons face. Not long, the police finds out that random criminals are dying by heartattack and they conclude it's a homocide. It is all basically the cat and mouse chase throughout the whole anime between the genius detective known as L, and Light Yagami.. \
- Sound(10/10)\
The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. It portrays the characters as they are. L's soundtrack depicts his battle\
          \
        with Light - starts slowly then gradually gets faster and faster. After some time, the soundtrack slowly fades away as if he lost the battle against Light. That was one of the examples, but don't let it fool you. It has a lot of other pieces, each special in their own way.\
- Art(10/10)\
Despite being made all the way back in 2007, it features amazing art and style with a lot of significance and symbolism.\
- Character (10/10)\
Characters are interesting, likeable, dislikeable and so on. What's special in this anime is that you can like all the characters no matter who you root for in the end. It is absolutely genius, by watching, you can see how Light becomes more and more evil the longer he uses the Death Note.\
- Enjoyment (10/10)\
This anime was and still is one of the best, if not the best piece of any type of literature I laid my eyes on. It has everything an anime requires - amazing art even though it's from 2007, amazing and unique story that makes you think, amazing character development and so on.\
- Overall (10/10)\
This anime made me actually read the manga, which non other anime ever made me do. \
10/10 no doubt.\

    DEATH NOTE tells the story of Light Yagami, a 17th years old boy who found a Note that has Mystical Power to kill someone by writing its name on it.\
My Priority watch this anime? (High)\
This is a must Watch! \
Death Note is now available on Bluray Remastered!\
-Character\
Light Yagami uses the Death Note to kill bad guys and create a Bright and Ideal World. he is more look like a Villain than a Heroes, which makes it interesting.\
then there's Lawliet also known as 'L' the best detective in the world, L's job is to find and finish Light Yagami. he is the real Justice, what makes\
          \
        him interesting is his look, he is wild and kinda F***ed up.\
-Story\
Concept of Death Note is simple but BOLD ...\
my opinion the story is really good, except for the episode 27 and so on.\
i won't explain why its really awful, i don't' want to put spoiler into my review. just watch it, its still Good.\
\
DEATH NOTE (OLD BUT GOLD)\
even the studio MadHouse and Producer Viz Media release the Remastered Edition while Death Note is really popular until now they don't want to dissapoint Customers/Viewers with garbage quality, since Death Note is an anime which is released in 2006.\

    ~*Death Note: How to Make \"Smart\" Characters*~\
The dynamic of Death Note is simple:\
-Protagonist (whichever one you thought it was in this show) comes up with a plan A.\
-Antagonist (whichever one you thought it was) has already anticipated plan A and has come up with plan B in order to thwart plan B.\
-Protagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan C to counter plan B.\
-Antagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan D to counter plan C\
-Protagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan E to counter plan\
          \
        D\
-Antagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan F to counter plan E\
-Protagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan G to counter plan F\
-Antagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan H to counter plan G\
-Protagonist, as it turns out, has anticipated this anticipation, and so has devised plan I to counter plan H\
....\
Continue until author gets tired and one pre-anticipation is either incorrect or not made.\
This is how \"smart\" characters are made.  There is no actual discussion of likely contingencies, it's just literal mystic intelligence.  They know exactly what the other one is going to do at least 40 steps ahead.  \
It's kind of stupid.\
Also, L was a crappy character.\
Also, Light was a crappy character too, and dumb to boot.  He tested out the Death Note by only killing people in a prison in his prefecture or something.  When the broadcast went out he should have immediately deduced that it was a sting by dint of having only killed criminals in that region, or should have been more skeptical about whether there is even such a thing as a worldwide broadcast.\
Also, once this actually happened they discuss explicitly how it could basically only be Light Yagami because he had to have had access to police records and was killing people on a schedule that was consistent with a student.  The only thing preventing the police from convicting him was cowardice.\

    Death Note: 37 episodes of the main character Light Yagami  going up against some of the greatest users of logic in fiction outside of Sherlock Holmes. L is particularly fun to watch. The premise starts strong and keeps getting stronger as elements are brought up and used and taken as far as they can go.\
Now if only I could say the same for the characters, in particular, three characters are introduced after Episode 26. (The only real break/ half-recap episode in the series.) Any major character introduced before Episode 26 gets plenty of screen time. But after Episode 26? Of the most important new\
          \
        characters, only one, Near, actually gets to breathe, and show off any of his intellect.\
The Music is amazing. L's theme and Light's theme and all variations are a joy to listen to. If the soundtracks were available in NA iTunes, (which they aren't!) instant purchase.\
Side Note: The show can lose you partway through the Yostuba Arc. I put the series down for three months after Episode 20. And I kept putting it on hold for a lot of other anime. This is supposed to be the big middle part of the story, and it falls flat, very flat. It's why I'm giving the story an 8 instead of 10.\
(Most of the 'A Certain' Franchise, last 7 episodes of Noragami Aragoto, Selector Infected Wixoss, the 1st 6 episodes of Assassination Classroom 2nd Season,  the first 29 episodes of Shakugan no Shana, the RE: Cyborg 009 movie, the 1st 14 episodes out of Chuunibiyou's 2 seasons if anyone's wondering.).\

    Death Note is the perfect thriller.  A game of cat-and-mouse between the two most intelligent main characters, it's so suspense-packed that you have to watch the next episode even if you are dying you will watch and forget about going to the hospital, the story is very well though out unlike many other anime, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the viewer, and one can never predict what is about to happen. \
As you continue watching it you realize how much more there is to the story than a simple notebook and the conflict between a killer and the police. It's\
          \
        about justice, morality, who is right or wrong? is there even a right or wrong in here? aren't both sides trying to archive the same goal of a world without crime or evil and where such crime or evil is punished but with different methods? you will reach a conclusion to all the questions on you'r own depending on you'r personalty, moral and ethics.\
Art – 10/10\
Made by MadHouse can only be Great!! I love the dark tones, the scenes composition like the potato moment, all used to convey mood and thought. Atmosphere greatly helps in drawing the audience into Kira and L’s duel to the point you won't even be able to think anything else because all you'r attention is on what you are watching and nothing else.\
Sound – 10/10\
The voice-acting is perfect. The music is intense, dramatic, epic always intensifying the scene and in the right moment.\
Story – 10/10\
A student finds a notebook that can kill anyone by writing one’s name within, it sound cheap but the story was so well done it's unbelievable, any plot hole you might think has an explanation and even things like the Shinigamis were well thought, the only down-side for some people is the part 2 and in my opinion the end since i wanted it to happen in a different way.\
Overall Quality – 10/10\
A must watch. Death Note is easily a Top 10 Anime in any list people may create, the most popular and maybe even the one that half anime fans watched as there first anime\

    After watching hundreds of animations, I have to say that in my mind, Death Note is a masterpiece indeed. I have watched this animation for around 6 times. If I could, I am willing to forget everything about this animation and enjoy it again. In the following part of the article, I would review this animation from five aspects: story, art, sound, characters, and enjoyment. \
Story (10/10)\
The most important standard for me to rate an animation or a movie is its story. If a work has a really fantastic plot, I would treat it as a masterpiece ignoring how bad its art or sound is.\

        Death Note is a great example which has a rather amazing story. During watching, I always tried to guess what would happen in the next episode but also always failed. The writers can often give us some logically compelling arguments to push the story. While watching this animation, I always fast forward only because I cannot wait anymore to see what would happen next. All in all, the story of this animation is very awesome. \
Art (9/10)\
Generally, it is great. I really like the dark color in this anime. It's a nice indication for the following story. I have nothing more to be said in this part. \
Character (10/10)\
In this animation, every character is distinctive. Yagami Light, an outstanding high school student, is a sophisticated person. He is cruel, sagacious, and hard-working and has a great appearance. His dream is to clear up all the criminals and evils in the world. It sounds good, right? However, he tries to achieve this goal by using the death note to kill those who are in the way. The complexity of Yagami Light is perfect since some people would like this character while others would not.  He is just like those \"kind\" dictators, e.g. William the Conqueror, Emperor Hirohito, and Napoléon Louis Bonaparte. In my opinion, Yagami Light is the most successful character in this animation. \
L is another important and distinct character in this story. He is as clever as Light but quite odd. However, I do not wanna say anything more about him because I think he is not well-designed as Light. \
Finally, I wanna say something about a minor role, Kiyomi Takada. I really hate this guy because she was willing to be dominated by Kira, blindly adored Kira and killed my favorite Mello. However, I could understand why she would like to do so. She has always been an elite since she was young. This kind of female will only admire those who are more outstanding than her, like Kira. Furthermore, She grew up in an upper-class family. Thus she does not know what the society really is. She does not know how to solve the problem of criminal fundamentally. The only thing she knows is to kill the evil and persist the kind. This is the most significant reason why she is willing to be controlled by Kira. I really sympathize with her, but I hate her. \
Sound (10/10)\
The OP and ED are excellent. The background music is also perfect. By the way, the designers used the symmetry chords to make the character songs of N and M. It is a great way to show N's intelligence and M's uninhibited actions. I really like the sounds in Death Note. \
Enjoyment (10/10)\
Actually, I finished this animation within a day. I cannot stop myself to do other things because it is too amazing. It offered me super fantastic enjoyment. \
In conclusion, Death Note is indeed a masterpiece in my opinion. If I have to choose three animations that I like the most, one of them must be Death Note. \

    What would you do if you had a Death Note? What if somebody just started murdering every single criminal out there? These are the questions Death Note answers, or more accurately, lets you answer for yourself. Death Note is amazing.  I don't even know where to start. The art is fantastic, I love it. Character models are quite detailed and animation is pretty good. I can't stop listening to the soundtrack. The songs are varied and the only song that was out of place was the second opening, which sucked by the way. It is just so out of place. But those are just\
          \
        2 songs (the ending one as well) so I don't care as much (The first opening is amazing, I just want to clarify that. It's my ringtone as of the time I am writing this review). L's theme, Light's theme, Low of Solipsism, the Death Note theme itself... so many great songs. But now to the more important part - the story. The story is suspensful, unique, with many plot twists. It is morally grey. It doesn't tell you \"this is good, that is bad\". The characters are sooooooo good! L is seriously one of the best characters ever in fiction. He is just so unique and is very inspiring. Light Yagami is also very unique. The other characters also are good. Ryuuk, Matsuda, Aizawa. Each character has their own backstory and personality, as well as motivations. They also have their own morals and they do have some evil in them. Death Note has times for comic relief, by the way. But it just fits. It's not over-the-top blood coming out of people's noses things (aside from one part...), it is actually quite dark in its humour as well at times. It also uses a lot of symbolism. But it's not the annoying \"Look how smart we are, we can do symbolism\" type of stuff they teach in schools. No, it actually helps the atmosphere and story. It uses a lot of religious symbolism, for example, and is amusing and not pretentious. The plot moves at a perfect pace. The first half of the anime at least. The first part of the anime is a masterpiece. The second is pretty good but... there are flaws.\
 The pacing is all over the place. It is just too fast. The first one let the characters get amazing character development. And I mean all of them. The second one just rushes everything. Seriously, you have no time to think anything through and is unnecessarily confusing. The character of Mello I liked, but he isn't developed much, as mentioned previously. Near was just alright. Maybe even mediocre. He is just an L rip-off. He might be more interesting in the manga but we're talking about the anime here. And he just comes off as an L rip-off here. The ending, I thought wasn't bad in theory but there were some badly executed things. That song at the end RUINED IT! Seriously, who in their right mind put a song which sounds more fitting for a Disney animated classic in such a dark and twisted story?! Now this is pretentious and stupid. It also left a lot of questions left to be answered. Too many. I'd talk about it more but I want to avoid spoilers.\
 Also, Misa. She is annoying. And I mean very, very annoying.  She is a bit okay at times but in the end just ruins the dark, mysterious feeling of the anime and makes all \"kawaii\" and crap.\
Overall, Death Note is no doubt an amazing anime. The first half is, again, a masterpiece. The second is pretty good but is not as good as the first. You just want to watch more. You can't stop. I'm still obsessed with it.\

*Disclaimer*\
I will sometimes refer to Light as Kira in this review since it's Light's persona.\
Ahhh...Death Note, the classic that's been seen by millions of people and the highest ranked anime on MAL's popularity list. This anime has received a lot of praise and it deserves most of it. Is it overrated? Yes, but that holds true (did i use that expression correctly? eh who cares) for literally every single anime that is considered a \"classic\". Claiming that an anime is the best anime in existance puts forth expectations that are impossible to meet. I don't know why i wrote that...ANYHOW, let's get on with\
          \
        the review :D.\
The story follows Light Yagami, a high school student with a strong sense of justice who wants to follow in his father's footsteps and become a detective. One day (by pure chance) Light comes across a notebook that belongs to a shinigami named Ryuk. Light quickly discovers that writing someone's name in the notebook while visualizing their face will cause them to die. Over the course of the series we get to witness light transform from a normal person who wants to help change the world for the better to the self proclaimed god of the new world who strikes down evildoers in an attempt to cleanse the world of filth. As you could imagine, the cops don't like it when people take matters into their own hands and so when things start to spiral out of control, they hire a world renowned detective called L who has never failed to solve a case. This is when the show evolves into a brilliant cat and mouse chase that goes back and forth between Light and L. \
The first part of Death Note is a thrilling story of clashing ideologies with so many clever twists and turns that if you haven't watched or read it, i only have one thing to say to you, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?! \
Unfortunately the show takes a drastic turn for the worse when L dies (don't say that i didn't warn you). The thing that made the first part of the series such a masterpeice was the moral debate between L and Kira. All of the things that made Death Note such an interesting show just got \"washed away\" when L died. The show tries to make up for L's death by introducing Mello and Near into the show. Mello is kind of an interesting character but he barely gets any screen time and Near is literally nothing, you never hear any personality whatsoever in his thoughts like you did with L. L explained his thought process and how he came to certain conclusions but near just says stuff like \"we know ________, therefore _______\" and that's basically what Near does for his entire run. In fact, most people probably wouldn't notice if N died and was replaced with a robot. The major difference between N and L is that L has emotions (albeit very strange ones).\
Light's character also changes for the worse. In the first part of the show Light is portrayed as a man of principle with a twisted sense of justice whereas In the 2nd part of the show, he's portrayed as a complete douchebag without any morals whatsoever. \
At least the conclusion of the show was handled pretty well. Light got what he deserved and everyone lived happily ever after...nah.\
Even though the 2nd part of the show is kinda mediocre, Death Note is still worth watching and i can understand why some people think it's the best anime of all time.\

    Death Note is at the precipice of all psychological thriller anime. It's one of the anime that could be recommended to anyone without hesitation due to it's universally applicable themes.\
Story -  Death Note follows the story of a high school genius - Light Yagami that is bored with his life and encounters a Death Note from a shinigamiwith the power to kill anyone. he starts passing judgments on criminals and soon develops a moral rival, the super detective - L. It's the perfect cat and mouse chase with philosophical themes such as justice and judging right and wrong.\
Art - The Art-style remains pretty consistent\
          \
        and realistic reminiscent of the realistic themes of the show. It isn't shy from appearing Gothic and biblical to again show it's themes and Light's narcissistic portrayal of a god. Death Note's first opening the WORLD bleeds with christian symbolism and foreshadows the events of the show.\
Sound - Death Note has many memorable soundtracks like - L's theme, Light's theme, Low of Solipsism etc. They are all perfect for setting up the mood and the scene. However, they are all comprised of the same ingredients - choir, piano, guitar and occasional drums. This makes the soundtracks indistinguishable from one another but nevertheless they are evoking. \
Characters - All the characters fulfill a specific role in the anime and their morals dealing with the situation makes for an entertaining show. The main characters are polar opposites and the supporting characters provide emotions such as Love - Misa, Humor - Matsuda, Pride - Soichiro Yagami and Nihilism - Ryuk.\
This anime is best to be birdwatched alone because the suspense will kill you and talk to some friends after seeing this anime as you'll be in a state of depression because such a fine piece of art has ended :) \

    I think Death Note was an OKAY anime.\
I didn't really like how L was, I don't know, I personally thought it was weird. Also, I thought that Ryuk and Rem also had a very awkward appearnace; even if they clearly aren't supposed to have a human-like form.\
I didn't like how one of the characters was defeated so easily after all that strategy. (Sorry trying not to spoil anything)\
I liked how there was a lot of logic and strategy put into this anime, it was very clever on how L and Light fought each other.\
At some points it could be very suspenseful, just waiting to see\
          \
        what happens next.\
The end was tragic too.\
I like how there was a lot of plot twists and everything.\
I kind of liked this anime but I think the ending was pretty bad, all that strategy went to waste; it just seems like you went through all this suspense for an ending that you expected more from, it's an okay anime overall for me.\

Now, I absolutely loved the anime. I will not say it's the best, or the worst. It is entirely my opinion. I saw this when I was in fifth grade, and I re watched it many times throughout my life. This could mean two things; I'm brutally honest, or I'm just a critic.\
Story: (8)\
The story was an amazing idea. Watching to smart minds compete against one and anouther was the best idea I heard. Each time I watched it, I could see more jokes that peak through every now and then.\
Until... Light managed to kill L. It started to go down\
          \
        headfirst. Now only did everyone get sad, but it lost its spark! L was a fantastic character that the fandom grew on. Then, they brought in a \"second generation L\" to take his place.\
I tried to pull through, but this character took the role of L to the extreme. Making it boring. This story ended up with a less spark, getting more rushed to be finished.\
\
Art: (8)\
Well done, but there shouldn't be that much blood should there? Does the human body bleed that much?\
Sound: (8)\
Well done, you can hear the screaming nice and loud!\
Characters: (6)\
Yes, I rated a 6. The characters didn't maintain their roles and tried to take of another's in various places. Near tries to take L, L tries to be like Light in some episodes, and Misa tries to be too much like Amy Rose. They were great ideas, yet they all are just missing something...\
Spoiler:\
When in the last episode, Light became so stupid I just wanted to punch him.\
End of spoiler\
Enjoyment: (9)\
It would be a 10, but the flaws brought it down.\

    First of all, I'd like to say I love the sort of drama this story brings. The kind where a highly intelligent character is constantly in a seeming dead-end and you think \"that's it, it's over for him\" only to see him pull through once more. When it comes to animes, I like to examine the ending, overall message of the story and wonder if it did a good job presenting the philosophical idea. If there even is one to be found, that is.\
The message of this story seems very simple to me upon finishing. The message is that we all have an idea of\
          \
        what we wish the world to be. And no matter how moderate you may think your ideal vision is, it will always have a bottom line of how high of a mountain of human bodies are you prepared to build. Let's assume you simply want your corner of the world to stay exactly how it is where people basic rights are protected and aren't subject to the judgment of a higher moral authority figure like in Light Yagami's ideal world. Well, there still needs to be killings in your world. Your world requires that the protectors of your rights and others, be they the violated persons themselves or the police, have to be able to use force against those who would violate the laws of your land. If someone is holding a gun and shooting up a mall, the police have no choice but to kill that man in many cases. So even the most mundane beliefs about how the world should be require signing the death warrant of someone.\
This is exactly why L, despite agreeing with the death penalty, is against Kira and why he wants to put Kira to death. L represents the rule of law, the idea that killing is morally permissible as long as it is done by a just rule of law like that of Japan or the United States that respects human rights, fair trials, and an accountable justice system. Whereas Kira represents a more primal, emotional idea of justice that isn't subject to the flaws of bureaucracy that appeals to the basic human desire for a righteous higher power. There's a reason almost every human culture has religion, because even if it's not true, people want to believe in a God. \
And of course, the story attempts to demonstrate through the destruction of Light's empathy, his compassion, and his relentless quest for power that his vision of a perfect world only populated by good, morally upstanding people not only requires a mountain of bodies that would put Everest to shame, but that this sort of power is fundamentally not suited for men to possess freely. Hence why our enlightenment values here in the west are provably superior.\
The one criticism I'd make of this story, despite it's otherwise excellent plot, is that the second half, the last 12 episodes with the Near arc, had a very disappointing ending that frankly just doesn't make sense. But I can't really explain why I feel that way without going into heavy ending spoilers. \

    I won't be able to say anything bad about this story, so I guess this review will be highly subjective, but... well, this was my first anime, this story made me start watching anime, so forgive me. Eventhough I saw many series since I first watched this one, it never got down from my favourite list. This story is amazing in so many ways.\
The art, the music, they are amazing on their own, but... I can't say much about them. They are perfect in helping the story, in developing it, but when you are concentrating on the series itself, you forget to think about them.\
          \
        What I have to take out, is the way they are playing with the sound: In some scenes, silence can have the greatest meaning, or just a simple sound, not music, like a bell ringing.\
The story has many layers. You can watch it as a crime story, and you will find it really good. It is mystical, sometimes like a thriller, with many twists. You have no time to be bored, from the first episode to the last, DN will keep your interests. And behind this great crime story, there is the deep symbolism, mostly from western, Christian culture. From biblical references, to references to great works of literature, like Faust, you can find many little, or big hints to the meanings behind the story. I already watched the anime three times, and it still has new aspects for me, and I still never felt bored watching it.\
You can't go by the characters as well. Although Light is the character first introduced, and we follow him as a main protagonist, if you ask me, he and L are both main characters. Light has a very strange dual personality, and after a time I even got the impression that he has multiple personality disorder, this became so strange. I never could tell, what I truly think about this character: I don't hate him... at some points of the story, I even felt I pitied him, for what he had become, but I never liked his character either. The whole philosophy he represents is absolutely inacceptable for me. On the other hand, the other character, L is not normal either. It's quite sure, he has autism, but unlike Light, he's personality is really strong, and he is basically impossible to tempt with power... and that's why he's one of my all-time favourites, besides his intellect. And these two have amazing dinamics, a weird, sometimes funny, sometimes horribly sad frenemy relationship, and this is what makes this anime really strong emotionally as well as in story. The side characters, are sometimes annoying (like Misa... she is terribly annoying, but even so... I pitied her as well), but sometimes they are amazing like the two main figures, for example Near, Mello and Yagami Soichiro are interesting and well developed.\
I would write many more about this story, but I just can't without spoilers, and no review could perfectly portray all those moral questions and dilemmas that are represented, and also I can't really show the fact, that this anime can have an altogether different meaning to every person, who watch it. But really... give it a try. It's truly one of the best anime ever.\

Story\
10/10\
Ok, so it's about this guy Light Yagami who finds a Death Note which grants him the power to kill whoever's name is written in it. He uses this to try to purge the world from evil and become a God, but becomes corrupted by power within. He becomes known to the world as Kira and the Japanese police work with investigator L to try and figure out who Kira is and put\
          \
        a stop to his reign of terror. The plot is original and has a great concept that is engaging, interesting, and has a deep message behind it. Which is that power corrupts. And it handles this very well in a way that is mature and effective. And like I said before, it's addictive to watch. The plot becomes quite complicated, but not to the point of being too confusing and leading to frustration. It's more so that it can make you think and try to look back at it. And that's the thing that makes it so addictive to watch. People mostly complain about the second story arc and the ending. I don't care what nobody says, I like it just fine. Without spoiling, the reason it ends this way is to try and get it's point across. And I happen to think it succeeds very well in this aspect. If it were to end differently, it would've been hypocritical towards it's initial goal and it's theme. So don't complain. And as for the second arc in general, I think it's just fine. It doesn't deviate from the story, and it's still just as enjoyable to watch as it was in the first arc. People only complain because of the characters. Can't explain what I mean by that because it would give away major spoilers. So to sum it all up, I love the story and I don't have problems with it like other people seem to.\
Characters\
9.5/10\
The characters for Death Note are great. They are 3 dimensional and well developed. Light Yagami is the villain protagonist that you'll either love or hate, and that's what makes him complex and interesting. L is the heroin antagonist that is the best character of the series. He is similar to Light so much as they are very clever and intelligent and always have tricks up their sleeves. And the fact that they can see right through each others traps is what makes this a fun cat and mouse game. They work off of each other great in their rivalry. Other characters involving Misa, Light's dad, Matsuda, Aizawa, etc are important to the story and serve an important purpose. None of the characters feel out of place or unnecessary. My only criticism is that I don't like how the played the dumb blonde trop with Misa later on. She's a smarter character than that, and I think they just overdid it with that. But still, great characters.\
Animation\
10/10\
The animation is amazing. Distinctive and original character designs especially with L who is practically iconic. Best design out of all of them. The setting is what you'd expect from this kind of anime, but it works great with dark backgrounds that fit the tone of the anime. The Shinigami really stands out as it's creative and has a very cool design. I don't have any problems with the animation at all. It all looks great! The only \"action\" we get is from the deaths themselves which are thrilling and suspenseful like they should. This anime also has a great color scheme using very dark colors as it fits in a very dark anime. Nothing to criticize, so a 10 for me!\
Sound\
10/10 \
Once again, nothing to criticize. The English dub is one of the best dubs out there. One of the few animes out there were the English dub is better than the Japanese dub. Definitely check out the dub! As for the soundtrack, the opening song is one of the best out there. Fits in great with the series. The second one may seem silly with all it's screaming and misheard lyrics, but it's still a great listen. The musical score may be receptive, but only because it's that awesome. Some of the best musical scores I've ever heard in an anime. Seriously worth downloading and listening to causally. So with a great English dub, great musical score, great openings, it's a 10!\
Overall\
9.9/10\
A+\
Death Note is seriously a must watch if you love these kinds of anime, or just anime in general. Once you start watching it, you won't be able to stop. It sucks you in just like that. No other anime has had me this sold on it before. So it's a masterpiece in my book. \

    Death Note in a word: Ethics\
Who's right? Who's wrong? Who's the hero? Who's the villain? Why?\
Even though Death Note is one of the \"mainstream animes\" like SAO and AOT, I really enjoyed it. I do agree the fan base can be annoying at times, but judging the anime solely on its content, I liked it a lot. I've seen both the dubbed and subbed and found both to be addicting. So, I say no worries there.\
The quality I enjoyed the most was the way it made the viewer question their own personal human ethics. Is Light doing the right thing? Would I do that? Did\
          \
        he go too far? At what point did his actions become selfish or wrong? Are his actions wrong because they are selfish, or are the still right because he is trying to achieve his ideal Utopian society? I think someone could easily write a paper on \"The Ethics of Death Note\" (An idea for those of you in an Ethics College class). I, personally, like animes or movies that make me question what I would do in difficult situations, and this did that for me multiple times. \
I liked the whole concept and the darker style of this anime and it was just the right anime for the mood I was in. \
The main reasons I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because 1. There were a few slow moments where I wished it had picked up the pace in the story and 2. Some of the \"big\" moments were a little predictable. However, it still had plenty of surprises and I would highly recommend this anime.\

    I think I am not exaggerating if I tell you that Death Note is one of the best anime series ever made. \
Death Note is a story about a boy who finds a notebook in which he can write peoples names to make them die. Killing them has no consequences at all which makes this an interesting aspect of the story, because Light (the boy) has to figure what to do with this power. After a short while the best character in anime history is introduced. A boy named L. His character is great because he is really smart, and not in a way that\
          \
        the writer keeps on telling you he is smart, but because you can hear a lot of his thoughts and see through his actions that he is smart, which makes him a fun character to watch. \
The anime quickly turns into a battle between L and Light, with the big theme: what is justice? Death Note is an epic mind battle between two of the most intelligent characters in anime history.\

    Reseña de Death Note en español SIN SPOILERS\
Death Note. El anime con el cual entrar de lleno al mundo del anime. Generalmente todos comenzaron a ver anime por la televisión con series como: Dragon ball, pokemon, digimon, etc. Sin tener idea que eran \"anime\", pero ya sabiendo que es anime Death Note es la mejor opción. El argumento se trata de un estudiante genio y deprimido de la vida, encuentra una libreta con la cual tiene el poder de asesinar a las personas escribiendo su nombre. El atractivo de esta serie es ver como nuestro protagonista(un antihéroe en este caso) se enfrenta a la policía,\
          \
        con el fin de crear un mundo mejor y para eso decide asesinar a todos los criminales del mundo, pero lo hace de forma anónima usando el seudónimo de Kira. Aquí es cuando aparece el antagonista(en este caso el bueno de la historia) el mejor detective del mundo(alguien igual o mas inteligente que nuestro protagonista) que se dedicara a encontrar a Kira para que deje de matar personas. Lo que sostiene al anime son los duelos psicológicos, los planes para triunfar y vencer al otro, si bien en esta serie no veras acción como la que verías es Naruto o en Dragon ball z, es realmente emocionante ver a los personajes principales pelear psicológicamente. Finalmente el misterio por saber si el protagonista cumple su meta de crear un mundo sin criminales o si el antagonista es capaz de encontrarlo para ejecutarlo es lo mas interesante de esta historia.

    Look, don't get me wrong. I love death note manga. It's my favorite. But the anime COMPLETLY killed it. I've always been a fan of Takeshi Obata, and i still am. His art is great and the story line remains intriguing. But the way they went about showing it is just... different... wrong. It doesn't feel right, but I can't put my finger on exactly what IT is. Not to mention that the voices just sound all wrong, even in the japanese version. The voice actors just don't sound the way that I, and most likely many other viewers, imagined it. Characters attitudes should be\
          \
        included in voice acting, but nearly every voice seems out of place in this. \
Overall, it might be good if you've never read the manga, but even then, you should just read it instead. The manga is SO much better.\
DRUIDS FTW!!!\

    Death Note has a unique storyline to it. I have to agree and its a very insteresting anime indeed. But I have to say that I really didnt like the characters too much. Light has no sense of human morality and is not very complex in his emotions. The main character wants to \"take over the world\" and cares nothing for anything other than his goal. Which makes me feel as though I cant follow with the characters perspective. Light is unrelateable. \
Misa is ,put simply, annoying. Her lack of knowledge bothers me and to top it off shes plays an important role. Which means\
          \
        I had to see even more. The sound wasnt too appealing either. \
To sum it up, the protagonist, was almost the only character that had any depth.\

- Openings of the anime is very good\
          \
        to me as it fits the anime pretty well , Season One's Opening = Calm and Mysterious while Season Two's Opening = Rapid spam of metal song which fits the season two's plot line >.>\

    *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\
So you've watched anime like DBZ, Naruto, Bleach or One Piece, and maybe you liked them. But then you come to MAL and see that there's a little anime called \"Death Note\". The name itself intrigues you, doesn't it? So after watching it you think to yourself, \"well that was pretty good, nothing really good about it EXCEPT EVERYTHING.\" Almost.\
\
Story:-9\
This part of the review will split the ratings into 2 parts: the \"L arc\" and the \"N arc\".\
The story of Death Note is wonderfully unique and is \"Near\" perfect, I say that because while the unique nature of the anime is one of\
          \
        it's strongest points it definitely has some plot holes here and there.\
The first arc is ,in popular opinion, the better of the 2 arcs. It revolves around our Anti-Hero Light and a genius detective \"L\". This arc has them both dueling it out in a gigantic mind game of clashing ideals. Each character plays large roles in an extremely elaborate chess game. The number of twists throughout the series would even give M. Night Shyamalan a hard on. Then comes the second arc.\
If you've read anything about this anime it's the \"potato chip\" line and/or that the second arc is garbage. I honestly wouldn't say that the second arc is garbage but it definitely is a step down from what we've experienced prior. The mind games are now based on chance and it just seems like Light becomes, dare I say, stupid. No longer is the puzzle complex and fascinating and no longer are the 2, or in this case, 3 main protagonists smart and cunning. The entire anime goes from Professor Layton to Mario Party in the change of arcs.\
Overall if not for the the second arc the story would've gotten a 10.\
\
Art:-7\
The art in this series is not something I would brag about. Compared to what what Tetsurou Araki has presented us in Black Lagoon prior to Death Note, this cannot be considered his best work by any mean. But in no stretch of the imagination is this animation \"bad\". No, not even close. The animations in the openings and endings are definitely good if not great. While there is very little action, it still is a treat to the eyes. The writing in the death note itself cannot go unmentioned as well, the way people write in the notebook, while impossible, is staggering. I mean when someone's handwriting sparkles, you know that you're in for a ride.\
\
Sound:-10\
This part of the review is split between the soundtrack, openings and endings and Voice Acting respectively.\
If I could I would give this part much more than 10, by and for this anime has one of the best soundtracks ever to enter human ears. For an example of this just listen to 3 themes:\
1. Kira's Theme\
2. L's Theme (A)\
3. Low of Solipsism\
The entire soundtrack is crafted beautifully and each song compliments the tone of the anime perfect.\
The opening of the second arc and both endings are nothing brilliant, but still good to listen to. But then you have the first opening.\"The World\" by Nightmare is one of the best anime openings of all time. The song and animation compliment each other perfectly and even the song in itself is a good listen.\
The voice actors for the subbed version of Death Note all fit the character perfectly, the dub on the other hand isn't better, but they do portray each character well, except for Light who sounds like he smokes to much.\
\
Character:-9\
There are a variety of characters in this series and if I study each in detail I'll be sitting here for weeks. So I'll only touch on a few.\
L is the detective throughout the story who's character acts as a comic relief character as well as a serious detective. He's usually revered as a great character by most of the fanbase and you can easily see why. He's a quirky, fast-thinking and amazing detective and we all love him.\
Light is the main anti-hero of the story and is one of the most controversial characters in the series. Unlike L, whom everybody loves, Light is accused of having wrong ideals and sometimes being an all around, pardon my French, dick.\
This is true in many cases and yes he can be a dick a lot of the time, especially in episodes 25 and onwards. But in the end he still is a \"good\" character, not necessarily a likable one though.\
Then we have comic relief characters like Matsude, Misa and Ryuk, the Shinigami. Aside from that the rest of the cast is utilized perfectly and only has 2 glaring flaws in my book. Near and Misa. These 2 characters are not likable nor good. Near is someone whom I can't talk about without mentioning major spoilers and Misa is just annoying. She is a classic anime airhead and while I wouldn't have minded if she was in any other anime, in a serious anime like this, her character doesn't fit.\
\
Enjoyment:-8\
Overall I liked this anime in totality. The episodes from \
1-7 were brilliant\
8-16 very good\
17-25 again brilliant\
26-37 good on their own but when compared to the rest of the anime, average.\
The anime will have you on the edge of your seat most of the time and other times it'll have you flabbergasted at the stupid decisions made by some character. It'll also have you crying at the end of a few episodes because \"something bad happened\".\
I would recommend this anime to anyone out there, it's a great anime to watch but just keep in mind that you need to use your brain to watch it.\
Overall:- 8.4 (Barely missed a 9)\

    Death Note has very devoted and widespread fans, so there are probably already hundreds of reviews about this show already, but because I liked the show so much, I really wanted to write a review for it.\
Story 10/10: The story of this anime is amazing and truly is well-crafted. Everything is well-thought-out and planned, just as if a master criminal him/herself were writing it! Even some of the slightest details have some sort of significance or role in the plot. The story is suspenseful and draws you in from beginning to end. Be prepared for cliffhangers at the end of each episode! If you do\
          \
        like complex and suspenseful plots this is definitely the show for you. Not only that, but the entire concept of the story is rather unique. I mean it really backs up the phrase: \"the pen is mightier than the sword.\"\
Art 9/10: The art is awesome, it definitely gives the anime a gothic feel. And again, it has details! From the character's faces to the clothes to the settings to the food that L eats and to the objects the characters are holding. It definitely does a good job with conveying the expressions, like thinking and crazy serial killer faces. Also another thing about the art that I just want to mention, as you watch the show, the art for at least some of the characters changes over time; Chief Yagami starts the show with no grey in his hair, but as time goes on, his hair has more and more grey.\
Sound 8/10: Sound is pretty good, the music definitely fits with the show's mood. Only one thing I have to warn you about; the second opening song for Death Note is a heavy metal song, so do not watch the show with earphones in for the second half, I don't want people to fall out of their chairs in shock! I'm not a fan of heavy metal but I got used to the song and it kind of grew on me, I even kind of sing it sometimes.\
Character 10/10: The characters are also well-done, there is some backstory, motives, relationships, and personality that comes with the characters. Even some of the minor characters have an incredible impact on the show. But the two characters that are the most well-done are L and Light. These are both intelligent characters that have an intellectual battle with each other. This battle does remind me of a similar battle between Sherlock Holmes and Jim Moriarty, with L being Sherlock and Light being Moriarty. The two are equal opponents, which will leave you guessing till the end on who will win.\
Enjoyment 10/10: I loved this show! Even though it was 37 episodes, I managed to finish it in only four days. That is about 9 episodes per day, wow I watched that show way too much. The only thing I would complain about is the tension, this show is very serious, it would have been nice to have a break in-between all the suspense and complex planning. But it definitely doesn't need to be that way for you to enjoy it!\
Overall 10/10: Very well-thought-out and satisfying. I know you might be sick of people saying \"Death Note is so awesome\" but give it a chance anyway.\

    Death Note was a really good anime.... at first. The first half of the anime was a fantastic battle of wits and it kept you in suspense wondering who would come out on top. However, after a certain part (don't want to spoil it) the main character became VERY annoying VERY quickly and it got to the point where it was painful to watch. I will give credit to the fact that the music and the art style of the anime was very well done. However, the show started with a high quality story  and ended up being very disappointing. Its worth watching for\

        a little while, but don't go into the show with super high expectations.\

    An anime that over-stayed its welcome.\
I was interested in Death Note when the manga was first being translated into english, and when I heard it was becoming an anime, I was excited, since I don't particularly enjoy reading manga.\
The anime starts of pretty well, but it got old fast. The characters are about as interesting and well defined as anime characters get... but they don't seem to have much development in relation to the story. The interesting philosophical questions never change or are explored differently at all, as the premise is pretty limiting in that regard. As each episode went on, I felt myself feeling\
          \
        less and less inclined to finish it, until I just never watched another episode (except on the occasion I caught it on adult swim with nothing else to do).\
I also think part of the problem is how contrived so many situations in this anime are. Similarly, L doesn't really click with me as a good character, he, too, seems contrived, and there just to make some of these ridiculous scenarios possible. It seems like his personality was just tacked on to try and make people think of Sherlock Holmes, but just not as interesting.\

    How about a game of chess?\
One with uncontested control over life and death as the prize?\
Death Note is an odd fish. The Protagonist is also the villain.\
Light Yagami is the perfect little golden boy with a sharp, quick and powerful intellect; but he is also a murderous sociopath with a god complex, and a occult notebook that allows him to anonymously inflict his absolutist worldview on a defenseless society.\
That is, until an eccentric detective with a sharp, quick and powerful intellect rivalling Light's own interferes.\
What follows is a Xanatos Chess Match of multi-teired crosses/double-crosses/triple-crosses where the two main characters search for clues to their enemies\
          \
        identity. Each taking turns being the Cat in this game of Cat and Mouse.\
It all leads to Light Yagami's Shakespeare style decent into corruption and madness; while his crackpot opposite number crouches, unblinking in the dim LCD light and unravels Light's tangled skein of lies.\
It is quite compelling, with unexpected plot twists and fascinatingly driven characters.\
Just when things start to get stale, suddenly the table not only turns but is violently flipped over. Copycats, memory deletions, occult exploits, psychodrama.\
Never a dull moment.\
I do have two minor quibbles with the series.\
1) Some of the later \"twists\" that pull Light's fat out of the fire come seemingly out of nowhere. I suspect that these twists make more sense in the Manga, and it's merely a case of sloppy adaptation.\
2) The music is awful.\
Not just the incidental music (of which there are, what...two, maybe three leitmotifs repeated ad nauseum.) but the opening and closing credit themes are utter garbage. The first 19 episodes open with a numbingly blah bit of bad Fox4Kids JRock...but episodes 20-37 open with a diabolically shitty slab of inept death-metal-esque horse-twaddle. It makes one glad their is a skip button.\
So, there you have it.\
Death Note:\
A police procedural on blotter acid. A supernatural thriller with wit and chutzpah.\
The Good Kind of Bad Craziness.\

    DEATH NOTE REVIEW:\
MINDSET:\
It is more cool that it is dark and moralistic with its themes.\
REVIEW:\
To me, I view Death Note as a show whose emphasis is not towards realism, but in the more rule of cool aspects since this is a Shonen Jump show where talking about. It has some aspects of it, but for the most part, You are really just looking at how two sides of the argument with near grey morality have an eipc battle with the power of their wits and cunning. And this is how most people tend to misunderstand Death Note, it is more of a show that focuses\
          \
        on how L v.s Light Yagami duking it out for everyone to awe at its rather corny epicness, rather than a more realistic style of writing fleshing out its cast and dark themes giving some sort of message. Sure it may be cool to think outside the box at times like what if the Death Note was real, but there never seemed to be a moment when I really felt that harsh philosophy.\
You still see a sense of how the whole thriller and mystery aspect blends in rather nicely with the whole Shonen like feel. Like how Light feels the need to eradicate the world from all sinners and he has to hide he's real identity from the public, yet he's still a teenager with very vague motives behind he's actions, with a sense that it seems natural that he can pull of crazy stunts and it felt more like he did it because he was following the path of coolness rather than the path of realism and depth.\
Side characters do have a sense of depth and development, and they do have a motive for their actions. Like Lights Dad whose head of the police force, wants to hunt down Kira because he belives that Kiras actions are wrong, and he even allowed some of he's staff to join him as an option, because he does'nt want to risk lives. Though most of the cast may not be as well fleshed out, and some of the characters like misa was just a result of bad writing, really? The reason why she was obsessed with Kira was because he unintentionally did her revenge mission for him...\
Kira and L to me, were great when their together, You always feel a jump of excitement and tension when the two are suspiciously trying to catch one one and other. Chemistry between the two always felt more like a constant mind game between two uber smarty pants finding the smartest tactics to beat each other. Though, I do see some complexity within L, and that he does develop and he felt like the more complex character. Though I do personally prefer L as the better character since he's just following the rule of cool in a dark, yet still laughably aweable manner.\
The thing that I just adored about Death Note was the battle of the two cunning geniuses alone, the two are constantly at their wits, You see how intellectual both characters are from the first few episodes, and the epic arch when the two end up together in the skyscraper to do nothing but to simply out smart the enemy was absolutly awesome, and intense stiff bro. There does feel like a use of a plot device that may seem BS, but it does seem to fit with the whole coolness factor in the show. Overall, the battles make the show feel quite clever at times, at how they excecute all of these things at once.\
Speaking of tension, the battle between Kira and L were never hugely intense, but there was always a feeling of intensity and grip to be constantly excited on how this battle of the worlds smartest mass murderer, verses the worlds finest detective. For the most part, the show always leaves an awesome cliffhanger to pull You in for more upcoming episodes just to see how each one plays out.\
I would say it is 20% more intense but 80% more exciting, since the show of course mostly disregards its darker themes and make it more like a game of some really cool chess, You don't feel like Your in some sort of fear, or crazy adrenaline gushing to get You hyped but You get hyped by simply going awe at how crazy the situations can get and leaves You curious instead. The show still remains its Shonen-like feel, and if it was more realistic, then thats some intense sh*t, but this is a point when I can't amplify it to an 8, since it does not go any deeper than just a straight up thriller and mystery show.\
The whole Shimigami aspect was just more or less an excuse to simply own a Death Note, while it did had some use of speaking through dark themes at the shows \"Climactic\" Season 2 ending with the Shimigami, I always felt like they were just a bunch of over powered death gods who are just bored. They didn't carry in a real meaning, but are mostly just there to make the Death Note exist without being too cheesy.\
YES. Season 2 was clearly unnecessary, and the show just lost all of the intensity, the tension and its overall cast. Heck, Kira started to act like an absolute prick in the end, and all what I'm seeing was just him getting beat up. The show could've been fine if they left the first season as it is. And why should any of us care that this part of the show even exists?\
Madhouse, when Your trying to look all hip and cool rather than making kiddie material, You really are hip and cool. Sure the signiture Madhouse style was to always create emphasis on darker and more grim tones of grey with a blended feel of CGI colour schemes but there doesn’t seem to be signs of pure CGI. I'm talking to You Aldnoah! Anyway's, the lighting and shading and mechanical lighting, the use of colours in the OP are all real great to simply look at. You sense a good deal of effort was put into this garnishing, and it stays very consistent without ever dropping the budget. Character desgins are overall great, and sure, not all blend in well and L's design really does stands out from the more realistic portrayal of adults and middle-aged crime solvers.\
The music feels really impressive, it has chamber choirs that blows Your flipping mind, (my favourite theme in the OST was Ryuks theme btw) You are constantly being immersed in the situations, You truly feel impact, intensity, tension, awe, calmness, calamity, this is easily one of the best soundtracks that I've heard, like ever. There’s a well fine mix of Guitars, Pianos, Drums, Techno Beats, Violins, Trumpets and even a song that only consisted of just f**king mind blowing Choir just going ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh here me ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, and holy sh*t that’s awesome! There is a true feeling of Cliffhanger, fear, coolness and it just jam f*cks every awe inspired emotion into one of the more grim yet quite corny, but totally flipping amazing OST's ever. The OP however, its really just some J-Rock I've heard a million times, it gets You hyped, but there's really nothing too amazing after that, colours are cool though. The ED is skip worthy since I get too hyped for everything else! However, they  changed the OP to just J-Death Metal, not saying that there’s something completely bad about that, but it was just a weird change of pace that I personally am neutral whether on liking it, or hating it...\
LEGACY:\
Its edgy, but not moralistic, its cool, yet it makes it depth shallow, its a thriller, but it feels more like an exaggeration of one. Its surely not deep, but hey, its well memorised by the Anime community for being one of the better mystery thrillers that existed in previous years...\
SCORES:\
7/10 – Well rounded cast with Light following the rule of cool\
7/10 – Exciting thriller stuff bro, and overall great Shonen Jump Story \
7/10 – Mad House visuals are always great when its not for kids. \
8.5/10 – Damn awesome OST.\
FINALE: 7/10 So it may not be deep, but its still awesome.\

    Only a month ago I had finished watching DeathNote and I can tell you that I feel that it is one of the best shows that I've seen to date. DeathNote left me at the edge of my seat in suspense and with an unquenchable thirst for more. I seriously recommend this, for anyone who is interested in the fantasy/mystery genre to watch. \
Story: The anime begins with a normal college student stumbling upon a notebook that has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it, given that you have the person's face in your mind when the name is written. \
To\
          \
        me, DeathNote showed a different side of justice. In some cases, people may feel that killing criminals and felons is the right thing to do, whether their crimes are small or large. Criminals are corrupt and do not belong in this world, so they should be, as Yagami Light put it, 'judged.' But is it right to, by our own hands, kill someone? Then are we not as corrupt as the people whose lives we have destroyed? \
And then there's L, working to uncover Light's 'secret' life. He believes in justice set up by the government, by humans. We incarcerate criminals for a set amount of days, months, or years only to set them free in the end. But how exactly do we know that their time in prison was enough to make them 'clean?'  How do we not know that when they're on the outside again, they will not commit another illegal act that could possibly be worse?\
Aside from these thoughts, DeathNote left me thinking about the next move from either Light or L. All the steps in their plan were so intricately put and planned out that even I was surprised at how everything was carried out. The plot moved so smoothly that I was so completely enthralled. If you like mysteries, I severely suggest watching this.\
Character: Both characters, Light and L, had so much in common yet viewed justice so differently. Both extremely intellectual and determined characters, Light and L were always there to out-do one another. At times, you really cannot tell which character you want to win. Some may agree to Light's 'justice' and want him to make it out on top. And then there's those who agree with L and wish for him to win. Then there's the new addition to the story, Amane Misa, who seems to be a brat at first glance, but to me she is only a girl in love who tries to do whatever in her power to be with someone. And lastly, Ryuk, whose only sole purpose was to get some 'fun' and view the 'interesting creatures' while away from the Shinigami world. \
What really got me for the Yagami Light character was that his name is Light, but here he is, killing criminals left and right which, to me, seems like an abnormally DARK thing to do. Also, L's penchant for sweets just seemed to tickle my insides until I couldn't help but laugh. I mean, come on, if you ate that many sweets and sat around all day, wouldn't you be as fat as a horse?!\
Art: The drawings for the characters and the scenery were beautiful, to say the least. While watching the show I did not see one mar in any of the episodes. And the drawings of the Shinigami were spectacular. If someone were to look up Death God, you would see Ryuk, darkness, wings, and all. I also liked how they drew so many interesting characters into the show. Each were unique in their own way.\
Sound: Clear.as.a.bell. Everything that was annunciated was heard with perfection. The first introduction song for the show was beautiful and fit so well with the mood DeathNote is trying to make. The verses really just connected with the Light and L. Then the second introduction song was extremely death-metal that fit how the criminals are dropping like flies under Light's wrath. \
Overall: I've never really been into the mystery genre until I got a look at DeathNote when it appeared on Adult Swim a few months prior. After the first episode I have to admit that I was hooked. Every word of every line my eyes followed until the end, where I immediately got out another episode. The show was so good that from episodes 12 to 37, I started watching each and every episode in a row without stopping, well unless I had to eat. If you like edge-of-your-seat suspense, thought-provoking mysteries, and paranormal/fantasy anime, DeathNote lies in your immediate future.",

    After a long wait, Death Note episode 25 is finally out thanks to Kuro_Hana fansubbers ^.^ I still think the anime/manga turned a bit weird after episodes 20 or so... But thanks to the new developments in the storyline, I'm still gonna be hooked ^.^\
Death note is DEFINITELY  my current anime favorite.  Although it doesn't have that usual samurai skilled-magical -boy fantasy power-upping appeal that i usually look for in anime, this one certainly got me addicted.\
The basic premise of the storyline is unique and simple.  But with the battle of minds that ensues, it certainly doesn't sound as simple as that.\
          \
         Saying 'this is a story of two geniuses trying to outwit each other'  is really a kind of understatement of the year.\
The animation is good, and faithful to the manga.  At times i think the scenes are too dark, but it only added to the overall appeal of the anime, since it does deal with death.  The sound effects  could have been improved a bit.. there are times I feel that i've heard them in some suspense film/series before.  A great storyline like this deserves a RAWR soundtrack.  But the opening and ending songs are fine with me ^_^\
Characterization.. superb!  You'll really get to love the characters as the story goes along, and finds fault with them too.  It just goes to show how good the character development is.  ^_^   (hmmm, light or L? light or L?) lol actually, i'm favoring L myself ^.^  he's eccentric and adorable and so squooooooooshy huggable ^_^  *kisses L smack on the lips*  xP\

    Death Note is, for me, the best mystery anime to ever exist. It is an essential viewing for those who want to dig deep into the mind of people whose actions you may or may not agree with. Perhaps that is the reason why I loved it so much.\
PROS\
To start, this anime has an important theme - the definition of right and wrong. Yes, this theme has been used to death (no pun intended) on other anime, TV shows, and movies as well. Yet, no other story has come as close to understanding this theme as much as Death Note. The question of whether it\
          \
        is right or wrong to kill someone because they are \"bad\" is an interesting idea. I can imagine that many people who have seen Death Note might side with Light, the main character of the story. Of course, there are those who are against such that would probably go with L. Ether way, the debate of such an idea is quite interesting and I am glad this series brought it up. A series that makes you ponder such issues, although impossible, is of importance.\
It should be no surprise to anyone that this series looks gorgeous. Death Note is developed by Madhouse, the same studio that made Gunslinger Girl and Highschool of the Dead. Whether you like their past anime or not, there is no denying the fact that they know how to make an anime look great. It stays the same here.\
The best compliment I can give Death Note is that it is the most well written anime I've ever watched. If you are one of those people that is dying to find a great written piece of work - this is it. Everything, from the dialogue spoken to the characters, to the story itself, is at its highest form. To say that there are twists and turns in this anime would be an understatement. The writer of this anime, Tsugumi Ohba, is able to create very clever changes in each episode. Some of these surprises can come in 5 minute intervals. It is really quite extraordinary and I applaud the writer for being as good as he is.\
Continuing with the writing of the story is the characters. Each character is very interesting and due to certain actions, you ether root for them or go against them. This can differ from viewer to viewer, depending on what kind of person you are. As said above, you might be someone who roots for others to get killed by the notebook, or you might root for the killer to die. I can imagine that the audience for this is divided. \
CONS\
The intros for this series sucks - really sucks. I love Death Note more than I can possibly describe, but the intros have to be some of the worst I have ever seen. The first intro that came on every episode was bad, but I could kind of deal with it. The second, though, was completely unacceptable. This is a mystery anime series, so why is the intro making it seem like there is so much action in it..I was very disappointed with it. The death metal song used was unbearable. I actually forced myself to skip it every time I began an episode. I didn't have to do this with the first intro, although it was already bad.\
The dub for this anime is poor. I watched the complete series in sub form, but I tested myself to watch some of the dub version as well after I finished watching the series. Every character, dubbed, sounded awful. I highly recommend to watch he sub version if you are going to start seeing this series. Bear in mind that I have no problem with dubbed anime. I have seen a lot of dubbed and subbed anime, and haven't had many problems with both, but Death Note should NOT be seen in dubbed form. It's bad.\
OVERALL\
Death Note is hard to describe, in terms of how great it is. Very few words can live up to this excellent piece of work. While I did have some small gripes with the series, as a whole, it is extremely close to being the best anime I've ever seen. Art, story, and characters are all at the highest form of entertainment for the viewer. Once again, if you do plan on seeing Death Note, please view the subbed version. It is the only acceptable form for such an incredible ride, like this one. \

    Power. Be it in the form of wealth, influence or any other, we all know that it can change the people who have it. We are quick to call the rich, the politicians and many others corrupted when they abuse their power. And we often say that it should be us that had it, that we would be able to use it for the greater good and for that only.\
The truth is... we never know how corruptive power can be, until we have it in our hands. And, even if we don't realise our corruption, it shows to the ones around us. We may think\
          \
        that we are using the power we are given to fight evil... but what is evil and what is good? If everything has a cause, then so does evil, and, if so, is the cause also evil? Is then everything evil? In the end, do good and evil truly exist? And who has the right to say so?\
These are the questions you 'll be asking yourself as you watch \"Death Note\". The whole series is a battle of morals in the characters' heads and a battle of wits between Yagami Light, the person bestowed with power capable to change the world, and the people who try to uncover him and put him to justice. In the beggining of the story, you will almost certainly find yourself supporting Light and his ethics to the fullest. But, by the time you reach the finale, that will probably have drastically changed. As Light's character would have changed from the person with the pure motive of cleansing the world from (what he perceives as) evil to a monster that won't hesitate to toy with the feelings and lives of humans and gods alike, to acheive his own selfish goals. As the story goes, his hybris constantly becomes bigger and bigger. In the end, will he receive divine retribution for his attrocious acts, or will he become a God on earth?\
The story and the way it unfolds strongly reminds me of another show, coming from the other side of the pacific... namely, \"Dexter\". In fact, their story and plot are so similar (save for the supernatural element in \"Death Note\") it's almost suspicious. For those who 've seen \"Dexter\", the phrase which summarises \"Death Note\" is \"Anime Dexter on steroids\". And probably crack as well.\
 To the more technical aspects of the show, you can't really find something to be unhappy about. The art and animation are done really well, and particularly the designs of the deathgods were quite imaginative. The voice acting is almost perfect, with the characters' feelings and personalities succesfully portrayed in their voices. I don't have much to say for the opening and closing animations, except that the second OP kicks a**.\
Well, even though most agree that \"Death Note\" is a masterpiece, it is, like everything else, not without it's flaws. There are mainly two things I didn't like.\
- Misa. I cannot decide if I adore her for her cuteness and sexyness, I admire her for her detective skills or absolutly hate her for being the world's biggest IDIOT (with all the letters in capital) when she is around Light. Really, she can be so pathetic at times, it hurts to watch. In a series where all the characters' personalities seem somewhat realistic, hers seems like it came straight out of \"Pink Panther\". \
- The ending. Or rather the way we come to it. Because the ending itself is fantastic by all means, but the last episode as a whole feels like:\
\"-OK boys, look, we've only got budget worth for one more episode, so let's wrap it up and go for a drink. Oh, and the story will end like THIS.\
 -But, boss, we can't go from HERE to THERE in one episode. It won't make any sense no matter how we present it.\
 -No, you can't. But you will.\"\
Yeah, whatever.\
Anyway, these and some other minor problems are not enough to deter me from saying that \"Death Note\" is one of the best anime series ever created and an absolute must-see for everyone. It is the most popular anime here in MAL, and that is for a good reason.\

    I'll start by saying that this is my all-time favourite anime. Oh, and I'm a girl.\
This may be shounen (marketed to a male audience of 10+), and I can see how guys would be more attracted to this sort of plot, but it's a masterpiece that, in my opinion, both guys and girls will enjoy.\
The concept itself is very simple: Light, a bored, but brilliant high school student, wants to build a new world free of criminals and has the perfect tool in his hands to do so. What makes it so good is how well its developed, and how realistic it feels. You literally\
          \
        get sucked into the story and find yourself torn in between supporting Light - he is the main character after all, and we usually root for them, don't we? - and wanting to rip his throat out for some of the things he does to get what he wants. Yes, it's as intense as it sounds!\
The art isn't the detailed kind, but I really like the lighting effects throughout the series. It sets the mood perfectly. The soundtrack also does that. It may seem overly dramatic if you listen to it by itself, but it worked really well. And yes, lame as it sounds, I ended up downloading every track after watching the anime!\
I'm aware that there are several other reviews for this, but it just seemed wrong not to review something I enjoyed so much. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE, BOYS AND GIRLS ALIKE!\

    My first anime, and a very good series overall. Between the character development, story in general, music and constant cliff-hangers, \"Death Note\" is definitely a series to watch, in my opinion.\
While I personally felt that the story lagged after the death of a certain character, the story somewhat picked itself back up after. They were missed, but their death wasn't in vain -- there was a legitimate reason behind it.\
The art and attention to detail in the series is excellent. Although there are moments -- especially in the series' few action sequences -- where I feel some things are over-done a tad, it doesn't at\
          \
        all detract from the quality of the storytelling. The voice acting (watched in sub) and music are both excellent.\

    One of the best anime out there, Death Note gave me a different perception of world, and changed my opinion for anime industry.\
Story: A refreshing original story with a lot of suspence driving you crazy. A story that compines a lot of elements as horror, drama, action even and some romance with a magnificent way. Based in a ethical question: Does it is right to kill humans so you can create the perfect world?. The answer depends one the viewer, and his moral. You will get caught in an amazing chase between Light and L. 10/10\
Art: They say the eyes display the true character of\
          \
        a human, and that is what I noticed in this anime.Realistic and simple drawn people but detailed and unique. Also good grapghics. 9/10\
Sound: Well, both the openings and the endings were not something special. But the sound during the episode fitted perfectly. Creating emotions like suspence. The actors were pretty good, the voices fitted perfectly the characters. 8/10\
Characters: The characters of this anime were all unique, completed personalities with different beliefs that clashed through the anime. Their past is also very interesting and makes you want to know more for them. The main protagonist or antagonist it depends the way of your thinking is a perfect human that hides his true personality. Normally he is a sociopath that shows his true colours when he finds the death note. His plan is to make the perfect world with no criminals, he likes perfection, and he acts only to accomplish his target . L was also quite a memorable character, he knows how to deal with even the most difficult situations,he is a truly smart human and he is quite the sad character to watch. He might look like the complete opposite with Light but I think he have alot of common with him. 10/10\
Enjoyment: The most enjouing part is the first, but I cant say that i didnt like and the second part. Light and L are like in a game of cat and mouse playing both characters and they make some unbelievable tricks. 9/10\
One of my favourite, I hope you enjoy watching it.\

    It's hard to categorize Death Note at times it's so faced paced and then other times it seems to slow down to a stand still. The characters L and Light who face each other in a duel to reveal the identity of the entity known as 'Kira.'..oh yeah theres also Ryuk the friendly neighborhood Shinigami (Lit. 'Death God' \
Without giving too much away the battle between L and Light becomes much more personal rather then a game which it is sometimes made out to be. Both characters are geniuses in their own respect and ultimately the story reflects their attitudes. The imagery and beautiful background\
          \
        provide a lot of insight into who these two characters are as we learn their personal motives and dig deeper into Death note's philosophy.   \
Now in some respects the series seems very comical with side characters like Misa Misa who plays a strong role in supporting Light who appears indifferent towards Misa. Then Ryuk who plays a neutral stance towards Light neither helping or hurting him but acting more of a navigator with side commentary and a love for apples. \
The important thing about Death Note is that it is in very real terms close to the way of thought of many philosophers. I loved the action, timing, and presentation. It truly reflects a style of anime that brings a sense of originality and creativity. Which to sum up is\

    For starters, this is Death Note.  An anime deemed \"favorite\" by so many fans.  And understandably so.  It has great story components including nothing less than a psychological death match between two compelling characters.\
There are a few times when the dialogue is almost laughably dramamtic.  And there are a few leaps of logic made that are questionably outside the deductive abilities of mere humans.  But all is forgiven, at least by most.  The intense story, the interesting characters so real and so unusual, and the at times complicated manuevering of Yagami Light override any few and trivial faults. \
          \
        Just give in to the ride.  Don't nitpick.\
Light is often compared to Lelouch of Code Geass, both being under the label of Anti-hero.  Light however doesn't really qualify as anti-hero.  He is, heart and soul, a self-serving megalomaniacal psychopath willing to sacrifice even those close to him to protect himself and his power.  He operates under the guise of \"justice\" but his demonic smiles and power thirst give him away.\
Don't be fooled though, Death Note is good no matter who wins the death match, Light or L.\
As for Near...he is a sad substitute.  :(\
Ryuk is a shinigami after mine own heart.  Turning attention to the foibles of humans to alleviate boredom.  And he has a great chuckle.  The dangling heart earring?  Perfect.\
L is one of the more intriguing characters in any anime.\
If you download a torrent to watch, I recommend avoiding the one subbed by The Subbers in the Rye (TSR).  They actually messed up at least two of the \"epic\" lines of the show.\
The last half of the last episode is pretty intense.\
As for the basics; the art is good.  Nothing truly amazing or extraordinary...but quality.  The most visually interesting animation art for me occurs in the closing theme for episodes 20 - 36.\
The music throughout is well chosen, very mood appropriate.\
Death Note is one of those anime that is among many people's top choices and as such is classic and a definite must see, if you haven't already.\

    Story:\
\"Deep\". There's one word to describe Death Note. When I first began watching this, I knew it was going to involve some paranormal/horror factor. But since I noticed how attractive the protagonist was, I'd expected it to have romance. Then I realized, three episodes in, that Light Yagami was actually the antagonist in a way, because of his monsterousness. I was completely shocked but at the same time pulled into it even more. The storyline is very complex and it keeps you right in front of it. Even if you're not into the whole creepy psycho horror thing, I think anyone can enjoy it. One\
          \
        more thing: Light's character is absolutely brilliant. There are so many surprising twists to the plot and it is quite riveting if you ask me.\
Art:\
The art is very detailed. It is definitely different from shoujo anime. It was creative and realistic. The characters almost resembled real people. Characters' faces had fine lines and wrinkles, something I really appreciated. The faces Light made when he was being crazy looked a little psychotic and weird to me, though. I laughed at them more than cowered in fear lol.\
Sound: \
I loved all of it. The beginning theme was like metal rock, and it was very new to me. Most of the songs in the anime were lovely piano pieces, and brought spectacular emotion to the scenes.\
Character:\
You've got a psychopath as your protagonist. How much better could it get? You've also got his rival, a good guy but technically the antagonist. Then we have the shinigami, which had great personality. The characters, as I have said before, are just like real life people. \
Enjoyment:\
Like I said, I didn't expect the plot I got when I decided to watch Death Note. Still, I was sucked into it. It's not something you would expect to like. I was still a little upset that there was no romance, but then again, he was evil and only loved himself.\
Overall:\
Outstanding. I don't really have any complaints, but it would have been pretty sweet if he fell in love or something. But that's just me.\

    I consider Death Note the best anime ever made.\
 The plot, the caracters, the music, the animation, everything is so connected and well put. \
It's also true that in the middle or so, is not that good as it was at first, but the last episode is so mind blowing that it made it worthy.\
I remember te first time that I watched the last episode and I was completely in shock. I mean, I know that Light was really messed up and even though his intentions at first were good, the power of the death note turned him into one of the best villains ever.\
          \
And that's the funny thing about Death Note; the leading caracter is the antagonist of the story.\
Finally, Death Note is a anime that will make you think: Does the end truly justifies the means? (obviously my answer is no)\

    When mortals gain the ability to determine the deaths of their neighbors, they start to believe themselves to be God. Death Note is without a doubt, one of the best anime of all time where a game of wits plays out between a young man with a God complex and an eccentric investigator who is obsessed with solving the case.\
It all starts when a notebook falls from the sky and a young man named Yagami Light picks it up, he later finds out that it is called the Death Note and that if someone writes somebody’s name on it, then they can kill them in\
          \
        any way. Light begins to believe that he should just kill all the criminals in the world so that he can cleanse the taint and feels that he should rule over everyone. He then starts murdering them in ways that has baffled the police.\
This anime will make one question what is right or wrong. Is it alright to kill convicted felons? Was their crime severe enough that they deserve the death sentence? Do we have the right to pass judgement on to those we don’t even know? But this isn’t where the anime excels at, it is when a famous investigator catches wind of the strange phenomenon. L plays the guessing game to find out just who the killer is, while Light continues his killing spree and tries his best in avoiding the eyes of L while trying to learn his true name in order to kill him through the Death Note.\
The way the story moves is something that will leave you on the edge of your seat each episode. There is something amazing in how it draws you in and always gives you a great sense of thrill and amazement as to how they are able to continue playing the game of cat and mouse.\
Light and L are what drives the show to its full potential. Light is charismatic, extremely smart, good looking, and is a psychopath who is hell bent on ruling the world through his perceived notion of justice. Not to mention he can make eating a potato chip look cool.\
L is creepy, eccentric, beyond brilliant, observant, and has a sweet tooth. He is the only one who can truly fight Light on equal footing despite his feet always being on the chair. The two compliment each other so well that it is nothing more than the perfect rivalry between two of the greatest minds in anime.\
The anime is one hell of a ride in the 1st half but the 2nd half just feels bland in comparison. Things could have ended in a nearly perfect sense at one point but the creators decided to stretch it out even further and it doesn’t ever feel as satisfying towards the end. Although there was a decent amount of satisfaction to be had at the very end of this amazing journey where it sort of redeemed the entire 2nd half but still felt lackluster when compared to how far the 1st half went.\
This anime is complex with a lot of twists and turns that will put ones mind to the test. This is one of the most satisfying series to have ever existed and it is the perfect one to watch for those who are looking for a suspenseful show with deep psychological and morally impacting lessons that would make one question what they would ever do if they ever had that kind of power in their hands. Would they follow in the path of Light and cleanse the world of their own definition of evil people? Would they be just like L and find out the truth of the mysterious power and ensure that no mortal would ever use something that is beyond the level of curses? Or would they create their own definition of justice that they will then show to everyone else in the world?\

    Death Note is easily one of the best Anime ever created and I would have loved to give it a 10/10 for the first 26 episodes. It is really a great masterpiece. \
The story is incredibly well-thought out and well-written.\
If it just wasn't for the last 11 episodes. \
The new characters were lame and the execution of the story started to suffer a lot. It started to become less and less credible and less and less interesting.\
Even so it is still an amazing Anime that I would recommend to everyone. The first 26 eps were the best I have ever seen in an Anime up\
          \
        to date.\

    Death Note was the first Anime I've ever watched, so I was surprised I haven't even written a review for it yet.\
Arguably one of the best Anime's of all time, Death Note, unlike any other show, made me want to binge it constantly. With such a great pace to keep you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode, I felt so guilty binge watching a couple of episodes per weekend.\
The reasons why I felt so guilty was just how everything worked together so well. Example; The soundtrack really tied in during the characters thought process or a climatic moment, the\
          \
        art showed the true nature of what pure evil looks like, and to top it all off - the voice acting was stellar. \
If you haven't seen this Anime, give it a go.\
If you have dropped this Anime, give it another shot.\
That's all I really have to say, thank you for reading.",

The art, sound and characters were epic. You can tell a lot of effort went into making this series as enjoyable as possible.\
The only thing that puts it down for me is the ending. I was a little disappointed.\

    Own, Online Viewing, or Evade\
I’d say a show Definitely worth Owning.\
The Blu-ray release is the best way to own this great show.\
Overall Rating 8/10\
A notebook falls from the sky and this if found by a bored, high school genius Light Yagami.  The rules written on the inside cover include the title of this review, \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\"  \
It's a story about shinigami, death gods, and guy who believe's he's the one true judge, jury, and executioner.  An amazing show that pits the clever and dangerous Light Yagami against the great and secretive detective \"L\".\
          \
         For a show that has this much death, there really isn't many fights to speak of.  The battle of wit and cunning drive the show to a unique drama and intensity that really can't be missed.  \
The total show has 39 episodes.  I cant say I know the exact episode but part way there is a major change.  Ignore what you may have read online.  The show completes at episode 39.  It's still a solid show after this major event and of course it doesn't conclude until the end...\
Theme Songs 8/10 \
This series has some great music, a good opening and ending. Fast paced, I didn’t skip them.\
Theme Songs [2nd op & ed] 10/10\
The 2nd opening & ending themes are excellent.  The power and intensity of these songs make them some of the best themes across all anime.\
Ending 8/10\
NO spoilers, the total end was solid enough. It's about what you expect or the opposite.  The end concluded what it should, nothing more and nothing less.\

    Sigh........\
The first 25 episodes of this show were absolutely amazing. If this show had ended at episode 25, I would've given it a perfect 10/10 easily. The battle between Light and L had me on the edge of my seat every episode. I have re-watched these first 25 episodes at least 4 times without getting bored. They were really that good.\
Unfortunately the last 12 felt like a cheap attempt at replicating what the first 25 did so well. The twists felt forced, the characters felt like caricatures and the ending just didn't feel natural. Still one of my favorite shows, I just felt like the\
          \
        ending spoiled the great start. \
I'd still recommend people to watch this show just for the significance of it. This show got me into anime, and it's sad it couldn't have ended better.\

    Death note\
Well to start this off.This anime gave me such brain problems it wasn’t even funny I still get puzzled at what happened and trying to get an end picture in the end i still just don’t see it. but anyways So why did I rate this amazing/very popular anime a rating a of 8 well with this I point to the last 12 episodes.\
So what happens that make this anime spiral out of control well for non-spoilers sake I’m not going to tell, however you will be able to tell when this happens. \
Also just saying if death note had of ended at episode\
          \
        26 with maybe a extra episode of 27. 10/10 would be the only score you could give this anime it even if you hated this anime. Sadly this was not the case. (although ending it there as well would not feel right either)\
Although I do respect that they stuck with light’s (the main character) characteristic all the way to the end. However I feel that with the amount of plot holes left. I finished watching death note with the feeling of disappointment. This may be that in the end I have the thinking that a sequel is coming or was planned. But in the end I’m certain that how death note has ended as with its amount of success it has had and that for there to be a continuation it will more than likely lead to various problems. So a sequel will more than certainly never happen. There is also the fact that there is the feeling that this is how the creator wanted, death note to finish anyways.\
In conclusion even though I despised the ending I still thoroughly enjoyed this anime (this is a guy that generally hates this type of genre). Even after finishing watching this anime it still gave me headache weeks after. So in the end if you are put off because of the ending I say that you should still watch this top quality anime as you will enjoy the ride. ",

    I found Death Note to be great, dramatic, supernatural and suspenseful!  I highly recommend this anime if you also like protagonists who evolve into villains.\
-Story-\
The story is overall very good.  I found the first half of the series better than the second, though.  There's so many twists and turns in the plot and the tense battle of wits between Light and L create so many nail-biting moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. \
What I find really good about this anime is that it doesn't really make you sympathize with Light, even if he is the main character. \
          \
        He's a horrible, egotistical, homicidal person with a god complex and it's enthralling. \
Personally, I like the ending of the anime a little better than the manga.  I found it more poetic.\
However, if you dislike Light a lot, I would probably recommend reading the manga.  I feel the ending would be much more satisfying for you.\
-Art-\
Very well done.  At times it seems a little over dramatic (and somewhat hilarious.)  Literally Light Yagami is just sitting at his desk scribbling names onto paper and there's too much flourish into it.  But anyway, the art style is very good.\
-Sound-\
Voice acting is good.  I find it very interesting that the Death Note Main theme has such a heavy monastic style (very fitting for Light's desire to cleanse the world and become a God) and sounds suspiciously like O Fortuna from Carmina Burana.\
-Character-\
This anime offers a lot of interesting character with interesting backstories, personalities, and developments.  If you're fond of people descending into cut-throat madness, then you'll certainly enjoy watching Light evolve throughout the series.\

    A boring life of extraordinary smart studen, Light Yagami, gets to taste some justice and fun. Even if you aren't fan of detective TV shows/movies, this show will definitely take you places. As for someone who enjoys mind games and remorseless killing of people, I'd be willing to erase my memory of seeing this just to see it AGAIN with all that tension.\
I get that a lot of people hate the show since end of 25th episode or so, but it couldn't have ended there. Even masterpiece like this has to end the right way to preserve the right end.\

    I understand that Death Note has a very large following.\
People enjoy its dark and complex story line. The concept of the death note, in which people die if their names are written in it, is quite interesting. This simple concept is the fuel for a greater story that is this show.\
Unfortunately, the show crashes really hard at a certain point. \
It reaches a really high point and you expect some great weaving of plots and actions taken by characters. The story then spirals down and down as the author struggled to figure out where the story is being taken. Very expected outcomes occur or certain\

        impossible or confusing situations occur that are clearly thrown in to fill up holes in the plot or as explanations to things.\

    Death Note isn't really the best show ever but, it isn't that bad. At the beginning like around the first 9 episodes, it was really one heck of a ride. Then of course, it's story got complicated and the story goes down.\
There's this kid named Light Yagami - a bored High-school genius, one day, saw a notebook that fell from the sky. That notebook is the \"Death Note\". One particular rule of that notebook states that \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\". At first, he thought that this is some kind of crazy prank pulled off by someone. Then, later\
          \
        on, he decided to keep it with him. He opened his TV and saw that there was a hostage crisis going on. The face and the name of that hostage taker was shown on TV. He decided to test the \"Death Note\" and wrote that Hostage taker's name. Of course, he was still doubting that this is all of a joke. Until 6 minutes and 40 seconds later, that hostage taker died. He thought it was all a coincidence. Until, he wrote other criminal's name. That's the time he thought that he could bring justice to the whole world and become a new \"God\". Later on, after many criminals were killed, the Japanese people called him \"Kira\" - some people thinks that he is the savior while some people thinks that this is not a right thing to do.\
As the killing goes on, there's one detective named \"L\" (It's not his real name). He decided to investigate this case and find out who is \"Kira\".\
That's where the thrill kicks in. A battle between cat and mouse - between L and Kira. This is also a clash of ideals on which ideals are right and wrong.\
The first 9 episodes were really engaging and it made me want to watch more... Until Episode 10 kicks in and the story goes down.\
The story of Death Note from Episode 10 onward is just complicated. It tries too hard and it drags the show like a long-running Shonen anime (This is indeed a Shonen anime but, you know what I mean). Because of that complication, the story isn't that thrilling anymore and the game of cat and mouse was gone. Though, that's all I can say for now because I don't want to spoil.\
I'll tell you though on where it gets back up and that is at Episode 25 where one major character dies. After Episode 25? It goes down again.\
What made the story complicated? To me, it definitely has to be the adding of more characters. There were so much characters that were unnecessary despite them relating to the main plot. For example, Misa or the \"Second Kira\".\
For the ending... Well... I know how many people considered the ending \"bad\" but, it's decent in my opinion. It just shows who won and who lost and which ideal really stands. I have no complains with the ending.\
Death Note's animation really fits the show's theme. The dark shade that it surrounds really fits the psychological theme of the show. There were a lot of crazy animation like Yagami just eating a bag of potato chips or Yagami writing down the name of the criminals which made it look intense as ever. I also like how the animation switches when they're thinking by switching colors. For example, Light's hair turns red and L's hair turns blue.\
Many people will disagree but I still think Code Geass's OST is better than Death Note. HOWEVER, Death Note's soundtrack is still outstanding. The intense, orchestrated music really fits the show's theme. Also, the theme's played during the investigation also fits the show's theme.\
When it comes to Death Note's opening and ending theme, they're better than Code Geass. If Death Note's first opening theme was good, the second one was better. The heavy metal theme of the second opening was great and it fits the psychological theme of the show. This also includes the second ending theme.\
For the characters, Light Yagami and \"L\" are the ones that stand out the most. Light Yagami's ideals is to kill all criminals while L doesn't believe on that ideal. Because of this clash of ideal, it is hard to tell whether Light Yagami is a good guy, an anti-hero or a bad guy. \
Light Yagami is just a natural genius. He really plans out the situation very well so, he won't fail in the future. He also has a personality where he always want to win. His traits are also similar with L except that he opposes his ideal, winning really doesn't matter to him and of course, he looks and acts weird.\
Other characters include Soichiro Yagami and co-workers like Matsuda and they're great but, other characters that were added from Episode 10 onward like Misa, is just unnecessary and complicates the story.\
Misa is just a cheerful girl who admires Kira's ideal. She also happens to be the second Kira though, I won't explain a lot of that. \
After Episode 25, more was added like Near and Mello. Near was necessary to conclude the story but Mello? He seems to be a guy who just interferes. Near shares similar traits with L but Mello doesn't. Mello always wants to win over Near and he is willing to solve the case first before Near does.\
There were more like Mikumi, Takada who praised L but, these people just felt like they were dragging the story too much.\
Is Death Note worth watching? Well, it's your choice. If you're not really bothered with stories trying hard to extend then,  you might enjoy this choice. Despite the extensions, there are indeed some parts of it where the thrill was still there. Though, it doesn't maintain it.\
I felt like Death Note was an anime that was too long perhaps. It was just draggy and it made the story look bad.\

The story line is great, it is the main reason you should watch it.If you like an anime that makes you THINK, then you must watch this, I ended up watching 1 episode due to being recomended to watch it by a college friend, I literally sat and watched all episodes in one sitting, I was totally hooked from the first episode.\
Now about characterisation..\
The characters all rock, have their own personalities which makes you love em and hate 'em simultaneously, You end up rooting for both sides, the good and \"bad\"\

        because of it, it's very entertaining to watch.\

    Let me start by just saying that this is one of the best and most popular anime series of all time. Death Note has a great story and is very unpredictable on how events are going to turn out. The basic premise is two geniuses going head to head in a battle of wits that will keep you on edge as things pan out. The main characters development is great and does a good job showing how his though off himself and others completely change from beginning to end. The are isn't very colorful and uses lots of dark colors but it fits the story\

        and atmosphere very well. There are a handful of characters and all serve a purpose in this story, some aren't developed to great while some are, overall the characters are interesting and show different sides of the story. This series is very enjoyable for its very plot driven story and not much action elements but the psychological  aspect will definitely keep you sucked in. The music is outstanding and is one of the best soundtracks in my opinion of any series because it describes the situations,mood, and characters perfectly. Overall this is a MUST SEE for anyone even if they're not an anime fan. If you haven't seen this by now and consider yourself an anime fan watch this right now.",

    Where to begin when you want to review a classic like DEATH NOTE? \
And a classic it is, indeed.\
Death Note was, and still is, one of the few animes that showed us that you do not need super muscles and insane large-scale battles to have true action.\
This is a PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE show, no kamehamehas of the sort, mind only.\
The entire series relies upon TWO RIVALS. \
One is Light Yagami, a talented and charismatic young man who stumbles upon a death-giving notebook, and choses to use this tool to make justice in the world by himself, eventually becoming a mass murderer.\
The other is a detective only known\
          \
        as ''L'' , he is the best of the best, never failed once, but a normal person would see him as shaggy and weird. He is the one designed to stop Light.\
These two will put on quite a show, trying to have the best on each other, creating a cat-and-mouse game where you never know which is which. They really are the heart and soul of the series, and even tho the supporting cast is quite good as well, none of them can even compare to the main protagonists.\
Light is straight up malicious and terrifying (not to mention quite mad) but you just can't help but sympathize  with him due to his charm and intelligence.\
L, on the other hand, is just as much of a badass. While looking very laid back at times, he will prove his fame of best in the world, putting up a true challenge for the death-god he is facing.\
This epic showdown will leave you wandering: ''What is the true meaning of justice? What is bad? What does it mean to be good? Who should I side with?''. I'll leave the answer to those questions to you.\
Everithing of the SOUND department is awesome too, from the voice acting to the OST to openings and endings.\
While being kind of an ''old'' series at this day and age, Death Note got old really well as far as ART and ANIMATION are concerned, keeping a very-high level for the entire series.\
''So if everything is so godlike, why did it not get a higher rating?'', You might ask.\
I would have to get into heavy spoilers to explain you that, but lets just say that the chess game Death Note is, is awesome because of those two guys and in the last bit of the show that rivalry is just put aside. The obvious consequence is that the enjoyment of the anime is drastically reduced, and that must affect the rating.\
So, for any of you fools who still didn't watch Death Note, do it. \
It is a MUST of this medium and most of the series is just straight up 10/10, pure gold.\
Particularly suggested to fans of thrillers and mistery, but also for those who enjoy a show to be, well, ''smart''.\
Not for people wanting something very laid back and relaxing.\

    Death Note’s mainstream appeal is something that clearly has earned the rights to have. It’s easy  to pick up at any point in your life. Well crafted plot twists, great voice acting both sub and dub and clever writing will simply keep your intrested though the entire thing.\
Light Yagami is your everyday high school student till he comes into contact with the death note a magical notebook that can kill anyone by writing their full name in it while picturing their face in which they will simply die of a heart attack in the next 40 seconds.

          \
        for the temptation of the death note with the ideology of becoming the god of the new world in which he strives to create over the course of the show by killing criminals, This capture the attention of the japanese police and later on the world top detective L as they battle Light who has now been dub Kira by socially setting up what could only be described as a game of chess where every major character is nothing more than a pawn in Light’s and L’s battle of wits. \
Every move made by L and Light are logical and are explain well enough for every viewer to follow with ease. Each character remains interesting throughout the entire show as the dynamics of everyone's relationship with each other makes you become attached to everyone of the major players in the story despite not changing all that much throughout the story.\
Sadly the artwork mainly for the backgrounds all just kind of blend together and overall lacks details and soon the animation falls into this problem with many later episodes just being still images and panning shots which if not for the interesting conflicts that come up in the story I would find this show falling into mediocrity which can be a common problem in most animated trillers and dramas. Thankfully the music is great at coavying the tone of the story and the Gothic atmosphere. The World which is the first opening captures Light ascending to godhood and the battle between him and L while What’s up people? Capture Light’s Descent into madness.\
However Death note biggest problem is it second arc which just pulls new characters out of nowheres with nothing interesting about them as the pacing of the show travels at breakneck speeds, the other characters just become boring shells of what they were in the first arc, the writing of the show suffer from the pacing and things are re explain way to much with the only saving grace being that the show animation improves somewhat but at the cost of some episodes becoming more like a action thriller which the show is not supposed to be. The ending of the second arc while having the most over the top laugh scene ever is where the show finally hits rock bottom and kills your enjoyment as a plot twist is just pulled out of nowheres with no foreshadowing or anything.\
Overall the show is not flawless but it’s worth watching the first arc for the tightly constructed plot and character dynamics, the themes of ideological conflicts, godhood and temptation as well as being understandable for everyone no matter their age though the use of clever writing, while the second arc is poorly constructed it’s still entertaining mainly to see how fast the arc can hit rock bottom for yourself ",

    Light in all his vainglory was rendered helpless in his moment of reckoning. That is the remainder of the Death Note manga (post-chapter 58) in a nutshell... Oh shit, where to begin. Death Note anime episodes 1-25 is gold and Death Note anime's second half \"Season 2\" (post-chapter 58 in the manga) is a trip into the abyss of cringeville.

    This was one anime that I was heavily interested in the moment I heard of it. The whole concept sounded incredibly interesting to me. Death Note is one of the first animes ive seen and its also one of the most well known anime of all time. The manga was written by Tsunami Ohba and although it wasn't very long it was still highly successful with over 30 million copies sold. Studio Madhouse made an anime adaption of Death Note and you can almost predict that it was gonna be good at worst, with Madhouse being one of anime's best studios. So how good was\

        Death Note, Im bout to explain.***contains MINOR spoilers***\

Story:9/10\
So clever and deep that it's nearly impossible to not be interested in. What I really loved was how suspenseful it is, so much suspense and gives a lot of chills to the point where it's almost like we're watching a horror. It also refers to the phrase, \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\", which adds a lot of thought provoke for the audience. Also contains a lot of plot twists that would make your jaw drop. The cat and mouse game however is what centers the plot and it was this that really made the story standout. It's incredibly written, extremely well paced, and also kinda manipulative. It's one of those few anime where you would actually wanna watch the \"villain\" win, watching a bored intelligent student that slowly develops sociopathic like tendencies was what I call terrifying delightful. However as disappointed it is to say this, it wasn't perfect. After a certain character dies the story quality in the second half of the series starts to slowly decrease. It becomes less enjoyable and repetitive and although it wasn't bad it wasn't nearly as great as the first half of the series. Even so it gave us an AMAZING finale that couldn't have been done any better and gave the series a great conclusion. It's a storyline that's simple enough to understand but at the same time deep enough to get the audience to think. What would you do if owned the Death Note ?? How would you use it ?? Would you use it at all ?? This was a special story that surpasses many that I've seen.\

Studio Madhouse, I could just leave it like this you and would know that the animation was incredible. Artwork was great; drawn very serious and at times can look gloomy. Never have I seen an anime with a more realistic look than this series. Unlike most anime, Death Note NEVER uses the cliche anime facial expressions, the characters look normal but very real and serious as if your watching a tv series. There isn't a character with huge breasts, or someone with an insane looking hairstyle, or really anything that would stand out form the rest of the cast. Character designs for the Shinigami were very cool and creative w/o looking too distracting. They look exactly what I would expect death gods to look like.  Animation was excellent, a lot of consistency and no lacking. Movements were smooth backgrounds were given a realistic look the animators definitely put great effort here but then again that's Madhouse for ya.\
Sound:10/10\
In a thriller series like this you need music to give its audience that dark vibe, and boy it succeeded very well. The Music is great and fits extremely well for the series. Has very good opening and ending themes, plus great background music that sets the tone for the mood and settings. Its first ending theme, \"Alumnia\" was one of my favorite tracks as it was such a great choice that gave you this sinister thrilling feel that was very catchy as well. But my number one favorite would have to be, \"Low Of Solipsism\" it was a background track that to this date gives me chills down my spine. This beautiful, gothic, gloomy track was mainly used for the murdering scenes and it couldn't have any better. The English dub was also fantastic, this has to be one of the best dubs anime has had in a while. Brad Swaile absolutely nailed Light's character giving him a fitting youthful voice as well as a sinister laugh that portrays his sociopathic like personality. Alessandro Juliani and Brian Drummond did great jobs as L and Ryuk respectively with both giving great voice acting.\
Character:9/10\
The biggest standouts of the cast by far are Light and L. They are both one of anime's greatest characters, watching these two is pure gold. They're both highly intelligent and unbeatable, it was like watching a match between Ali and Frazier, you don't know who'll win and they both put on a great show. And what's scary is that you don't know who to root for. The supporting characters were solid as well, with most having memorable scenes. Ryuk was very good he was served as the comic relief and who's arguably the most important character in the series. He was very entertaining to watch who decides to observe Light due to being fascinated on how he uses the Death Note. As for Misa for most of the time she was annoying and although her development wasn't well her introduction to the series was perfect. She became infatuated with Light and even develops an obsession over him in a very weak way and has a weak personality due to not being very smart and being oblivious to how Light looks at her. Near and Mello were very good from an entertaining standpoint and had great personalities, however they were mainly used as replacements for a certain character that kept them from being great.\
\
Final Verdict\
\
Pros\
+A deep and gripping storyline that's incredibly well written and well paced\
+An outstanding cast of characters that feels very real and entertaining to watch overall\
+Outstanding production values; from sound, to animation, and to voice acting\
+The cat and mouse game between Light and L is anime gold\
Cons\
-A 2nd half that felt unsatisfying and underwhelming(although had a great finale)\
-Near and Mello were seen as mere images of L rather than their own characters\
\
Death Note is one of the greatest animes ever and for a while it was the best I've seen. The great suspense, the amazing duo performances from Light and L, and clever storyline CANT be missed from any person who enjoys tv. And although the 2nd half was weaker, it gives a perfect final episode to a classic anime.\

    This anime is absolutely fantastic. Probably the best aspect of it is the whole genius vs genius premise, which is established very early. It's certainly one of the smartest anime I've seen, and the actions Light and L take will leave you speechless by the end of an episode, and you may even have to re-watch some of it to fully understand what you just saw. The art style is semi-realistic and its muted colors sets the mood for the show nicely. The music is a great compliment to the action. Whenever Light's doing something with the Death Note or making a genius decision, he's\
          \
        usually backed up by a choir and orchestra to supplement his \"godliness,\" and much of the rest is complimented by distorted guitar riffs, which are very good if you're into that type of music. Overall character development isn't lacking either. Of course, Light and L are given the most depth, but even the supporting characters are adequately developed, although they can seen 2-D at times. Watching Light transform from a child prodigy into a merciless god and L go from a voice behind a monitor to a human with habits and personality were some of the most enjoyable parts. The only major thing that disappointed me was that it was lacking in subtlety. This was the first anime I had ever watched and I would recommend it as anyone else's first anime too, because it has a somewhat complex plot and gray morality is the major theme, but it's still simple enough for most people to enjoy.\

    I used to be an investigator, a detective of sorts, so I was highly sceptical about this anime as it was so greatly praised to be (the central focus of this psychological show is about detective work, after all).\
Throughout this anime, I've tried to make as many predictions as possible as to what would happen next, who was doing what, ect.\
Imagine my surprise when I only had one of my predictions and assumptions come true, and that was that Near would have known what Light's plan was.  \
I was completely baffled. Not only was Death Note extremely unpredictable, it was also thoroughly enjoyable and\
          \
        I do not lie when I say it embodies exactly what a 'psychological' anime should be. \
It comes very close to being a masterpiece, and it very much is (thus the 'perfect' rating). \
It follows the ultimate game of cat and mouse, twisting your sense of rationality and questioning your very perception on morality. Is the world truly rotten? Do all criminals deserve to die? What is good? What is evil? What role does perspective have in all of this? The questions this anime raises is astounding. \
The story is a perfect 10. A simplification of its plot may seem ridiculous (and it was for me) but actually watching how it unfolds will impress you. Don't get me started on the characters. L and Light may be the best fictional characters I've come across: well rounded, intricate to the very core. Predictable (L's love for sweets, L and Light's similar nature) but also unpredictable (just about everything else).\
For anyone who likes a good show, the Death Note experience is just as good as you can get. There is no rival. After watching this, you may as well give up watching any other anime as they won't even compare. \
Because, folks, this is the best it gets.\

    Story:\
The story is amazing, I love how it's posed as 'the perfect crime' and I love the main protagonist's development throughout the series. When you watch the first episode, you don't know what to expect, But once Light is given the Death Note and meets Ryuk things start to get interesting. The story is great, there are tons of twists and turns especially a twist almost EVERY EPISODE.\
But the only thing I can complain about the story is the 'Yotsuba arc' and the ending.\
Art:\
The art style is phenomenal, the characters are drawn to meet the standards of what they should look like. (Ex. Light is\
          \
        a honor student, and the artist knew what to draw from there.)\
I especially love the design of L, He looks weird, but he looked pretty intelligent and determined to solve any case no matter how tough.\
Misa's design is just adorable and I love her outfits...i wish I had them.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack is fantastic and it really has great music to listen to if you are working on homework or focusing on work. The openings are catchy and great to listen to, and the closings make you want to continue watching to see what happens.\
The characters:\
The characters are fantastic, I love the development of Light Yagami. He is posed as the perfect young man who was driven to insanity by abuse of power. L has got to be my all-time FAVORITE anime character. He's unique, quirky, and intelligent. But the only character I can complain about is Misa Amane. She by far has to be the most annoying anime character EVER!...need I say more?\
Enjoyment:\
I found the series clever and very interesting.\
Each episode and moment with the characters drew me into the series and made me fall in love with it.\
Overall:\
If you are one for an anime that is clever, full of interesting characters, and a smooth plot. I give it a high recommendation and I'm sure that you will enjoy it.",

    Death Note is a work of art! \
This anime is the type of show that will have you watching it episode after episode. With a bright, beautiful 'villain' whose name is literally Light, and a shady, gluttonous 'hero' named L its hard to not love this anime just for the juxtaposition of a typical story duo. \
The characters in Death Note all have fantastic detailed background stories that make you fall in love with each one individually, from child prodigies to master thief's to gods of death there is guaranteed at least one character that you will fall in love with ( mine\
          \
        personally was Misa Misa ). With characters like Matsuda and Ryuk providing comic relief in an anime that touches a serious topic, it provides just the  right amount of laugh. \
I love this anime because it had me gripping the edge of my seat the entire time I watched it, and every time I have watched it since. Every episode advances the plot of the story, so you don't have to put up with those awful filler episodes ( YUCK! ) and with a surprise at the end of each one that will have you going  WAIT, what? ( well at least I was ) you wont regret watching this. \

    The main reason I greatly enjoyed this anime (and the manga) was the fact that half the time you would be rooting for the good guys, and the other half you would be rooting for the bad ones. There was an in depth story, though at some points got a bit boring. The art style was great. The only problems I had was that some characters didn't get as much screen time as they did in the manga and the ending was a bit anticlimactic. Other then that I thoroughly enjoyed the constant genius v.s genius mechanism and the storyline.\

    Death Note is a classic. You have not seen anime if you haven't seen Death Note, in my humble opinion. The characters and story have long ago become iconic and there are thousands of fans even today. \
The plot is very unique, the characters, though sometimes slightly unbelievable, are strangely relatable. Light himself is the manifestation of the thoughts everyone has had at least once. He is what anyone would be without moral principles; then again, so is L. Their polar opposition and at the same time, their weird similarity makes the interplay between the two very engaging. \
The music is great as well –\
          \
        everything except the second opening which sounds like someone's violating a cat. But that's all right, because the anime is still brilliant up until the point when we are introduced to the new detective characters. Then it all goes downhill. The second half of the anime is pretty much the reason why I cannot give it a perfect score. \
The artistic choices are very staggering at times but interesting in a very innovative way. The use of opposing colors for Light and L in their mind scape lends itself to making the tension even more palpable. \
Overall, this anime is a must watch of all must watches. \

    Death Note is one of the few anime that I would call a masterpiece.\
From the cunning and clever story writing, to the very interesting character, this show is amazing\
The character development from the main character Light Yagami is just VERY entertaining to watch.\
Watching Death Note you can't help but to side with the villain (the main character)  because of how charming and interesting he is in but at some points later on in the show your opinion may flip in an instant. it's just so entertaining!\
However, in the second half of the series the story/plot just goes downhill. While the second half is still\
          \
        mildly entertaining, it loses the cleverness and a lot of the thought that was put into the first half\
Watching the second half you would think that Michael Bay directed it\
BUT the ending makes me partially forgive the second half\
Overall this anime is great for everyone. It truly is a visual masterpiece and the story and characters are amazing. I would recommend this to anyone really.\

    Unlike most other anime fans, it took me quite some time to even consider watching Death Note. It's pretty damned popular, that's for sure, but upon completing it, I felt compelled to give my own two cents to the series.\
The Story (Potential spoilers may be ahead?): 8/10\
Death Note comes in two major portions, so we'll start with the first portion. \
The series starts out pretty interestingly, unraveling rather vividly in the very first episode. Light's actions with the supernatural Death Note evolve from simple curiosity to a rather creepy Messiah complex as he becomes the faceless vigilante known as 'Kira', while his antics quickly are\
          \
        picked up by his soon-to-be nemesis, the master investigator, L. The initial confrontation between the two quickly evolves into an epic cat and mouse chase between two extremely intelligent individuals, with the balance continuously shifting between both sides. These exchanges are nothing short of exhilarating to watch, as a majority of the actions, deductions and evasion fit magically as the battle between Kira and L shifts across different locales and scenarios, with plot twist after plot twist; culminating in a shocking finale to the first portion. If left unto the first 25 episodes, I'd say Death Note would easily be the best anime I've watched, but only 'til here.\
The second portion would never live up to the bar set by the first, and at many times it became too clever for its' own good. The exceedingly overconfident Light begins getting bolder and bolder, as two new characters N and Mello, are introduced to hunt him down. The plot here on out takes a dive, and it occasionally becomes boring to keep up with the episodes, but there are still moments of brilliance even in this somber pit, but the ending makes up for some of the shakiness and ends on a rather epic note. \
Art: 8/10\
Death Note is not exactly a super new anime, but the realism and beauty of the artwork still is extremely praiseworthy. It accurately captures the delicate mix between darkness and glory that the series revolves around. You're given a lovely canvas to stare at as it unfolds before you, and it's easy to like what you see. \
Sound: 9/10\
Death Note's soundtrack is nothing short of incredible. From the godly, malevolent theme that encapsulates Light Yagami to the mysterious, yet epic veil that enshrouds L; the soundtrack nails it all. The first opening is also catchy as heck, and you'll find yourself humming it in the loo before long. The other tunes in the series fit in equally well, save the second opening (which is rather awful to me, but oh well, subjective), which also still serves to remind viewers of the insane take Kira was heading deeper towards. \
Character: 8/10\
The characters here are easy to love, easy to understand and fun to grow with. Of course the most stunning example would be L Lawliet. L's development and portrayal was fantastic and amazing to follow; and it's easy to fall in love with him as a character. Light's descent from budding messiah to plain psycho killer is also brilliant to watch throughout the series, and though you may have differing views on who Light truly is, you'll enjoy the realism in the shift. Apart from these two, the other members of the Kira taskforce are also rather well built on for side characters, such as the brashly loyal Matsuda, the hot tempered Aizawa, the pillar of justice Yagami and even the irritating yandere bimbo, Misa. Ryuk is also an interesting figure in all this, who reminds you of his importance in the end, despite being slightly more than an observer throughout the series. Apart from Near and Mello who are rather one dimensional 24/7, the others display a large variety of interesting and realistic emotions and personalities, which make you feel a part of something real.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I'll be honest. As a whole, I loved it. Sure, portion 2 was a pain at times, but the flow of the story still progresses well enough to convince you to keep watching, to keep moving. At the end of the day, Death Note gives you that satisfaction every good anime should; despite the rather sad but fitting ending, you leave the final closing sequence with a smile, knowing your time wasn't wasted. The best part of the series was the struggle between L and Light, a captivating series of attack and defense that challenges one's ingenuity to the absolute extremes, and takes looking out of the box to a whole new, satisfying extreme. In the end, despite many hiccups and threats, Death Note doesn't truly forget what it is, and that's what makes it worth it.  \
Overall: 9/10\
So yeah, that's my first review on MAL. These are my views on a show which I genuinely was glued on..for the most part. Thanks for reading!\

    Ok now if one hasn’t heard about this anime, one hasn’t lived. It is just SO well thought and so addicting. Watch as you see the two most mentally capable people fight in a battle of wits. Light Yagami, the boy who finds the death note, a book who kills anyone who’s name is written in it while L, the best detective in the world, tries to catch him with nothing but his own thinking capability. The Plot twists in this anime are so awe-striking and the storyline is very original. Although, the series does go a bit downhill at the Yatsooba Arc and after\

        (SPOILER) the death of a very important character.it still manages to retain its features such as mind battles and plot twists. Death Note is definitely a ‘ten’. To give it lesser than that would be a disgrace to the anime world. THIS IS WHAT MADE ME LOVE ANIME.\

It had such an intriguing plot that never failed to amaze me and always catch me off guard. It also had lots of episodes/content which I personally liked so that I could enjoy the anime for a longer period of time.

        from whatever point of view you had. The art wasn't the best, but considering how old this anime is, it was actually pretty good. Definitely not bad enough to consider not watching the anime. Overall, Death Note was a very well-made anime series and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.\

    TL;DR Death note is my favorite anime I ever watched for very good reason there is very few filler everything feels like it progress the story in some way whether its progressing Light and L's battle or having funny dialogue from Ruyk and the rest of the supporting cast. \
Story\
The story is about a shinigami dropping a book that can kill anyone with just knowing a name or face. Light the main character picks it up and tries to kill all criminals to make a new world and become a god of it. The main antagonist (or protagonist depending how you look at it) \
          \
        L  one of the worlds top detectives is trying to stop him from doing this.\
Characters\
The characters in this anime are very well thought out Misa was a very good chess piece for Light's plan and was the one time a waifu made a story driven anime like this so much better and could of been done with a male character. Light has a very sincere goal with the death note at first in trying to make the world better but later turns a wall making for a very well developed character.  L gave Light a very fitting enemy that made the plot interesting and enjoyable for me.\
THE BAD\
There is a very unexpected event that switched up the plot making new enemies come into play named Mihael and Mello. These characters are very different brothers that made a second arc that really pissed me off and wasn't as enjoyable as the L arc. \
Verdict \
Even though I really didn't enjoy the Mello and Mihael arc Death Note is still an amazing anime that I could recommend to anyone it did a lot of things right and didn't do many things wrong \

    death note is my favorite anime of all time. and to some that may seem like a stretch, but it shows us the vulnerability of humanity and our psyche in and of itself. it's one of those anime where it makes you /think/ and honestly just really messes with your head. \
death note tells the story of a young man who looked at the world, saw its many flaws, and said, \"i'm gonna change it with this convenient thing that i found called the death note,\" and light yagami is the perfect example of a road to hell paved with good intentions.\
and though he's considered\
          \
        to be a villain by many (including myself), going against L in the epic battle of good vs evil, he was a pretty idealistic person, shocked by the corruption of the world and was given a chance to do something about them- he had good intentions at first. \
but what he failed to realize was that he was just as fucked up as everyone else; killing all the \"bad\" people makes you a \"bad\" person: a killer.\
now on the other hand, my personal favorite character of all time, L, followed the rules of what is considered right by society, but just like light, he was also flawed. he distanced himself from other human beings just by being smarter than most, and i guess you could consider him as being unhappy because of this.\
many see L as the main hero of the story, including myself, but in reality, he was actually really isolated.\
both light and L wanted a better world, and they were brought together by this. but they were both miserable and lonely and honestly they should have been friends, but they couldn't because of how the world isolates us as individuals and tells us our way of doing things is always right.\
overall, death note is beautiful because is asks you the question: if you were given the change to change the world for the better, would you?\

    Death Note could be a masterpiece but the motivation of Kira unconvincing.\
Put yourself in the place of Light, if you received a death note, you could kill people with only 17 years old.\
With 17 years his biggest concern is their school grades but to Light Yagami this is not a problem because it is considered one of Japan's brightest students. In the first episode, Light says that the world is rotten, lost. This does not justify you want to be a God and punish people. For example, The Punisher had his family killed by criminals, and this has justified what Frank Castle does.\
If they had\
          \
        done something explaining why Light wants to be a God would be great.\
But if you skip this part, this will be one of the best anime that you will watch, like it or not Japanese cartoons.\

    death note was pretty freaking good.\
 I just finished watching the last episode and it was amazing. Lots of critical thinking involved and intense situations. Most of the story takes place with them doing their cop work. There are so many clues leading to who \"Kira\" is and the characters try really hard to not believe who he is. \
what I meant by critical thinking was that they do a lot of tricks to get the person who \"kira\" is exposed. Many intense situations and in a way a lot of manipulation going on.\
 I was very fond of all of the characters involved, especially\
          \
        \"L\". there are good twists and traps to everything, I highly recommend this anime. \

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\
I liked it and hated it at the same time.\
They actively closed every possible loophole from the Death Note, but ruined it with the antagonists using baseless theories. They should have just ended the series after episode 25.\
Characters: 10 for Light, 10 foy Misa and 10 for Ryuk. 4 for L, 2 for Light's father, 0 for Mello, 0 for Near. Total: I'll give em 7, even though it's a 5 average.\
Light, Ryuk and Misa were really fun characters, and were the main reason why I kept watching the show.\
L desperately tried to convict Light even though he had no basis for\
          \
        his assumptions, and Light was cleared several times. At one point he locked him for 60 days for absolutely no reason, and said that the only way he will be happy is if Light is revealed as Kira.\
Light's father, the chief of the police force,  would apparently kill his only son without hesitation if that is what L told him to do.\
The second antagonists, L's successors, were worse than him, and not in a good manner; M's character was so flat and didn't develop at all, and N was obviously a 7-years-old-clairvoyant.\
Art and Sound: 6.5 for art, 8 for sound.\
I liked both the art style and the soundtrack of the series, especially Kira's song.\
Story: 8.\
The plot was good, I enjoyed it and the idea of the death note.\
Overall: 7 is the average of the above. I excluded my enjoyment because I am neutral and not sure how I feel about it.\
Towards the ending, the series started losing its charm, and I just wanted to get over with it, only to see the worst ending they could possibly come up with.\
I didn't read the manga.\

    I've seen Death Note four times, twice subbed and twice dubbed. This series is renown worldwide as a cultural icon of Anime. You ask a random person to name an Anime; Death Note will be there with Cowboy Bebop, Attack On Titan and Pokemon. \
This series is a complex look at morality and poses some very interesting questions. It's a tale of how power corrupts even the purest of intentions. The protagonist of this story originally has the goal for peace through administering justice upon the guilty but his own sense of justice quickly begins to morph throughout the early episodes. What starts as a\
          \
        noble cause becomes a selfish grab for dominance over society, taking pleasure in his intellectual superiority in a game against anyone who dare challenge him. \
The other great thing about this series apart from the story itself is the characters. Lets not forget the amazing and talented Miyano, Mamoru who voices Light, you might know him from Steins;Gate where he voices Okabe. The voice acting is superb on the Japanese side and also a surprisingly good dub for anyone interested.\
This series is a must watch for fans of Anime, it also serves as a great gateway Anime to introduce new fans. This Anime for me is the one which changes my perspective on Anime from a simple hobby to one of my main interests.  I'd also recommend that fans of this Anime check out the live action movies. There is three of them and each has a full Japanese cast. \

    Ah...Death Note. Where do I begin?\
 Death Note, as you'll hear by most who have seen the series, is greatly known as one of the best anime series out there, and possibly of all time, and it certainly earns such a title. \
Why might you ask? One could argue it's because of it's astonishing artwork, others may say it's because of it's amazing soundtrack. All are true of course, but the reason why Death Note has the reputation it does, is because of it's amazing story ark. Death Note is essentially one gigantic \"Cat and Mouse game\" as most people refer to it as. But\
          \
        you never know who is the cat, and who is the mouse.\
Death Note has this \"thing\" that it does. It's always forcing you to the edge of your seat, pretty literally. It's inarguably why so much people enjoy it. Within the span of the first few episodes you are able to see the true power Light has found. The power of the notebook.\
As for things such as sound, animation, (ext) it's all extremely well done. As cliche as it may sound, it's true. Take in mind while watching Death Note that it was created 8 years ago. That is all I should have to say, but the animation is truly beautiful. Even compared to anime today it still looks better then most. If your concerned about animation seeing as it's \"old\", don't be. \
The sound tracks for Death Note are very nice as well. Some might even say to nice, to the point it can be a little surprising, to say the least. If you take the time and listen to the OST's you'll fall in love with them.\
As for character development, once again phenomenal. Death Note really doesn't leave any plotholes at all. The character development, even for minor characters, is extremely well done. The character development in Death Note is very nice, letting you form bonds with characters quickly.\
The only thing I seriously disliked about Death Note was the ending. I am not going to discuss it much, as I hate receiving and giving out spoilsies, but it is the only thing in the whole series I'm disappointed about. Rather then that Death Note is almost as close to perfect as any anime series could get.\
On a final note, I would seriously recommend watching Death Note DUBBED, not subbed. Even if you are a dedicated fan of watching anime subbed everyone (or most people) will agree watching it dubbed. The dub for Death Note is FAR superior then the sub in everyway. If you wish to watch Death Note subbed, so it AFTER you see it dubbed.\
So there you have it, my full review on Death Note. I hope everyone found this helpful, although I'm positive there are hundreds of others like this out there. \

    I have watched Death Note several times. No matter how many times i watch it, it keeps surprising me with more. Its a very mysterious anime where u have to keep focus on whats going to happen next. It draws you in the story and makes you feel alive in it.Thats one of the reasons so many people enjoy watching it including me. Its a mysterious cat and mouse anime where u have to try to prevail without making others know your true nature. The storyline is unbelievabe good and the laugh of Yagami Light gives me the thrills which is why i gave Sound\

        a 8. I gave art a 7 because it should have a better queality than that. His character is very sepcial and unique, I could see his thoughts getting changed episode after episode. It gave me a look in how a person could change step by step. Which is why i think this is a good anime that you could enjoy over and over. \

    Death Note is beyond popular and I knew that eventually I would watch it because of its popularity. I was actually planning on watching other anime before Death Note then I got a message on my profile asking me about watching Death Note so I said screw it I’m watching it now. My oh my, what a good choice that was for me, hell of a show.\
Story- I rated this a 9 when probably everyone would rate the story a 10. Not to spoil anything but the only reason this was not a 10 is because I would want a different ending, and that is\
          \
        all I will say. Some people are going to love the ending others are not. Other than that this was my first anime I have watched where there is no fighting. I don’t care obviously but it does such a good job hooking you episode after episode without flashy fight scenes so props on that. The mind games are so intriguing that I think the writer of the show is a genius himself. Everything was put together so well it is a true masterpiece. \
Art- because this show is relatively new the art is outstanding. Everything is so crisp and the colors are outstanding. The characters look incredible in particular the Shinigami. I feel that art can never take away from an anime but it can always contribute to one and this art definitely contributes. No complaints here.\
Sound- Ok here is where I could get some hate. In my opinion the Dub was fantastic and I’ve heard nothing but good from the Sub. The soundtracks during the show are really good and make you feel whatever the characters feel; that is always a good thing. But, I cannot stand when an anime has a bad opening and bad ending song. This happened twice for this anime. Both openings and endings are really bad and I contribute that as a part of the Sound category. If you don’t than lemme tell ya that the sound would have been a 10 for me if I didn’t count he songs. Just my opinion.\
Character- I don’t think anyone can argue that the characters in here are amazing. I will always appreciate a good villain/anti-hero. In my opinion one must have an amazing villain/anti-hero to really make a show/movie worth ones time and Death Note delivers. The characters all contribute and even the ones you think are expendable and you will not see them again well, think again; always remember everything about the characters because they are bound to come back and serve a bigger purpose. Light the main character was amazing in very way and yet so twisted and I love twisted. I’m not twisted haha not even close it’s something enjoyable to watch. There is never a moment in the show where you heart is not pounding because of character tension. \
Overall Death Note is the most unique anime I have ever seen and the most suspenseful one at that. I enjoyed all characters and their interactions with each other. I love the moral struggle between two different views of justice. I think this is one of the few anime that ANYONE can enjoy, a solid 9, amazing show.",

    I loved this anime. At first thought, it was stupid. A highschool boy with a notebook that kills? Didn't sound very good. After a while, I got curious. It turned out to be one of the best animes I've seen. \
Story: The story was amazing. It keeps you guessing until the end. You would think it  would get boring, Light just killing people. But there's always a new twist. \
Art: The characters were drawn so intricately and yet so simply. I love the faces and bodies. They don't look like they're going to fall apart. They're slim, but full. Great detail is put into\
          \
        drawing everything. \
Sound: I've seen both the English and Japanese versions. The voices fit the characters well in both. Although, I was a little disappointed in English Misa's and L's voices. The music for the OP and ED in both season is great. All of them are on my iPod. \
Characters: Misa was annoying, and yet I love her. She has cool clothes. Her backstory is really awesome, too. Each character has a personality that is both sad and complete. The relationships between characters seems to evolve and decline constantly. There is minimal romance, but enough to keep romantics like me happy. There are always new characters to love and hate.\
Enjoyment: No comment. From reading the above, you should be able to see that I absolutely love this series. I even have some of the dvds and merchandise. \
Overall: Very awesome. Watch it. I swear you won't be disappointed.\

    If your the type of person who enjoys an Anime that requires you to use the last cell in your brain to figure the story out, well this is for you. The story completely hooks you in as soon as the main narrative begins. It's about a teenage student who urges to cleanse the world from it's filth, and another person trying his best to stop him. \
Now if you prefer the use of swords and choreography, you will be disappointed. Because the battles in this Anime uses their brain to the extent that your sweating, really, it's amazing.\
The drawings and character input is fantastic,\

        they add the extra color in order to make you hooked towards the Anime and makes you want to finish it, QUICK.\

    Alright everyone. if you have not seen this yet it is a MUST! It is one of the best animes out their in my opinion. This anime is a shorter anime with under 60 episodes long and it kept my leaning at the edge of seat. The story starts with a necessary build to introduce the deathnote, but never makes it too slow to get bored of the show. Then it starts getting interesting when they investigate how so many people are dying and why. From this moment on it is pretty much a game of chess between the two main characters which gets intense\
          \
        pretty quick. From there in the story untill the end of the show it keeps its high intensity. The characters in this show are relatable to real life people and what actions they would do which makes it such a great anime.Hopes you guys love it as much as I did.   \

Death Note is palpably one of the nonpareil anime of all time, proffering a acutely and riveting rigmarole diegesis emulated by scanty. I can verily say that it is one of the best anime I've ever watched. As the exordium dwindles out to a seraphic, male chorus soaring atop vivacious sight of prosaic stage of Shinigami realm, it gives me palpitation. \
\"Humans are truly... disgusting creatures!\"\
The series follows Light Yagami, a Japanese high-school student disenchanted by the world encompassing him, suppurated in crime\
          \
        misfeasance, and who, purely by chance, stumbles upon the Death Note, a notebook which can kill any whose names are written on its pages. Surmising it as a connate rig, Light initially is a minimifidia, until corroborating first-hand the Death Note's competence. Light taps the Death Note to efface infamous criminals in a peregrination to lustrate it of evil and create a utopia. Concurrently, Ryuk who purposefully drops the Death Note, striving to quell his own boredom descends from Shinigami realm to seek out for the owner Death Note. The essence of anime is to assay a punctilious, meticulous tour of the horizon past the initial episode would be paradoxical to fit into a review imbued with spoilers that would apodictically raze the show. The story is tense heaving on your vehemence as Light gets away with his plans or on the contrary that protagonists (L) is about to ensnare Light. Whether you're on L's side or Light's side, the story is akin to a roller-coaster ride that you will refuse to get out of. \
\"Justice will, without fail, prevail.\"\
Death Note blossoms in serving memorable characters. It is said that, no story would trounce without a single interesting character. Death Note flourishes here. Episode upon episode, anomalous character development is pre-eminent throughout, even for minor sub-characters. Moreover there are no inconsequential plethora here–each character introduced has a clear conviction to execute, which they do with rigor, leaving an audience complacent that the writers' heed never retracted from the good stuff, the substantial plotline.\
\"I must protect my fledging utopia.\"\
The animation is phenomenal, fitting for a psychological thriller series. A palatial and idiosyncratic shading dexterity commingle with the more traditional style of drawing to create a look and feel that both stayed true to the quintessential appearance of anime and achieved a verisimilitude that reflected Death Note's mature themes. The filters added in some scenes, like when Light and L are having their intellectual fracas, are exceptional. \
Alike the animation, aegis has been amplified to ensure that overall, the feisty soundtrack resonates with the mood of the dark world in which the anime takes place. Character themes in particular have been innovatively orchestrated and emphasize the dramatic scenes when played. As for openings and endings, I find no fault. The divine first intro by Nightmare, aptly titled 'The World' unshackles heaven-splitting chords worthy of an zealous head bang. The insert music is amazing, the way they used said soundtracks was awesome, the mystery scores were amazingly executed during L and Light's battles.\
\"However gifted you are, you alone can't change the world.\"\
Death Note is unworldly plight in full 21st century pre-eminence. Such a densely-bundled, fast-paced story is seldom seen in an animated series, and with thankfully none of those irksome filler episodes the shounen like so much, Death Note continues its vertiginous momentum all the way to its denouement. When you finally pull up the bar, get off the roller-coaster and set two wavering feet on the ground, it only takes a moment of recouping balance until you're back at the queue's end to experience it again. And again. And again. And yet again. Death Note was the paramount that made me watch other anime. The only thing I hate about the series is that it had to end. And also that I wasn't able to espy something which may rival with Death Note, and I'm sure there will be none. Death Note is fad exemplary personating as a magnum opus. If there would be no human beings any more, Death Note would no longer be appreciated. \

    If you had the ability to kill those that have done wrong, would you?\
This story isn't some story based on moral judgment or ethics. Rather, it's a battle between two ideas. Is it right to kill evildoers? Or is it generally incorrect to kill people? Regardless, this show is one that you should watch, as it enters a psychological battle between \"Good\" and \"Evil.\" But which is which?\

Story (10/10)\
Great plot and delivery is really good.\
Art and Sound (8/10)\
Both are quite average. However, these shinigamis > shinigamis like ones from Bleach. I'm not sure how the Japanese do it, but they are spot on in terms\
          \
        of voice actors/actresses.\
Character (10/10)\
This is the main piece of the entire series. You'll hate some of the characters and you'll love some of the characters. Sometimes for the wrong reasons. But that's okay because they're all excellent in their contributions to the show.\
Enjoyment and Overall (10/10)\
Yup. Nothing more to say about this show really. Death Note really is a classic. It's not everyone's cup of tea but in my opinion everyone should give it a shot. Also, there are some story points (like the characters' past) that you may have to look up to understand. I hope you all enjoy this anime as much as I did!\

    This will be my first review so I'll kept it simple and as straightforward as possible. Death Note was my first anime, and having watched it about five months ago, I'm very happy to review it here on MAL. I'll start by making a general evaluation/rating of every element that composes the anime - Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment, finishing with an overall appreciation. \
Story - This is clearly a 9, intriguing and complex plot full of twists, bonus points if you like criminal and police investigation series. The plot will make you stick to Death Note  until the end and it's full of\
          \
        unexpected events. It loses a bit of quality after episode 25, but it's still worth viewing to the end. As for the thematics, the main subject is Justice and the popular saying that 'the ends justify the means', I found it very interesting perhaps because I study law, I saw the whole question of 'would killing all criminals make the world a better place?' complex and prone to both pro and con arguments, the anime has thematics that make you think about what is 'good' and 'evil'.\
Art - An 8, very good art, realistic and very satisfying, not to mention very good graphics\
Sound - An 8 again, good sountrack with a theme for every moment, event or situation,  good enough to boost up your interest and enthusiasm in every specific scene\
Character - Another 9, the characters are one of the best parts of Death Note,the main reason b sides the plot that kept me watching it on a daily basis. The characters are deep, mysterious and every one has it's own characteristics. The best part is that the main character, Yagami Light, is an anti-hero, so if you're into anti-heroes, this is the anime for you, plus you have another awesome character named L, a guy with above the norm deduction skills, a funny shinigami named Ryuk, and many more.\
Enjoyment - A 9, it kept me stuck on the screen for almost a week until I finished it, it goes down after episode 25, but even so it's still worth watching, it regains a little of quality in the final episodes near the end. The combination of the previous elements, mainly the plot (along with thematics) and the characters quality, make for a very good overall enjoyment\
Overall - I'll have to give it a 9, maybe it was my first anime and so I was easy to please, or I was simply amazed by it, but I'll have to recommend this, it is worth the time spend and advisable as a first anime, bonus points for the fact it doesn't' have too much gore or bloody scenes (not good for starters I guess). Thrilling and complex plot, with amazing, deep and fascinating characters, realistic graphics and a very worthy soundtrack to boost up your nerves and anxiety when you're looking to see the conclusion of an episode and what's finally going to happen.\
I hope everyone enjoyed my first review, if anything comes up just contact me on MAL\

    Death Note is a brilliant anime. Not only is the story an interesting concept, the way the plot plays out and unravels is perfectly executed. But since the plot is ridiculously easy to spoil and has nothing wrong with it, I'm just going to say \"It is mind-bogglingly amazing,\" and then move on.\
The characters are perfect (Perfect for the plot. Don't worry, they've got flaws), just like everything else in this anime. They never do anything that seems wrong for their personality, and they are completely believable as real people.\
Every aspect of Death Note is inhumanly perfect. In fact, it is. It truly is. But\
          \
        Death Note unexpectedly fails. For all of the brilliance in this anime's writing, and dialogue, and voice acting, and characters, it was one of the most difficult anime for me to every get all the way through. Here is why.\
The only reason why I could barely bring myself to finish Death Note is the protagoist, Light. In literature, the protagonist of a story isn't necessarily defined as \"The character the plot revolves around.\" It's defined as \"The character the audience identifies with.\" In other words, you're supposed to be the most sympathetic toward the main character, who is Light Yagami in this case. But it's impossible to be sympathetic toward Light at any moment in the show. Sure, he kills with the Death Note to deliver justice and create a utopia, but I never saw a single redeeming quality in him. He never shows remorse or any sort. Every one around him is either a tool or an obstacle that needs to be removed. Summary: Light is a cold, heartless bastard that is impossible to love.\
Light's character turned me off. Once I realized I hated him, I had to force myself through every episode, pausing every few minutes to go do something else before continuing. I only watched it because I had started the anime, and I was determined to finish it, especially one so highly spoken of. Even then, I took an entire one month hiatus around the halfway point because I was sickened by Light, and more over, I couldn't bear to watch the ending because I wouldn't have been able to accept it if he ended up \"winning.\"\
I'm not trying to tell you that this anime is terrible. Like I said at the beginning of the review, it's spectacular in countless ways. I hated this anime, but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love it. If you haven't seen Death Note, I implore you to try it out. Even if it doesn't sound like something you would like, you still need to give it a try. I'm sure that, if you do enjoy it, it will instantly be in your top 3 list of anime.\

    Death Note is a top notch anime. Like a symphony masterpiece, it drags you in slowly without ever letting go, increasing the pace through ingenious actions the characters take til the grand finale where it culminates.\
To start with, I think it looked pretty awesome. Admittedly, there were fluctuations in the character animation/drawing at certain points, but those weren't that often and when done right, the visuals are great; the death gods, character expressions and action sequences are full of eye candy and look very stylish. The script is really ingenious, I could seldom tell what was going to happen next. If I had to name\
          \
        the part in the series which I particularly liked, it had to be the time when L was seriously starting to get on Light's tail - revealing the way characters think in a dramatic way is one bright point in this anime. Actions are never taken without serious calculation and reasoning, therefore I really can't think of any plotholes right now.\
However, as much as I liked the episodes after L's death, I don't think they could ever surpass the ones prior to them. If it had ended with L dying, I would have been pleased. Don't get me wrong, I totally liked Near, Mello and the events that followed; if one asked me whether I'd like to undo the creation of those episodes my answer would be no. But this, and the fact that Light went berserk in the end and died (not very surprising, justice wins bla bla bla) still stand as slight objections to this anime in my review. Maybe it's just my personal preference, but the last third of the show is a bit pale compared to the first two.\

    *to those people who are only looking for a quick summary, skip to the end*\
If you happen to get a power that allows you to kill anyone, regardless of who they are, for as long as you know their name and face, what would you do? Most people would probably use it for their own selfish desires, like to kill that noisy neighbor who doesn’t know where his own lawn ends, or that slave driver of a boss that just piles up more and more paperwork on your desk, or maybe even that fat bastard who won’t pay his debt. Regardless of your answer, I\
          \
        guess that every one of us has someone in their mind who you think should just disappear. This is the very same circumstances that happen in Death note. Light Yagami, an exceptionally smart student happened to find a notebook entitled as Death Note. Thinking of it as a prank, he decided to test it out and surprisingly, he found out that it’s real. Having a strong sense of justice, he decides that with this power, he shall create a new world order, and started his work by killing every single criminal in the world.\
I know what you’re asking right now, is Death Note any good? The answer to that is yes, it is, and the reasons are that: Death Note has pretty much one of the most well thought out and complicated plots out there. It tells the story in such a way that it makes you want to keep an eye on every single detail as it might be the next thing to surprise you. Second, it makes use of very complicated yet very plausible logic that just leaves you thinking if it really makes sense. Lastly, it makes use of the element of suspense most of the time, leaving people glued to their seats while awaiting the next big revelation. Now, if you haven’t guessed yet, the thing that makes Death Note such a great anime is its plot. It makes you think deeply into the situations that the characters Light and L is thrown into, and when you try to predict what will happen next, most of the time you’ll come up with the wrong conclusions. This is the thing that makes Death note such an engaging anime. There are some people out there such as myself who find it pleasurable to try and guess what will happen next in the story, and when you do get it right, it gives a lot of satisfaction. And since Death Note is of the mystery genre and all, it really delivers well in the mystery part. Now, another thing that makes Death note so great is its unique perspective of the story. Instead of showing the story through the eyes of the good guy, L, it shows the story through the eyes of Light Yagami, one of the very few utter assholes that I’ve come to respect. He is in a nutshell, an evil anti-hero who is hell bent on creating a perfect world by committing mass murder. Seeing the story through the eyes of the evil MC can make you think about whether what he is doing is actually right, unlike in other animes wherein when the story is shown through the eyes of the good guy protagonist, the story seems to bias to the side of the good guy MC. But of course, as with all anime, none are perfect. Although this really isn’t a hole in the plot or a mistake by the creators of the anime, some people (most of them haters) points out that the story is too, well, perfect. They like to point out that everything just flows too smoothly, especially the plans that Light carry out. After reading the manga and watching the anime, I have also come to notice this. I’d like to reason out though that this is an anime, not real life. Seeing those plans unfold in seeming perfection is one of the most enjoyable part of watching this anime. If you take that away then Death Note would lose at least 50% of its enjoyment factor. Also, after the timeskip somewhere in the middle of the anime, the plot suddenly seemed to have dropped in quality a bit due to a major plot twist, though it might just be me. Despite that though, Death Note still has one of the best plot out there, and I’d like to see someone say otherwise.\
Along with a wonderful plot comes an even better set of characters. From the evil scheming bastard MC Light Yagami to the good guy detective L, every character is just perfect. They are very well developed, with complete personalities and their own philosophies. You can really feel what they are thinking of despite both main characters being slightly despicable in their own way, you just can’t help but agree with them in some points. These things can really make the characters grow on you, and seriously, you’ll really come to love them. Another thing that I’d like to mention again is the fact that the roles of the antagonist and the protagonists were switched, making Light the main character and L as the antagonist. Now, the great thing about this is that the viewers are actually given insight into the mind of the evil MC, and unlike in the other animes wherein the MC just spouts nonsense about justice and peace while the author just hopes that the viewers will take such ideals with a grain of salt, Death Note actually takes time to try and explain the reasons as to why the MC actually does that and even provides us with his philosophies and beliefs. This is one of the things that make Death Note a couple of notches better than other animes. Also with regards to the how smoothly the character development goes, I’d say that they did a damn well job. The pacing was just perfect. You can really see the transformation from a simple high school student that firmly believes that cleansing the world of criminals is justice to a half-mad genius who has a god complex. \
Now another thing that I would like to mention is the animation and music of Death Note. Although these things are not really needed to make a good anime, I’d really have to say that Death Note’s animation has aged pretty well. Made during 2007, its animation is still pretty good by my standard, all clean and slick. So to those who have phobias of 90’s animation fear not, it won’t kill your eyes. As for the music, the background music really makes things a heck lot more epic, especially during those scenes when Light is sitting in front of his desk and writing the names of criminals like a BAWS, then an orchestra-playing-epic-music-and-a-choir-starts-singing-in-Latin-or-some-other-laguage-I-can’t-understand type background type of music starts playing. Also, the second opening was really unique. Freaking screamo will really get you pumped for the stuff that will happen next.\
So to conclude everything, I’d just like to say that Death Note is an exceptionally good anime. It has a beautiful plot, great characters, is quite long, about 37 episodes so you’ll be able to enjoy it thoroughly. For those people who are into detective and mystery type anime, I highly suggest watching this .I swear you won’t regret it. \
As a summary, these are the pros and cons that I pointed out in my review\
+Plot is really complex with lots of twists and turns that really hooks you in\
+The Main characters are without a doubt, some of the most interesting characters out there, with personalities and beliefs that are well developed\
+The suspense factor is great throughout the anime\
+The intro and BGM were both very well done\
+Quite unique by the fact that the anime was shown through the eyes of the Antagonist \
\
-Gathered a few haters who claim that the story was too unrealistic because everything in the anime goes too smoothly\
-has 1 filler episode\

    Death Note literally blew my mind! \
The issues it brings up will alter your perception of the world and make you question your humanity, however, it does it in a way that will make you want to watch the next episode. SPOILERS AHEAD. Even though this anime is very serious it does have its moments. The detective L, who is later replaced by Near and Mello to lead the Kira investigation, has a very unique way of looking at the world and is extremely smart but physically under developed. Although when he and light aka Kira fight, no seriously I may add, he does put\
          \
        up a good fight. The main feature of this anime is wether you believe a highs school student has the right to judge people who have committed crimes, like Light Yagami as Kira did, and eventually paid with his life for it. \
THIS SHOW GAVE ME NIGHTMARES, BUT IT WAS SOO GOOD I COULDN'T HELP BUT CLICK THE LINK TO THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!!!!\

    Story:\
A story about an super intelligent young man who resents crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change , when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the 'Death Note'. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written on it, that person will die. After trying it out and meeting the previous owner of the Death Note; he beings his seek to become 'the God of the new world' by passing his own judgments.\
Art:\
Outstanding. Period.\
Sound:\
The music was the completing key element. I did not appreciate the opening and ending music though... Dubbers did a great job and\
          \
        they match the characters perfectly. \
Enjoyment:\
This show is so thrilling and so addictive that you will stick to your chair until you watch each and every episode.\
It was the No.1 Anime to me that could never be matched ... until they decided to put Near and Mello in the show... And then they made it even worse by that ending - (Spoilers: Light should have been killed by his own father, Misa, Teru or Rem).\

    First of all, this anime is A MASTERPIECE (based of the first 26 episodes), because I love it so much I just make myself believe there are only 26 episodes. (and i'll tell you why at the very bottom)\
Now to the anime itself. The reason why it is such a masterpiece lies in its story, character development, and pace. \
The story might seem like déjà vu, but there not out there that comes anywhere near it (Believe me i checked). Many animes try to include the supernatural (ghost hunt), mystery solving (detective conan), or cutting edge intellect(code geass), but not other has taken it to\
          \
        Death Note's level. \
What really captivated me was how I always wanted know what's next, who's going to die, what is the next plan, and who am I going to like more between L and Light. Because what I realized, this anime doesn't give you a hero and a villain, but two extremely intelligent teenagers fighting in the name of justice, and you will never stick to only one.\
Now to the last 10 episodes...... To be honest on it's own, it could be regarded higher, but the simple fact that it is part of the first 26 (not OVA, not spin off) makes it horrible compared to how it started. \
I remember watching the first 26 episodes in 2 days (pure awesomeness). Next day: 6 episodes in I got so bored I skipped to the final episode and thus I re-programmed my brain to believe there are only 26 episodes in the main story and 10 fillers.\

    Whenever I think of Death Note, I always consider it an absolute masterpiece, but that is because I always refuse to think about the second half of the show. The first half of the show, without a doubt, has amazing characters, story and is fantastic. But in the second half, the show takes such a massive dive in quality that it's difficult to consider it amazing.\
My recommendation is stop watching Death Note after the 1st half.\

    DISCLAIMER: Although this series gets a 10 from, by no means whatsoever does that mean I think that 'Death Note' is a 'Masterpiece'. I give scores via a point system, and the points ended up adding up to 10. The show definitely has it flaws, which shall be explored in this review, but they are greatly outweighed by its successes. \
I'll skip over giving 'Death Note' a summary, because the one provided by MAL is pretty much self-explanatory. The premise of the show is great, but the way the plot unravels and branches off is even better (+1). Although there are many subplots, they all\
          \
        relate to the main overarching plot which means that nothing every seems like a filler (+1). Although, the show never really stagnates, the second act is pretty boring (-1). This is mostly due to circumstances that I can't explore (because of spoilers); however, the act is needed for everything to fall into place and once it is over the show picks up the pacing it possessed in the first act (possibly with even more impetus) (+1).\
With story progression, comes character progression- which this show definitely has. Light starts off as an intelligent boy that gradually unravels to become raging, egomaniac-al psychopath. They way he develops is completely different to how one usually sees a villain develop (+1) - he is not evil from the start, but rather becomes evil through opportunity. The 'Death Note' has blackened his soul and becomes obsessed with the idea of becoming God. It's so refreshing to see the world through the eyes of such an horrific human being (+1). Although I absolutely detest Light, and would probably shoot him in the head before he ever got the chance to write my name is notebook of death, there's no denying that the fucked up kid is a fantastic character.\
Whilst L doesn't receive the main amount of character progression, his presence as a character is phenomenal. The way he challenges Light in every aspect - he is completely different from him, yet he is able to think like him in order to set Light off. I disagree with the interpretation that he would also take advantage of the 'Death Note' if given the opportunity - c'mon guys, this guy isn't the fucked up little shit that is N. L's main purpose in life is to solve crimes through his intellect, apprehend criminals and have them be served proper justice. He doesn't attempt to play the role of God, but instead accepts his mortality (something that Light could never do). (+2)\
Before I move onto the crap characters of the series, I'd also like to give special mentions to Ryuk, Mello and *drum roll* Matsuda! Ryuk's attitude towards Light was A+: he didn't give a flying fuck about that psychopath. Indifferent to everything, he only wanted to see if his theories about the human psyche were correct, before finally serving that creep his just deserts. (+2)  Mello was the complete opposite of L: rash, but effective. He got the job done, and was integral to the plot (+2); however, is rashness led to his demise due to his sloppiness (so -1 - sorry Mello! I still love you!). Finally, Matsuda: probably the only HUMAN of the series (+1); his optimism and integrity was endearing, which made the end of the series even more crushing as you just knew he would never be the same after finding out his idol was serial killer (+2 for character development, no matter how tragic).\
Now, to the bad eggs: Misa, Ren and Near. I don't even want to waste time going into detail about these characters except to label the first two as completely spineless, and the last one as completely arrogant (and pretty similar to Light - no thanks). (-4 for being absolutely shitty).\
Moving onto the art and sound: the animation was perfectly gritty and reflected the message of the story perfectly (+1). The seiyuus did the jobs amazingly, and gave each character a perfect sound (+2). Whilst the OSTs for the first half of the series were amazing (+1), the screamo at the second half absolutely sucked (and probably caused me to develop tinnitus) (-2). I wanted to rip out my ear drums. \
Despite its pitfalls (which are mainly due to the boring middle segment of the anime, which couldn't be omitted, and some utterly awful characters), 'Death Note' is highly enjoyable and I found it refreshing to see the story develop from the eyes of an utter maniac. Its not everyday we get to see the thought-processes of a villain. (+1 for entertainment factor).\

    Death Note is one of those anime shows that you have to watch if you are an anime fan. It is also one of the show I would show to someone trying to break into the world of anime. It's simple but complex, dark but not so dark that you can't find characters to relate to or root for. \
The overall story is very simple ( a boy finds a book that allows him to kill people if he writes their name in the book.) but the magic of this anime comes in the mystery and the twists and turns. You follow along with the\
          \
        main character as he uses the book to rid the world of evil criminals in an effort to make the world a better place. At the same time, a super smart detective is trying to catch him at every turn. The joy of the series comes in the cat and mouse exchanges between the two characters. As the story develops new rules come into play with the book (death note) and these rules play a major part in the storyline. \
The only negative thing I can say about the series is that I was not fond of the second half. You spend the whole first half of the series watching these two genius level characters battle it out to get the best of one another. And in the second half, they lose that initial rivalry and fail to recapture it with the addition of other characters. \
All in all  I would highly recommend this anime to anyone! Check it out and trust me it will have you on the edge of your seat! (espcally the first half of the series!!!!) \

    Extremely witty plot. One thing that I loved right away was how well-calculated the main protagonist was from the very beginning. This very feeling started reminscensing me of classic detective novels.\
Music (OST by Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi) totally suits the plot and its dark, gloomy, and Satanic blend of uniqueness.\
For some, the story's long explanatory dialogues in the beginning might seem a burden. But they're just clearing stuff so bear that.\
Episode 1 itself is one hell of a Hollywood drama with its fast paced death scenes complimented further by the soundtrack.\
The story will seem a bit slow-paced in the middle parts. They could've done\
          \
        without extending the story so much with dialogues and thinking.\
The story becomes too complicated and intense after the initial 10 episode. The whole concept of Death Notes, ownership transfer, and how Kira does all that stuff he does is just mind-bending. I really want to applaud Tsugumi Ohba and director Tetsurō Araki for scripting such a well thought-out story that beats the toughest of detective novels right out of the water.\
The supernatural part relating to the gods of death is very deep and interesting too, and not just a side story to explain the powers of Death Note.\
As much as it's interesting, the anime is equally depressing and sad, full of emotions around the last 10-15th episodes.\
Story becomes pretty slow-paced and boring in the last few episodes. It's overstretched by putting emphasis on a dead wagon. Almost like they're refraining from the main war, the main plot, for those few episodes. Things pick speed back up after a while though.\
The anime is accompanied by a very, very touching conclusion. It'll make Death Note a memorable experience of your life. Something you'll always get nostalgic with.\

    One of the only pieces of work which i would wholeheartedly agree that the anime is a greater masterpiece to the manga *not to downplay the manga by any means* Madhouse outdone there self with this one.\
 Art: 8\
      I'll keep this one short and sweet \"Madhouse Is Love, Madhouse Is Life.\"\
This not to say it couldn't have been better, but since the manga doesn't have big fat anime battles it's more of a psychological, mental struggle there really wasn't much to animate. \

Story/Plot: 9\
      Light Yagami one of Japans brightest lands himself in possession of a book that has the power to kill anyone, anywhere at anytime all at the flick of a pen. You follow him into a twisting turning roller coaster as he dodges the police and other various encounters. The \"god like\" pacing is the biggest part of the show which it does perfectly, until episode 26 where i'm going to say controversially it should have ended. I'm not going to delve into the other 11 episodes as they are the soul reason I had to score the Plot and other categories lower as it is mediocre. *only slightly i'll add*\
Character: 9\
       Probably one of Death Note's strongest categories, I honestly followed Light Yagami's mental superiority so intently my IQ went up by 50. The back and fourth between the Protagonist and Antagonist is so intense that by the end you're not sure who's who. *Side note: its not a 10 for the last 11 episodes.  \
Enjoyment/Overall: 9\
       Going off the first 26 episodes, this anime is a masterpiece and as critical i can be i have no qualms saying that. Do i recommend this? Do you recommend ordering spicy rice at Nandos? That's a yes my friends. Go have some fun.\

    Death Note is propably one of the best anime series.\
Actually it should be the best one.Netherless, the unnecessary second half destroy it. Therefore I'm goning to rate the anime in two part(1-25)(26-36)\
From the first part,I can tell that the story is unique and the characters is well-developed. I think after watching this ,everyone can tell that it is a masterpiece.10 marks for the story, 8 marks for the art,8 marks for the sound,10 marks for the characters, and 10 marks for my enjoyment. For considering it was an anime aired near 10 years,I will give a perfect 10 for the first half. L and Light,\
          \
        the forever rivals has controlled the whole story,with the dark hero -- Light has a wonderful brain which has a perverted dream-- to become the god of the new world after he got  Death Note. L-- with a wonderful brain same as Light but he is a detective,(actually I think he is smarter than Light) with the strange action. Ruyk with a scary face but he is only a god which like eating apples. The really big differenences between them to create Death Note.\
For the second half ,I think it is not the same level as the first half, in fact it is not poor, but it is just average.\
For the story I will give it a 6 becuase of the unrealistic stoy line and N always using some methods which has already surpassed the natural.\
The best part in the second half is only the part when Light dead, it has not much surprise. For the art and the sound ,it has not change much so I will give the same marks as the first half for 8. The characters has no enough time for developing in only 12 ep. N and same as L but never better than him. M is a quite good character however he deads early and cannot developed well.Therefore I will give a 7 for the character (5 marks for Light and Ruyk, 2 for others).For the enjoyment,after L deads, I have no mood to watch M and N, I'm just kept my concentration on Ruyk. It is different on first half that L and Light are propably two of the best characters in the anime history. Therefore I can only just give 5 marks for my enjoyment.\
In a conclusion, 10 marks for the first parts while 6 for the second. In the average, 8 marks are given.( I must give a 10 without doubt if there hasn't the second part)\

    (Note: this is my opinion)\
Death Note is a quality anime. The plot centers around Light Yagami, a high school student who is known for being very smart, finds the Death Note, a notebook that kills anyone whose name is written in it as long as the person writing the name has memorized their face.\
Light Yagami's only challenge is the brilliant detective L who is basically a discount batman. L was orphaned at a young age and is armed with lots of money and a butler.\
The first 25 episodes of Death Note are amazing. They work perfectly with the soundtrack and the animation is brilliant. \
After\
          \
        episode 25, with the introduction of Near and Mello, the series takes quite a drastic plummet. Then the series goes back uphill with the introduction of Mikami, or as I call him, the delete guy.\
Episode 25 and 37 are hard hitters in terms of the feels so watch out for that ;)\

    My friend is a big Anime fan and as I am just easing into it I asked for some advise, whilst she gave  me many, many, many recommendations I settled on Death Note for a number of reasons. A lot of people had been very excited about the anime and it was one of the top five my friend had recommended. \
Whilst at first I found the plot a little edgy I found myself loving every second of it. Between the character development and little surprises throughout the plot I felt like I was almost a shinigami myself ^_^ I believe the sound tracks\
          \
        and selected music could have been a little more gentle, however, the opening is one of the best sound tracks through out the whole series.\
When watching certain programs I find little traits in characters that I can relate to to amuse myself or create new ideas to write/think about. \
Overall, my favourite parts of this Anime series were character developments of Light Yagami and L Lawliet, I enjoyed how Ryuk was used for pure humour and I loved the plot twists. The best recommendation I have ever received for anything and everything. \

    A diabolically clever show, Death Note is devilishly addictive. Its dastardly utilization of a villain as its main character is morbidly entertaining, to say the least. It truly is a well-done show. Though I may not be the shows biggest fan, as there are quite a few flaws, I truly did appreciate the cleverness of the show. It definitely warrants its huge fan-base and popularity, and it can easily be counted amongst the more elite animes. \
Side Note: The characters are amazing, especially L, but unfortunately the final third of the show is, in my opinion, not nearly at the same level as the first\
          \
        2/3rds of the show. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth watching, as it's characters are complex and deviously clever, it's writing is superb, it's storytelling is (for the most part) excellent, and overall it's just a really dark yet fun show to watch. Enjoy! \

    Disclaimer: I am NOT a PROFESIONAL reviewer I’m only a anime fan trying to give feed back to other anime fans with that said one to the review.\
Overall this anime is on of the few shows i’ve seen that manage to capture you from the very beginning the director did an amazing job with both the cinematic effects you truly felt the emotions and suspense the characters feel and he did a good job as well with the mood and angles trowel in he knew when to have dark shady colors and what angles to have to make you feel like your a part of\
          \
        the experience. Light Yagami is a complex character driven by a sense of justice you don’t know if you root for his or the police force. As the story unfolds you get kinda conflicting feeling as you can understand that killing people even if they’re criminals is wrong but you also understand that the world would be much better place without them.\
I love seeing him deal with his psychological issues while he has to battle with both L the greatest detective in the world and the Japanese police force.\
Now I won’t spoil anything so reviewing this is a bit hard all I can say is that this is a must watch for every anime fan \

    Death Note, to me, is a wonderful example at just how interesting and enthralling an anime, or indeed any story can be. Great story, great art, wonderful characters, but only a 6/10?\
Yes.\
While Death Note is a perfect example of an enthralling story with wonderful characters, it's also a good example on how the removal of some characters, especially anticlimactically can easily break a story experience.\
While the first half was a wonderful masterpiece, I struggled to watch the remainder of the show, not *just* because they got rid of some characters I like, but because of the *way* it was done. I recommend this anime even\
          \
        to, or maybe especially to people who don't consider themselves anime fans, and i'd recommend this to anime fans as well, even if the events can be disappointing.\

    I am quite prideful to admit that Death Note has changed my life. It has allowed me to start questioning the idea of mortality and human worth. One simple question which will allow you to determine whether the protagonist is a villain or a hero: Should a man who has done terrible crime(s) (such as raping a woman) be respected as a human being and do they deserve to live? If your answer is no, like me, welcome to the dark club, where you believe Light Yagami, our signature character, to be the hero. If not, then you shall see life from a pessimist's perspective.\
          \
\
The signature \"epic writing scene\" from the first episode of the anime is what started making the art of the show more clear to be a 10 out of 10. The constant emphasis on dark colors (such as nearly every scene being at night time) allows the theme to be dark and deep as it should be. Red emphasizes death, and is commonly shown in the background of our main character.\
The music of this anime is the absolute best. It perfectly shows the intensity of the scene and allows the atmosphere to be set. No extra comments needed, the sound is perfect. \
Up until the midpoint of the anime, every aspect led Death Note to be a 10 out of 10, until its decline afterwards. This is not meant to be a discouragement, as this simply chipped 1 number off of the story and character aspects. I highly encourage anybody to finish this anime, no matter how much the midpoint's bitter, injustice-given taste is (as it seems to do so for some others). The feeling of rivalry is still there, but rather the competitor is a child version in comparison. An intellectual child.\
This anime, albeit with short disappointment, is quite honestly one of the strongest-speaking anime of all time. Your morals are in question to whoever watches.\

    *This review contains spoilers*\
First review.\
Death Note is an anime I feel very conflicted about. I hope that this review might explain my opinion. \
The story of Light and his quest to become \"God of the new world\" is one I find very interesting and appealing on a personal level. The \"Death Note\" is a very unique plot device and like many magical plot devices it has a set of rules to stop the plot from ending before it starts. The beginning is the best place to start: We are introduced to Light, we're introduced to supernatural elements ( Ryuk and shinigami), we learn that the\
          \
        world of Death Note is based on own, and we learn of the rivalry and epic battle that is about to commence between Light and L. The way the story is thrust upon you in the beginning is pretty simple, a book fell from the sky and Light picked it up; there is nothing wrong with a story that happens by coincidence or chance (because that's how life works) but there something a bit off about a story where the Main character of the story can be vastly different from each other (proven by Misa's existence in the story). The show does make up for this by being keeping its plots and events seamless.\
The characters of death note are still in my after more than a year since watching death note, making it a testament to how well executed they are. I'm not saying because aside from some of the supporting characters i don't feel like there was much character development; Light stays more or less the same person till the very end (which I'll get to later). Death changes people so when you have 'Death' in the name I do expect some character development (like in 'Death' Parade). I mean killing always changes a person either they may enjoy it or they feel disgusted with themselves and if that change occurred in Light I either didn't notice it or it wasn't well executed. Though to make memorable supporting characters is a feat on its own.\
Another thing I still remember, though not vividly, is the music in death note. Having a soundtrack that sounds orcestrial is perfect for the show. The tense moments seem more impactful and the song \"Death Note theme\" is still in my mind to this day. The first OP is okay but oddly enough I like the second OP more; I assume its because it reflects the second half/season of death note better than the first one did. I watched the english dub (like I always do when possible) and enjoyed each VA's portrail of their respective characters in the show. I didn't like any one character VA more than another aside from the shinigami, which i like for the same reason I like Alphonse from FMA, because they were odd or unique even from a technical aspect.\
The art is pretty good and is what I would expect from Madhouse (One punch man, Hunter x Hunter (2011)); the 'action' scenes like the tennis match between Light and L and the time Light wrote while simultaneously eating chips (ha) flow like water and are well placed and natural bringing needed excitement in a nice contrast to the talkier, slower, and tenser moments. The dark colours of the show is perfect for this morally grey series.\
Rant and Spoiler warning. This is where I feel strongest about the series and turned this solid 9 series into a 6.5 (I rounded up). The ending, its as important as the beginning and Death Note's is one i feel strongly about. Light is character the audience is in part meant to root for because he is given the most screen time and we are given his inner thoughts (while other characters have spoken monologues). When an ending drastically changes a character it feels wrong to me. A temporary reaction to an event is fine but what death note did to light seems inconceivable. Its established that if Light has to find out L's (and later on N's) real name in order to kill him become \"God of the New world\". He kills L in what I'm assuming is the end of season 1 (I binged the show over a week) and introduces us to N and Keehl. At the last episode Light makes one his pawns write N (Nate) and everyone with him (N's companions and the Kira task force) in the Death Note to Kill them; after a whole plan that reveals the Death Note pages to be a fake and therefore won't kill them. What Light does next is what pisses me off, He panics. I don't mean realising that your phone is missing panic, I mean a hobo having his lunch stolen panic. Now at this point you might expect Light to be shot in this fury of his (which he does). Light calls everyone idiots for what they did to him and crawls away like a dog, even though they could (and should) have arrested him in that moment. But instead Light crawls to some stares and it is implied that Ryuk kills. This ending feels hollow to me, there is nothing wrong with MC dying at the end but the circumstances are.\
In conclusion Death Note is a rollercoaster ride that if you want to call yourself a fan of anime kind of have to watch by default with good reason (good OST, decent characters, nice art, and appealing story). \

    Overview:\
This series is overrated.\
'Overrated' does not mean 'bad', it means 'overrated', as in 'not the amazing masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be'. Now, before you all start throwing hissy-fits and accuse me of not understanding or whatever, just bear with me for a bit and let me explain my position, because I can give plenty of good reasons as to why I feel the way I do. It's a very good series- I don't mind admitting that- but it has a lot of glaring flaws that people tend to overlook in favour of its unique premise.\
Story (7.5/10):\
The story is centred around\
          \
        Light Yagami, a bored young genius who resents all things evil. During any old day at school, he finds a mysterious notebook called a Death Note, which apparently has the ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages. Although understandably sceptical about its powers, Light decides to take the notebook home to experiment with. He soon discovers that the Death Note is real. Before long, he is completely corrupted by a desire to rid the world of all those he disapproves of, after which he will take over the new world as its god.\
Of course, mass murder does not go unnoticed and so it's not long before Light gains an opponent, and that opponent is the world's greatest detective, known only as L. At this point, the person behind the murders (namely Light) has been dubbed by the police as 'Kira', the Japanese word for 'killer'. The result is an insane game of cat-and-mouse where Kira and L have to hunt down each other without knowing their name or face, and the first one whose identity is revealed loses. It's not a bad story and Light's a great villain to make it happen but while it starts off brilliant, it slowly starts to fall apart towards the end because of its unrelenting arrogance.\
The biggest problem with the story is that it seems to believe it can get away with just about anything. It seems to be a common belief in the anime community that very specific things, such as 'anyone can die', automatically mean 'good story' and can't be overdone. Well, in my opinion, anything can be overdone. A story isn't automatically brilliant because it isn't afraid to kill off a main character, because later it might realise that it can't continue without that character. Anyway, without giving too much away, the final third of the series comes off as really rushed when compared to the rest of it and while the ending is fitting and symbolic, to get to it we have to have one of the biggest ass pulls I've seen in anything, let alone anime. The end result is a very intelligent, deep story that takes far too many risks and ultimately gets crushed under the weight of its own ambition.\
Art & Animation (8.5/10):\
\"Death Note\"'s animation is at its best in darkened scenes. In lightened scenes, however, it doesn't look nearly as good. In darkened scenes, the art looks fantastic, but in lightened scenes it looks quite average. A lot of the animations can be quite cheesy as well, with seriously melodramatic bits that nearly ruined some otherwise really good scenes. That may come across  as nitpicking for some people, but if there's one anime cliché I cannot stand, it's melodrama. Overall, however, the series does look really good.\
Sound & Dialogue (8/10):\
\"Death Note\"'s soundtrack is good, but not what I'd call memorable. Overtime, it just uses the same tracks over and over again to the point that they just blend into the background. The opening and ending themes are quite forgettable and I skipped them every time. The voice acting and dialogue is mostly really good, although some of it, Light's in particular, can be pretty heavy-handed at times. Don't get me wrong- Brad Swaile does play the role well- but there are times when he sounds so full-of-himself and is essentially saying to L and the others 'You can't do anything to me.' when they absolutely can. It's like he's announcing that he's Kira. If I were to pick a standout performance, it would have to be Alessandro Juliani as L. He has a very droll voice which is very fitting of the character.\
Characters (6.5/10):\
I'll start with the two leads: Light and L. The rivalry between the two of them is definitely interesting, as they both contrast each other in many ways. For example, Light is highly charismatic and wins over allies easily without really doing anything. L, on the other hand, has to work hard to win the trust of the Japanese Task Force, due to essentially being an anomaly and having a lot of strange habits. In other words, Light is very normal while L is very strange. Light is definitely a good character as he's essentially a spin on the typical shonen protagonist (high school student with a mysterious supernatural weapon, except that he's a villain) and his intelligence makes him formidable. Ultimately, however, I found L to be much smarter than Light as even though he knows nothing about the supernatural elements of the series, he still manages to keep up with Light nearly every step of the way. There are times when he even manages to be ahead of him. The intense battle between these two is very interesting and one of the reasons I was able to enjoy the series.\
Besides Light and L, we also have the members of the Japanese Task Force, who are good characters in their own rights, most notably Shuichi Aizawa and Touta Matsuda. Matsuda is the youngest and most inexperienced member of the team, and is frequently considered an idiot by the others, but he's also the best shot in the force and he absolutely gets a chance to prove it. Aizawa has a very short temper but in spite of this, or sometimes even because of it, he serves as the voice of reason and is usually the one to call out L when he believes he's going too far. In fact, judging by the characters introduced in the first episodes, the cast of characters is very good.\
Unfortunately, in episode 11, Misa Amane gets introduced and that is where the characters take a turn for the worst. Misa is an absolutely perfect example of what not to do with a Yandere character. Imagine taking Yuno Gasai, the queen of them all, and stripping away everything that made that character so compelling and sympathetic (the cuteness, cunning, deep insecurities etc.). Then imagine portraying her obsession with Yu-excuse me, Light- as comic relief rather than dark mystery and sticking on the 'overgrown spoiled child' stereotype that female characters are infamous for, and you have Misa- a one-dimensional caricature of a crazy stalker as opposed to a complex, fleshed-out character. And while she is given a tragic backstory, I couldn't relate to or sympathise with her at all, as Light is such a despicable person that it's simply impossible to understand what she sees in him. The characters introduced afterwards pretty much follow suit. Most of them are either brought in solely for comic relief, disappear as quickly as they were introduced or are just poor replacements for old characters, with two particularly infamous examples of the latter. It's like Tsugumi Ohba ran out of ideas very early and just started jotting down any idea that popped into his head, which practically serves as a foreshadowing of the show's decline. As a result, this is easily the low point of the series.\
Enjoyment (7.5/10):\
The first two thirds of the series are highly suspenseful, as Light does everything to figure out L's real name and L tries to prove Light's guilt. Unfortunately, the final third is very boring by comparison, to the point that I almost thought I was watching a completely different show, which is jarring to say the least. I pretty much struggled to watch the entire series to the end, though I will admit the ending did redeem things a little.\
Overall:\
Long story short, \"Death Note\" is probably the most overrated anime I have seen. It starts off very good but completely falls apart in the last arc and it seems that people simply love it so much for its ambition. Truth is, ambition isn't always a good thing. Often, it gets in the way and makes you believe you can do much more than you really can, and \"Death Note\" proves that. Of course, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't worth a look. It's just that if someone tells you it's a masterpiece, I'd think twice before believing them. \

    This is one of the best psychological thrillers out there. \
It sucks you in right off the bat and when the two main characters pit themselves up against each other, you feel as though you're right in the middle of them. It really stimulates your mind and even when you think you're one step ahead of the characters, they knock you backwards. \
Towards the end, it fell slightly short in some episodes, but nevertheless, a truly fantastic piece of art! I almost NEVER re-watch anime, but I have done so with this one 3 times over.\
The two main characters are definitely two of my favorites\
          \
        ever and make the show worth watching.\

    \"Power tends to corrupt. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\
  Even a brief flirtation with power can radically transform a benevolent and selfless individual into a presumptuous egoist. Such tragedy is the very essence of the anime series \"Death Note\" which devastatingly depicts the malformation of protagonist Light Yagami from a dignified idealist into a haughty murderer. The moral ambiguity of the story encourages the viewer to critique their own ideals of what constitutes good and evil, leading to a thoroughly compelling narrative. This exceptional story is fundamentally centred on how lofty ideals are easily corrupted and the extent to which an individual can be conquered\
          \
        by the pursuit of power. The character of Light Yagami is essentially Shakespearean; just like Hamlet and Macbeth, Light’s fate is ultimately poignant and reflective of human nature. The complexity of the main character and the harrowing journey that he takes underlies an immensely sophisticated plotline and justifies why \"Death Note\" is rightfully regarded as one of the finest anime series of the last decade.  \
 Whilst the world is abundant in hope and inspiration, it is equally resourceful in crime and injustice; a sort of equilibrium between tranquillity and savagery. \"Death Note\" depicts a zealous idealist who attempts to radically alter this balance in order to establish a utopia in which crime is eliminated. The central character Light Yagami is a quintessential prodigy who is among the most exceptional students in Japan; he is seen as a hard- working and respectful honour student with decent moral standards. Yet, he is also a bored and frustrated young man who fanatically derides the devastating consequences of criminality on society. When a Shinigami (a being that instigates death) by the name of Ryuk, who also happens to be disentranced in his own world, drops a death note into the human world that Light stumbles upon, the fate of the protagonist is destined for tragedy.  A single rule governs the use of the Death Note: \"the human whose name is written in this note shall die\". After much introspection and mental conflict, Light decides to become an enforcer of justice who uses the death note to eliminate all criminals in order to usher in a new world in which crime is non-existent and he is worshipped as a deity. Within days the brilliant idealist turns into a supercilious murderer as he kills hundreds of people using the notebook and employs the most ingenious of methods to prevent being caught. Amidst all of this chaos the viewer is left to question the morality of Light’s actions and whether he is indeed passing righteous judgement; this is the seminal and ground-breaking aspect of this series as Light ruthlessly, excessively and narcissistically employs the death note to create a world free of crime. Light’s methods become increasingly Machiavellian and his approach becomes devoid of empathy as he begins to systematically eliminate not just criminals but also anyone who opposes him. One is always left to question whether Light’s methods are a necessary evil or simply the brutal machinations of a megalomaniac.  \
 This debate is accentuated as the Japanese police quickly suspect that the string of murdered criminals is the work of a serial killer. At this point the Japanese police, which happens to be spearheaded by Light’s morally immaculate father (Soichiro Yagami), seeks the help of a world renowned detective by the name of L. L is the eccentric genius who detests Light’s methods and exerts every effort in his attempts to apprehend him. Crucially, L is the pronounced antithesis to Light Yagami as he is opposed to the moral foundations and rationalisation of the man he is attempting to capture. The series is exceptional at presenting the contrast between the points of view towards reforming the world that devastatingly collide as L and Light clash.  It is as compelling to discern the similarities of the two men as they both obsessively conspire to foil the schemes of the other. Their respective fanaticisms, L’s desire to capture Light and Light’s attempts to create a utopia, facilitate a thoroughly fascinating narrative that has rarely been seen in anime. Juxtaposition has been used elegantly in anime as the methods of Lelouch and Suzaku conflicted in \"Code Geass\" and the ideologies of Akane and Makishima collided in \"Psycho Pass\". Nonetheless, the rivalry between L and Light is unparalled given the fanaticism and intelligence of the two foes who leave no stone unturned in their attempts to outwit one another. Once episode 25 reaches its riveting conclusion the viewer is immersed by a captivating masterpiece of a level that is rarely seen in anime. From that point onwards the series continues to potently combine suspense with intelligent mystery but there is a noticeable decline in the quality of the storytelling as L’s protégés Near and Mello are introduced. It must be said that the two protégés are nowhere near as enticing and idiosyncratic as L and this means that the story in general begins to decline in the last twelve episodes or so. The series’ finale can also be criticized since it is overly dramatic and is devoid of the emotional elements that were such a pivotal aspect of the first half of the story. Whilst the climax is certainly not a failure it is somewhat tedious and unconvincing which is not what a series of this calibre deserved. \
 Other than the central main characters the viewer is introduced to a diverse and intriguing cast that galvanises the story and gives it greater depth. Soichiro Yagami is an admirable character given his assiduousness and indefatigability as he seeks to capture Kira, the name the media uses to refer to Light Yagami. He is also immensely tragic in that he does not realise that the killer he is looking to apprehend is the very son he loved so compassionately. Ryuk is amusing in that he fulfils his yearning for excitement by sending the human world into mayhem by dropping a death note; the Shinigami is indeed a fascinating character with intriguing motivations. Misa Amane is the integral female character who also happens to possess a death note; she is obsessively infatuated by Kira and eventually begins to cooperate with Light Yagami as she aspires to help him achieve his dream of a utopia. It must be said that Misa can at times be greatly irritating as she has a tendency to slow the story and her unwavering loyalty to Light Yagami, who is conspicuously manipulating her, borders on sheer stupidity. The main cast is completed by the police officers Matsuda and Aizawa who provide broadness and even an element of effective humour to the series. A major criticism of the series is the stagnant character development which means that the emotional attachment of the viewer to a large majority of the characters is fairly limited. The transformation of Light Yagami from an idealist seeking a paragon to an egocentric murderer with a definitive \"god complex\" is frightening and exceptionally well portrayed but this is the limit of the character development that takes place in \"Death Note\". The other characters, whether they be Misa or Ryuk, remain constant and do not develop or even mature in any shape or form. This is the underlying weakness of the series that prevents it from standing alongside \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" and \"Cowboy Bebop\" as a titan of anime. \
 The animation of the series does not compare to anything produced by a studio like Kyoto Animation but it is effective and pleasant to view. Character designs have been approached meticulously and this leads to a well -crafted series.  The soundtrack is efficacious in that each character has a particular theme that resonates powerfully with their personality and role in the story; this only serves to heighten the impact of the character cast. \
 Idealistic ambitions have a tendency to be tainted by corruption as has been seen in history. Students of history will turn to the mutation of the French Revolution into a reign of terror whilst students of literature will refer to the tragedy of Hamlet. This feature of humanity applies to Light Yagami and \"Death Note\" is able to exquisitely portray this transformation. Whilst the series has its flaws it is tremendously effective in depicting how far a man can fall when he can no longer handle power. \"Death Note\" is a compelling and poignant series that is certainly worth watching and its beauty lies in its ability to encourage the viewer to question their own convictions.

    No spoilers, or summaries in this review, just an opinion-based, general discussion.\
I'm sorry, but this anime is so overrated. After all of the hype people were giving me about it, I was expecting a lot more...substance. Honestly, it started getting weird for me from episode 9 on. After that it just felt like a period where I was watching a completely different anime from what I had started with and there was so much fluff that I couldn't see through it! I feel like no depth was added to the story which is sad because it had so much potential. Instead I watched a bunch\

        of psychos stuck in the twilight zone. 'Nuff said.\

    Ah, it pains me to write this review. Well, to be more precise, this is more of a commemoration of the good parts of Death Note, (a.k.a. The first 20 some episodes), while strenuously acknowledging the steady decline of the series as it progressed. \
This anime had great potential, as in, it would've recieved a solid score of 8, if it had ended with a short conclusion after the obvious climax. It possessed a good set up, easily transitioning into the actual plot. The portrayal of our sociopathic protagonist, Light, as an over-achieving student, bored with life, thus stunting his disillusioned path for justice, was\
          \
        a very wise decision on the creator's part. The death note in itself was both original, and intensifying.\
What really pleased me to see as an avid watcher, was the implementation of a set of rules. In many anime, especially science fiction or fantasy, the characters undergo some sort of invincible transformation, making the story incredibly dull, knowing that whenever the main character comes into conflict, either they would miraculously survive, or obtain some sort of random assistance. The fact that the shinigami in this series were unable to assist their human companions, required Light to fend for himself, thus making for a much stronger character development. \
L was a very straight-laced character as well, and I mean this structurally, not character personality wise. The role of a detective couldn't have been enacted better. Once again, we see set limitations that an actual detective may encounter, not some omniscient being who draws evidence from thin air. The relationship between Light and L was one that served as both thrilling, emotional, and at times comical. Despite some minor repetition, and redundant themes, this anime was everything you would expect, and wish to see in this genre. \
Now the difficult part.\
 I don't want to provide any spoilers, but in episode 25, we see the climax of the series. Let's just say after this incident, died the quality, and interest value of the entire anime. \
Sure the creators attempted to keep the once vibrant flame burning, but it just became very mediocre, and sullen. I suppose, there was really no reason to care at this point. Some may argue that it was for the purpose of truly bringing justice, but to state it bluntly, after about the 28th episode, it wasn't worth finishing. I, of course finished it, to make sure I wasn't missing any plot twists. Alas, I was left empty handed. \
My only advice to the creators, was that they should've quit while they were ahead. It just dragged on, and really wasn't worth the trouble. Expecting an Xbox for Christmas, but receiving socks, is probably the best way to describe this feeling. Just disappointing. \

    When I dove into the anime otaku word there were some anime's I knew I needed to watch or at least try and one of them was death note, I had known about this anime even as an outsider and I also understood the basic concept where there is a supernatural notebook for whom ever's name you write into it shall die.\
Impression\
to start off the approach this anime takes I found similar to who bleach started, your main character is a teenager and one day some supernatural stuff happens and then he's exterminating offenders of heinous crimes. The rules of the concept play very well\
          \
        with the plot as it turns into a very riveting psycho thriller with a perpetual cat and mouse game that goes on for most of the anime until about the 26th episode which would have been a great place to stop however the last 17  episodes are kind of a train wreck so most people pay attention to the first initial story.\
Now if you are into action and don't find thrillers very entertaining you may not like this anime, (you may not like this anime, [YOU MAY]) I say that because this anime has a tendency to pull in fans of the other genres mainly because of the way the story is laid out.\
Characters\
there is light yagami, who is a bright young man who is the lead protagonist of the story, now this is not an anime that is particularly kind to it's characters and I won't get into them to much because it may spoil the story and the characters are not particularly the main focus of this anime but more of the concept, but there are defiantly some likable, L who is sort to the antagonist/protagonist has an awkward nature that can be relatable to some and is just as smart as light, there is Ryuk a shinigami who is the source of the death note who is the badass monster clown character who despite his appearance show's some pretty funny antics for comic relief but can maintain a serious stature, finally there is Misa Amane the sort of love interest for Light, (sort of).\
Sub vs. dub\
for this round the sub and dub seem to match blow for blow, the english dub can bring you into the story very well just as the sub does and the sub can be pretty entertaining to listen to. the only real difference is between a few characters. Ryuk in japanese sounds like a regular old man wile in english he has a grittier and more sinister voice as do most of the other shinigami which works better to their somewhat dark nature. the only other difference which doesn't make as much of a difference unless you despise the sound of hi pitched squeaky japanese school girls is Misa amane, in japanese she has a real high pitched voice which isn't as annoying as you think and in english her voice, in it's own way was still high pitched but was still it's own thing but it doesn't make much difference because both are portrayed very well and I suggest getting a taste of both the sub and dub if you can.\
final verdict\
I'm going to either give this one an eight or a seven, it's not the greatest but I couldn't tell you what is the greatest, but this anime is a definite must watch or at least you could try it out.\

Sound:\

Never before have I heard of openings and closings reflecting a character. The first opening that begins each episode is best described as anxious uncertainty. This mellow yet chilling sound begins each early episode of Light's journey. But as Light progresses down this path, the opening and closing shifts. No longer is it a gothic lulluby, but rather becomes a screaming beat of insanity.\
Character:\
10/10\
The world is full of insignificant characters. These lowlifes are crudely whittled pawns. They have no past or future, only now. They do their job and cease to exist. However, pawns are not the only pieces on a chessboard. Other pieces are shaped by their past, polished by their present, and shine brightly as they move down the board toward their future. Light, L, Misa, Near, Mellow, Mikami, Takada...these are fine-tuned Knights, Queens, Rooks, Bishops, and Kings. And not a single piece is left untold.\

    Death Note is, undoubtedly, one of the highest quality animes out there. The storyline is completely unique, original, and suspenseful; always compelling you to watch the next episode, but not disappointing you at the finale. When I first came across this show, I was skeptical about i after reading the description because I didn't like heavy, detective, murder, or horror shows. But trust me on this one, the gore is kept to  minimum, and the story is pure genius as it is based on intellect rather then physical strength. \
Story 10/10\
A notebook falls from the realm of the shinigami, landing in the human world,\
          \
        where a bright university student picks it up. The notebook, called \"Death Note\", has the power to kill whoevers name is written in it, even to the extent of controlling their time and conditions of death. However, one must know the name and face of the target for the note to actually take affect. Yagami Light, a boy with a strong sense of justice, decides to take it upon himself to rid the world of evil by killing the criminals of the world to create a new one. Meanwhile, a strange detective names L begins to hunt him down, and the race begins between the two geniuses. \
Art 10/10\
The art perfectly depicts the emotions and expressions that each of the characters are feeling. Although they are not the most detailed pictures, they are beyond expectations in distinguishing the characters from each other.\
Sound 9/10\
Not that this area was particularly lacking, but the sound could have been improved. Each character sort of had a theme song that really matched them and played a large effect on the film, but the opening songs could have been much better.\
Character 10/10\
Here, is one of the few animes where an intense plot can be made with a minimal number of contrasting characters. Yagami Light, L, Near, Mello, and Misa basically make up the plot. Each of the characters are painstakingly different, with realistic similarities, and are amazing in their own ways. \

    Death Note is one of the best animes I have seen. The story was very original about what is true justice. Whether killing people is right or not. The challenges of Light and L. The way the solve it. (I gained more knowledge from it) Mentally testing each other. Not having fillers like some animes that has nothing to move the theme along.  The drama that it gave it like \" ...I will take a potato chip and EAT IT\" Light Yagami and all the funny parts of it all.  So overall, this is an awesome anime and the best I have ever\
          \
        seen. \

    Death Note is a recognisable anime and deservingly so given its unique but not completely off the planet weird storyline.\
Death Note revolves around a Death Note, a notebook with which the user can kill by merely writing a person's name in it whilst picturing the person. When Light Yagami, a high school student, discovers a Death Note belonging to a Shinigami, he sets about a quest to cleanse the world of evil. However, there are many who attempt to bring \"Kira\" to justice, namely the enigmatic L.\
The anime's strength lies in its unique weird characters. Light, seemingly the most sane of the bunch is arguably\
          \
        a sociopath, and the major detectives running the investigation (L and followers) have a few habits of their own.\
The other thing worth noting is the story. The plot is dramatic with a lot of cunning, almost surgical moves by some of the players. This makes for a very engaging battle of wits between Light and his enemies. However, whilst the story is good and no doubt has continuity, the plot is somewhat hindered by the sudden, bordering on disjointed, twists that occur at times in the story. Some parts are supposed to be sudden, but others I think deserved a few more episodes to demonstrate a gradual change. The perfect example is that L is a mystery at the start and it is a few episodes, before his identity is revealed to the audience. By contrast, the first time we meet another of the detectives, it is without any secrecy whatsoever. \
Overall, this is a fantastic anime with unique characters, a beautifully detailed mystery and a most enjoyable endeavour to embark on.\

    This was one of the first anime that I watched. I didn't know what to expect but after a couple of episodes I was hooked. What worked for me was the genius the lead character possessed and their pursuit to achieve their goal. There are many unexpected twists and the thrill of what's gonna happen next was high. This series also raises a question over good results driven from immoral deeds and how power can mess you up; I spent much time deciding which character I wanted to succeed, but I will leave it up to you to decide. The downside for me was stereotypical\
          \
        character of Misa Misa, it was irritating for me. And the second season went downhill for me, the first season was spot on deserving 10/10 but 2nd was not that good, new characters were not likeable but rather annoying. The end was unexpected but majority of viewers would agree that it was not as good as it was expected to be. Highly recommended.\

    Death Note is one of the best Animes to ever come upon to..(I am not sure if you see me a little exaggerating)\
Story 10/10:\
        The most important factor in making Death Note a true Anime masterpiece is its story..It's the kind of story that will keep you waiting for more..The results aren't so predictable..The story, all in all, is a great story better than anything I've ever seen..\
Art 8/10:\
         The animation in Death Note has been pretty good..Although it has nothing special but the graphics are quiet good and the\
          \
        blood at the end of the story was gruesome and interesting but still appropriate for kids\
Sound 7/10:\
         The sound in this Anime wasn't bad..It was understandable (I watched the English Dub version)\
Also, the theme music was quite awesome :D...But to be honest it felt nothing special\
Character 9/10:\
         The character is a contributing fact in the story. The character of Light Yagami going for Justice and the character of others like L and Near are awesome :D\
Enjoyment 10/10:\
         I remember that summer vacation when I stayed the whole night up..That Anime was good..It is always enjoyable and always interesting..\
Overall 9/10:\
        All in all,this Anime is one of the most recommended..It will leave you thinking about the events and it might leave you wanting to rewatch..It's surely recommended\

    This is one of those titles that everyone and their brother have seen. it’s still one of the top ranked animes according to fans that have voted there. It wasn’t without it’s problems though and so for me to discuss them in more detail I’m going to remind those that haven’t seen this show: Spoilers in the write-up.\
\
Final Series Score: 9/10\
Rewatchablity: low\
Pros: excellent animation, premise was very orginal and engaging, many great characters, plot took several unexpected turns, L’s investagation was smart and made for compelling anime.\
Cons: pacing problems, second half was rather weak and unconvincing, not enough Ryuk\
\
Death Note follows Light Yagami, who is\
          \
        a typical bored genius high school student, after he finds the \"Death Note\" laying on the ground one day. Instead of being a creepy goth-emo kid’s diary – it’s how the Shinigami actually go about killing the people of the world. When Light realizes what he has, he has visions of cleaning up the filth of the world and making the earth a better place to live (with him being the \"god\" of this new world order). It doesn’t take long for police around the world to realize that their criminals are dieing quite unexpectedly and in large numbers. The killer is dubbed \"Kira\" by the media.\
\
They decide to call for this generation’s Sherlock Holmes to find out what’s going on and apprehend the person or persons behind this epidemic of killing. His name is L and he’s a bit unorthodox in appearance and methods but very brilliant. Quite possibly the only one that could match wits with Light. The show then shifts to a contest of wills between Light and L. Will Light win and establish his NWO or will L figure out that it’s Light before Light has the chance to kill L?\
Something else i must mention after you finish this anime it is almost impossible to watch again as the story is so tense when you first watch it that it makes you want to watch the next episode, but after seeing the whole series you know what is going to happen and this makes it very boring.\
Have fun watching this anime \

    Death Note:\
Story:\
Very imaginative, creative, complex and precise story. A book that can kill people in various ways of which the writer specifies. With rules balancing out the power of the Death Note, I think the creator got the mix just right. Yagami Ratio, a Japanese student and also a genius, contemplates one day, of what it would be like if all the people who were making the world rotten with crime and corruption - were gone!\
One day from the sky, falls a Note Book called, 'Death Note,' a perfect present for a genius boy who wants to change the world. From there the story goes\
          \
        on and develops into a battle of wit and intelligence between Raito and a super detective called - L. With the shinigami who dropped the death note by his side, Raito continues to purge the world of criminals and low lifes.\
Art:\
Very slik and sharp, great how they gave a coloured theme, such as red eyes and hair ect. to each person when they plotted and deducted plans inside their conscious. The animation adds greatly to the suspense.\
Sound:\
Almost perfect OST considering the anime plot and character's personality. And also great openings and endings that also reflect the nature of the show.\
Character:\
Outstanding character designs, nearly all of them scream KAKOII-ness, with high intelligence and sharp minds mixed in with habbits and mannerisms the characters fit perfectly into their given roles.\
For anyone who is thinking of watching this anime but is unsure, don't be, this is well worth the watch. I also recommend it to people who only watch all action shonen type anime, this will change your opinion and taste in anime! =D\

    A masterpiece, simply said. Death Note is everything an anime should be. The first unique anime that changed the way I felt about animes. Death Note was the anime that got me back into animes. I was an avid watcher of anime on Toonami and Anime Unleashed on Tech TV. As I grew older I separated from animes and felt that nothing new would ever be as good as an anime during my childhood. Well I was wrong, this anime blew me a way in more then words can describe. The love you will feel for these characters will stay long after you've finished watching\

        it. If I had to recommend any anime it would be Death Note. The perfect anime for anyone who enjoys a complex moral driven thriller.\

    The Death Note anime...wish me luck!:-D(Sorry about the poor grammar/spelling)\
STORY (6)\
Yeah, I gave the Death Note story a 6...got a problem with that??:'(.  Let me explain. The reason that I gave the plot a lower rating than the norm is because the second half of the series had a serious dip in the enjoyment factor.  Am I alone in assuming that Near is a very unlikeable character??  I loved the first half of the season! It was a lot fun watching the cat and mouse mind games between L and Kira.  The manipulative mind games between Kira and his pursuers is\
          \
        the driving force behind the whole series.  This means that the success or failure of this series depends upon how enjoyable these games can be, so when the mind games stop being entertaining...failure...One of the negative points of this anime is that (at times) it tries to be too serious and epic and it just comes out as silly and cheesy.  Epic is good, but all good things in moderation.\
ART (7)\
I'm certainly no expert when it comes to judging animation, so I'm gonna keep this nice and short.  I thought it was pretty good.(hah you thought I was gonna say something meaningful:-D)...but in all seriousness, I don't really have any complaint with the animation.  I liked how the anime characters still looked like the manga characters(you know how sometimes you read a manga then you go to see the anime(or vice versa)and you're like \"Wait...WHAT?? Who is this character!?!?\"...yeah...).\
SOUND (7)\
Overall, I thought that the music was pretty good.  The opening is really catchy and fits the series.  The ending is good, but unmemorable. The music throughout the episodes usually help to make a scene even more epic...EXCEPT when the series starts trying too hard and every Kira/L/Near/Mellow scene just HAS to be epic...*sigh*...\
ENJOYMENT (8)\
For all my b**ching bout the second half of the series, I still gave Death Note a fairly high enjoyment rating.  I thought that no matter how much I didn't enjoy the last half, I still enjoyed the first half enough for it to earn an 8. I mean, who doesn't love an anti-hero with a god complex:-D.\
OVERALL (7)\
Overall, I give this anime a 7!  It would have been higher if the second half had been better, and if the anime didn't feel like it was epically trolling me...As much as I talked bout the negative points of this anime, I still enjoyed Death Note.  The suspenseful mind games and interesting characters helped make up for much of this anime's flaws:-).\

    OK, so I'll try make this short as I realise reading a lengthy review can be quite tedious when you'd much rather be spending the time watching anime :)\
For me, there are two words which describe this: Suspenseful and Thrilling.\
The story begins of Yagami Light, a regular student stumbles upon a \"Death Note\" that, to keep it simple, when a name is written, that person shall die of a heart attack or a written cause chosen by the writer.\
The story develops onwards, whereby Light eliminates all criminals to develop a Utopia, a world free from crime.\
Following the outbreak of such deaths, centered around Japan, a\
          \
        highly regarded investigator, known as \"L\" is brought upon to find the killer. Thus ensues a compelling storyline in which \"L\" wants to find the killer (Light), whilst Light wants to find who this mysterious \"L\"is.\
Have you ever watched a TV series, where at the end of each episode, there is a cliffhanger that leaves the audience wanting to know what happens next?\
Well, this is what Death Note is, and before you know it, watching a couple episodes will not be enough, and all of a sudden, you want to know more of what happens next and so on.\
I'll leave it here, not wanting to spoil this anime for others. If you havent seen it, I highly recommend it to everyone.\

    Well, here it is, the all-famed Death Note. I have to say, I figured since so many people love it, it can't be bad. Boy, was I wrong. Death Note has an incredibly mediocre plot for what it set out to do. The story, as we all know, is about the discovery of the Death Note that can kill those whose names are written in it. Original? Somewhat. Well-executed? Hardly. The art and the sound were really good, which is a shame that they seemed to make it pretty and ran out of focus and funding for a good story and characters. Don't even get\
          \
        me started on the characters. L was the cute, quirky villain(original right? Oh wait, that's been beaten to death) and Light was your typical emotastic sqeenix type character with a vendetta against society. I've seen much better crime drama anime like Boogiepop Phantom and Paranoia Agent, which is a shame because this piece of crap ended up being one of, if not the most popular, crime anime. Oh well, you guys can have your Death Note, I'm just saying it's an all-around bad anime that really doesn't deserve all the hype it gets. \

    If you had the power to kill anybody just by writing their name into a book what would you do? Would you become a vigilante killing anybody who makes the world a worse place to live in, or would you kill anybody who defies you, making you a God one step at a time...\
When I first saw death note I watched the entire series in one sitting. It wasn't particularly short either so that shows you how much I liked it. The intelligent and contrasting characters kept me entertained along with its interesting idea of being able to kill anybody with ease, however about two\
          \
        thirds of the way in the series went downhill fast. I recommend this to any anime fan who is into psychological thrillers. And please skip the English dub, it was dodgy at best.\

    Death Note is definitely a dramatic, attention-keeping anime that I would love to watch again. \
The story line of this anime is very unexpected at some points. With most animes and/or tv shows that I watch, I can easily guess the ending or at least compile a list of suspects. With Death Note, that was not the case. Everything from relationships to killings were very unexpected. The author of the manga and the director of the show must have been extremely intelligent people. They came up with long, in depth plots that kept the reader/viewer guessing the entire time. \
The characters were also very interesting.\
          \
        For the majority of animes that I've seen... most characters are very flat characters. Their ideas on the world and their personalities don't change too much within the anime. But once again, Death Note was very different from most animes. Even the most minor characters would have dramatic personality changes that would eventually lead to even more problems.\
As far as the art and sound goes, I gave it a 10 and 9. The art was practically flawless. Beautiful illustrations, color matching the mood of the scenes and the difference in drawing techniques based on character personality were very interesting. The sound, as far as I can tell, was pretty good. I did watch the dubbed series, therefore I don't know how the subbed was. The only thing I can say that I disliked about the sound (and I don't know if this even counts for this category) was the repetitive lines. Characters, especially Light, would continuously say the same basic things over and over. I felt that this took away from the mood and made my attention go elsewhere. \
Overall, I enjoyed the series completely. It was an amazing story line, and I would love to watch it again. Maybe next time, I'll watch the subbed and see if this changes my opinion on the sound at all.\

    Ah, Death Note. One of my favorite anime of all time. Death Note is a pretty unique experience. You follow Light Yagami, an completely ordinary student. However, this all change when Light find the \"Death Note\", a mysterious notebook owned by all the Shinigamis, a.k.a \"Gods of Death\". This is where things gets crazy. Light, after testing the Death Note on some random criminal, start to like his newfound powers, maybe even too much. With those powers, Light intend to kill all the criminals, and create a perfect world, where he will be the god. He then become known as \"Kira\", either feared or loved\
          \
        by other people, depending if they agree with him or not\
But of course, the police won't just stand there. They contact Ryusaki, or \"L\" if you prefer, the best detective in the world. The rest of the anime is all about mind fights between L and Light. Often, Light will have an advantage against Ryusaki, but you always have that feeling that he'll get the upper-hand soon.\
The animation is really good, and the color palette really fits the show. All animation are fluid, and the characters have simple, yet very good designs\
This is one of the things that makes Death Note so great, you don't follow the hero, you follow a killer with a god complex. At some point, you wonder ; \"Are Light's actions really so evil ?\" But then Light reminds you that he is, killing ANYONE that stand between him and his perfect world.\
 The other things that I liked, is that this show makes you feel so smart ! Light feels unstoppable, he looks more and more smart each time he reveals par of his plan, as you watch the police and \"L\" constantly getting outsmarted by him. Because of this, Death Note is an anime that can only be watched once, because it's entirely made of plot twists, and cliffhangers. ( In a good way ). You always want to come back the next week, because you know the next episode will be just as fantastic !\
The music is okay, but there's not any notable tracks beside Low of Solipsism.\
Each characters feel unique, wether it's the Light with his cold and psychopathic personality, who will use anyone to get to his goal, even if it means killing friends and family, or Ryuk, Light's companion, which happens to be a Shinigami drugged with apples or Matsuda, one one of the police investigator, cowardly at times, which also happens to be my favorite character.\
This is why I give Death Note a 10/10, for how brilliantly made it's 25 five episodes are.\
\
................. Ok, dammit ! I'll talk about it.\
Sigh... The last twelve episodes.... How do I put it ? Take almost everything that made Death Note so great, and flip it around. There you got the \"Near\" arc.  This arc introduce Near and Mello, two new detectives. Near and Mello are like the pre-alpha 0.112 version of Ryusaki. You don't have that constant feeling that Kira is going to lose anymore. All you do is wonder why they introduced those pointless, bland and completely uninteresting characters. This also leads to a completely BS ending, which made no sense at all. I said that nothing good came out of the law arc, but that isn't really true. Teru Mikami is a really cool character, it's a shame he didn't got more screen time though.\
\
Because of this, I'll have to lower the my rating. However, I love acting as if this arc doesn't exist, so I'll only take away one point, and not 2-3 like I should do.\
And so, I, Darknesser, will give Death Note my final rating of 9/10 and my recommendation\
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a potato chip, AND EAT IT.\

    This anime was pretty good for me, and i think the plot is pretty interesting, the story is really catching and it's unpredictable. My personal favorite thing about this anime are the characters, because to me this characters seem pretty full and have their own personalities they all seem like different characters there's some that are similar but original at their own way. The sound it's good somewhat repetitive but you get that it's a trademark of the anime which makes it even more original.\
I have seen this anime 5 times and i guess i will never get enough of it until i learn every\
          \
        line of it (i'm kidding but i'm pretty obsessed with it). The art it's one of the things i love the most about this anime, and it's because it's original and kind of dark. \
The story is completely original and it's complex but catching, sometimes you will get yourself in a twist thiniking about the story but that's what it makes this story my favorite one. Overall i think it's great, and i highly reccomend it to everyone (that it's interested of course).",

    [Edited for spoilers] Original Review can be found on Animenfo.com -via Kyzoryn\
Death Note is a variance of Code Geass. With that being said, Death Note depicts a story without fighting, blood-shed and physical super powers that many anime are built upon; instead it focuses upon the psychological aspects through a battle of two geniuses, Light Yagami the protagonist and L the antagonist.\
The beauty of the storyline is not the good vs. bad (which is actually a grey area) is the fork between L and Light which forces viewers to fall in love with either of the two, but not both. The constant challenges, betrayal, and\
          \
        cold manipulation are what make the story so exciting. It’s not who is tougher, but who is smarter, riskier, and who will win this battle of wits – its like a chess game, but add drama, death, betrayal and love. The weakness of the storyline is the double ending, has justice prevailed or failed? Who is right L? Or Light? And who is to decide?\
Another strength is the quality of the each and every character as well as the dialogue associated with them. Lights transformation not only defines his character, but those around him as well. L’s odd but lovable antics and habits allow viewers to fall in love with this character. Each character has its place and purpose, the dialogue moving and meaningful, there is a second wasted on fillers or filler-like characters. \
Overall, Death Note is a suspenseful, mind-blowing anime that if you haven’t watched yet, you must watch. It makes a place of its own independent as Death Note explores the psychological world of this battle of wits; it is truly one of a kind. It’s not every day that you come across such a masterpiece.\

    Death Note was the first shonen series I ever watched, and it is not an overstatement to say that even though I have watched many others, this one still tops my list.  Its definately my favorite.  Almost everything about this anime is perfect- the characters, the plot, the mystery and the extremely interesting cat-and-mouse chase between main characters L and Light.  Both L and Light are extremely intelligent and the plans they come up with devised to catch the other are genius and highly interesting.  Death Note will keep you guessing until the very end- its highly entertaining and I spent\
          \
        many nights up WAY too late because I couldn't stop watching.  It was definately worth it.\

    Deathnote is quite a show. Never before has a show had such a far reaching influnce. It finds appeal in the east, the west, with the young and the old. For the westerners in the world, this is the first anime i would suggest watching. My parents and even grandparents have watched this show with me, and they love it. This is the very definition of mass appeal without selling out. Whether you like Deathnot or not, this is the best anime ever made without question. It's not my personal favorite but it is just a flatout masterpiece in every category.\
Story- Without question, what makes\
          \
        Deathnote such a great anime is the story. Every move is carefully thought out in the most intricate and masterful way. The progression is flawless and you will be thinking of the script writer as a genius by the fifth episode. He keeps your emotions tied with an odd mix of anxiety, intrigue, quirky hilarity and a twisted undertone that could possibly change how you look at the world. What is right and what is wrong? The screenwriters definite answer for those questions is a resounding, \"Who knows? But this is what i do know...\". 10/10\
Art- Nothing here is incredibly detailed. The reason this category excels is because of perfection of design. The images the artists have procured will stay with you forever. Shinigami's, the nether realm, the main characters...everything is drawn with complete distinction and uniqueness. The lines are clean and the quality never wavers. 10/10\
Sound- Never noticed any problems. 10/10\
Characters- The characters of Deathnote are brilliantly designed and varied. The main character, Light is a great placeholder that any thinking man could put himself into. The antogonist detectives L and Near are characters you will hold just a closely as Light. Which really makes you question \"who's really the bad guy, here?\". L is designed with an almost over the top quirkiness, which is why he's probably the most popular character. There are more and more characters who are equally as strong as the mains, all in their own way. You will find attatchments to every character. 10/10\
Enjoyment- for one reason or another, this show has received a lot of hate from true anime fans. They all complain of different things, but i can never put my finger on a flaw. The show is perfect. But it really shouldn't be watched by anyone under the age of 12. There are a lot of psychopathic behaviors at play, here...death and dying...and some philosophies that ring true, but are hard to grasp as a child. 9/10 Purely on the pre-tense that some people really just do not like the show.\
Overall- Im glad this show was my first. It's still the best Ive seen after all these years. It will stand the test of time, and entertain audiences for years to come. I really hope you can watch this and see what I see in it!\

    It is hard for me to give Death Note anything less than a 10, BUT I have seen anime with better art; given the year Death Note was done it is understandable why the art is up to a lesser standard so I give the art an 8.\
With that out of the way I want to make this review short and sweet on why this anime surpasses all others. No matter what type of anime you watch Death Note has something for you, guaranteed. When it comes down to it the most important part of any show to keep the viewer entertained and hooked is\
          \
        the story line. In some way the story has to engage its audience; and let me tell you, Death Note engages. A story that only seems to get more dramatic, unpredictable, intense, and complicated keeps people in suspense, guessing and addicted. You will want to know what is going to happen next, and you may think you do know, but you're wrong.\
A truly brilliant anime from start to finish with dynamic characters that you will either love, or love to hate. In the case of Yagami Light you will probably find yourself both loving and hating him. But in all each character has layers added to them that you would normally find in a longer running anime. Considering Death Note has 37 episodes each character still has their own complexity and depth to some extent. \
It is hard for me to simply describe an anime like this where you need to watch first hand to understand for yourself just why it is so captivating. A must watch for anyone; there's a reason it's the 1# most popular.  \

    The anime Death Note is a absulutes masterpiece in my eyes. The story and the characters are so epic and so harmunieren class together, as do in my eyes a few. All people who have not seen this anime, which I can recommend Anime warmly when they are prepared for a lot of action, suspense and epic scenes. Also to the DvD Boxes, series that I own, I can only say good. (Mine are on publisher Kazé and it is the German version) The slipcase are beautifully designed and also keep some out. All in one: An acute power!\
(Dies to L) to the first few\
          \
        episodes, I can say that they were full of excitement. One part could no longer hold on the sofa watching excitement! Kira was always aufmerksarm and ready for anything, up to the time when L died. Then he looked much more relaxed and no longer stayed right on his environment, because he thought he had defused the danger, but it was not so, because suddenly appeared Near and Mello on, but Kira thought they had no chance of him to catch. In the end he had to but admit that he had been beaten, for which he paid with his life. After Near L's took place, it seemed to me that the anime would unnecessarily protracted. At the end I was amazed even by the sudden closing, but it was fun to watch this anime and now to write this review.\

    This in my opinion would have been a master piece, but felt like they rushed to pack as much content in as possible. Thus resulted in a fair rating in my regard. Everything in this review is my based solely on my opinion, some may view it biased but I will maintain my views.\
Spoiler alert\
***********************************************\
Well the story up till when L died was almost perfect, but i felt when they introduced Near and Mellow they were pushing it with how the storyline. It should have ended with L's death. The rest of the story seemed to be a spontaneous and seemed to really depreciate the\
          \
        MC. The ending was what I felt spoiled it, when they could simply take out a few pages of the notebook and keep it with him in person (prosecutor) they instead opted for making a fake one. Where you could not be certain it was not tampered with. He used tearing of pages extensively before, which he did not use as a backup plan. The MC before L's death was way smarter and have more precautions than that. There was also the fact that the MC's sister appeared brain dead for some reason which was not clearly explained.\
Well the art is nothing special seeing as its been a decade.\
Same with sound.\
The characters were actually pretty well made, aside from ones after L's death.\
Enjoyment was again really good until after L's death.\
Overall it was alright taking into consideration that its old and all. Although the the seemingly spontaneous story after L's death seemed rushed and less thought went into them.\

    The story line is amazing and it keeps you hooked but sometimes it feels like the story is getting dragged on but all the characters are amazing! I enjoyed it a lot but sometimes it felt like some things were unnecessary. There are lots of twists and turns, and it keeps you guessing what is gonna happen next. It gets pretty intense after a few episodes and the English dub isn't bad either. I personally like L's character the most. I liked it because it has a lot of moments where the shows catches you off guard , it really makes you hate it and\
          \
        love it at the same time.If you don't like nerve wracking twists and turns then don't watch it but If you really are into psychological thrillers then you should definitely watch it! \

    As you can tell I didn't completely hate this show. I actually really wanted to love it and up until a fixed point, this could have been in my top 10 easy.\
The art I gave a 7, it's solid nothing to complain about here really. It just wasn't over the top enough to be more than good.\
Sound was fine, I enjoyed all the music and the sound quality in both sub and dub was fine so 7 here as well.\
Story: I gave this a 5.The plot in itself is fine and interesting but the way they go about it after the first 20 episodes or\
          \
        so lacks the intensity and chemistry for obvious reasons once you get to that point.\
Characters: This is one of my biggest issues with this series and there will be slight spoilers in here so I will try and not use names but still get the point across. The main antagonist for the series for the majority of the series that will have you hooked and on the edge of your seat was the highlight outside of the protagonist. The way it was written and the character himself was almost to good and could have caused the series to end in a different manor but with  his replacement after the first bit the show takes a sharp nose dive into the dumpster. The replacement is a poor wanna be of first bit who has no real chemistry built or even attempting to be built. He is literally an emotionless clone. Most of the other characters serve their purpose well enough I guess some of it is rather boring and generic and the replacement of the starting Antagonist really halted all momentum for this series and caused negative marks among a bit portion of the fan base. I know for me and almost every person I have spoken to about this series really ended for them after the first antagonist was no longer part of the show even though we watched/read the rest.\

    Undoubtedly one of the most famous and iconic anime of all time. Death Note is an anime that really forces you to question your own morality and views of the two main characters Light and L, who represent two opposite sides of the moral spectrum. Light believes that the ends of creating a perfect world justify the means of slaughtering potentially millions of evildoers among the human race, while L believes that the means are so sickeningly nihilistic that there cannot possibly be any good to come of this ideal. While of course this is slightly too black and white to hold true realistic worth\
          \
        in today's world, I wholeheartedly praise any form of art that makes the audience think and react to it.\
The intelligence of this anime is unrivalled, the way it can hold and preserve tension for so long is a testament to the well-thought out plot. If you truly suspend your disbelief then you will be immersed in one of the most engrossing, suspenseful cat and mouse games an entertainment medium can offer. Honestly,  I class this anime as a psychological horror due to the sheer sickening, vile content that its plot holds. Light himself finds himself bored in an unstimulating, stagnant world where weakness is preyed upon by the malicious and when he first receives his Note he wants to rectify this. However, he soon evolves from a valiant, idealistic young man to a narcissistic, paranoid being with an undeniably disturbing god-complex. It's this stomach-churningly realistic portrayal of Light's evolution as the unrivalled power of the Death Note rots away his conscience.\
 L however is much more likable in the eyes of the audience and his intelligent, quirky yet wholesomely loveable nature helps break up and place emphasis upon the moments of suspense, which, with the incredible soundtrack never fails to send chills down my spine, with the red/blue God and Satan imagery, as well as the incredibly powerful washing-of-feet scene in Episode 25 (no doubt a reference to Jesus and Judas). Ryuk is a character who is as equally unsettling as Light because it is only his boredom and his complete disregard for the human race is the whole reason why the story was made which really resonates with my fear that the human race really is completely insignificant. Ryuk knows that no matter what Light does, it will all end with Ryuk writing his name in the notebook and killing him, his maniacal giggles of excitement and interest whenever Light or L makes their next move is really quite unsettling as he only views this as a mere form of entertainment and he is the perfect blend between the world of the Shinigami and our world, of fantasy and reality. Misa has also garnered a lot of criticism for her sheer annoying personality. In reality however, Misa is the most tragic character as she represents the blindness that love and lust can give, she is weak and vulnerable and Light takes full advantage of her, defiling Rem's dignity as a Shinigami in doing so. \
Of course there are weaker points in the anime as this is not perfect by any means. I find it incredibly hard to believe that in the time jump we have in the 3rd arc that 5 years on, Light has still not gained the control of the world that he should have with the power he wields (I personally think this would've made a better arc) and that early on, some of L's deductions are honestly just bizarre (EG determining that Kira was a student) however I believe that criticism of Near and Mello is not justified. It is a testament to L and Watari's genius and that no matter what happens there will always be someone there to bring those who are evil to justice. \
I honestly believe that the originality of the storyline, the intrigue of the characters, the thought and reaction-provoking themes and dilemmas and the sheer sickening entertainment that you can get from this anime immortalises it as one of the best anime of all and a timeless classic. If you haven't watched it already, I insist that you do so.\

    This was quite a unique anime. The first I've seen that has and actually keeps a very dark theme throughout the whole story. I won't go into very much detail here but overall, Death Note was a cinematic page turner. I really enjoyed the multitudes of cliffhangers and plot twists which kept me interested and always on the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone and everyone who has not seen Death Note. Although this was an amazing anime, I would have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the anticlimactic ending. Quite a bitter way to end off\
          \
        such an amazing series really... But this should not dissuade you from trying out Death Note; and again, it was overall an amazing anime which is sure to impress 11/10 who watch it. \

    *MINOR SPOILERS*\
This anime is the epitome of perfect, and honestly i think i could say this is one of, if not, the best anime i've ever seen. It's perfectly portrayed and everything, and everyone, has a story....\
Starting with the story, it's actually quite simple. A mysterious notebook falls on the grounds of a high school, and Light Yagami happens to pick it up, later to find out of it's power and what it's capable of. Light quickly tries to follow his own plans, different from anyone else who has used it before. After some time he get's noticed world-wide and even gathers some followers, and\
          \
        also some enemies. One of these enemies is L, who is probably my favorite character in the series. We see Light & L both fighting each other, trying to see what Light, or L, will try to pull on each other next. Much more later, the story thickens and many things good, and evil start to happen. More could be said, but i'll leave that for you to see. Overall the story is just amazing, it gets your heart pumping in many scenes of stress, trying to figure out who Light will kill next...Very intense.\
As the art style isn't my type, i can see it fitting perfectly with this series. It has a very dark atmosphere and mood overall, and i think for the year it was made, it's pretty perfect.\
I watched the english dub, per usual, and the voice acting for this specific anime was perfect. Although, the OP wasn't too good the first time around, but the second OP seemed to fit better. Sound is great.\
The characters is what makes this anime so perfect. You have Light, a smart highschooler who quickly becomes a Senior Investigator, and then you have L, the worlds best Investigator, as well as his successors, Near & Mellow, two more investigators in the series. You also have Misa Amane, who isn't the smartest girl in the series, and many, many more people who contributed to this amazing series. Let me start with L, who shows an extreme intelligence, and also has a really strange posture when sitting. Then Light, L's \"Rival\", if you will, who fights with L for a good time, both of them figuring out ways to \"outdo\" each other. But like i said, all the characters leave a very good feel to the end of this anime, and are very memorable.\
Overall enjoyment is just brilliant, i loved the outcome of this anime, and i will most likely watch this series again, and again to see what i may have missed. This is a DEFINITE MUST WATCH. Nothing more to say, as i don't want to spoil much.\

    Though it may seem I'm rating this show a little too high, I really, REALLY, enjoyed this anime.\
It was one of my first animes to watch and I was surprised.\
This show had raised my standards for other animes and made me think every other anime was just as good or better. (Which now as I get more involved in shows I know better...)\
The characters were all unique and interesting, the story was fantastic and the creators really knew how to pull at your emotions.\
And yes, an important character dies in about the middle of this show and people will say it goes down from there,\
          \
        but I completely disagree.\
Though this beautifully-written character dies (not saying whom) the story is still exciting as ever. A different feeling after this character passes, but still very enjoyable.\
Not only does this give viewers a look into what could happen if a Death Note were released, it shows what both sides would do.  It shows  the measures policemen might go to and the viewpoint of a psychopathic criminal.\

YOU WILL NEVER GET SLEEP.\

    Death Note one of the most popular (It's the #1) anime series of all time. However it's not your typical Shounen series, because, of Course it is Seinen.\
Story:-\
Death Note has one of the greatest stories I have seen. The sudden twists and turns, everything is almost unexpected, makes the anime watchable episode after episode through the weeks. [Spoiler] However I didn't really like the way it ended. That's why I stopped at 8 in score.\
Characters:-\
Characters are almost perfect. Great back stories, uniqueness of the each character, attitudes and everything are well worked out. However some actions of 'L' , 'Misa' and 'Mello' do annoy me\
          \
        for no reason. Cut those out, the characters are perfect.\
Art:-\
The art work is fine, and really matches the settings with that mix of still images, pencil-shadings,etc. But it did not impressed me (probably because I watch a lot of ufotable's work) but it also didn't affect the overall enjoyment.\
Sounds:-\
I'm not a expert in this part. The heavy-metal OP's are awesome ,though.\
Enjoyment:-\
I was really enjoying it in the first arc, but in the second arc it let me down. Though third and fourth pick it up again. I like it but I didn't love it.\

    Although i can't Rank every single thing with a 10/10 i'll feel like it is my obligation to give a 10/10 in the Overall , i will explain why. Ok so , Death Note is one of those animes you quickly fall in love with without even expecting , at first as you read the sypnosis you might think that the anime itself is pretty boring as it has no action , like \" ok there's a guy that kills with his note book , boringgg \" but you could not be more wrong if you think that way.  Death Note is a really\
          \
        different anime , it's action won't be based on physical fighting but as a mental and emotional one. The most brilliant thing about this anime is the way it exposes how a genious mind could turn dangerous with such powerfull tool , as you progress through the anime you will have doubts about the psycopath changes about the main character but you still won't hate him , you will mostly love him for the way he gets rid of problems you first think impossible to get rid of . Death Note will also surprise you as the Death Note itself has a lot of rules to be explored and the same goes about the relation between the death note's keeper and it's shinigami , Death Note is one of those animes that will surprise you when you least expect it. The anime will be perfect until one point near the end , truth is that one of the most important characters gets a closure too soon and the anime provides a few other characters to exchange him without much of sucess ( in my opinion ). The ending should either make u happy or sad , i have no idea about it but you will enjoy to watch the main character's manipulation over others and even through himself to change future events.\

    Death Note is a must watch for anyone wanting to watch an anime. Its popularity speaks for itself. I liked Light Yagami more than most and he is one of my favorite characters. Unfortunately, the anime is not entirely perfect and gave a very letdown ending. But still, I would recommend that you watch it till the end, at least for Light Yagami. He is not the smartest guy on the planet, but he sure gave quite the fight.\
The anime, which consists of 2 arcs, has the first arc executed perfectly. The first arc of the story, which ends in episode 25, is written beautifully\
          \
        and is something pretty to behold.  Truth be told, if the anime ended with the first arc, I would have had no qualms rating it a perfect 10. However, the second arc is the one arc that feels uncomfortably far from perfect. It was inevitable though, the anime was directly adapted from the manga. However, the second arc feels as if it was written in a hurry, in order to just finish up loose ends.  I could not reconcile with the fact that this was a part of Death Note.\
When I watched the first arc, the whole setting was perfect. We find Light Yagami, a student, who chances upon the eponymous Death Note, which has the power to kill anyone whose name is written on it. From then on, the story focuses on Light Yagami's intelligent skills, which he uses in order to play a cat and mouse game with the police. The story also becomes enjoyable at times, and has a good character development going for it. The whole game becomes a war and then it becomes a matter of time before evolving into a Mexican standoff.\
However, in the second arc, we are faced with an inferior opponent to Light Yagami and it only gets even worse from here. Especially when the said opponent carries nothing original and takes the aid of a criminal and a chance of luck. To put matters into perspective, the opponent of Light in the first arc was someone who needed to earn the trust of the police in order to catch Light in the act and his words were not taken seriously most of the time. But the opponent of the second arc was someone who gets believed by the police the minute he appears and seems to have a Mary Sue thing going for him. \
And the ending, oh dear lord, the ending. It was something I could not believe happened and felt like a cop out. I would have been happier if the ending went in the intended manner, but they just had to go and do it. Not to mention the numerous inconsistencies in the ending episode  itself.\
However, I was at least grateful that even though the second arc was all but butchered at that point, they tried their best to preserve Light Yagami's character. I said tried because, the rest was nonsensical. \
The story overall is Great and  deserves a 9. The reason is though I said the first arc was perfect and got  a 10, the second arc could easily go for a 7. That's why the total story goes for a 9.\
The art is not remarkable, but not unremarkable either and hence it gets a 7.\
The soundtrack of the entire series is awesome and  totally worth it. It gets a 9.\
Character: 8, because of the second arc.\
It was quite enjoyable though. Even in the second arc, it was still enjoyable and that is the only thing that stops me from regarding the second arc as canon.\
Overall the series gets an 8, because even though the entire anime is a definite worth to watch, it did not live up to the mark at the end. So, that's why it gets an 8. If it were me, I would recommend that you watch only until episode 25, because everything after that is definitely going to lower your perception of the anime.\
\
And, just to be sure, I am not penalizing the anime for the bad story. That was the manga's fault. The reason I penalized it was because they did not do something better, which they easily could have.\

    Death Note is a rather enjoyable show, but the second arc wasn't as good. The ending was also rather lack-luster. \
The characters were good, and I though I disliked Light Yagami as a person, his character was incredible. The one character I couldn't stand was Soichiro Yagami. I just disliked him. I also disliked Near and Misa.\
The animation and sound were good, but the sound is not my style. The openings were fairly good.  On the sub vs dub argument, I say dub, it is incredibly casted. Misa gets annoying in the dub though. \
The story was interesting, and quite good. That is, until\

    This is a great \"starter\" anime. Trying to get your best friend, SO, or whatever into anime? This is usually a no-brainer go to. It's got good characters and good development, all at a nice pace. I've watched the series from start to end probably 4 or 5 times. You get attached to both sides of the story, good and bad - and may even have your own interpretation of which side is which! A great thinking show. About halfway through the show, you can see it start to get a bit rushed though. When one side has blatant \"guesses\" turn out to be entirely\
          \
        accurate, it just feels like plothole after plot hole (albeit minor) to get the show over with. This makes me despise when that turning point happens, but it is what it is. Still a great anime to watch! \

    Well, hello, the first anime I ever watched. \
Listen, I'll be honest... I wasn't expecting much from an anime that is as hyped up and mainstream as Death Note. But you know what?\
It was freakin' awesome. Okay, it wasn't perfect. I had an issue getting through the rest of the anime once that one thing happened that changed everything... you know what I'm talking about. \
But for the most part, it was very intriguing, very dark, and very well done. Which is right up my alley. \

    I love this show! I`ve rewatched a total of 4 times already. I honestly wish for like an OVA of some sort to squash all the theories of what happened to Yagami Light and other lingering questions. \
To me there was no need for character development because everyone was perfect as they were. I loved the plot twists and cunningness of Yagami Light and Ryuk`s unbiased nature towards every character. I don`t have much to say but to go watch this classic ASAP and also the drawing/graphic of the first few episodes isn`t that good but I promise it gets better.\

Death Note is definitely one of the best anime I have watched. I’ve always wondered why this anime is on the very top list of popularity.  It has a unique story. All characters are very well written; each of them are compelling which can make significant impact to the story and plot. The pacing is superb, every episode is intriguing as it makes you want to watch the next episode to find out what happens next. The dark themed art and music fits this anime perfectly giving viewers a pleasurable experience from start to finish. This anime is a must watch; it has\
          \
        all the suspense, mystery, thrills which will definitely affect your psychological state of mind. I recommend it to everyone who is reading this. \
Art: 10/10\
This anime made good use of low key lighting which made specific scenes much more intense. \
Sound: 10/10\
OP and ED were good. All Voice Actors played their part to perfection, specially Yagami Light's character when he does that evil smirk and laugh.\
Character: 10/10\
Each character in this anime gave the story much more plot and depth. No character is cliche or empty, as each of them has their own identity and can stand on their own, pushing Yagami Light to his limits to overcome those who stand in his way.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Very entertaining and enjoyable from start to finish leaving viewers satisfied after finishing the series.",

    What would you do if you had the power to kill anyone by just writing their name in a little book? Light Yagami is an extremely intelligent high school student who discovers a \"death note\" dropped by a bored shinigami named Ryuk. Light then uses this death note to murder criminals and people he believes are tearing this world down. These actions do not go unnoticed. A very talented detective named L, who's intelligence is only equalled by Light's, noticed these deaths and quickly deduces that it is Light who is committing these murders. The series follows Light using this death note to shape the\
          \
        world in his eyes and L foiling his plans at every turn. The mind games the two play on each other are incredibly entertaining and proves to be one of the best rivalries I've seen in an anime series. Two of the smartest people in Japan clash throughout the series, trying to outsmart the other, Light covering up everything he's doing and L uncovering it all. The series is very exhilarating and it is incredibly entertaining to watch. Light and L are shown to be working toward the same goal, both believing they represent justice in the world, with Light using murder as his tactic and L using the law. They are two of the best characters seen in anime and the hardest thing about this series for me was deciding who to root for. Light is so clever and so likable that I wanted him to get away with it but at the same time I wanted L to finally expose Light for the murderer he is. The art is fantastic, the music and voice acting is some of the best, and the story is very storied and so suspenseful. Aside from Light and L, there wasn't anything special about the other characters, To me it was all about Light and L. I enjoyed the series so much up until about episode 25 or 26 (I can't remember) because that to me is when the series started to go down a bit. I still enjoyed the hell out of it and still is one the most enjoyable anime series that I've seen. If you haven't seen this series yet, please watch it, it's one of the most popular anime series for a reason.\

         I'll just start off by saying that Death Note is one of my favorite TV series of all time.  I can see how it would not be for everybody, though.  It's relatively low on action, and instead focuses on brains over brawn.  You can describe it as cat-and-mouse, chess without rules, or my personal favorite, a giant game of he knows that I know that he knows that I know that he knows that I know... BUT... does he know this?\
Story: 10\
     I won't explain what Death Note is about, because that's what\
          \
        the synopsis is for.  I thought the plot was handled very well.  When you look deeper into it, it kind of gets more and more depressing actually.  A young genius with an extremely bright future gains a supernatural power, but it doesn't come without sacrifices.  The story really kind of lets you choose who is right and who is wrong, which is really neat and definitely a plus for a psychological anime.  No matter who you are rooting for though, they will both outsmart and be outsmarted many times.  Both sides are balanced very well with their own strengths and weaknesses.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that I like it more than most people.  There's really only one aspect of it that I would change, but it is a fairly big one.\
Art/Animation: 10\
     There aren't really any epic battles or anything of the sort in Death Note, so there really isn't any room for jaw-dropping animation.  The art itself though, is really good.  It's usually pretty dark and gritty rather than bright and colorful, which fits the mood of the series very well.  I feel like the character designs were a bit more realistic and most anime out there.  Whenever characters start thinking really hard, the background goes black, and their hair changes to their corresponding color, which I felt really amplified the situation.  You also won't see much more symbolism in any other anime ever, if you like that sort of thing.\
Sound: 9\
     It kind of goes without saying that the original Japanese voice actors did their job very well, but Death Note is one of the three anime where I think the dub might have actually been even better, at least most of the time.  The voices themselves fit their characters, and the lines are spoken with the right amount of emotion for each character.  By this I mean that some characters speak with lots of emotion and some speak with very little, but that's how it is supposed to be.\
The background music is some of the best I've ever heard.  Each character's themes definitely represent them very well.  We get a good mix of orchestrated pieces, and more modern sounding pieces.  There's not much else I can say because of how subjective music is, so I'll just let you listen and decide for yourself.  However, I personally loved the first opening and ending songs, and hated the second ones.  I'm just not a fan of heavy metal screaming at the top of your lungs.  That's why I dropped one point.\
Character: 9\
     There aren't a ton of major characters in Death Note, but the few that there are were phenomenal.  Regardless of which main character you root for, you'll probably like them both.  One of the main characters seems to slowly lose his rationality throughout the series, and the other one is just so mysterious for the first few episodes that when you finally get to meet him... well, let's just say you'll be pretty surprised.  For the most part, the shinigami provided comic relief and new elements to the plot, such as more rules to the Death Note, but when they got serious, it was pretty freaky.  Later on in the series, a couple of new major characters are introduced, and while they probably aren't super great by themselves, the way they compliment each other is awesome.  I will still say they could have been elaborated on a bit more.  Since they are so important to the series, this alone is what dropped one point of my character rating.  I can't say much more without spoiling the series.\
Enjoyment:  10\
     Again, Death Note is my favorite TV series of all time.  The mind games and intense brain battles are very intriguing, and when there is action, it really gets you excited because of how rare it is.  That's when you know stuff is getting real.  Will someone be exposed?  Will someone mess up amidst the chaos?  I enjoyed how the series was able to feel dark and mature without being over-the-top gory, having a crazy amount of bad language, or throwing fan service around where it wasn't needed.\
Overall:  10\
     I highly recommend this anime to everyone.  I think even non-anime fans might enjoy it, because it doesn't fall under either of the two anime stereotypes; crazy action or mushy drama.  Just make sure to avoid searching Google or YouTube for anything related to Death Note before your done.  Spoilers are many.  I have seen them.\

    I'm writing this in 2017. Death Note is Tumblr's #18 Anime/Manga. This series aired in 2006 and 2007, so it's ten years old and still popular. Its timelessness is again proven by its spot as MAL's #1 anime series.\
I'm on the side of many others -- for me, the first third of the series is what shone. L and Light's cat-and-mouse battle was interesting, but when Light starts working with the team, it gets a bit monotonous. When Near comes into the picture, it's over for me. I understood things until we got to specific rules and aspects like transferring ownership of the Death Note.\
          \
        Nonetheless, this anime is great and I definitely recommend it, especially to people who want to get into the medium.\
Story: 7 for Good\
The concept of the Death Note is creative. Light's handling of it really makes you think, and it's even the subject of debate for some. This anime isn't merely something you watch, despite how consuming it is. It's something that you think about, peruse over.\
All areas of the story were covered: Kira, the team to defeat it, the team to defeat that team. Police and Kira's worshipers and Kira's opponents. Questions are answered and stakes are constantly raised in the interest of keeping the audience attentive.\
When Near and his taskforce enters the picture, I definitely lose it. There are things I don't understand and questions that I continue to have even after finishing the series. Again, Light and L's battle of wits was what drew me in. But that doesn't meant that there isn't merit in finishing the series. There were still moments that shocked me, scarred me, and kept me on the edge of my seat. \
Art: 7 for Good\
This isn't necessarily the prettiest anime to watch. Nothing about the art was spectacular to me, but considering that it was created ten years ago, there's some leeway in that respect. All this, however, matters little when considering Death Note's content. The color palette is dark and muddled, which makes perfect sense considering the tone of the series. Some images appear scattered and hazy, which is also understandable.\
There are two artistic details I remember: light changing (no pun intended) when Light and L pass under trees, and clouds of breath streaming from the mouths of a crowd. These are small but were well done and are just examples of how these details helped depict the setting.\
Sound: 7 for Good\
There isn't much to say here; I don't know much about sound. I will say that I appreciated the opera-ish themes for the characters. But the more that certain compositions played, the less they retained any effect. I did not like the opening and closing themes of the later episodes, but that's more subjective than objective.\
Character: 8 for Very Good\
Light and L were my favorite characters in the series. Misa simply loves Kira/Light. The taskforces are in pursuit of justice. Mello is in pursuit of victory.\
Personally, I believe that Near is a pale imitation of L (no pun intended.) Even though he accomplished \"more,\" he would not have been able to achieve this without the work of L, who knew Light was Kira and made obvious to all. \
What I liked about Light and L was that they were full-force into their characters. Nothing about them trickled into any other personality. Until Light's last episode, Light believes that Kira is the way of justice. That Kira is necessary for the progression of a new, better society. A new world. Until L's last episode, he believes that justice will prevail, that Light is Kira, and he continues to ensure that Kira is caught. \
But these characters are not the epitome of good and evil, even though Mikami (I had to look up his name) says those are the only two forces in the world. L is willing to sacrifice human lives for others. Light kills criminals, but innocent people die as well. They are not virtuous; they are flawed. Yet they are unapologetically themselves.\
Their battle is enthralling. They are geniuses and it shows, and they will be ten steps ahead of you, and they will think that they are ten steps ahead of each other, even if they are not. It makes for some good viewing, it makes for some cringing, it even makes for some laughs.\
Enjoyment and Overall: 8 for Very Good\
For the most part, I enjoyed this series. It excels in terms of plot, characterization, and even humour. I understand why Death Note is loved and why it continues to be revered as a masterpiece of suspense, even ten years after its initial airing.\

    Death Note really is great and such an interesting story, BUT...\
1) it's really sexist. I noticed how only the male characters are awesome (like Light and L) and all the female characters are either there just because (like Light's mom and sister) or are there just to be submissive over men (like Misa and Takada).\
Not only that, but countless characters say sexist shit as well: the detective on early episodes saying that once his fiancé has kids she won't have to work anymore, some rapist guys saying that because a woman was wearing a skirt she was \"asking for it\", Light's dad saying that HE\
          \
        WON'T LET his daughter marry a policeman and that she HAS TO marry someone else, etc etc.\
No, but really: Misa's entire character only exists just so she can be \"\"\"\"\"useful\"\"\"\" to Light. Enough said.\
2) The second arc of the anime is HOOORRRIIIBBLLLEEE. When a certain event happens to a certain character, it all just goes downhill.\
We're introduced to Near and Mello, which are the poor man's version of L, and they just... they're not L. Near is the one that comes closest to what L is, but Mello????? WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE???? WHY DID HE EVEN EXIST???? HELL IF I KNOW\
I hated these characters, I hated that the anime couldn't keep up being as cool as it used to be, I hated the plot, I hated how it only got more sexist as the episodes gone by, I *HATED* IT.\
The last 3 episodes are good, but by the time I finished watching it, I was just glad it was over. I think that if they hadn't [spoiler about that character], things would've ended better. Or if the story had ended when that spoiler happened.\
But OVERALL, if you get past these 2 points that I made, it's a good anime. I just personally don't think it's the \"best\" anime ever.\

    Everything that i'm goint to write may be (it certainly is) subject to personal opinion and bias.\
To me the show felt lackluster as a whole, be it because of the linear nature of the characters or the unexciting art style.\
 The premise of the whole story is an interesting one and it's exploited in a smart way ( the never ending back and forth between light and whoever it's trying to catch him is developed in a charmingly convoluted way), but the watcher never feels threatened by the possible outcome of it since there's not much room to get attached to any character: they are\
          \
        very dull and feel like one trick ponies, not even mentioning how superficial their analysis is compared to the development of the plot.\
The art direction definitely isn't enlightened either since, except for a pair of original moments (chips), nothing truly leaves astonished or utterly speechless. As the plot unravels this becomes a bigger and bigger problem because of how quickly the watcher gets accustomed to the initially interesting scenes in which names are written down on the note. 1st Op, ost and sound design are pretty cool though.\
Overall, definitely not a masterpiece and hyped to the point of setting the watcher's bar higher than the show can reach.\

    Death Note is a true master piece of an anime. It is rare that a medium, other than a documentary, can make you feel so smart. Death Note's constant twists that always keep you on your toes and masterful use of storytelling does this perfectly, as you begin to predict which move L or Kira would make next.  \
I actually came into Death Note expecting to be disappointed an uninterested, as it was the first anime I had watched and I absolutely hated the medium at that point (don't worry, I'm a total convert now ;) ). However from the moment I loaded up\
          \
        the first episode I was absolutely hooked. The actual concept is a very interesting idea within itself; a philosophical question asking what you would do if you had a book where you could anonymously kill people, and is it okay to kill criminals who have wronged others? The story also puts you in a unique position, I think, because you are rooting for neither Light nor L: both have good qualities and bad qualities, and neither is a clear 'bad guy'. The two also happen to be super geniuses, which leads to the best part of this anime: the conflict between L and Light (and later Near, to a lesser extent). It is a conflict that always keeps you on your toes, never knowing how one would best the other. Through every episode, I never felt like anything put into the anime was just filler. The art is suitably dark and gloomy and suits the mood of the story quite well, and I have no complaints. As for sound: I watched Death Note in English and I absolutely do not regret it. The voice acting was extremely well done, with each character having a distinct pattern of speech that reflected their character's personalities perfectly. It was filled with emotion and never drew me out of the experience because of something falling flat, like I have seen in other anime.  However, the music was unremarkable. That's not to say it was bad, but it did not include anything I could hum months later, or remember affectionately, such as Attack on TItan's catchy theme. The characters are fully flushed out, and are all put through an immense amount of psychological introspection that explores what their moral code truly is a where it lies. The only complaint I would have about the characters in this show is that (***SPOILERS AHEAD***) L's successor, Near, does not live up to his mentor in terms of uniqueness and originality, and just feels like a bit of an afterthought. (SPOILER OVER). \
Overall, Death Note is my absolute favourite anime. Need I say more? If you like a smart, engaging anime that always keeps you guessing, you will find nothing better than Death Note.\

    Having finished watching it - I have to admit that this was completely amazing. Just a couple things to complain about (I mean, there's gotta be something right..?)\
*SPOILERS AHEAD*\
1) Misa-Misa: Just the way she pines after Light really pisses me off and how naive and stupid she can really be. ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE BECAME THE SECOND KIRA - THE WAY SHE HANDLED IT WAS SO RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE.\
2) Mello and Near: These characters honestly were nothing compared to L. They felt like amateurs at best, especially since Light was getting more or less reckless about his actions, they probably should have been able to catch him\
          \
        earlier.\
3) Light's reckless actions: Honestly it wasn't necessary to kill L's imposter on TV (though I guess it was needed to move the story along). Also, he shouldn't have killed Raye Penber because Raye didn't even suspect him and doing so just caused more unnecessary killings such as Raye's wife. Light wouldn't have had to kill her if he hadn't killed Raye in the first place. Another thing was underestimating Near and saying that he had won before he had ACTUALLY won which gave him away completely.\
4) The theme song for the second half of the anime - I honestly preferred the first one better but I guess it's just up to personal opinion.\
Now that that's over, here's the good things about the anime:\
1) The main characters (Light and L): The complexity of these characters was honestly brilliant. I enjoyed Light's development as a character(except in the second half when he became extremely reckless and psycho at times). L was a welcome part of the story for me, his genius was incredibly dazzling and after every action that Light did, I would wonder whether L would get a clue from it. I also loved that posture L adopted when he sat in a chair and the way he held phones, etc.\
2) Ryuk: Ryuk was undoubtedly the best Shinigami in Death Note, the others were bland and boring compared to him. I loved the parts especially when Ryuk experienced withdrawal symptoms after not eating an apple for a long time. In fact, Ryuk's personality was such a refresher from Light and L's neverending fight. One of my favourite parts was when Light manipulated Ryuk to do things for him in exchange for an apple. Some of the best things about Ryuk were his side comments and his laugh.\
3) The art: The art was completely amazing throughout the series and quite brilliant at times. I especially loved it when they displayed Light and L in red and blue because it really reflected their personalities. \
4) Sound: The soundtrack during the anime really complimented the events that were happening during that time. The sound was pretty much amazing except for the second theme song (in my opinion).\
Definitely recommend this anime - was wonderful to watch.\
Final thing:\
Light is such a f*ckboi xD\

I love how the story progresses throughout the show, from Light finding the Death Note to him becoming a maniac later in the show. He uses the notebook to 'create' a 'new world' in which he will be the god of, in which only criminals will be punished.\
Sound - 9.5/10\
Death Note is one of the anime with one of the best soundtracks in the industry. The soundtrack on Death Note plays a huge part in the Anime. The 'opera-like' music shows Lights God-like aspects. The second OP though, is a downgrade from the first one.\
Art - 10/10\
Yet another amazing aspect of Death\
          \
        Note, from the Opening, to the Anime. The animation is truly amazing. The Animation on the first Opening syncs perfectly with the song. It has heavy Christian Symbolism which shows Light's desire to become the 'god' of the 'new world'. A lot of scenes are perfectly animated as well. (the potato chip scene)\
Characters - With the story firstly mainly focusing on Light who is shown to be a genius high school boy, but when he proceeds to find the Death Note his character changes. Light becomes a maniac, obsessed with killing criminals and creating this 'New World' of his. L, L was the opposite of Light, he was an anti-social genius. He tried to catch Kira risking his own life which lead up to his death. Misa, Misa was my least favorite character, she is shown to be obsessed with Light because he punished her parents killers, so if Light gives her any order she immediately does what he says. She is shown to not be very smart risking it all at some points in the series.\

    I know this is a late review but at least hear me what I think about the anime. First off, I would like to thank everyone who made this anime and it instantly became a worldwide phenomenon until today. It is really a great story for everyone.\
Here's my review:\
The first half of the anime is so memorable even I watched it almost 4 years ago. One of the best rivals in anime I have ever seen. The mind games are intense and enjoyable to watch.  The second half was meh for me. It was crash and burn for me but still it was good.\

    The evils in this world are inescapable.  No matter where you look, no matter where you go, there are people out there who seem to do nothing but hurt others.  They take advantage of them, preying on anyone they can get even the smallest leverage over, letting their own ingenuity do the rest.  Rapists, murderers, thieves, all of them are nothing but soulless vampires hurting the people around them with no thoughts towards anyone’s feelings but their own.  There’s no escaping it.  God made a mistake when he granted man free will.  This world...  It’s rotting.  These\
          \
        are the thoughts plaguing a brilliant young Japanese man named Light Yagami, a bored genius with a chip on his shoulder the size of the entire world’s criminal population.  We’ve all wondered what we’d do if we could kill whoever we want with little more than a thought...  We could take care of that bully who’s been harassing us, that singer we can’t stand, or that politician who doesn’t agree with us...  But one day, as Light is moving between classes, he actually gets the opportunity to do just that.  \
Out in the courtyard, he finds a Death Note, a notebook that was dropped into the human world by a Shinigami, or God of Death, who’s just as bored as he is.  It doesn’t take long for the industrious millennial to realize the kind of power he’s been given, and he very quickly decides to create a new world free of crime and evil, with himself lording over it as the new God.  His ruthless genocide on the wicked doesn’t go unnoticed, as he attracts the attention of copycats, worshipers, and a mysterious detective named L who wants nothing more than to end his reign of justice.  They say that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but as the body count racks up, and the deadly game of cat and mouse between Light and his nemesis L wages on, with Light’s true intentions becoming more and more questionable with every single twist and turn of the plot, it’s worth asking:  What is true justice?  Where is the line between good and evil, and at what point does a vengeful God cross it?  If power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then then the lines may not be as clear as Light, or anyone else, realizes.\
I’ve always been annoyed by people who state that there’s an ‘anime style,’ because when you actually back up and take a look at the medium as a whole, there just might be more individual art and animation styles in the anime medium than there even is in America.  It’s easy to say that all of the Hannah Barbara cartoons of the seventies were designed to look like Scooby Doo, or that there are too many modern cartoons that look like Adventure time, or that CG Disney ladies just look like identical dolls with different hair and faces added on, but you can’t really say the same for the anime medium.  Even anime released by the same studio around the same time will rarely ever look that close to each other, aside from a few recognizable studio quirks.  I’ll admit that Studio Madhouse has released a handful of titles that look like Death note, but with Death Parade allegedly taking place in the same universe, it’s a smaller number than you’d think.  Other titles like Monster, Black Lagoon and the Marvel Anime come close, but ultimately stray in one form or another.\
But Death Note is one of the Studio Madhouse anime that lean more towards actual human realism rather than the big-eye, small nose giant head designs that people often attribute the anime \"style\" too.  Characters are designed to be almost lifelike, with everyone sporting appropriately sized eyes, save for a few token weirdos who’s eyes are slightly larger than they should be, like Misa and Near.  There’s really nothing about their anatomy that’s exaggerated, and none of them are drawn to be inhumanly attractive like bishounen or moe girls would be, everyone just looks human, which not only sets the tone of the series, but it also provides the perfect opportunity for Shinigami, the other-worldly observers who started this whole mess, to stand out as the grotesque humanoid monsters they should be.  The level of imagination that went into them is astounding, as even the ones who only show up in one or two scenes look like nothing you’ve seen before.  The human characters are also designed in such a way to inform their personalities in some clever ways.\
As for the animation, this is a dialogue heavy show, so there really isn’t much to speak of.  A lot of the series is just talking heads, but they took just enough of a cue from Akiyuki Shinbou to use interesting framing and shading to keep things visually interesting without ever going overboard and looking pretentious.  They save their money for big movements, and I don’t just mean action scenes like fights and chases, although those do exist, and they look gorgeous.  This is an extremely over-the-top show, to the point that even the act of eating a potato chip can be made to look every bit as epic as Moses parting the red sea.  They go the cheaper route when events like these aren’t happening, and while I wish to say they managed their budget well, I can’t.  This show isn’t just a dramatic rollercoaster, oh no, the animation is just as inconsistent, because for every breathtaking high, there’s an egregiously painful low when they try to portray fluid movement on a low budget, and it looks embarrassingly bad, and it’s just as noticeable as the good stuff, if not moreso.\
The animation is a mixed bag, but in terms of the music, Death Note might just have one of the best soundtracks in anime history.  The first thing you probably think of in terms of Death Note’s ost is the loud, epic greek choir that fires up for all of the show’s biggest moments, Low of Solipsism, the most memorable song in the series and easily one of the most iconic themes of all time.  It’s right up there with the Azumanga Daioh eyecatch music, being instantly recognizable, maybe even to people who haven’t even seen the series.  As much as I’d like to praise it for it’s overall use throughout the series, it’s the individual character themes that really take the cake here.  Light and L are generally represented by the guitar and the piano, respectively, with the former representing youthful revolt and(probably unintentionally) deliberate insincerity, with the former representing order and the return to the classic world, IE the one Light’s trying to change.  Appropriately, each theme has the instrument representing the opposing character creeping into it at some point.  \
This is taken even further by a later character named Near having a similar theme to L, albeit with a less conventional instrument for a less conventional detective.  Their themes go a lot deeper than this, with the progression of each track representing the course of the plot, and trust me, every character gets a similarly descriptive theme, but you don’t want to hear about that.  You want to hear about the openings, and how awesome they both are.  They’re both artistic, high energy and visually stunning, and they’re every bit as representative of the plot and characters as the musical themes are.  Musically, the first opening, The World, is a lot more conventional, which by no means is a bad thing.  It’s the catchy hard rock song a show like this should have, with a ton of religious imagery and every major character getting their time in the spotlight.  The second opening, What’s Up People, has become notorious in the medium for being entirely balls-out insane.  Switching from hard rock to Death metal, it symbolizes the chaos of the world and Light at that point in the story.\
The English dub was an Ocean effort, and while they’ve produced some less appealing dubs in the past, this one is surprisingly solid.  There aren’t a lot of Canadian anime dubs out there, so the ones we do see don’t really feature the actors or directors we’ve gotten used to through the American ADR scene, and the different sound plays up how different this entire show is really well.  The only problem you might have with it is the uncanny valley effect of hearing so many past and present My Little Pony actors lending their voices to such a serious show.  The two main actors in particular are outstanding, with Brad Swaile matching every beat of his Japanese counterpart, and Battlestar Galactica veteran Allesandro Juiliani actually surpassing his.  Swaile is able to play every side of Light Yagami, from the good-natured innocent he pretends to be to the heartless killer he hides under the surface, and he even manages to sound just as crazy and psychopathic as Mamoru Miyano, effortlessly passing the bar at every opportunity.  Juiliani went above and beyond with giving nuance to L that frankly wasn’t there in the original sub.\
I don’t know how Brian Drummond was able to do Ryuk’s voice, but I feel like I’d offer him a lozenge if I ever met him in person.  He plays the character like a combination of Wolverine and Harvey Fierstein, which makes sense, as he’s played Wolverine in more than a few adaptations.  He’s had a long and prolific career in both anime and western animation, doing everything from My Little Pony and Bratz to Cardcaptor Sakura and Gundam, but he’ll always be Ryuk to me.  Shannon Chan-Kent hasn’t done as much anime as Drummond, having less than ten credits to her name, but she does her best to keep up with the sheer insanity of her own Japanese counterpart, and while she doesn’t quite match up, the simple truth is that I’ve yet to see anyone match the inflections of Aya Hirano.  If Wendee Lee couldn’t do it, then the singing voice for Pinkie Pie could only be expected to do so much.  She does a fine job, but still kinda misses the mark, taking an annoying character that Aya saved and just playing her as annoying anyway.\
The rest of the cast is also at least fine, with the only other obvious stand-outs being the characters of Mello and Near, whom I can’t really talk about for spoiler reasons.  Kirby Morrow, the original Goku himself, goes absolutely crazy as the justice obsessed character Teru Mikami, and his performance goes about as off the rails as anyone else I’ve mentioned thus far.  I don’t think character actor Chris Britton has done any anime aside from this one, but he plays Light’s father Soichiro as grounded and authoritative, showing the age of the character very clearly through the fatigue of his voice.  Vincent tong,Trevor Duvall, John Murphy and a disappointingly small role by Brian Dobson(But not as disappointing as the screen time that Tabitha St. Germaine got) make up the other officers of the NPA, none of whom battle the main cast for your attention, but all of whom do a solid job in more grounded and realistic parts.  The writing is on point and as accurate as possible, and I honestly recommend watching both versions at least once, as it sounds amazing in both languages.\
Death Note is one of those few anime that really don’t need an introduction.  If you know what anime is, you’ve heard of it.  It’s not quite as recognizable as Dragonball Z or Pokemon, but if those shows are Hulk hogan and the Macho Man, then Death Note is at the very least John Cena...  There’s no guarantee that you’ve heard of it, but it’s still pretty damn likely.  To this day, it’s the most recently released anime to receive an American remake, and I’m not just talking about that Netflix movie that I’ve been putting off watching...  I am thoroughly convinced that Breaking Bad took more than a few notes from it.  Oddly enough, for an anime this popular, the blowback hasn’t been as severe as it has been for a lot of other titles that blew up as big as it did...  Most critics and audiences have at least a generally positive opinion of it, it’s broken a lot of cultural barriers, and it’s even managed to inspire a number of real life murders.  Is it worth all the hype?  Does it really deserve it’s spot in the public consciousness?\
Well, we’ll start with the negatives.  I didn’t really notice it until I was rewatching the series for this review, although it is pretty obvious now that I think of it...  This story was, more likely than not, written as it went along.  It has to have been.  There’s very little material on display that feels like it was planned out in advance, or at least it wasn’t planned very far in advance.  I’ve read comments from the manga’s mysterious author that at least two of the side characters’ deaths were decided spur of the moment, in one case because the character was learning too much too quickly, and the second because he happened to be the most expendable option out of those available at the time.  Now writing a story this way isn’t always a bad thing...  Stephen King is exceptional at it.  The problem is that you have to know how to make it work, and Death Note kind of doesn’t.  Outside of the music and openings, there was NO foreshadowing in this series, which makes a lot of plot twists feel jarringly out of nowhere, but there are much more obvious examples.\
Take, for example, the booby trap Light builds to conceal his death note early on in the series.  Light goes into great detail about how he built a secret compartment to house his notebook, telling us not only how it works, but how it was set up to destroy the book if anyone were to get too close to discovering it.  this is all well and good, but for the amount of screen time it takes up, it never actually comes up in the story again.  It never plays a part in the narrative, except for covering a potential plothole down the line, but that alone isn’t good enough to justify the attention that went into it.  There’s a rule called Chekov’s gun, stating that if something gets mentioned in the story, it has to play a part later in the story.  You don’t mention a gun if nobody’s gonna get shot by it, and you don’t go to extreme lengths to avoid something if that thing’s never going to either happen or almost happen.  We don’t need to know how he hid the notebook, we know he’s smart enough to do it.  We don’t need to know how paranoid and careful he is, the door trick tells us that just fine on it’s own.\
Sure, maybe it was PLANNED to come up again, but I’m pretty sure the only reason they did that was so nobody would question why the people putting up surveillance cameras in his room never found it.  Even for that purpose, simply having him say \"Nobody will ever find it\" would suffice, because we would have taken him at his word.  It’s especially strange because as meticulously as this was described, the author was still perfectly happy with never explaining how Light was able to sneak a tiny television inside of a SEALED bag of chips, which he was somehow able to clearly watch while writing down the names being broadcast on it, all while never actually looking into the bag itself.  Kind of a weird for us to just take on faith when you’re explicitly describing a fail-safe that never actually gets used.  But this is also emblematic of another huge problem that writing like this can cause, and that’s the fact that the author often wound up writing the story into a corner and having to pull out complete bullshit in order to get out of it.\
My friend Karandi over at the 100 word Anime blog pointed out in her review of this series that it relies heavily on coincidence, and yeah, this is a really good point.  Death Note is damn near Shakespearian in the amount of deus ex machina asspulls it uses.  Coincidences aren’t just conveniently used, they’re deeply ingrained in the plot, and I’m not exaggerating that.  This entire situation began on a coincidence, with Light just happening to find the notebook, and it ends on a coincidence, because spoilers.  I know coincidence on it’s own isn’t the end of the world, I mean there are a ton of heroes who constantly have to save people that coincidentally happen to be their loved ones, but the sheer amount of it in Death Note is astounding, and it works really hard against the reputation the show has built for itself around being smart.  On top of that I can’t count the number of times that characters made stupid or ill advised decisions for the sake of the plot, and I’m not just talking about canonically stupid characters like Misa.\
But since Misa’s been brought up, that’s another criticism the series keeps having lodged against it, and it’s pretty damn valid...  Death Note is skin-crawlingly sexist.  With very few exceptions, and I can not stress the word very hard enough, male characters make up the entirety of the police force, politicians, business heads and major players in Light’s death game, with those few exceptions I mentioned either being pawns with limited agency or having extremely limited screen time.  Women are portrayed through their relationships to male characters, playing the roles of mother, sister, grieving lover or obsessed stalker, and the only two exceptions to this that I can think of are Wedy and Halle Lidner, who certainly had agency and lives of their own, but were used far too scarcely to make an impact.  I had high hopes for Naomi Misora, who was really likeable and interesting, even though she was giving up her career to become a housewife and was out to avenge her dead fiancee.  She was a smart and proactive character, which is why it’s profoundly insulting how her sudden brain fart led to her downfall.  Trust me, there’s a good reason she’s one of only two characters to get their own light novel spin-off.\
Misa Amane gets close to top billing, which is progressive by his series’ standards, but it comes with a pretty harsh trade-off...  She is canonically the dumbest character in the show, motivated entirely by infatuation(also canonical), and while she does get a few moments to shine here and there(like her manipulation of one certain business head), her screw-ups and terrible decisions way overpower anything good she brings to the series.  Yeah, she’s devoted to Kira for avenging the death of her parents, but she would die for Light and happily be used by him just because he’s good looking and smart.  I’ve already covered their terrible relationship in my ‘top ten worst romances’ list, so I won’t dwell on her here, but there’s still the matter of Light being a certified chick magnet, with countless female characters getting charmed by him, including a girl who wants to continue their date after watching a man die, and a certain otherwise promising character playing right into his hand despite knowing better from the details of her husband’s death.  The only difference between him and Kirito is that he’s acknowledged as being a dick about it.  The ladies still be cray thirsty, though.\
But even with these issues being very pronounced, my biggest problem with the series is something I don’t think I’ve heard anyone else complain about...  I hated the voice overs.  It was just too much.  I know what you’re saying, that’s just a part of the experience!  It’s how they portray the mind games between the hero and the villain!  Yeah, well, you could say the same thing about Yugioh, and that show gets ruthlessly parodied for it, while Death note somehow gets a pass despite being even worse about it.  I kept waiting for Light to reference the heart of the cards, or something.  It’s true that these sequences could sometimes be useful, like when Light was freaking out about Naomi Misora and his thought process helped to amp up the suspense, but I would honestly say that just over half of it is unnecessary.  I don’t need to hear Light say \"40 seconds...\"  to get that he’s waiting forty seconds, and I don’t need to have every one of his schemes explained to me, before OR after they happen.  This is how stories are written when the writer thinks that you’re too stupid to figure things out for yourself.\
That’s admittedly a lot of negatives, so what’s positive about this show?  how has it survived so prominently in the public consciousness, music and character designs aside?  well, there are two elements that I think give it staying power, and the first is the dynamic between Light and L.  And no, I’m not just talking about the whole ‘genius vs. genius’ appeal, it goes deeper than that.  While they’re polar opposites all the way down to the computers they use, they also share some stark similarities.  They’re both obvious sociopaths, L by accident and Light by design, and they’re both drawn to each other more for the challenge of it than through any sort of moral sincerity.  They both justify their actions through moral superiority and altruism, but at the end of the day, it’s more a matter of ambition...  Light wants to be god, L wants to tackle an unsolvable case.  They both put on acts to inspire people to side with them, albeit with different intents, and they both seem to exhibit fear rather than remorse when they do something wrong...  L for fear of punishment, Light for fear of being caught.  \
I don’t think I have to explain how juicy a premise that is...  Two characters that just happened to land on opposite sides of the law due to their circumstances, both valuing personal success over actual justice, and they’re going at each other’s throats while pretending to be friends.  This interplay alone kind of  makes up for the fact that there are less than five characters in a giant cast that get any development.  Everyone is a player in the game of Light and L, two bored geniuses who will stop at nothing to obliterate each other...  They couldn’t be more similar, but they also couldn’t be more different, and they both have pretty much every anime fan in existence gravitating to one side or another.  Life even kind of imitates art, because while Light was designed to have the social skills to manipulate people in ways that L could never dream of, that also wound up being the majority consensus of the fanhood, who tend to side overwhelmingly with Light, despite the fact that he was explicitly designed to be evil and unsympathetic, but they’re drawn more to the passion of his cause and his slick, slimy charisma than to his actual actions.\
Even when this dynamic disappears thanks to a certain plot twist that happens about two thirds of the way into the story...  A twist that most viewers loathe, but that I personally never minded...  The show is still able to at least be interesting and engaging, and that’s due to it’s other major saving grace;  Death note has an absolutely brilliant sense of pacing.  There is not a second wasted in this series, nor does any part of it ever drag.  Death note does not fuck around.  Every moment of screen time is spent furthering the plot or the story in some way, and the high, energetic tone only ever slows down when it damn well wants to.  It’s all plot, plot, development, spectacle, plot, reveal...  I mean, yeah, there are moments that probably could have been cut without affecting anything, but more often than not, those are the really fun and memorable scenes like the tennis match, and you don’t want to skip scenes as entertaining and full of levity as that.  Even at it’s worst moments, and let’s not kid ourselves, there are some serious qualifiers for that title, Death note is a roller coaster you just can’t bring yourself to get off of.\
Death Note is available from viz Media.  It’s been released in numerous different formats, including individual 4-episode disks and the more recent thinpack bluray release, none of which are that hard to find.  There have been several movies based on it, including two animated films that retell the story through Ryuk’s eyes, three Japanese live action movies(only one of which I’ve seen, and it was barely watchable) and an American movie on Netflix that I’ve been avoiding like the plague.  The original manga is also available stateside from Viz Media, as are both Light novels, which I highly recommend checking out just for the awkward translation issues alone.\
So after all that, is Death note worthy of it’s reputation?  does it deserve to be so popular, and stand the test of time like it has?  I can’t believe I'm saying this, but yes, it absolutely does.  I’m not saying that it’s myriad of problems don’t matter, or that they should be ignored, but the final product is way more entertaining than the sum of it’s parts.  For example, I may have complained about the author just making things up as he went along, and it probably would have been better if he’d had some grand scheme in mind so that he could fill it with depth and meaning, and symbolism that wasn’t just pretentiously chosen for aesthetic purposes, but it wouldn’t be so heart-poundingly unpredictable, so this really is a matter of execution ultimately trumping substance and content.  Death note is a high energy detective thriller that, despite it’s many asspulls, never loses sense of the basic rule of cause and effect, and is able to be as campy and over-the-top as you can imagine while still taking itself completely seriously.  It’s got a lot of problems, sure, but I can’t think of anyone who I wouldn’t recommend it to, and I think everyone should see it at least once.  I give Death note a 7/10.\

    So I know I'm late for typing up a review on Death Note, but I figure it is a anime that will still be attracting new fans for a few more years to come, so I'm here to make this review.\
Death Note... If I were to sum this up with one line... \"I'll take a potato chip... And I'll eat it!\" \
Story: 10\\10\
The story is an incredible tale of two people fighting to the death, not with psyical violance and uneeded Micheal Bay action scenes, but with over the top anime moments and a little bit of intellect as well. Watch as L stumbes his\
          \
        way through a case, relying purely on luck to catch a mass murderer. Meanwhile, watch as Kira, A.K.A, Light, A.K.A, God, puffs his chest out and challanges the luckiest guy in the world to a murder game.\
Art: 6\\10\
The art is an old style, but I think it is safe to say the anime isn't the youngest girl on the block, so the artstyle is passable. Also, it does grow on you, so if you're the type to not like old anime, this one will get better after a few episodes have passed.\
Sound: 10\\10\
This has a great dub, and as I've only seen the dub I cannot compare. However, both versions are considered great anime. From the scenes I have seen subbed, I think that the scenes you'll have probably seen will be better in the dub.\
Character: 9\\10\
I will admit, after ***** packs his bags and goes to the coroner, the story does take a bit of a boring turn, until the very end, when it starts picking up pace. It is like it tries to continue without one of its characters, but just doesn't quite hit the mark. It does have a difficulty to make us feel a connection with the literal replacement characters, so for that you'll have to come to your own conclusion, but I personally didn't like the replacements.\
The other characters were great and developed. I do feel like second Kira was a little underdeveloped, as we could have seen he / her shine a little more. There were moments when second Kira felt like a side character, when really the character could have easily been seen playing a more important role. Especially for those episodes where the second Kira is killing, and the montage. Those moments could have been explored to see a more developed character who is doing his \\ her best for Kira.\
Enjoyment: 8\\10\
The enjoyment for this anime is exceptional, but I feel I should rate it as an 8 because of those episodes after... The big incident... Where the Shirigami kills some people. Not gonna spoil! But since I felt those repelacements were underdeveloped and rather boring, it made me enjy those episodes less.\
Overall: 10\\10\
I rate things as 10\\10 when I know I will want to rewatch it at a later date. The higher my score, the more likely I am to rewatch. So even though it has those faults mentioned above, I'll still be coming back to this later.\

    Hadn't watched an anime in a loooong time and thought why not give it a shot, it could be worth your time. It was the beginning of a fairly okay, not great, ride in the anime series.\
(Disappointed with my list of animes lately, thought each would have been a 'Death Note' - quality wise).Was and still is to date the best anime I've ever watched (Haven't watched that many though lol). First episode in, and I was hooked immediately.  \
9, because it gets just slightly boring after 20 episodes. (Not mad with how it ended for one of the protagonists).\
Oh and fell in love\

    Liked this Anime. Fantastic plot, dialogues, character development & the conclusion of the story. Story starts with a high school student Light Yagami getting the Death Note, a notebook which has incredible power : \"Killing someone whose name is written on the book\" through which he wanted to eradicate the evil from the world. He started killing the criminals by writing their names on the NoteBook. He got the pseudonym \"Kira\" from public. I had as a viewer liked this idea of his. Yes, I thought that killing criminals might eliminate the crime from the world. But, I was wrong. \
There is a saying :\
          \
        \"Lust of power consumes the morality\". In this case, this power was the Death Note. It really consumed the morals of Yagami. He turned against the law enforcement bodies & started eliminating them. His aim was no more to eliminate the evil but eliminating anyone who gets in his way. In the process, he started proclaiming himself as the God of the new world. Now his driving desire to rule the world forced him to go past the boundaries of humanity.  \
Light Yagami's ambition was to make the world free from evil. But, he was the one who was creating a plethora of evil deeds the world has ever seen.\
He could see the darkness prevailing in the world but not the darkness in himself. Our hero was now became a villain. Everything for him was a game of chess. Some pieces to be utilized and sacrificed when they're of no use. \
General sense of morality in me wanted to see his fate. I was not disappointed. There do exist some signs of good no matter how hopeless, to take over the evil. He was even able to defeat the most capable officer involved in the investigation of deaths caused by him. But, the game of chess was still on. Some able descendents of the defeated officer were able the checkmate the self-proclaimed King and pay tribute to their mentor. If you're fond of BBC's Sherlock-Moriarty saga and want to feel that moment again then Death Note will not disappoint you. The enthralling mind games played will keep Adrenaline surging in your nerves.\
Death Note depicts how the hunger for power can turn an individual into heart-less beast. It shows no matter how powerful you become, if you go one on one against humanity then your fate is going to be fatal.\
My most favorite dialogue :-\
Light : \"Haha. I'm Kira. So, you want to kill Kira? Shoot me then. I'm the God and this is my world. I did it to eliminate the crime. Can't you see? Crime rate dropped, global wars stopped. I restored the humanity.\"\
Nate : \"No. You're a serial killer who is confusing himself as God and obsessed by the idea that whatever you're doing falls under morality.\"\

    From start to the very ending,my eyes were wide open,and I was wide awake to see or to deny.Great tension between two different principles,will give you an extra place to judge the inner meaning of justice.If you are thinking your life is worth enough,then here i suggest you to say how million of lives were putting under the mercy of a boy.\
As to justify Light,I would say,he has obviously a rare kind of personality that I will seek for defying anyone smartest.His fellow justice phenomenon was wisely showed by his judgement.Again,we saw his evil side by seeing how far he can go for his criteria,\"I\
          \
        hate to loose\",as a scale of principal I will keep Light ahead of L,cause i think L's main target was to find Kira,he was successful though he didn't have that evidence.\
As a scale of showing the \"rule breaking\"(which i loved most) character,L has no opponent.But I think in the whole series,he was depicted as Light's opponent,not that much of his own personal side.That's why,his golden sides were kind of neglected somehow but still he was credited \"a must\".\
As far,Death Note is the best anime that would draw a thousands of questions before u,a millions of conflicts ahead you,a soft respect for both the evil or the justice,oh!you will fall for both the evil or justice by your own decisions.:-)\

\
Honestly, I loved this anime.\
It being one of the first anime's I've ever watched, I personally didn't have good expectations. But my god, it was great.\
It starts of with your perfect highschool student named Light Yagami, with perfect grades, looks, and a perfect life in genral. One day as he's walking on his school campus, he notices a black notebook fall out of the sky that he ends up picking up. It's titled \"Death Note,\" a book that results in a person dying when you write said person's name in the book whilst thinking of their face.\
This is why I love this show.\
The utter\
          \
        concept of a book that has the power to kill simply by writing a name makes you think, especially when Light begins to use it to kill criminals. When Yagami begins to kill, police notice the sudden rise of criminals dying by heart attacks (you'll understand when you watch the show) and sends a equally smart person as Light named \"L,\" a world famous detective who can solve practically anything you give to him, onto the case.\
L and Light meet, L suspecting Light to be Kira (the name in which the public calledthe sudden killer) and Light knowing that L is, well, L.\
L and Light have a status where you don't know whether to love or hate them. At the begining of the show, naturally, most people side with Light considering the fact that he's the main character. But, by the end, I found the fact to be switched. I ended up hating Light and having L to be my favorite character. \
Light went from killing criminals who somewhat \"derserved to die,\" to killing innocent people who somehow got in his way. He went from an average, sane, highschool student, to a phsycopathic murderer who smiled when L died in his arms. DIED.\
L stayed as a strange character who loved sweets and who sat strangely, staying reconizable and, well, a good character.\
Anyways, that was my review.",

    Death Note is one of those anime that makes you remember why you love anime in the first place. A tight cat and mouse game between two of the most loved anime characters ever conceived that never lowers the intelligence of one just for plot. That on top of animation by Mad House that matches the tone brilliantly and a kick-ass soundtrack all mix into a blend delivered to us in a package with a neat little bow. An enjoyable anime I will return to in the future and so well others as years go on and there is really nothing else like it. A\

    One of the Cult Animes of the History of Anime most appreciated for most people,even for me.\
I was finished the series and i can say,what this anime is good,because the great interpretation of the Psychology Theme and Mental Strategy between the villain protagonist Light and the Antagonic Hero Detective: L,with an great appreciation and with one of the great stories about Manga/Anime Universe,about a Note Book with the power to kill people,and the main protagonist make him,an great form to erradicate all evil-people of the entire World,for make him a better place and became a God. The God of the New World. The series was\
          \
        good until the Second Half of the series,and really was a bit dissapoiting for me,and the ending was really epic and good. And most of the characters, have my respect because of how are maked themselves,with an different role.\
In my opinion an great Detective Histories,with an Epic OST,Characters with Good Roles,an Intense Psychologycal Battles,and also an history about an evil notebook who that could dominate the world,and became a God: The Death Note.And also Greatest Animation.  \

    Many people have praised and reviewed this anime, so why am I repeating the cycle? Because Death Note is amazing. Not to mention that this can be a great gateway into anime if you're unfamiliar. \
Death Note is one of those animes that you'll never see anywhere else. It offers a unique perspective of a moral dilemma. Is murder okay when it comes to criminals? The game of cat and mouse between the two main characters is legendary throughout the community. The weakest part of the story considered by many in the second half. While I believe the story is amazing throughout the entirety, many\
          \
        others believe otherwise. It's really just a matter of perspective.\
The art is great, of course. There's never a point where the art appears rushed or incomplete. And the designs of each character stand out properly, making them more memorable. \
The soundtrack compliments the anime every step of the way. The majority of the songs are religious-like and serious, while a few are goofy for those somewhat rare comedic scenes.\
The characters also excel in this anime. Each one has a unique personality and makes the viewer empathize with them more. The two MCs in particular excel at this. Light is the protagonist, but unlike most has a sinister method to achieve his goal, while L, being the antagonist, typically has more just methods (further complementing the moral dilemma). \
Again, the second half of the anime is usually seen as the weaker part, but I say just watch for yourself and decide whether it's strong or not. I'll say again that I believe the series is great through and through.\
In conclusion, this anime is not only amazing but a staple in the anime world. Despite it being a shonen, it deviates from its label and tells a one of a kind story. I should know, I binged this series in a single night on my first watch. \

    Death Note has a strong sense of atmosphere, pacing and comes with very deep thematic undertones, such as the ones at the core of the premise such as the question of law versus justice, and more subtle things such as autism and homosexuality. The character writing in the show is very advanced.\
While certainly, people seem to be fixated on the show's major turning point towards the end, I think the satisfying ending tome some extent justifies the short-lived dip in quality. \
The soundtrack, is spot on, deeply atmospheric, and emotional at times, it has great range and leitmotifs aren't used sparingly for each major characters.\
          \
        I suppose the visuals are a little inconsistent, either they are packed with religious iconography or symbolism, and done with some very impactful impressionist direction, or at times look a little too grey and still to be engaging. \

    This is the first in my top 10 animes I have ever watched that I will be reviewing though there's little to be said that hasn't been said. \
This anime withstood the test of time and still stands to be one of the most brilliant things I have ever seen. There are no certain heroes in this anime and you keep rooting for your anti-hero (Light) long past his expiration date that is set off in the middle of the anime. \
The story is simple and there's abundance of action and in-action, where battles are lost and won on intellectual level. The open mindedness of\
          \
        the anti-hero, sheer intelligence and the ease with witch he handles accusations and manipulation will leave you amazed. \
As Light's counterpoint is L who is, and perhaps even more, intelligent than Light, cunning and stubborn and all around amazing character that you will love to ridicule and then love to love. \
You can very well compare these two to Hannibal Lecter -Will Graham relationship or rather, it can be compared to Light and L's. Constant competition and comradeship color it after all.\
What I personally liked as well was that all of this was caused by Light Yagami's Onegin-esque spleen.\
Art, for the period and even now, is amazing, though a remake wouldn't hurt considering the graphics available today.\
What really got me pumped about this anime is the music. Usually, I don't notice it (sometimes it should be so, it's supposed to melt into the whole experience) and have to re-watch so I can say something about it. However, in Death Note it's hard /not/ to notice the music. The score is amazing and every track has the eerie feeling matching very well with the anime, and more importantly with the art. \
The anime doesn't completely follow the manga but for those who truly want a one of a life-time experience, or who want an intro to good anime, this one is definitely for you. \

    Note:\
Skip ahead to the second paragraph if you aren't interested in my breakdown of why I believe my delaying this series has only made me able to appreciate it more.\
As I have picked this title up ten years after original airing A LOT of Anime fans I know and come across over the decade have mentioned this one as a must see and I gotta say, I'm both disappointed and glad. I'll elaborate quickly. I'm disappointed because I put off watching this for so long which is probably the obvious one of the two. I'm glad that I let so much time pass because around\
          \
        the time of its airing (2006 through 2007) I was really just beginning my journey into Anime as a whole and if I watched this back then without the experience and knowledge of some shows I have under my belt right now I really don't think I would have as much appreciation for it as I do now. I would have missed a lot of things this show brings to the table. I'll mention each show that comes to mind real quick and what they opened me up to exactly.\
1. Ghost in the Shell - This show doesn't the mystery tag on it most of the time but it was the first one to really get my brain going in the sense of analyzing.\
2. Attack on Titan - This one was the first I saw to really show me what it was to be \"dark\" in Anime.\
3. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion - Lelouch was the first character that I've experienced with a god complex coupled with a big ego that comes closest to the likes of Light. He is probably the only other one in my Anime history so far. All others that could possibly qualify like Uchiha Madara or Gligamesh can't really compare when it comes down to it for me.\
4. Steins;Gate - This one really was my first experience to the \"thrill\" coming out of Anime and also psychological really popped out to me the first time here too.\
Those are the main series that I believe enhance my appreciation for the show.\
Review Start:\
I understand Lights opinion and point of view. I also can see the opposite side where L stands and says \"This is not the right way to do this\" I happened to inch more towards L's side throughout the show even though it was evident that what Light was doing actually helped the world in its own twisted way.\
The chess match between Light and L was amazing for me. I still want more...I've never seen anything like it before. It really had me hooked. Both of them are genius' in their own right and as far as I'm concerned it is still a draw given the turn of events, although I know it's not. Admittedly, things kinda got a little weird for me when M and N came into the picture.\
I'm gonna get a little cryptic here because I want to say it without spoiling -\
I'm tempted to read the manga to see if it ends like it did in the series. I have a feeling they changed it up a bit to shorten the TV series. Not saying that it would have ran 200+ episodes but everything blowing up on \"L\" because \"M\" didn't listen to \"L\" doesn't feel right to me. I feel the most heartache for \"S\" and you can really see in the show the whole thing took its toll on him. \"T\" and \"A\" were the unfortunate victims of a tsundere mastermind and \"R\" got the worst \"end\" of anyone in my opinion. Seems to me the only one got any entertainment was \"R\". Everyone else was doomed to some type of tragedy after touching the Death Note just as was mentioned at some point in the show itself.\
This ones a bit long winded but this marks the end. Hope it was a good read and anyone who hasn't seen, I hope my mystery in the last paragraph pieces together nicely for you as you watch.\

    After a long time I decided to watch this anime. GLAD I FRIGGIN DID THAT!!\
In a long shot, this anime is now in my top3 anime ever watched. I think for it's time ( 2006 - 2007 ) the art is actually really good. Not by today's standards, but you'll get the hang of it in no time and you'll get sucked in the story.\
I watched this entire anime in 3 days, it was fun to watch every single episode. Only the final episode was kinda mweh... You will be in the anime from the first episode, which is for 2006 anime kinda rare for\
          \
        me. Bleach was my first anime ever seen ( started watching in 2009 ) and I got sucked into anime world. Many mentioned this anime to me, I always declined for DL shizzle. Now streamed it. IT WAS WORTH IT.\
Characters. In all anime there is maybe a character too many. In Bleach perhaps Orihime ( \" Kurosaki-kuuuuuunnnnnn\" ) and in Death Note it's gotta be Matsuda imho. Overall characters is thought out, nice interactions and ofcourse the MC's are pretty well done.\
9/10 from me.\

\
Unfortunately episodes 26-37 had to happen so the show gets a 7. Why? Well the characters get a 7 because only the the 2 new big side characters introduced in that bad period are terrible, while the rest are great through the entire run (our main and the blond being the exception). Our main's treatment during that period being what annoyed me the most. I cant say more without spoiling, sorry.\
The art and sound stay great throughout so they\

        get a 10.Story gets a 5 because episodes 26-37 took a great story and slowly tortured it until the ending blew its brains out and i think my enjoyment score of 5 might be to generous.\
All in all i say ignore episodes 26-37 you'll be happier that way. \

    Death note probably , one of the most intelligent series i have seen. It has one of the dubs that i have seen ever in an anime ,the whole English voice over cast is brilliantly chosen as each an every voice fits the role perfectly ,for example  the role of ryuk which perfectly show's how ryuk doesn't give two shits about light is just there for the sheer fun of it and also is very goofy and  this is perfectly encapsulated by Brian drummond  .\
Story \
This one of the most intelligent shows i have seen as far and it is good to\
          \
        find this kinds of shows  , which will make your brain into mush as you will have no idea of whats going on and will try to figure out ,but what you will see will completely shock you as you have experienced what you would never have expected , but this is not constant as the 2nd half is more and more predictable and not as much as enjoyable.which is too bad otherwise it would have reached my top spot of my favorite anime list\
Art\
This one of the most beautiful art i have ever seen, it perfectly fits the mood of this morally grey series with this ever present grayish tint and whenever the character is in deep though or having an intimate conversation it will zoom into their face and change the color scheme to fit that respective  character like for example whenever L is thinking his hair changes to blue which might mean intelligence or show his drive to figure out the truth and in the case of Light it turns to red which signifies his power and the great passion of his to became the \"GOD OF THE NEW WORLD\"\
Sound \
Nothing much needs to be said about the soundtrack  because it in itself stands out the most about this series as this soundtrack is the one which i always play on the background when i am working or studying or even to gym as it gives you the motivation and pumps you up for whatever that is your doing , this soundtrack in itself tells a story as i think that  certain instruments are for a specific character like the distorted guitar for light , the piano and the clean guitar for L etc . Both the ops and the eds are impeccable which makes it hard to skip them .\
Character    \
The main reason why this show is so damn good is mainly because of the characters ,as everybody is unique and get so much development in a single episode that some series takes 5-6 episodes to do which is amazing ,and this makes for some of the best interchanges between the characters .some of my favorite characters are L(of course),matsuda and ryuk they fit their roles in the story like how how L is the best detective , and is a genius who eats a lot i mean a LOT if sugar,matsuda being the goofball and the youngest in the task force,which proves sometimes  how he is a bit childish like how when watari gives the task force fake ids and security belts he becomes excited,and then ryuk being ryuk that's all i need to say about him\
\
Overall it is a very enjoyable series but it also has its faults like the part where near is introduced who is basically the step in for light which makes him uninteresting and the ending omg sooooo unfitting and also unfulfilling but that doesn't make it a bad half but an inferior half to the first half in which nobody took the time to find faults as there were not many and it also had L which made it awesome \
That's all from me \
Peace out \

    Ayy, time for Death Note, the legitimately highly acclaimed series.\
First of all, the story, truly unique, will get you tied up to your chair if you haven't already seen it. Well it also is the main problem of the series, as everyone who saw it in its entirety will know what was the wrong choice they made which led the series to a wall and to drop of attractiveness. The first part characters are gorgeous, but then after this \"choice\", we get introduced to despicable characters that tend to resemble to what we hoped didn't disappear ....\
For the art! Well as the story is unique,\
          \
        we get to see unique things too ! ;)\
Now the sound, well it is true that L's theme is one of the best in entire anime, the soundtrack is great, no flaws whatsoever, not for me at least.\
The overall enjoyment of the series is unprecedented, you only get disappointed at the end of the series, but even if it disappoints, the first half is so good that we forgive the flaws towards the end.\
Overall, Death Note is a must see series for anyone who hasn't seen it, this show is for you if you like smart moves, intrigues, and apples ;)\

    Ok, so, Death Note.  I put off watching this because of everyone talking about it and blah blah blah, but finally I got too curious because the concept sounded somehow interesting.  The first episode and I was actually hooked.  I couldn't stop watching...I wanted to see what would happen next and I ended up watching like, five episodes at a time for the next week.  This was all the fun of a good old detective-versus-dark force crimeflick, from the dark force's perspective and the characters were actually interesting!    \
Unfortunately, this didn't end where it should have.  L\
          \
        was easily the best and most interesting character, and with him out of the picture, the series was out of balance and didn't really have anywhere to go.  I was not particularly satisfied with the ending, but that didn't diminish the series' appeal.   It does, however, lower the overall ratings of what could have been a near-perfect series.\

    The question is who is Light Yagami? You decide and let me know!\
I feel the story of Death Note is one of the greatest stories ever told. It has just about everything that you could want in a story action, suspense, horror, comedy I give this a 10 not only is it my favorite anime It's my favorite movie my favorite book my favorite comic my favorite poster my 2nd favorite shirt 2nd only to Dr Rockso! (Ka ka ka ka YEAH!) and I'll explain why...\
 Story...10\
 The story is so suspensful and so artfully told that you could both think you understood everything but\
          \
        still find something new at the same time never really sure if your right or not? Two different people will not take the story the same way those same 2 people will argue with you up and down about why a certain character did what he did or why he did what he did.   Big drama big payoffs edge of your seat action. The best part about it to me is it makes you think. What would I do if one day I found a notebook that allowed you the ability to kill anyone anywhere in the world with just a name a face a pen and a notebook (take a second and think about it? and yes I mean YOU!) Would you use it?Would you kill people you didn't like? Would you be too scared to write in it? Would you think it was just a joke? Of course you would and after the persons whose  name you wrote died at the time you stated, how you said it would happen and the exact circumstances would you feel remorse? Would you be able to bring yourself to do it again? Would you be terrified? What happens when you die? Because the rules of the notebook say that a human who has used the notebook can neither go to heaven or hell. The story of Death Note is about what would happen when a teenager named Light Yagami found the death note and what's gonna have to happen now is you could either take my word for it or find out for yourself! No as a matter of fact I demand you to watch it! And if you don't like it, Its probably because you didn't understand it! \
  Artwork... \
 Really good camera angles a really nice even though it's anime it still manages to be realistic gritty and smooth at the same time. Very true to the manga \
  Sound...\
 I thought every character fit except for maybe Rem damn good jobs by the voice actors!\
  Character...\
 There are some of the most unique characters that i have ever seen before or since the death gods are a hell of alot different thanin Bleach.The chracter L is perhaps one of the strangest characters of all times. It's really kind of hard to wrap your mind around him and he is highly up for interpretation. Light some people think he's gay some people think hes wonderful women love him and I think he is malignant narcissist. Misa misa is a dumby but extremely loyal which I find to be a great quality but maybe not the best thing for herself. Near and Mellow are hard to describe so I won't! Cause I hate them anyway. Now what alot of people don't mention would be the millions and begillions ( made up #) of criminals that get killed over the span of the story RIP.  \
  Enjoyment...\
 Supercalifragalisticexpalidoucious!!!!!!\
  Overall...\
 I'll take this one last slot to tell you one more time to watch it! and if you've seen it rewatch it if you've just seen the anime there's 3 live action movies and 12 volumes of manga plus a 13th volume to try to explain things and I recommend the manga. The manga because the end is a little bit better but in my opinion not not NOT NOT what should have happened!!!..!.!",

    When I started watching this anime, it was all because I've heard about from all my anime-fanatic friends. I thought it'd be good, and I had high expectations for this anime. Once I started watching it, I couldn't get enough. Light Yagami is one of the most distinguished, unique anime character I've ever met. With a desire to bring justice to the world, and at the same time does something illegal -- mass murder -- to try to cleanse the world of its evil. \
After watching this anime, I'm sure that it had met all my expectations. I was so elated that my friends told\
          \
        me about this anime; because it's one of the best I've seen. I was obsessed with it for two months or three. I bought the three live-action movies, watched them five times each... I loved it. Then, I decided I had to read the manga. \
So, in my opinion, I love this anime/manga. It has got to be the best anime, if not already.\

    Goodness, where to start with this? Death Note has been one of the best series I've ever seen in my entire life. It's plot just blew me away. It was so amazing. The characters were also very interesting, like Light, the power-hungry genius intent on creating a better world. Then you have L, who, despite his age, is just so adorable, especially when he's eating sweets. Let us not forget Near and Mello, who were also very important to the story. I liked those two. They were fun characters, in a sense.\
I think what I really liked about this series was the plot. Death Note\
          \
        was quite different from other series I've seen. I'm used to hilarious and action based series, so having a serious detective story was a nice change. The logic in it gave me a brain wreckage, and throughout the entire series, I always wondered how the author could have possibly come up with dialogue like that.\
The voice acting was astounding, especially Light and L's. Their American VAs did a tremendous job with them.\
Death Note is my fourth favorite series, but geez...it's a damn good series to watch. I give it a ten.\

    When I finished reading the manga of the same name, I had mixed feelings about it; the story was different and definitely thrilling, the art beautiful, but the story progressed slowly.\
The anime fixed any problems regarding that.\
There is nothing new to the story, compared to manga. The story remains the same, although there are some small pieces missing. A notebook falls from the shinigami world, picked up by Light Yagami - a bored, intelligent young man who seizes this opportunity with minimal hesitation. Write down a person's name and they will die. Get more elaborate, and the death shall follow instructions if possible. Throw in\
          \
        master detective L, and the game is ready to begin.\

    Yeah, another 10 for Death Note, but its gotta be one of the only animes out there that people cant argue the score.\
The Story is very compelling and after a few episodes you are absolutely hooked on the story, and will find yourself unable to stop watching until you are eventually done with the show. Story follows the lives of various people who recieve an item by the name of a \"death note\" which is a notebook that will kill anyone whos name is written inside. \
There are 2 main characters throughout: Light Yagami, and L. Light is the protagonist who has the death note\
          \
        and and L is the detective sent to investigate who is behind mass amounts of killing. A cat and mouse story develops as these two battle it out to see who is the more inteligent induvidual. The show is very psychologically driven, with these two behind it all.\
The art is fantastic, which isnt much of a surprise, it is done rather darkly, but seeing as how it matches the story it makes alot of sense.\
Like I said, it was so much fun to watch and see where things were going to go. I started watching and then couldnt stop, one thing is that it almost couldve been ended earlier, because at a point people just start getting tossed in almost for shits and giggles it seems, but unless the show had run its course we wouldnt have had such a dark ending. Actually I think that it was a bad idea to end it where they did, I think that they couldve milked it for another couple seasons at least, and we all wouldve watched it, I sure would have. Great show, well worth watching.\

Although the ending had been a little abrupt, if you rewatch it a couple of times, you might see the beauty of what this anime possesses. Each individual character had unique characteristics, which made delighted me even more. The plot was extremely planned out well; young Light Yagami finds a sole Death Note and starts creating schemes to extinguish evil from the world. He is considered as the 'best' in Japan and therefore, he has a brilliant mind that prevents him from being captured by polices. Yet, the ICPO (otherwise similar to the\
          \
        FBI and the CIA) brings out their ultimate detective to solve this case. The detective, otherwise nicknamed as 'L,' tries his best with logical explanations to step-by-step capture Light and pause his killings. Outside, they are very renown friends; yet, through the real world, both are major threats and they compete to relinquish the other. In all, Death Note is definitely an outstanding anime and therefore you should turn go ahead, turn on your TV or your computer and enjoy yourself with this award-winning animation.\

    Death Note is amazing. It has it's ups and downs but it is an amazing anime. \
The story is amazing. It's really interesting and enjoyable. And it's kind of hard to tell who the real villain is. Is it Light, because he's using the Death Note to kill people? Or is is L because he's trying to put a stop to Light? It's hard to decide! \
The art for Death Note is really nice, the backgrounds are mainly dark, grey and dreary. It suits the anime perfectly. The characters on the other hand, it depends on what angle they're at. Sometimes they look really well\
          \
        and other times they don't look so good. L for example, sometimes he looked really well and other times he looked a little bit off. It looks fine most of the time and it is bearable when the characters look a bit off as it only lasts a few seconds. \
The sound was really good. I highly enjoyed it. I liked the first opening and ending songs and I really liked the background music, especially L's Theme. The second opening and ending songs annoyed me. I hated them a lot. But that's the only problem I have with the sound. The rest was done really well and suited the anime perfectly. \
The characters were really good. There was one that I really disliked and that was Misa Amane, she was just a comic relief character, but unlike other comic relief characters, she wasn't funny and didn't have a unique trait that made her seem like a decent character. She was trying to be cute and failing and then she tried to be smart and she was dangerously stupid. She did have slight intelligence when she was in possession of the Death Note but not a lot. The other characters were good. I didn't like Light but that was because I like L, there isn't much I hold against him that can be out in a spoiler-free review.\
Death Note is really enjoyable and has a lot of re-watch quality. It's a great first anime and I highly recommend it. \
Overall it's a great anime and it has a great storyline and it's really enjoyable. \

    I know I am going to struggle with bias when I write this review. I just really did not like how the anime ended (not even that, how a certain character changed so much over the course of the anime). I am one that does not necessarily want a happy ending, but at the very least a struggle for good. This is almost contradictory in a sense because a lot of times I really do adore the bad guys, but in this case it was just depressing to realize who the true bad guy is.\
Story: 8/10\
It is about a boy named Yagami Light who finds\
          \
        a notebook that can kill people if their names are written in it. He begins to use its power and decides to rid the world's evil with it. At the same time, investigators are looking into the unknown deaths of criminals, calling upon L for help. This is the part I hate the most, but there was almost a subtle blend between who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist. It may seem obvious at first, but this anime is anything but obvious. Who is the true enemy? Maybe he is right in front of you.\
There is a good build-up for the story. As much is explained as other things are disposed of. Supporting characters are usually only there for a short period of time because of circumstances that eventually prevents them from seeing the light of day, so not much depth is present for them, but the main cast is deep.\
Epic plot twist is epic.\
Art: 8/10\
The drawing style really fits the dark mood of the anime. Even during the day, there is a heavy atmosphere that seems to continue throughout every activity, especially after the power of the notebook is revealed. No matter how one looks at it, death is still death. Maybe Light believes it is for the better, but there is no denying people are dying. It draws upon a question that comes up a lot in anime and in life: when is it okay to kill? Do criminals deserve to die? Will the world become a better place because of that, or will just more pain ensue? There is not a direct answer found in the anime, but it does bring to light the effect of answering those questions in a way that appears right: kill them.\
I may have talked more about emotional appeal than art there...\
Sound: 8/10\
Scary. Befitting for such an anime. Nothing much I can say here (truth be told I forgot a lot of the soundtrack...)\
Character: 7/10\
As I have said before, a lot of characters are merely there to be written in the notebook. It builds upon the main storyline, but prevents a lot of character development outside of the main characters. Not too much is mentioned about the characters' pasts; most of the development occurs within the anime. And a lot does. A lot.\
Personally speaking, I did not like the change. I hated the second half of the anime because of two major changes that happened. I do not want to spoil it, but in a way, the first half was about a kid with a huge dream, the second half was about that same kid trying to claw his way out of the hole he dug for himself.\
Enjoyment: 6/10\
I would have liked it much better if the second half was changed. The ending was... a reasonable conclusion (albeit the still-dark atmosphere present), and in general, it was a good anime.\
Overall: 7/10\
I do not want to bash on this anime for not fitting my liking, so I will tell you to just give it a shot. For many I believe, it will be an amazing, gripping tale of hope and conviction, but ultimately deceit, trickery, and death.\

    This review is to give any newcomers a basic idea of what this anime is about, so there wont be ANY spoilers (Even if it is the slightest of spoilers) in this review. After all this time I finally decided to write the review and relieve the awesomeness of this anime that was trapped within me onto this review. By the time you finish this review, you will find yourself watching Death Note. So here comes another review of one of the best anime series of all time.\
Genre - If you are a deep thinker this anime is for you. There are so many twists\
          \
        in this anime series, I found myself thrilled most of the time.\
Story - Ok so to put it simply this is a \"good vs evil\" anime. A young man named Light Yagami found a Death Note on the ground. He noticed the Death Note has unusual powers and can kill a human if he knows the face and name. I wont say anything more about the plot, but what I can say is that this anime has one of the best \"witty\" battles. In this anime characters fight with their brains. One wrong move and it's the end for him/her. In my opinion I think the story is THE most notable thing about this anime.\
 Art - AMAZING, Hajime Oikawa must have put in a lot of effort to make the art in some scenes look realistic. Just watch the anime and you will know what I mean.\
Sound - Another notable thing about the series. The way the OST blends in with the anime is just flawless. Masayuki Iwakara did a great job creating every soundtrack, or should I say master piece.\
Characters - Yet again, another notable thing about the anime. Not many anime series out there can make every character useful in some way, this one can. As previously mentioned before this anime is a fight against good and evil or mainly the Police Force + L vs Light Yagami. Usually a single human can't fight off an army, watch as Light can. If you're wondering weather to watch the anime in DUB or SUB try both and then decide for yourself which one you like best. I personally prefer DUB, I couldn't stand SUB.\
Enjoyment - This anime is worth watching and rewatching. Pssst I watched this anime series 6 times, I still feel like watching it again but I have other anime to watch. I don't know anyone who watched this anime and disliked it. Every person who watched the anime and finished either sides with L or Kira, which is really surprising. One  of the many personal reasons why I liked it is because of the many themes presented in this anime series, it is up to the viewer to pick them up and then build a perspective on them.\
Overall - I can't find myself picking a number other than 10 for any category for this anime. The reason is simply because this anime is one heck of a master piece. If you're not convinced weather or not you should watch Death Note by now, stop wasting your time reading this review and give the first episode a try.\

                          \
    It's a recent and discussed anime, so i would like to give it a try and do the best i can to make this an helpful review.\
I'd like to go little by little, taking every aspect and analyzing it:\
STORY: Great screenplay, no doubt about it. The original autor of the manga, Tsugumi Ohba, has done an excellent work by using all her ideas, combining altogether and making a story considered one of the most innovative. BUT (there is a quite big but) from a certain point of the anime, the story collapse, making space for new and useless characters. Then the finale, a three-episode-marathon, it's\
          \
        like a Dragonball episode, when characters take a couple of episodes to hit their enemy with a punch.\
ART: I really like Takeshi Obata's style, because it's mature and quite realistic. But there are some exceptions, when characters, like Teru Mikami, tend to exagerate with their expressions, making them completely insane. Lke in the finale, when one of them change completely expression becoming another person, just like Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, lol\
SOUND: That's the best thing of this anime. I've never listened to such great compositions and works. Every character has its own theme music, and that's the same thing for particular scenes. But most of all, in the finale, wich i already told to be a little bit too exagerate, there is a masterpiece of sound and music; it's totally right, it makes your heart felling so excited for the ending, because the last 10 minutes are the most beautiful in the entire anime. Another thing, away from the episodes, are the opening and the endings. I found What's Up People?!, by Maximum The Hormone, a very good song, as well as the WORLD by Nigtmare.\
CHARACTER: By far, the character of \"L\" is the best. It's almost patologic, a genius of rare intelligence. Its character is evident when he first appears in public showing his face. Blue trousers, white pullover, tired eyes, no shoes and some maniacs like playing little games with sugar or eating cakes. He's just like an hikikomori, but he has a purpose, that's what makes him different. Light Yagami is a typical student with his own reasons to make a new world, so it's not different from ourselves. Shinigamis are done very well, especially Ryuk. Misa Amane is a total idiot, but that's what makes her a curious character. The other characters are, somehow, decent, with some ugly exceptions like Near.\
ENJOYMENT: It's not a funny anime, it's the opposite instead. But it's amusing to see how the story goes on, even when it reaches a certain point. It's also interesting listening to the almost illogical thoughts of characters. Let's not forget a brilliant line, so: \"I'll take a potato chip... and eat it!\" XD\
OVERALL: At the end of all my (long) review, its' a very good anime, with its errors and mistakes, but still innovative and exciting.\
Pardon my english ^_^\

    The relationship between the individual and society in the matter of law is nothing new in food for taught. The complication has had it's existence since birth of societies themselves. And has always interested people. Big names occur in this area like Hobbes or Locke to name a few.\
A common reasoning is that people tend to favor to live in groups because it's in their advantage.

Another reason to why people easily agree to the human societies is because the lack power to actually do as their\

        will desire, which of course isn't a bad thing at all. A life only led by desires wouldn't last long. But that also ultimately translates into a state where acceptance is key and criticism is forgotten, but if power to make change is given action is usually taken.\
Here is where my previous statements tie into Death note.\
Light the main protagonist seems to be a fairly usual youth aside from his astonishing intellect that is until he comes across with the book which triggers the whole series, the Death Note. Light now has power to change, and power to utilize his weapon which before wasn't enough to drastically change the world around him. His second weapon which now truly blooms is his mind. Together with the new found lethal weapon he now posses he's ready to make change, to reform the world itself. All the walls which before were unbreakable are now ready to be caved in.\
Even though this philosophical aspect truly is intriguing this alone isn't what makes death note great, aside from the philosophical standpoints the show also offers warfare through intellectual means. Light aims to purify the world with help of his cunning instead of brute force. \
To create such a show is obviously no easy feat but the author at least in my eyes pulled it off. I've never experienced such a thrill in a show as i did when you get to follow Light and the antagonist L battle in a realm of intellect, it was truly remarkable. And it feels like the way the thought processes are showcased truly shines in an animated show like this and could never be used into normal film.\
Even though I can never praise Death Note enough it obviously still has its flaws like any other show. A thing worth naming is the character development. This area is pretty much defined as a stalemate. The only character which truly develops is the protagonist himself while all the other as said before show no greater change. Another thing which is often noted as flawed with the series is that it doesn't hold the same standard throughout the series. It greatly diminishes in quality in the latter part of the series except the end which at least i found satisfactory.\
But still I dearly value this show as my favorite of all time, I simply never found anything like it. And even if many tend to associate Death note with words like overrated or hyped I still find the show one of a kind and a masterpiece.\

    Deathnote is by far one of the greatest and most original anime i have ever seen.... after clearing that up, let's check out the different fields for this anime that make it so good...\
_To tackle the story first. This is by far the main point that boosts this series up. Some of the greatest animes like bleach, naruto, one piece... (not just personal, but judged by many) have earned their current status while having many elements if not most, taken from different animes or shows. And despite that they are great! Imagine Deathnote, something that hasn't been done before, a very compelling story,  entertaining,\
          \
        but also has its moments of action, suspense.... overall great story!!\
_ Not so much need to be said about the art, the characters are well drawn, a more serious and less colorful environment, since the story is more or less in a fictional modern time, realistic in general (except for the shinigami/death gods and their book, hehe)\
_ The music is amazing and fits right where it needs to be, globally very good soundtrack, but kinda has a weird intro for the second part of the show (i hated it, but it's a matter of opinion...)\
_You'll LOVE the characters, that's all that needs to be said, in the first 2 episodes you'll meet the main characters, Light and L... and you'll be automatically introduced to their personalities and you'll discover more and more about them as the story progresses.\
To wrap everything up, this is an amazing anime, for everyone.... And really worth watching !!!\

    So, this is my first time for make a review for an Anime, so i will give it my best try...Specially for my Favourite series..\
Did you ever thinking about the \"Perfect\" world? a world where no criminals and crimes? Where everyone else safe and live their life freely without scared out about criminals and bad guys? \
Where is the Justice when corrupt politicians can freely walking on the outside?\
Where is the Justice when a Criminals still working on the world?\
\"The World is Rotten\" as Light Yagami said on the first episode...\
What if you get the power to kill people without even touch them? There must\
          \
        be some meaning behind this power, right? \
Death Note story focus on our Protagonist, a genius-high school student Light Yagami. He is bored with this typical and rotten world...Once he pick the Mysterious Black Note on his School Ground, He throw away all of his life achievements for rid the criminals for this world...Build a New Utopia and become the God of the New World.\
I'm wonder if the objectives really completed...\
Well, This is depends on you, the viewers... for choosing who is the good and the bad guys in this story.\
The story focus on a Mind and Strategy Fighting between our two Genius Leaders which have their own believes of Justice.\
The other Genius is L, The famous Great Detective who have solved so many outstanding cases on the world.\
Well, he is the Antagonist... \
If you expect to judge the characters from their looking, you'll be fooled...Well, i liked the idea from the starts.Then, i highly recommended you for this show...not to tell that this series involves with Shinigami and out-of-the-box things but you MUST watch this for a High Quality Story and Mystery...When there is L who solve the puzzles, then Light trying to crush the puzzles...\

    Man oh man...I feel like I need to catch my breath after this one. This, has to be in my top 5 of all time...I am angry at myself for waiting so long to finally watch it! Possibly the most intricate and clever anime (and television program period) I've ever seen. The cat and mouse between Light and L was mesmerizing...it was just perfect. Twist after twist had me wondering who was going to come out on top and how one or the other was going to get out of the pickle they were in. The Shinigami characters were brilliant and I even thought the\
          \
        secondary characters (I.e. Misa, Near, Mikami, Mello, etc) were well thought out. \
SPOILER ALERT!\
After episode 25, I was going to give up...I was shattered about what happened and I can see why people were pissed, but the show picks back up and gives the audience the ending they deserve...minus one major person. Honestly, after watching the second live action film, I feel like if they took that ending and changed it up a bit, it would have been perfect...\
at the same time however, the episode where L went out was so exciting and crazy, Light's way of pushing Rem to take him out and everything was so intense and shocking, I don't know, I just felt so excited that something could still shock me...I'm on the fence.\
P.S. Kenichi in the live films as L....so fucking perfect.\
My point is, it was an experience and a welcome one at that. Even when it was overly serious or unintentionally funny (eating potato chips LIKE A BOSS!) or sad, I was hooked and loving every second.\
10/10 MUST SEE FOR ALL.\

    Konnichiwa, my fellow anime lovers!\
Today I will be doing a review for the highly praised psychological/police thriller namely - Death Note.\
STORY : 8\
Death Note starts off fairly sluggish as the plot is quite complicated and needs to explain to the viewer of the rules that apply during the remainder of the series. This can be a bit daunting at first, but this allows the viewer to shape creative ideas, as if you were in the shoes of the protagonist himself. This is also beneficial when the story really picks up its intensity so the viewers' focus can be solely on the plot. It must be\
          \
        said, when the wheels are turning, this show is intense as can be and an absolute joy to watch. One setback the plot had was the mid-series climax and was delayed to pick up momentum again, but once it did, this train went all the way.\
ART : 8\
The art-style is very well suited for the genre as it creates this sense of claustrophobia and solitude. You could argue that the creators of Death Note wanted the viewer to have an isolated viewpoint as that from the main protagonist. All color-contrasts has been stripped from this world with the only exception being objects linked to the plot.\
SOUND : 7\
This is very subjective and I feel most viewers would disagree with me on the subject. No part of the OST stood out for me, and I suspect it was simply my preference to the musical genre. That being said the OST served its main purpose in setting up the atmosphere in every scene and I'll let you know the openings were phenomenal. Death Note is one of the rare cases where the English dub was done fairy well, so pick whichever to your liking.\
CHARACTERS : 9\
This is were the anime sets the benchmark for the thriller genre. \
The constant tussle between two geniuses (Kira and L) to stay ahead in their believed vindictive perceptions and to anticipate each others actions. The supporting roles also deserve a special mention as they are also focused to intertwine with the twists and turns the plot takes you on.\
ENJOYMENT : 7\
For my low-attention span brain, this show was draining to watch to say the least, but was very entertaining. Most viewers will constantly have their minds in overdrive to keep up with the plot, but that is to be expected watching an in-depth thriller such as Death Note.\
OVERALL : 8\
I wouldn't recommend this for younger audiences as the plot is complex and the twists aren't as obvious to notice even if you were fully focused on the plot. For mature audiences fascinated with the detective-thriller genre, this is an absolute must-see and will probably go down as one of their finest.",

    Everything about this anime exceeds all others. The storyline, the plot, the characters... they're all so original!!! Watch the anime (37 episodes) AND read the manga (12 volumes), doesn't matter which one you read first, they're both just so good! ^.^\
Light Yagami, 17, is a top-scoring scoring pre-Uni Japanese student, and he's bored out of his mind... until he finds the Death Note, a notebook of death. Anyone who's name is written in the notebook dies, and Light vows to use this power to rid the world of evil, as the Shinigami Ryuk watches over him, unseen to other humans. Only once all these well-known\
          \
        criminals start dying, the nation comes up with a huge rumour... that a god called 'Kira' is finally passing righteous judgement on the wrongdoing in their world. But this case catches the eye of the mysterious detective L - nobody knows his real name or face, but he's the greatest detective to have ever lived - and he has vowed to hunt Kira down and put an end to the murders. And so an all-out battle between the anonymous 'Kira' and 'L'. Who will win? Who is truly the meaning of justice?\
It's riveting. Once you've started, you can't stop. 10/10 for everything on the ratings, but if I could mark above, who knows when the noughts would end... because it just overthrows everyone's expectations COMPLETELY. If you don't read this, or watch it, you'll regret it.\

Perfect character, Light Yagami is perfect for betraying the calculating killer! Sheer enjoyment, it's got drama, suspense, action, comedy, the works! I only have one problem with it.

Do I even need to say anything more? Well I will. Death Note is by far my favorite anime, is it perfect? No, of course not. Nothing is perfect and like all anime, Death Note is not flawless. I'm guessing you've already heard people pointing out everything they love about it so before I jump on the bandwagon and do the same, let me point out the only two flaws I can think of so that I don't seem too biased.\
1. Characters. \"But wait a minute, you gave character a 9/10, isn't that really good?\" Yes, but it's not\
          \
        without it's problems. Remember, right now I'm only focusing on the bad aspects of this show, the good parts come later. Many of the characters are only there to move the plot forward, Misa is a prime example of this, she is basically a plot device with no character development, and this applies to almost all characters (except  maybe Matsuda who ironically enough is a comic relief character)\
2. The last third of the series. This is probably the most common complaint from people who didn't like Death Note. The last 12 episodes of this 37 episode series are not as good as the previous 25 due to reasons I will not reveal because BBCode is diabled. Let's just say felt unneccesary, were is not for the brilliant/awful ending. Personally I don't dislike these last few episodes as much as most people do but I can at least see why they do.\
Now, for the praise. Here's a tl;dr version of it: It's REALLY good.\
There are several characters in Death Note but you only need to care about two of them, Light and L. They both steal the show with their brilliant scheming, amazing deductive abilities and just all around enjoyable personalities. Light (the MAIN-main character) is actually a villain, something that's rarely seen in anime. \"But One Piece is about pirates, aren't they villains?\" No, because they don't do things like kill innocent people just because they stand in the way of justice (or at least Lights personal view of justice). He lies, manipulates people and is overall just a big douche... and I love it. Unlike most other anime villains we actually get to see Light plan for his evil... plans. Being an evil genious is not as easy as one might think and Light goes through a lot of hardships for the sake of his ambition to create a perfect world (and rule it as a God). He is calm, collected and does everything as smoothly as possible while trying to hide that evil grin of his, he is just too much fun to watch.\
But every hero needs a villain... which in this case is a hero... anyway, it's L. L is the worlds most brilliant detective and a perfect opponent for Light. He's a weird, eccentric, creepy, sugar addicted and overall socially awkward person with a skin so pale it makes Edward from Twiligt look normal. He's also impartial and daring devoting everything towards catching Light, it's a great cat and mouse thriller with no dull moments, which is quite an accomplishment considering the show is 90% dialogue.\
\"Wait... what?\" Yeah, that's right. While Death Note does have a few action scenes it's mostly just filled with dialogue, or should I say monologue. But unlike anime like Bakemonogatari which is filled with lots of entertaining dialogue which then ultimately lead nowhere all the dialogue in Death Note matters, better yet, it makes you feel really smart for no reason which is why many call Death Note an intelligent anime. This unfortunately is false, just because you're watching a complicated story with lots of twist and turns it doesn't mean that you are an intelligent person. Everything is explained in great detail and the only thing you have to do as a viewer is to sit back and enjoy the ride. Another popular misconception is that a lot of people seem to think that Death Note deals with important issues like \"Is it right to kill criminals?\" Death Note however, does not. It simply brings these issues to the table, but it doesn't do anything with them. Light quickly comes to the conslusion that \"Yes, it is\" and it's not really discussed a lot in the series after that.\
The art and music in this series is also wonderful and they fit perfectly together, to explain why would be pointless when you can just watch this video instead: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4LvpibQ_-E\
And now we're at the end of this review. Usually this is the part when I'm suppposed to write something like \"all in all Death note is a very good anime that dwelves deep into the bla bla bla\" but as you can see I'm not going to do that. Instead I'm going to leave you with these 59 words that I hope you'll find very useful: WATCH DEATH NOTE NOW IT IS A REALLY GOOD ANIME AND I BET YOU WILL LIKE IT WAIT WHY AM I WRITING WITH CAPS LOCK ON OH WELL IT IS TOO LATE TO TURN IT OFF NOW WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT AGAIN OH YEAH DEATH NOTE YOU SHOULD GO WATCH IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT I PROMISE\

    \"Deathnote\" is one of the few anime that is both highly intellectual and cynical in a very mature way.\
The show is pure brain food.\
If you like cynicism and a dark view on humanity and like brainy shows like the first seasons of \"House\", Ghost in the Shell or the old Sherlock Homes books,\
This is a must see.\
If you are like everybody else you probably find it disturbing \
that the protagonist is a sociopath hero and the anti-villain is a amoral super detective that cares more about the challenge than saving lives.\
This show is not about karma, it is about the audience enjoying intellectually\
how the characters\
          \
        solve a series of problems.\
There is only one thing that prevents the anime from being perfect, and that is a really crappy and superficial second season that I would have found being unwatchable was its not for its vague resemblance of the Deathnote series.\

    Death Note has a very distinct storytelling style. If you love classical who-done-it movies and series you are going to love this series. The first part of the series gives you a very strategic storytelling experience. 2 people dancing around each other without knowing who the other person is.\
After the mid season climax the series takes a bit of a slower pace which actually strengthens the series. After this is becomes more of a puzzle with each episode bringing you more pieces as you go along.\
A very refreshing series and having grown a lot older since I started watching anime I am happy to see\
          \
        more mature series as time progresses. In that regard this is one of the best you'll find around and gets my highest recommendation.\

    The character development in this anime is great, the concept is interesting, there are plot twists that you may or may not see coming (I personally didn't see many of them coming, but then again I'm not very good at that type of thing ^_^;), and the ending is...well, the jury's still out on that whole thing. I personally favor the manga ending over the anime ending; then again, I feel that the anime should have been drawn to a close somewhere after 'you know what' happens instead of continuing on in the way that it did. Still, I would recommend watching this anime as\
          \
        it is actually fairly great all-around; maybe not as 'OMGz amazing!' as all the fangirls/guys out there would make you think, but still pretty great.\

    In lack of a better word, I should say this anime is completely, absolutely and totally awesome. I guess Death Note is the most famous anime in the world, and there's a reason for it.\
1. STORY (10/10): Can you list me any other story similar with Death Note? Can you? I'm sure you can't because Death Note's story is completely original. A straight A student who suddenly found a strange notebook, and later found out this notebook, he could clean the world, killing all the bad people. It's a great plot that involves you more than fast. I couldn't find a better word than phenomenal.\
2.\
          \
        ART (10/10): The way Death Note's art is incredible is really... Incredible! I've never seen a anime as detailed, professional and real as Death Note's. I love when Kira gets in \"psychotic state\" and all of a sudden, the scenery changes and it's only Kira and the black background. The special effects (as the 3D effects or the scenes which Kira is writing the names) are surreal!\
3. SOUND (10/10): Again, a 10/10 rate. The characters' voices, the background sounds, the noises, fusses... They all are in their proper places without any issues. And the OST... God, I can't just explain. The way the original soundtracks were made with clarity and depth is just terrific. It's really original, scary and also enjoyable.\
4. CHARACTER (9/10): Here, I don't think we can have a 10/10. All of the characters are amazing, well-structured and engaging. But, at some time of the anime, you start to hate some of them. I found some of them boring at some point and I felt like there was something missing in their script. Obviously, there are incredible characters, like L and Raito, but there are one who I just got sick of them.\
5. ENJOYMENT (10/10): If I could, I would give a 20/10. I can't actually describe *the feels* I had watching the series. Every single episode has its suspense, and it was this suspense (with those other points I cited right up) what made me feel like I NEEDED to watch the anime. I didn't stop watching until I had seen the last episode. As not enough, I saw both the Rewrites. When it ended, I felt like there was something missing in my soul. I loved every single moment while watching and if I could, I would do it all over again. a 1000/10.\
6. OVERALL (10/10): Joining the plot, the art, the soundtrack, the characters and the feels we got watching this PERFECT anime, we get a merited 10/10. I recommend this anime to every single person, because it's a plot which involves anyone, it doesn't matter his/her age.\
It's my first review and English is not my first language, but I hope I have made my point.\

    Death Note is one hell of a ride, its plot is original and very distinctive. I found myself genuinely committed to it from start to finish. This is a well rounded anime with very minuscule flaws. The plot goes a little like this, a boy genius, Light, stumbles upon a Death Note dropped by Ryuik, a god of death, Light finds an alternative meaning for his encounter with the notebook. Light is convinced he was chosen to receive the notebook and rid the world of evil. Light wanted to be the \"God\" of the criminal-free world he was creating. Light referred himself as Kira an\
          \
        obvious alias, Kira caught the attention of the world best detective L and thus the game begins. It becomes a game of wits and complex stratagem.\
 If you are a keen and inquisitive observer, notice how light changes throughout the anime. He is the epitome of innocence and is morphed into evil and condemnation. I personally found myself intrigued with Light's character, he isn't the hero protagonist at all,using people to get what he wants. I mean, he is going to be a god of his Utopian after all. Light failed to notice he was becoming the very thing he wanted to abolish.\
Story:9\
I loved the story so original and a different type of dark. I would have liked a it more romance, but that's just my opinion.\
Art:10\
I constantly find myself referring to how well done Death Note's art is. I love a more serious look with a darker hue, its perfect. And its ominous tone will be the final blow!\
Sound:10\
The sound makes or breaks some anime, but I liked its sad and poetic music and i cant forget to mention its starting credits song, especially season 2!!! I watched it dubbed, even though i haven't seen it subbed, i have no intention to. I loved the voice actors because they sold the characters, Death Note is one of the better dubbs.\
Character: 8\
This is the lowest score i gave in all the categories, because Death Note ONLY  depth-end Light as a character in my view. Its subtleties satisfied my questions to a certain extent. Some might argue otherwise, but i stand with my opinion because we see Light under a spectrum of situations and we can identify with his feelings (hopefully not too much) and he became a whole and complete character, the whole anime is about Light and encompasses his journey of deception and sacrifice, so it would be foolish not to develop him more than other characters . L was eccentric to say the least, but his character development was just lukewarm to me, people often confuse character personality with character development with that being said L was just a good enough character, If you fell in love with L's character don't let your cloudy judgment factor with character development. \
Overall:\
I love dark and physiological genres. And Death Note was a very popular anime and was recommended to me multiple times, so i held it off because of my fear of not living up to its expectations. I completed the anime and I took more from it than i thought i would. To me its more than a journal of death or the view of an ideal world. Its about the corruption of mind, the obliviousness of unforgivable actions, the clouded and crazy mind,the delusions of saint-hood.You cant help but ask the question, What would i do if i had a Death Note?\

    Death Note is simply one of the best anime series I have ever seen, having an outstanding animation, very interesting and developed characters as well as a magnificent plot, filled with many unpredictable and surprising plot twists, keeping a high level of tension from the beginning until the ending of the story. The main premise of this series was pretty attractive and very well developed, making a great use of some supernatural elements in a realistic context. The motivations and psychology of the characters are portrayed in a very convincing manner: Their complex personality's serves as the main core of the plot development, resulting in\
          \
        one of the most fascinating mystery series ever made (in my opinion).\
The animation is simply excellent: Not only the character's designs are beautifully made (Having all those designs many subtle details which are able to combine realism with the stylish characteristics from the anime aesthetic) but also has a flawless atmosphere, which captures perfectly well the overall mood of this series. The use of colors and light effects is equally brilliant, keeping a high quality level in all the episodes. The voice acting and the music are effective, complementing the greatness of the plot and the animation.\
Death Note deserved all the hype and praise that it received, being one of the most brilliant anime that I've ever watched. I highly recommend this series to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.\

    I heard many things about Death Note. Many call it the best anime ever made. \
Is it true? In my opinion yes. But what makes it so perfect?\
First of all some will maybe say that you can not create a perfect anime there will always be some little mistakes. Well this could be true. However i can not really find \"little mistakes\" in this masterpiece. The story is unique, the soundtrack perfectly fits to the anime in almost every scene. Although Death Note also contains fantasy or supernatural elements i also have to say that Death Note is kinda realistic because it clearly shows in\
          \
        many scenes the human nature and the human weakpoints. \
Some will maybe even say that Death Note has a Christian message because the main protagonist of Death Note eats from the forbidden fruit. \
Conclusion\
Death Note is the best anime ever(in my opinion) if you haven't watched it yet you better do it. It's a must see for every anime/manga fan.\

    This is one of the anime's that got a lot of attention when it was released, it started out good BUT and this is a big but the villain is a smart idiot to say the least!!\
Kira - the protagonist - thinks he is such a freaking genius and that he will be able to keep on doing what he was doing. In the end he dug his own grave without even knowing it. \
Yes the plot continuity is very good, the flow of the story is well done, except for the feeling where they just wanted to wrap up the show and kill of\
          \
        everyone. And it also feel like, for me, the characters didn't undergo any development. So character wise, not so good.\

    As one of the most recognized anime of all time, Death Note is in my opinion one of the most agreeable anime ever.\
The basic plot is as follows:\
Light Yagami, an academically outstanding High School student, is bored with life and finds faults in society while going about his daily life. By chance, he discovers a notebook that was dropped in the schoolyard titled Death Note. According to the included instructions inside the notebook, the notebook gives those who use it the power to kill people by writing their name inside while picturing their face. \
After some preliminary testing, Light decides that not only does the\
          \
        notebook work, but it could be the solution to the broken world he lives in. By ridding the world of crime, Light intends to create a new world in which people coexist peacefully and productively.\
Quality - 9\
With amazing art (8/10), sound (9/10), and story (9/10); Death Note is a quality show. Notably, both the Japanese and English voice actors/actresses are amazing fits for their roles, and the depth of the story will leave even the most dedicated viewers surprised at times. The story itself deals with morals about right versus wrong, brings to question the societal norms we have grown accustomed to, and shows human nature at its best and worst. This is likely why Death Note is considered the Most Popular Anime.\
Likability - 10\
This anime is hard to hate. Many people criticize the second half as being repetitive, boring, or a ripoff of the beginning, and while I agree the quality was noticeably lower in terms of plot, by that time I was already hooked, and found myself thankful for further resolution, quality aside. Light's character is designed to be easy to connect with, since the feelings he experiences are meant to represent the majority opinions, and the main characters are honestly unforgettable. The fantasy themes were blended effectively in the modern setting, the actions and reactions always seemed justified, and when all was said and done, I was left without confusion.\
Recommendability - 10\
Okay, so I've mentioned that I think Death Note is agreeable, and this is a good place to touch on why that is. Most anime that people like need to have an appropriate balance of plot, humor, action, mystery, and character development (be it Naruto, One Punch Man, or Fullmetal Alchemist). Death Note keeps what should honestly be a dark, depressing anime light through the use of side characters and subplots. The fact that so many scenes and quotes are well known makes it a must-see for those newer to anime, but the freshness of the characters and unique layered plot make it a good choice for anyone interested in the psychological genre.\

    To start off I'm very new to anime so take my review with a grain of salt.  I was sucked in immediately by the art and style of the show.  Along with a very interesting premise presented to us from the first episode.  The first 26 episodes were 10/10 no doubt in my mind. I kept watching episode after episode wanting to know what is going to happen next.  Then the series hits a wall and completely derailed my interest.  From 27-37 I started to care less and less about characters, I would struggle to pay attention, and the only\
          \
        reason I felt the need to watch more was to get it over with and see how it ended.  Now without spoiling this I cant say much but it died off for me.  Should have found a way to end it right after 26, not drag on for ten more episodes.  Missed the chance to be a truly amazing show start to finish.  Still loved it,  would watch the first part of the show over.  \

    Death Note is just WOW! I was just so excited when I saw the first episode of it. Light, his character, his mission, his intelligence- everything is just great! The concept of Shinigami, Death Note, and the Light's mission was just so terrifying and exciting. \
On the contrary, there is L. He is just amazing to compete with Light. His extremely weird attitude, behavior and extraordinary intelligence forces a person to see more episodes.\
It's just \"What is gonna happen? Who will win?\".\
I felt a bit bad in the middle and almost lost interest in the story. I won't tell when I felt bad because I\
          \
        guess everyone must have felt disappointed at that point. But, even after that point, I watched it and liked it too.\
The story, the characters are great. The background music is so perfect! There were some emotional scenes, where I felt a bit sad. \
The ending was a bit disappointing, it could have ended in some other better way.\

    Death note was the first anime I ever watched, and I think it was definitely a good first choice! The story is quite easy to follow- there isn't too many characters that you need to familiarise yourself with, and the story is constantly gripping, so you always want to watch more. Being an older anime, the art isn't up to par with recent anime, but nevertheless, the characters look very life like and still feature some amazing scenes, where the art shines through and really adds to the overall impact of the situation. I have watched both the sub and dub, and they are both\
          \
        equally incredible- the voice actors chosen for the roles really did a good job at perfecting the character roles. The characters are all so great- not a single character comes to mind that I hate, and they all have their own quirky personalities and ways of handling certain scenarios. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and it's a very good first anime to watch if you're not too familiar with animes in general, as it doesn't contain any Japanese humour/jokes, that you won't understand or get. Overall a 9/10 :)\

    Started watching this after finding out it was one of the most popular anime of all time, and let me say i was NOT disappointed. Right from the start, the anime was entertaining and always keeping the viewer on edge and eager for the next episode. A large amount of episodes results in a large amount of character development as we focus on the life of a genius guy called Light and his plans for a new world with the help of the Death Note. What's interesting about this Light is that he may not necessarily be wrong and while his method is flawed at\
          \
        least his motives are well. However, I myself supported the new Hitler but grew to hate all teen girls in one body, Misa Amane. It's interesting to consider who the villain is in the anime. Usually an anime villain is someone who works against the protagonist, which in this case would be L (mostly). However Light is a murderer which we mostly associate with a villain.                                            Alongside Light, there is always an overgrown dementor called Ryuk who's there to either show of Lights's intelligence or eat an apple(juicy).\
Overall the anime is quite good as you'll never know what to expect and which side your own.\

    Death Note Review:\
Hey guys!  So this is my review of Death Note, one of the most popular anime titles of all time.  Before I begin I will first say that this is a noteworthy starter kit anime for anyone showing interest in the genre.  In my view, Death Note plays as a great stepping stone for those interested in crime investigation themed shows, as well as the genre of anime as a whole.  For me personally, Death Note was not my starter kit anime staple, however, I myself have forwarded it to many of my friends, and they’ve instantly become addicted.\
          \
         I feel that as an anime fan it is important to have these types of shows, and without titles like Death Note, the anime community would not have as big of a following.  Nonetheless, I would like to give Death Note a good review of all of its pros and cons, and most certainly point out the many flaws this show has.  Although Death Note is a favorite amongst the anime community, I would also like to prove a point that this anime is not as good as people actually think it is.  By me basically saying this anime is in fact overrated, I will also say that Death Note does bring entertainment in many forms through its story and character development, and can also leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout the 37 episodes it offers.\
Story 8/10:  To provide just the basics of the story, a high schooler named Light Yagami picks up a journal with mystical powers.  By using this journal (aka the Death Note) he can write someone’s name in the journal and they will die.  To put simply, the story develops into an investigation and the best detective in the world, named L, is assigned to the case to put a stop to the powers of the Death Note.  It is essentially like Sherlock Holmes being assigned to the most unusual type of investigation, and prior to this particular assignment, \"L\" has never failed in solving an investigation.  To end this brief synopsis, I will say that this story progression is very fluid and easy to follow.  By episode 1 or 2 you will more than likely be hooked into watching the rest of the series to see what happens.  To my prior point of saying that this is a great starter kit anime, the first 12 episodes should be enough to prove why.  The various situations involving the Death Note and the investigators have the story being turned on it’s head on numerous occasions, and a lot of times will have you in shock at what the hell happened.  Cliffhangers toward the end of episodes are initiated on a regular basis, along with unexpected twists in the story, especially with the main character Light.  As a person who has already seen the show, it is easy to analyze the story progression and the ethics behind having the Death Note.  This anime really makes you analyze the main character Light in his current situation, and makes you ponder about a scenario where if you had the journal what would you do with it?  Through its 2 arcs in the story line, the progression is easy to monitor and maintains consistency throughout the show, which is why I believe its story line is solid.  \
Art 7/10:  The art in this show is a little darker than what I am normally used to in the typical animes’ I usually watch.  By no means is anything pretty or outstanding in this anime in terms of its artwork.  The art really does however have a positive effect on the show as a whole, in terms of having a dark contrast; considering the show itself can be pretty obscure.  I can’t necessarily criticize the artwork in this anime, since it particularly suits the show well, yet It does take some getting used too if you’re unaware of the dark types of animes that are out there.   Not too many complaints from my end on this category.\
Sound 6/10: How can I describe the sound in this anime.  If I could put it in two words, \"incredibly average,\" would seem to fit the description.  Although the investigation and crime solving scenes throughout the show are very good, I will mostly complain about Death Note’s intros and ending for this show.   Like most of my reviews, I remain consistent on the notion that I love my anime intros and endings.  They get me ready for the show, and Death Note is probably the worst show I have ever seen in terms of music.   Literally, all intros and all endings are terrible.  I never once felt relaxed, interested, or even excited to watch this show from its intros, nor was I satisfied with the ending compositions.  To be honest, the one intro to Death Note around the 28 episode mark is death metal sounding, which you would think fit right into the transition of the show starting; sure enough it really made me feel like my ears would start bleeding.  Personally, the beginnings and endings to Death Note were not my favorite; luckily, the 20ish minutes outside the intros and endings  to the story arcs did a good job with the audio, and made the case study of the death note have an eerie feel to it.  I would say overall, that the sound to this show is average at best, although it does a decent job of keeping a good vibe throughout the investigation.\
Character 8/10:  The characters in Death Note, like in many anime, are what make it a solid show.  I think I can speak for everyone when I say this, characters can make or break the story and overall interest towards a show.  That is especially true for Death Note.  The first story arc focuses particularly on Light, Reyuk (The Shinygami), and the internal investigators including \"L\".  There are many outside actors of course like Lights family and other agents that I won’t mention because it will spoil the enjoyment.  Anyway, the first story arc of Death Note, and the character development is pretty awesome.  Although I hate Light Yagami as a character for ethical and moral reasons (which you will discover), I will praise the writers for really thinking outside the box in terms of what the characters would look like, and how they would be perceived by the viewer (Especially L).  You’ll laugh when you finally meet L, because it isn’t anything you would expect a master investigator to look like, which of course makes it all the more entertaining.  The show in my eye really tethered off after a few episodes in the second story arc of the show.  At the time when I was watching, I grew bored at times and I felt I wasn’t as motivated to watch the second arc as I was the first.  Fortunately, I did finish the show and am currently watching it a second time now, and quite truthfully more engaged in what is happening to the characters.  Ultimately, the characters in this show are portrayed well by the writers, and if you’re going to give the show the credit it deserves, it is easy to pick this category as its strongest selling point.  \
Enjoyment 7/10:  Like I said above, I enjoyed Death Note’s first story arc moreso than its second story arc, which is mostly why I am giving this category a lower rating.  As much as I enjoyed the first story arc, which I would likely give an 8.5/9 out of 10, the rest of the shows build up I believe lacked particular flare to it than its earlier episodes.  Nonetheless, I still managed to enjoy the show beginning to end, and although it was tough for me to power through the second arc, I gained a more appreciative attitude towards the show once I finished.  \
Overall 7/10:  With overall ratings and Death Note’s quality in mind, I would like to be a little more specific instead of a general rating of a 7, but on my own rating scale put this anime at a 7.7 ish.  The overall show is fantastic for anyone in the works of becoming an anime fan, and is a perfect start to the shows the genre provides.  To me, this is not a personal favorite of mine, however it does just enough for me to maintain a respectful appreciation for it.  My gratitude for it quite specifically stems from the fact that it remains one of the household anime titles today, and it serves as a starting line for those who have the desire to watch the many phenomenal shows the anime genre provides.  As I repeat myself, this is a great show to inform your friends, and even family about (I even had my Mom watch it lol).  This show is what they call a gateway drug/anime to shoot you off into the fray of many other prestigious titles.  Without series like Death Note, followers can’t gain interest into newer animes’ that become released, which is why I like to label it as a starter kit anime.  You can add this anime as well as Full Metal Alchemist as the big shows to make sure to watch, because they will elevate you into titles you may or may not have heard before.  Hopefully you give Death Note a shot, and like I said in my review of Code Geass, this is a bucket list show even if you’re not an anime fan.   All in all, this is a good show, and although I believe the community overblows its quality, it is definitely a show worth talking about.     \

    ***SPOILER WARNING***\
For the first 2/3 of the series, I really enjoyed this show. I've put it on hold because Light has become a complete prick, and I can no longer enjoy watching him do his petty egotistical manipulations of the people who care about him. He's become shallower and more selfish with each episode since L died, and I have better things to do than watch Light masturbate (metaphorically) to his image of himself. The writers of this story started off building a cathedral and then took a big dump on it.\
What began as a great examination of ethics vs. morals has turned into a\

    This is a superb anime, there's no doubt about that.  The stats don't lie.  It's popular for a reason.  It isn't perfect, however.  There was one issue in the storyline that I couldn't reconcile myself with.  If you think like I do, it might just ruin everything for you.  Allow me to explain.\
Imagine you have the power to kill people just by looking at them.  Fed up with certain individuals in your life, you decide to take two of them out with a fatal glance.  What would happen next?  Nothing!  The police would never suspect\
          \
        you.  And even if they did, what could they do?  They'd never prove it.  Even asking you about it would be humiliating.  \"I have reason to believe you've been murdering people using special magic eyes.\"  You'd just grimace at them as if they were insane; at which point they'd wander off feeling silly.  End of story.  Well, the same scenario applies to what happens in Death Note.  Someone writes names in a book and they dropping down dead.  Nobody would ever suspect him and they'd certainly never convict him in a court of law with such a silly accusation.  And this is where the show failed for me.  It was 37 episodes of unnecessary investigation.  All the main character had to do was deny everything then keep doing it.  Nobody would ever have suspected that notes in a book were the murder weapon.  I had difficulty getting past that fact.  The whole anime was based on the main guy trying to disprove something nobody would ever be able to prove anyway.  \
Other than this nagging problem, the show was really good, it has to be said.  The police were a bit too meek but beyond that the characterisation was superb and the story-telling was intense.  You just have to get past the fact that the story itself was built on a seriously weak premise.\

    The anime is beautifully written, beautifully animated and just plain beautiful. It isn't often that you see an anime solely about the battle of two minds. It is also very interesting to see two different viewpoints of people trying to achieve the same thing. In this case, it is justice.\
The animation and production itself was also worthy of praise. The music is very beneficial to the scenes because it creates that suspense that is needed in shows like this.\
The characters in Death Note each had their own complexity (maybe besides Misa but she wasn't really taken seriously by anyone). Having both the protagonist and antagonist\
          \
        be geniuses on relatively equal grounds created such an interesting dynamic between their characters. As well as this, the side characters commonly would have similar motives as the two main characters, but to a lesser extent and they would aim to achieve this in their own way. I believe this is really what the characters represent. Many different people trying to obtain the same goal through different means.\
I absolutely loved Death Note and would recommend it to anyone who is looking into stories that go beyond the normal battles of brawn and for those who want a more complex protagonist and antagonist.\

    Death Note is one of the most iconic psychological anime. Though not flawless in any way, it is indeed entertaining to say the least. The characters in this series are either hit or miss. Most of the supporting characters are just like recycled paper, and a little too much time was spent on them, especially when they were usually just tossed away shorty after they received a tiny bit of depth. The art is downgraded from the manga in almost every way. The dark undertone from the manga was completely butchered for a more shaded appearance. The soundtrack is wonderful with fitting music and above\
          \
        average openings. However, this series just drags on and on after episode 26 with useless characters taking the spotlight for no reason and wasted plot points. However, it is a fairly enjoyable ride. The main character changes in a very extreme manner after the first few episodes. We get to see his goals develop into something stronger. His main opposition is similar for the most part, receiving much depth along the way. Overall, Death Note is a good watch for anybody interested in this psychological genre.\

    I avoided this anime for several years because I was worried it would be too dark for me. However, as I got older the more I heard about how great it was, and I decided to give it a shot. \
And, wow, I was not disappointed.\
Death Note is a truly interesting and engaging anime that asks some of humanity's most unanswerable questions. Who decides what is right, and how do we as human beings make that choice? What makes a person good or evil? Is there even such a thing as that kind of black and white concept in this world?\
I'm not sure, but Death\
          \
        Note certainly made me think about it. The main protagonist, Light, is not exactly your average hero. In fact, one could argue that, while the main character, he was more of a villain than a hero. While I could sympathize with some of his ideas, ambitious genius quickly changed and grew more corrupt as he continued to kill people with the Death Note. He was selfish and cruel, and while he may or may not have truly thought of humanity's best interest in the beginning, he ultimately proved that he didn't care about much of anything or anyone but achieving his goals and playing God. It was quite tragic.\
That said, Light was a very well-written character and I enjoyed watching him, even if I wouldn't want to meet such a person in real life. I liked some of the other characters too, such as Light's father, who always kept on the path of justice, and Matsuda, a younger member of the police force with good intentions but a habit of klutzy behavior. I wasn't a huge fan of Light's \"love interest\" Misa, but it wasn't as much that I thought she was a bad character as much as the fact that there are few women in Death Note and Misa came off to me as the type of character who gives all women a bad reputation. I did feel a little sorry for her though, since she really did love Light despite that she was so blinded by it that she couldn't see his true intentions.\
On the other hand, the one other character who really stood out to me was the antagonist, L. L is the world's greatest detective, and the force that works against Light for the majority of the series to try to catch the one responsible for the Death Note killings. Although he isn't exactly a saint himself, I think he is my favorite character mainly because of his quirky personality and his little habits that become apparent as you watch him. His relationship to Light is particularly engaging, and perhaps the best part of the show, as they play cat and mouse trying to bring the other down.\
Some people think the show goes downhill after a certain character death two thirds of the way through the show, but I enjoyed the last part of the series. Some new characters were introduced, and at first I couldn't decide how I felt about them, but overall my interest stuck and I was every bit as satisfied by the ending as I was saddened and slightly disturbed by it.\
All in all, Death Note is a wonderful anime that I would recommend to anyone, even non-anime fans!\

    How do you define a better world?\
What is a world without crime?\
What makes a world rotten?\
Watching Death Note pretty much makes you question the depths of these philosophical questions. Moreover, coming from the point of view of evil protagonist/antagonist Yagami Light--the handsome, most intelligent (but not so intelligent as he is taken over by greed)--18-year-old that wanted a better world by vanquishing all criminals. It took me a horde of anime to reconsider whether the author (Ohba; as Obata is the artist) got ourselves a protagonist 'and' antagonist. Because in the end, no matter how you put it, people will want to be on Team\
          \
        L's side (and I was in denial)--because his ideologies are much practical and best fits humanity. Light wanted to be a god that wanted to dominated the world, that was just it...or how I captured him in his red eyes and evil snares and smug faces in the dark. \
He killed his 'best friend' (or what could be)--L. Mercilessly. He could have killed his younger sister. And, he killed his own father. \
He should be the worst person on earth, deserved to be in Hell, but he made it look like he 'was' the Devil: a beautiful manipulative devil that got what he wanted. Killing all the angels (the ones who've pursued him).\
The author, Ohba, is very wicked and powerful with this psychological thriller. It was brutality of the mind. And the characters are really compelling. From Light to L and to his successors, and to the women who are (*coughs*) addictive to Light's charm and will do everything to help him win, they all add up to make Ohba's art one dark masterpiece. You will sometimes wonder what did life did to him that he brought us this lavishing darkness: beautiful, it speaks of us--telling us the real horrors of human kind. \
We are greed and justice. We almost have no empathy; but we sometimes care about ourselves only. We are love and tactics. We are bloodlust and many other gory things once things go down the shittiest way possible, and, bam! That's us humans. Yep, we're just passing by.\
I enjoyed the music overall. Since the first episode, it's the thing that doesn't get out of me--the 10/10 score. It's rock and roll, it has a choir that sings for the gods (Requiem, Kyrie, etc.). It will sing you a funeral song when you're dead.\
I also love Mello and L. Period. And Misa deserved more. Women shouldn't in any way, be portrayed as objects to be thrown away once useless. So the only element of the anime that doesn't make it perfect is, it is sexist. But, doesn't really change anything now really. So I gave it a nine because I'm really more on the story. The next review I made, Bakuman, had deductions because of the author's 'blindness' (?) towards misogyny or sexism. \
Also, it is nine because I thought it lacked another tiny thing: a heart. \

    Okay so Death Note is definitely one of the best anime series of all time. Is unique and very compelling. It- i dont know how to describe it- is different. \
 The plot seems simple but theres so much more to it. Theres a lot of layers to it and definetly had alot of thought put into it. The music is great although by the second season it ia a bit lacking. The characters are AMAZING! they are super well thought out and detailed.I guess you can credit this to the author, its a battle of smarts and wits, and the main characters came up\
          \
        with unthinkable plans and schemes. L is mysterious and a true genius, credited with the best detective in Japan but Yagami Light rivals him. It is defenitly a unique idea, the death note and brings a serious fight of wits, and it is just amazingly planned out. Yes this applies to the manga, and the anime strays a bit but is very well done with detail and voicing. (I hate dub, but this is one of the few good dubs out there!) I do feel like Light could have been better and the ending could have been different, but overall its very well done!\
So i totally recommened this!\

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\
Death Note. OOOOH I want to give this a 10. I truly do. This is the show that got me into anime. It started off so beautiful. However, about half way through, it took a turn for the worse.\
Art- 9\
Not much to say here. Very solid art style with good use of lighting and changing colors.\
Sound- 8\
Again, not much to say here. Had a good soundtrack that was used at fitting times. I especially loved the first opening.\
Character- 8 (Spoiler)\
It had some original characters, and characters that have been done many times but still feel fresh. You have the main protagonist/antagonist (depending\
          \
        on you you ask) Light. He's a student who finds a book that allows him to kill whoever he wants- basically making him god. His main rival is L. He is a genius who works to discover his identity. These 2 are great and have many excellent supports, but I can't bring myself to give it a 10. This is due to the fact that L is eventually replaced after his death about half way through by a truly boring and childish character named Near. There's honestly not much else to say about Near, but he is part of what ruins this show.\
Story- 4 (Spoiler (Duh))\
This show started truly incredibly. It was suspenseful and you couldn't wait to learn what would happen next. However, at the moment of L's death, it all goes to shit. Boom. Done. Nothing else to say. One of the best plots and premises I've ever seen in an anime. Down the drain. Ruined. Next.\
Enjoyment- 7\
I consider enjoyment to really depend on the characters, art and story. Because of this, I have to give it this score. My enjoyment of the series can really be determined through the previous parts.\
Overall- 7\
What started as a great show eventually wrecked itself. GG.\

    Death Note is what I would say very mysterious, you'd never know when or what will happen, who will survive or who will die? This is one of the best anime ever made especially considering that the anime series started in 2006. I would definitely recommend this but don't expect everything to turn out good. Death Note has a lot of characters such as Light Yagami whom has a strong sense of justice. I love the story and its has very clever plot. The sad thing is that i wished that they would try to extend the series but overall I rate it 8/10 (\
          \
        Very Good )\

    *Possible Spoilers Ahead*\
Things I liked about this anime:\
Light makes for an amazing protagonist, like something out of shakespeare (I'm not exaggerating either, watch the dang show), and L is a superb antagonist. In fact, the story for the most part is amazing! The soundtrack is memorable, as the # number of listens on my iTunes shows. From episodes 1-27, I was well invested, and the whole season concluded beautifully. \
As for the second season, I didn't like it as much, but Light's monologue near the end is one of my favourite monologues of all time. If I were a man, this would be the monologue\
          \
        I'd do for auditions. It's that good.\
The dub is also really good, and if you're like me who tries to prioritize dubs over subs so that you're not forced into always reading the subtitles so you can properly watch the show, I'd certainly recommend it over subs.\
Did I mention this was my first real manga/anime? (Outside of 4kids dubbed anime, and that horrid Inuyasha anime, but that's for another day) I mean I may not view Death Note with as much awe as I did when I first read/watched it, but this is where it all began for me, into my decent as anime trash.\
With that said, there's reasons why I don't have it at 10.\
Things I didn't like about this anime:\
The second season had some things going for it, Mello was cool, Mikami's a ham and cheese platter, and I liked seeing the downward spiral of some of the characters. I am NOT A FAN OF N however, simply because he seemed too perfect. Every clue was handed to him basically, and I never got a sense of character from him. I admit part of that comes the nature of the events of the season 1 ending, and that Light's plan didn't take into account the possibilities of heirs, but still, it never felt like N was really challenged. Nearly everything seemed obvious to him.\
But for those who think I'm being blindsided by the awesomeness that was season 1, don't worry- this next issue was around since episode 1.\
The poor views on women. \
While not as bad as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Naruto or pretty much any anime where fan-service is king, I was surprised during my most recent viewing to see that women were either victims or portrayed as catty bitches bickering over Light.\
Misa was wasted as a character. They made her start on such a high note, to the point where while I heard fans hated her, I couldn't see why.\
And then she loses all intelligence once she meets Light. And NEVER GETS IT BACK. Sorry Misa, but I'm with the fans here.\
The only female character who doesn't go through any of this bullshit is Rem, and I can give some credit on how they handled her during the end of season 1.\
With all that said, due to the amazingness of everything else, I am willing to forgive its flaws and round my rating of 8.5 to a 9 for rating purposes. \
Conclusion: A must watch, dubbed or subbed is fine.\
PS: If you're like me and thought Naomi Misora was wasted as a character, there's always Death Note: Another Note...\

    Ah, my absolute favourite anime of all time, Death Note. And boy, is there a furious discussion going on about the value of this anime, even a decade after it was released. I will carefully try to explain why I think this anime deserves the highest score I can give.\
The premise and story should be known to almost anyone in the anime universe, and it's even somewhat popular outside of the anime medium. This popularity doesn't come from nowhere, it is genuinely the most interesting premise I've ever seen in an anime. It is so simple, yet so intriguing. The power to kill by writing\
          \
        a name in a notebook, and what to do with a power like that. What a wonderful idea, which piqued the interest of so many.\
Where the anime takes this premise is even more impressive. Rather than having a main character who decides he will use it for personal gain, he takes on the roll of a god, someone who can pass judgement on the unworthy. The story dares to venture into the discussion about when death is just, and if a world can improve if the 'rotten apples' die.\
Furthermore, the characters in this show are all unique and interesting, with our main character having a direct rival, creating confrontations between two highly skilled intellectuals. This show barely has any 'direct' action, yet it manages to create the most suspenseful, the most tense and pulse-pounding scenes.\
The art was something which originally turned me off, but after I got into the show, I started to see the beauty in it more and more. It fits the grim tone of the anime perfectly, improving it all the more. In other anime I would've disliked it, in this anime, it improved my experience. This combined with one of the best soundtracks, that, again, fits the theme perfectly, makes this one of the best experiences ever.\
There will always be people that disagree, but this anime has hit me on an emotional level. So much so, that I still use it as reference material for situations I encounter in life. It perfectly describes the borderline of justice and death, and will therefore most likely stay my favourite anime for the foreseeable future.\

    This is my first review so I thought I should write about the anime that ranks no 1 till date(and I have watched a lot of anime)\
You may feel after reading the above plot that oh its supernatural so lets skip it /or I want something more realistic but that is where you are wrong.\
this anime is a complete package highlighting on mystery and battle of wits but also gives you a considerable amount of comedy with L(MY ROLEMODEL) and RYUK ,romance with misa amane \
BUT the driving factor is how well u can relate with both light as well as L\
and you yourself think\
          \
        which is right and many times wish that both should come together and win the world. AT each time you also make choices which the characters make and mostly your choices match which makes you feel that you are actually a character(light or l as the case maybe) and not just a 3rd person.\
the story is fast paced so if any of you are thinking to open death note episode list in Wikipedia and only watch select episodes then I strictly disagree\
You cannot just skip even 1 episode of this anime\
the sound also gives the anime a boom impact\
finally\
I BET JUST WATCH 2 EPISODES AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED\
I ALSO RECOMMEND WATCHING WITH HEADSET/EARPHONE (IT TAKES THE ANIME TO ANOTHER LEVEL)",

    A must watch anime. For those who like magical and fantastic anime, Death Note is a good option to those who like smart turns in the plot and realistic atmospheres. To tell the truth, Death Note is a fairy tale - or even an old Greek tale, of the kind you already know how it will end (you learn quite in the beginning that the apple-lover Shinigami Ryuk will be responsible, to a certain extent, for the death of the main character, Killer...). And yet it is worthy to watch what happens in the in-between.\
The anime has three phases. A short one before the appearence\
          \
        of the best detective ever - L; a second one, the best, the Killer-L dispute (you MUST see this) and a third one, which we can call resolution.\
It is smart, dark, and raises some nice ethical questions to the table. Just watch it and fall in love with L (maybe with Ryuk too).\

    At first, I wasn't interested watching this anime just because I think this one's really overrated by viewers. Yet, once I started watching the first and second episode of this anime, I was really into this show. The story was amazing and very addicting. \
The first part of the anime introduces to us the abilities of the main character (Kira) who can kill a person by only writing his/her name on his notebook. It was simple, but gets more and more enthralling once they introduce a couple of new characters that puts the show unstoppable. \
I really like how the author creates Kira, as he\
          \
        is probably the smartest person in Japan, thus he thinks himself as a Deity that no one should dare to oppose him. The conflicts within him and all the good stuffs later in the anime makes this show the one you can't miss.\
Overall, I rated this anime 9 out of 10. The soundtrack, characters, and plot was amazing. Only the art though it is still good, I feel like it needs a little more touch yet it gives the dark and gloomy theme which is really appropriate to the anime.\

    Before I write this review of Death Note I want to state that this is completely my own personal opinion and that you may agree or disagree.\
Review:\
Death Note was an fun anime to watch and is revered as one of the best anime out there to date. No anime is out there that doesn't have it's flaws. Intro I think both intros fit the anime well and the animation as well. Character wise the MC is annoying at times and I grew to dislike him. Side characters are were this anime hits it's strong points. L the lead investigator of Death Note who is trying\
          \
        to catch our MC. L is my favorite character of this show because he is a genius and puts our MC in a pinch. Plot wise I personally think it's not the best. The reason I put an eight was because it is unique. The beginning plot is very good but the later arcs of the anime got too complicated and it shouldn't have gotten so out of hand. All in All Death Note is very unique and you should defiantly check it out if you have the time.\

When I saw the first episodes of Death Note, I thought it was\
simplez and such, but after I will realize that the anime is quite complex, because of the Death Note rules, the first episodes of death note were simply legendary, for he was a young anime style, with indirect battles and using strategy and the fact that the two protagonists were on opposite sides, but we can not tell which side was the good or evil because both have goals that benefit the world, more like the course of the episodes (ep 15 -), the anime gets boring and tiring to\
          \
        watch, the new characters did not compare to the old, and also the things happened from nothing without strategic framework and the fact that Kira will lose their humanity in the series, so we can tell which side was the good or evil, and also had a very bad end, because I've deduced that it would happen, then the end did not surprise me at all.\
With regard to art and sound, I found good animation, the only openings and endigs that were paid to 1, because the second opening and endigs was crap and the voice acting to get cool.\
Because of animes have few characters, each has its different personality, but I found the new characters ep 15-37 a little chatinhos.não had unique personalities that not the first episódios.Meu preferred personagen is the same L.pois Kira knowing who the L, had two death notes, and used several people, the L was more clever and was always one step ahead of Kira.\
The first episodes of the anime are very good, the person would be addicted assitsindo this episode, but then I get very boring and the people lose the taste easily\

Quando eu vi os primeiros episódios de Death Note,eu achava que era \
simplez e tal,mais depois eu vo percebendo que o anime é bastante complexo,por causa das regras do Death Note,os primeiros episódios de death note eram simplesmente míticos,por que era um estilo de anime novo,com batalhas indiretas e usando a estrategia e também pelo fato que os dois protagonistas,eram de lados opostos,porém nós não podemos distinguir qual do lado era do bem ou do mal pois ambos teriam objetivos que beneficiam o mundo,mais como o decorrer dos episódios(ep 15-),o anime vai ficando chato e cansativo de assistir,os personagens novos não se comparavam ao antigo,e também as coisas aconteciam do nada sem esquema estratégico e também pelo fato que o Kira vai perdendo sua humanidade na série,então podemos distinguir qual dos lados era do bem ou do mal,e também teve um final muito ruim,pelo fato que eu já deduzia que aquilo iria acontecer,então o final não me surpreendeu nada.\
Com relação a arte e o som,eu achei bom a animação,as únicas aberturas e endigs que prestaram foram a 1,porque as 2 abertura e endigs ficou uma bosta e a dublagem  fico até legal.\
Pelo fato dos animes terem poucos personagens,cada um deles tem sua personalidade diferente,porém eu achei os novos personagens do ep 15-37 um pouco chatinhos.não tinham personalidades únicas que nem nos primeiros episódios.Meu personagem preferido é o L,pois mesmo o Kira sabendo quem era o L,tinha dois death notes,e usou várias pessoas,o L era mais inteligente e sempre estava um passo a frente do Kira.\
Os primeiros episódios do anime são muito bons,a pessoa ficaria viciada assitsindo esse episódios,porém depois fico muito chato e a pessoas perderia o gosto facilmente",

    Opening Information\
A chronically bored Shinigami (God of Death) intentionally drops a \"Death Note\" in the human world. The notebook is found and kept by Light Yagami, an extremely prideful boy but an excellent student. He quickly discovers that if you write a person's name in the Death Note while picturing their face, the person will die of a heart attack. Light sets out to make the world a better place by killing dangerous criminals whose names are publicly broadcast. Not everyone agrees with Light's sense of justice, however. The mysterious world-class detective known as L considers the increasing criminal deaths to be cases of murder.\
          \
        L and a small team of Japanese police try to discover the miracle-killer's identity. An intense psychological war begins between the two main minds of the series: Light Yagami and the eccentric detective L.  \
Production and Acclaim \
Death Note was extremely popular in its day and many fans now consider it an anime classic on par with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Revolutionary Girl Utena. Almost 750,000 users on myanimelist.net rated Death Note for an average of 8.71 out of 10. On IMDb, over 120,000 users rated the series for an average of 9 out of 10. The website Anime News Network listed Death Note as number two on the list of Top 10 Most Popular anime series. The Japanese website mantan-web.jp reports that over 30 million copies of the Death Note manga have been printed. Death Note started out as a manga written by Tsugumi Ohba and drawn by Takeshi Obata, who also worked together on the fairly popular manga Bakuman. The anime adaptation was created by studio Madhouse and directed by Tetsuro Araki, who was involved in directing many other anime and was the series director for Aoi Bungaku Series, High School of the Dead, and Attack on Titan. The thirty-seven episode anime aired in the U.S. once a week from October 2007 to July 2008. \
Genre/ Attitude\
Although Death Note could fit into several genres including supernatural, suspense, and crime drama, it is widely hailed as a psychological thriller. Within the psychological genre, it's common to see anti-heroes as protagonists, villains equally matched with heroes, tension, conflict, quick pacing, and plots where the fate of the world is at stake. Dark themes are often present, but characters \"battle\" with their wits more than with physical strength, magical abilities, or weapons. The mind-states of the characters are often more important, in this genre, than the execution of actual plot events. However, as with any type of thriller, the story should still be exciting. Perhaps most importantly, a psychological thriller is designed to make viewers think. I almost consider Death Note the standard against which to measure other psychological-genre anime. \
Art: Style, Techniques, and Characters \
Studio Madhouse created many works including the popular series Hunter x Hunter, One Punch Man, Hellsing Ultimate, Tokyo Ghoul, and No Game No Life. Some of my personal favorite Madhouse anime are Monster, Paranoia Agent, Parasyte: The Maxim, and the film Wolf Children. The animation style in Death Note is fairly \"mature,\" rather than \"cute,\" much more realistic than anime of its day, and less vivid and colorful compared to anime of today. Viewers might love or hate the style; it's completely up to personal preference. However, even if you dislike the style, you'll have to admit that the animators did a great job bringing it to life. \
You may notice that the art in Death Note uses some excellent cinematics. Often, the mood, lighting, and color of a scene are reflective of Light's thoughts and feelings. A ray of sunlight sometimes appears, for example, when he has an idea or becomes inspired. Coloring may be dimmer when he is bored in the first few episodes. Background images and dialogue will be more negative when Light is thinking of the corruption of the world. Another tool used is the animation for when Light and L are thinking hard or battling each other’s' wits. The background goes dark, and the hair and eyes of the characters become brightly colorful. Light's hair and eyes turn red while L's color is blue. The first time this technique is used is in episode nine at the University entrance ceremony. \
Death Note sometimes uses dramatic contrast in scenes, like in episode three. Over a span of 45 seconds, the scene keeps switching between images of dying criminals and images of Light happily going about his school day. The contrast between the dark scenes and Light's happy scenes clearly gives the idea to viewers that something just isn't right. I also want to note that Death Note isn't \"boring\" with its character designs. Light and most of the police and detectives may have very similar, somewhat bland designs, but other characters are stunning in their originality, all the more so thanks to the \"standard\" set by Light. The character animation for L, for example, is unforgettable; his design is part of what made him such an iconic character in 2000s anime. Misa deviates from the standard even more than L with her beautiful blond hair, thin, petite body, large eyes, and \"sexy\" outfits. The designs for the Shinigami never cease to amaze me, containing just the right amount of creepiness. \
Sound: Voice Acting, Songs, and Scores \
I can't say enough about the voice acting in Death Note. The extremely talented seiyuu Mamoru Miyano plays Light Yagami. He is rarely typecast, playing such variable roles as Okabe in Steins;Gate, Kiba in Wolf's Rain, Tamaki in Ouran High School Host Club, Dazai in Bungou Stray dogs, and Tsukiyama in Tokyo Ghoul. Miyano is able to play both villains and charming young men, and Light, of course, can be said to be both.  L's seiyuu, Kappei Yamaguchi, has almost 300 acting credits on IMDb and does an excellent job portraying the frank, intelligent, and emotionally distant L. Keiji Fujiwara, who plays the side character police detective Aizawa, is one of my personal favorite seiyuu largely due to his role as Axel in the Kingdom Hearts series (Japanese version). Maaya Sakamoto, voice of Miss Takano in later episodes, is another talented favorite. If you're familiar with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiyah, note that Haruhi and Misa Amane have the same seiyuu, Aya Hirano. \
 Surprisingly, when I say I love the voice acting, I'm not only talking about the original Japanese version. Death Note is one of the extremely rare anime whose English Dub I can sit through and take seriously. Since many of the most important lines in Death Note are \"thoughts\" rather than characters' animated words, it was possible to deliver the best translation without worrying about matching words to lips. Naturally, it's not all perfect—you may have heard of the disaster of the English voice actor's \"potato chip\" line—but it's far better than most dubs. I think the voice actor who takes the cake is unmistakably Alessandro Juliani, the English voice of L, who played the part perfectly. \
In addition to the voice acting, I absolutely love the music in Death Note. I was not particularly impressed with either of the two opening themes, but the first ending theme, \"Alumina\" by Nightmare, quickly became a favorite of mine. The three original soundtracks for the anime were composed by Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Tanuichi. Death Note would not be Death Note without its unforgettable, dramatic music. There is a variety of style from melodies of soft electric guitar and piano, to fast piano and percussion, and to violin and cello with some Latin operatic vocals. \
Popular tracks from Death Note OST 1 are \"Low of Solipsism,\" used when Kira is killing people, the mysterious and thoughtful \"Light's theme,\" and the exciting and interesting \"L's theme.\" Death Note OST 2 features the score, \"Himitsu\" (meaning secret), which plays frequently in the anime and has a powerful element of mystery and cunning. The themes for Near and Mello appear in the third OST. I love practically all the music used in Death Note, and overall my favorite is Light's theme. At the moment, however, my favorite is the score \"Rem,\" the theme of one of the most underrated and misunderstood characters in the Death Note series. It is a sad, thoughtful piece that also gives the theme of being driven by some power under the surface; it is perfect for Shinigami Rem. \
Characters: Main and Side\
As with many psychological anime, the main focus is on the minds of the two lead characters and their similarities and differences as each comes to know the mind of the other. Light and L are our two stars, and the series did an excellent job of writing and designing them. Light shows the symptoms of a narcissist and a \"socially acceptable sociopath,\" who believes his own values are absolute, uses people as tools while appearing charming and successful in society, and having an incredible scheming and problem-solving mind and intellect. His seeming perfection from the outside is contrasted with his childish trait of not being able to tolerate losing, and the sad trait of never being able to love others.\
 L is similar: highly self-confidence, driven by a sense of justice, obsessed with mind games, and in some ways, a bit childish. However, while Light exemplifies sociopathic traits of social popularity, charm, and manipulation, L is socially withdrawn, frank to the point of being rude, and otherwise careless of social norms. Though both Light and L believe in \"justice,\" Light's definition is his subjective will, while L believes in the power of existing criminal justice systems. Fans usually love both L and Light because of their similarities, but they will still usually pick one or the other as the favorite, depending on the values and perceptions of the fans.  \
All of the characters in Death Note are memorable, in my opinion, and even though L and Light are the main focus, plenty of other characters get their own time in the spotlight and some great development. While Misa is not a particularly popular character (because she's just plain annoying), she is essential to the story, and realistic (there are many girls who think like her). She is also interesting if you consider what changes in her admiration after she loses her memories, and the love she holds onto throughout several experiences of memory loss. Nobody can forget the characters of Ryuuk, our bored and goofy Shinigami, Soichiro Yagami, our consistently morally upstanding police detective, and Matsuda, our brash and sometimes airheaded young detective. \
A good number of fans dislike Near and Mello, but I find them interesting and unique, and they are best understood and appreciated if you can refrain from comparing everything about them to L. Despite his great intellect and scheming ability not too far below that of Light, Mello is a far more human character, with the struggles of a teenager such as jealousy, rivalry, impatience, and stubborn pride. Near is fascinating to me considering that he lacks the drive of justice seen in L, but still has the brains and motivation to go against Light. His reasons may never be entirely understood. Near also shows even less emotion than Light or L, also putting him in the running for a \"socially acceptable sociopath.\" Also keep in mind that Near and Mello only receive half the number of episodes' time compared to L and Light, so naturally there may be gaps in their character development. \
Story: Structure and Themes\
The story of Death Note is, in my opinion, a classic, and while many fans dislike its conclusion, they still love the first two-thirds of the series. Pacing is always excellent in Death Note, never so fast that viewers become lost, and never wasting time with fillers and superfluous information. Its fast pace is what makes the series a thriller. Death Note is well suited for a serial episode format or a chapter novel format where each episode builds on the last and it's difficult to categorize episodes into specific \"arcs.\" This makes for a story that flows well. The major plot points are Light and L facing off in episode 2, Light and L getting to the point of meeting each other in episodes 8-10, Misa's capture and resulting events in episodes 15-17, the victory of Kira in episode 25, and the finale in episodes 36-37. It is possible, therefore, to think of Death Note as having four books: 1-8, 9-16, 17-25, and 26-37. As a writer, I just wanted to mention that unique story structure. \
There are many themes in Death Note, including corruption, power, death, crime and criminal justice systems, narcissism, pride, identity, \"sin,\" family, bullying, sacrifice, rivalries, relationships, revenge, \"karma,\" games, loss, peoples' thoughts in private versus in public, changing the world, definitions of good and evil, the nature of humans, and the various philosophies of individual characters. So many topics come up for discussion in Death Note that a whole book (or more) could be written about them. This is truly a thought-provoking anime, especially if you are new to the psychological genre.     \
Enjoyment \
When I give my overall rating on an anime, the most important factor for me is personal enjoyment. That's because I'm more of a consumer than a critic at heart. Death Note holds a special place in my heart as the first anime I ever watched all the way through. I enjoyed every bit of it and agree with fans that consider it a classic of 2000s anime. Because I'm such a fan of everything Death Note, it's hard to pick out specific things I liked about the series; I liked it all. For the purposes of a good review, however, I will note a few things. \
I liked the inclusion of the supernatural element: information about the habits and evolution of Shinigami and their alternate world in the mythos of Death Note. I'm a bit of an L fan girl (or was as a teenager) so naturally I find his odd habits adorable, such as his posture and his love of sweets. I can empathize with Misa to a certain degree because in the past I have been about equally obsessive over a lover, and I know how easy it is to fall apart and let your identity become wrapped up in another person. I love the protectiveness and \"love\" that Rem has for Misa. I hated Mello at first, but became thoroughly impressed with him thanks to what he did in the very end to help Near. Most of all, I love the timeless debate over the cycle of violence, and whether it's justifiable to kill criminals. \
If you're looking for a classic 2000s anime whose popularity lives on even a decade later, look no further than Death Note. ",

It would have gotten a 10, if not for the second half of the overall story. The moment Near and Mellow enter the show, it goes to shit. It feels weird to have them, doing their thing and the ending has ruined my love for the overall series.

    One of the best cat and mouse mystery shows of all time, not just in the anime world but just in general. This I put down to it's fantastic yet simple central concept of a magical notebook containing the power to kill whomever's name is written within it. Such a deadly and untraceable killing weapon creates the toughest mystery for the character of L, the best detective in the world. What follows is a thrilling game of wits between Light Yagami, a genius with a God complex, and L, an unassuming man with a brilliant detective mind. \
Having two characters with genius level intellects outwit\
          \
        each other again and again makes this show incredibly addictive to watch, as the viewer is left to work out just how (or if) L or Light will react to his opponents last move in this real life game of chess.\
Something I appreciate in this series is that there is no real antagonist or hero, you can choose who you are going to get behind and want to see defeat the other. Do you support Light's use of the notebook to try and wipe out evil from the world, or do you side with L's view that no one person should have such power? This show will undoubtedly make you consider your morals as everyone who watches the show ends up wondering how they would use the notebook, if at all. You may just take the view of the Shimigami and become the passive observer, merely trying to lessen the boredom of life. \
There are some problems with the story, however, a few episodes now known as the \"Yotsuba arc\" feel much slower compared to the rest of the show, and it feels as if the series comes to an abrupt stop during these episodes. Luckily, this \"arc\" lasts only a few episodes, but unfortunately, the show never quite picked back up to the level of tension and thrill of the first third of the show. SPOILER FOR LAST PART OF PARAGRAPH- After L dies, the central conflict of the show felt dead. Near and Mellow just didn't fill the void of L's excellent character. It felt cheap that neither character really 'won', rather both ended up dead. Although the victory of Mellow and Near could supposedly be used to justify L as being the overall victor of this show. This is just a personal opinion but I would have loved to see Light run his own twisted world, could have made a great season 2. I personally found the way Light was defeated to be a bit of an insult as I doubt something as stupid as a switcharoo would fool him, but I suppose it creates a moral about hubris. And I was a fan of Ryuk being the one to kill him. It would have been undignified if he had been sent to prison or something.\
The art in this show is incredible. It is detailed, and the animation fluid. The use of the red and blue motifs to contrast the personalities of Light and L was a great touch. The music in this show is also incredible. I love the slightly overdramatic orchestral music. It makes the show feel like an epic opera. The first OP was brilliant, with the music being synced extremely satisfyingly to the animation. I found the screamer/ heavy metal of the second OP to really be annoying and not suit the show at all, however.\
Ultimately, this is a great show. Great concept, great characters for the most part, great music, great animation, great plot and mystery. It is stopped from being a 10/10 by the Yotsuba arc, the slow down of the series post a certain characters' death, and what to me was a slightly unsatisfying ending (but it could have been worse). I don't know if this show deserves the top spot on this site, but it does deserve much of the praise it gets.\

    Not even joking, the worst anime of all time. This series was embarrassingly bad and I feel worse for having watched it. The characters and story and literally worse than anything I have seen before. \
To be totally serious anyone who genuinely likes this anime has real problems and needs to be examined.

    Death Note is one of the most popular animes around, with both avid anime fans, and general public enjoying thestory.\
Death Note is different, and definetley worth a watch, the story is clever, surprising you with the twists and turns, in both plot and in characters. The first 20 episodes had me hooked.\
But after a while, Death Note lost my interest my appeal was lost on the story.\
I found Light to be more annoying than clever, and his gradual psycological change became inane and almost unbareble. Killings became more and more lost of reason, with murders committed just for the sake of them. The twists became\
          \
        predicatable, and I only finished the series to see how it ended.\
But with the bad comes the good,\
The art is very well done, with a more realistic take on the traditional anime style.\
The overall background of the characters was well built up, and the story didn't have many holes, which one finds with this type of anime in particular, and the supernatural concept of shinigami in the real world seemed plausible.\
Overall I give this series a 6.\
It's worth a watch, and judge it for yourself.\

    O my god, this anime is one of the best anime I have ever seen if not the best! anime.\
The story is brilliant such a simple idea of a death note can make such a incredible thriller.\
The first episodes were brilliant, I know after 5 episodes that I wanted such a death note. \
The character:\
Light (aka kira) is incredible, he is extremely smart, popular and good looking. He is bored, bored with his life and bored with other people. He hates criminals he disgusts them. Then when he gets the chance to kill all and every criminal in the world and become justice the anime\
          \
        really starts kicking in. His plan to rebuild to world and rule the world as a god is only something everyone can dream of, at least I do. But the anime doesn't stop with this goal, no it even gets better when Light gets a opponent after 3 episodes. A man named L a super intelligent detective who's only goal is to capture kira. Since L and Light match each other in planning and intelligence we get a cat and mouse game that keeps on going 37 episodes long. \
The entire anime I kept wondering what Kira's next move was and how L responds to that. It was true brilliance and It was incredibly hard to chose between the goal of Kira and his brilliance, or the weird detective L who is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen in a anime. If not the weirdest. \
Let's get to the verdict cause I don't want to spoil to much.\
Verdict:\
The story was incredible, amazing, outstanding, best story I have ever seen in my entire life.\
The art was great it gave the entire anime this dark atmosphere in wich the battle between good and wrong commends.\
The music/sound was something that noticed me from the beginning. Each character had their own theme and each theme gave this anime such a dark and intelligent atmosphere that I often lisen to the soundtracks just for inspiration. Cause they are beautiful.\
The characters are outstanding as I said every character is awesome in it's own way. But light and L steal the show their performance is the best I've ever seen.\
The anime brought me to the edge of my seat the entire 37 episodes. It is hard to say goodby after 37 episodes, but a good story should end with a good ending, so a season 3 shouldn't be a good idea.\
Well I advice everyone to click this away and go watch death note right now since it's the! best anime I've ever seen. (if you have seen death note I advice you to watch the second best anime Code Geass).\

    This is really the best anime I ever watched. The story is unique, very simple: you find a notebook, but you realize that is a death note.\
The characters are outstanding, like L. He is my favorite character, because of his \"charm\" ( :)) ), and mostly because he really knows what to do in any situation. L is a person who you can't understand very much, he is reserved, but sometimes he can be really talkative. That's how I see him, and that's why I like this character very much.\

    Like Berserk, Sunabozu and a slew of others Death Note features a protagonist who is, not to mince words, a complete cunt. In fact nearly all of the characters in Death Note are unlike able cunts (apart from one, the only character I liked and she gets shit on repeatedly), but luckily they are quite entertaining and engaging cunts. Death Note is in many ways a spin on the classical murder mystery tarted up with some odd supernatural trappings. However it is the unfolding of the investigation which is the main thrust of the series and forms the basis of the narrative for nearly its\
          \
        entire length. I did feel that the latter part of the series flagged a little, especially the stuff following the L story arc. While it did pick up towards the end I thought the actual ending itself was crap and quite out of keeping with the general feel and direction of the story. I thought it sold out the theme and pathos which had been built up to that point and seemed almost as if the story \"chickened out\" and chose to resolve itself in a tiredly formulaic manner.\
Still probably worth a watch, it’s pretty engaging and the animation is top notch. The second opening is also the only anime opening I can think of the top of my head that a) sounds like (well actually is) japanese heavy metal and b) uses the word fucker.\
Gah, the ending of it is still pissing me off. If your going watch it I suggest you stop reading now as I am about to unleash some SPOILER fury.\

Even though I disliked him, why the fuck couldn’t they have just let Light \"win\"? It would have made more sense, as opposed to letting that little cockend Near outsmart him. It also would have fit much better with the rest of the series and served as an enjoyable \"cap\" for the generally perverse nature of the narrative. Fuck, even if Light had been done in by a betrayed Misa I would have preferred it. Even better would have been a flash forward a decade or two in the future where you see an older, victorious Light surveying his \"perfect world\" and Ryuk smirking in the background as he writes Lights name in his book. Agh stupid ending, perhaps I shouldn’t write about things directly after I see them, perhaps I need some \"distance\".\
***SPOILERS END***\
Man its far too fucking hot. I would also suggest not trying to watch this \"marathon\" fashion as the denseness of the story can lead to burnout. Probably better to \"digest\" it in 5 episode servings. \

    A few nights ago I decided to give Death Note a shot. It seemed to be in well regard, and I had no clue about the plot. I was watching it more or less blind. \
Well, after the first episode, I was totally hooked. It sets up an awesome premise for the main character, Light Yagami, a high school senior on his way to college. He finds a notebook, and the person who's name is written in it will die shortly thereafter, unless a details of the death are written. \
Although initially skeptical (and who wouldn't be?), Light realizes the power he has at his\
          \
        command, and starts taking out criminals like there's no tomorrow, because in his view, 'the world's become rotten'. \
Of course, criminals dropping like flies gets the attention of the authorities, and the hunt to find the mysterious killer, dubbed 'Kira', is on. Joining the hunt is L, a mysterious detective considered to be the best in the world. \
From that point on, it's en epic chess match between Light and L, and it's done incredibly well. \
Light reminds me a lot of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. Both are sick of the scum of the Earth, and make an effort to do something about it. However, where they differ is that Light is also a genius, and cannot see what he is doing as wrong. \
Of course, there's lots of complications to the plot, and I won't list them here. That's for you to decide. Give it a go if you really want an awesome story that reflects on major moral implications in society. You'll love it, trust me. \

    What is right what is wrong, is that something that could be judged? No, because everyone have their own views regarding 'justice' though at the end of the day it's just about various opinions conflicting with each other as everyone believe that their 'justice' is correct and what the majority believes is what is known as 'justice' or 'law'. But to be honest that's just our opinions which aren't right but not neccesorily wrong as every person views crime from a different aspect regardless of what the person who commits the crime is thinking because as long as their actions break the law those people\
          \
        are regarded as what we call 'criminals'.\
Story: 10 - Yagami Light is a genius who finds his current lifestyle and the world dull. One day while gazing outside the window he noticed a book falling from the sky and when class ended he picked up the notebook that was titled Death Note. He out of curiousity took the notebook with him home only to realise that this notebook has the ability to kill any human and he can change the world with this but things won't go smoothly as a well-known yet anonymous detective known as L has the wits to compete against Light which leads to mind games between them to see who outsmarts the other as Light starts of as a man of justice yet turns into to the one named Kira. I might be a bit biased towards this series because of the concept regarding the conflict of whether our main protagonist is a hero,villain or a anti-hero is what I found quite interesting ( I mostly feel biased with animes that have anti-hero's excluding code geass which I only gave a higher rating than I would've because of Lelouch's de..... basically what happened to him at the end of the series ). But I think the best part is how L and Light's opinions vary about their justice as the audience debate about who's right and who's wrong.\
Art: 10 - The art was impressive as it portrayed the movements of the characters so smoothly that it felt so realistic and the character design wasn't floppy or kiddy looking either so it all fitted in well.\
Sound: 10 - The soundtrack of this series is quite amazing because it makes you want to feel that you want too hear it again and again on an endless loop.\
Character: 10 - The characters were what drived the mind games to go so far untill we reached towards a conclusion. And we see a lot of contrasing yet somewhat similar characters which makes us feel that if we were in the same position then would we do the same thing. But I the best part about the characters would be Light and L's rivalry as they are one of the best and compatible rivals ever.\
Enjoyment: 10 - Though Death Note did have its flaws and a few times I did feel disappointed but there's no such thing as perfect so overall I really enjoyed this series. I think this series is suitable for most people I guess as long as you can handle the character developments with high psychological elements.\
People who liked: Psycho-Pass,Code Geass,Jigoku Shoujo,Darker Than Black,Detective Conan,Danganronpa-The animation,Guilty Crown,Persona 4,Paranoia Agent,Shiki and Monster will like this series due to some similar aspects which could be the characters/theme/atmosphere or storyline.\
Overall: 10 - Overall I loved this series and it's definitely worth a watch if you like shounen anime or are new to anime.\

    Death Note was a roller coaster of emotions. Following the antagonist as the main character provided tons of conflicting emotions. As I watched, there was always a sense of tension and mystery.Two things which I struggle to find in many things today. Every episode had you craving to find out what happened next. \
This is not an action anime. However, I would have to say the art was exceptional. Even so, this is one you'd watch for the edge-of-your-seat plot line. One of my absolute favorites, this is a must-watch.\

    Death Note is one of my favorite anime, and for good reason. The Story is very interesting and it really shows how someone as innocent as Light can get turned into a psychopath with the power he had. The story also lead me to think who would win, Kira or the police. The animation in this anime is really nice. Very dark coloring that sets the mood it's trying to set. The music in this anime are good, each piece feels in place. The voice acting is really good, My favorite being the voice of Light Yagami, he puts in a lot of emotion, and\
          \
        really shows off the lines really well, favorite line being the evil laugh in episode 37. The characters are really good, they have very serious characters, but have amazing characters like L (Ryuzaki) for the comic relief, The characters get serious but not so serious that it makes them boring, only bad character to me was Misa Amane, she was really annoying and never gave Light a moments peace. I enjoyed this quite well, I got sucked in with the story and the battle with Kira and the police, and seeing if Kira would achieve his goal. Overall, this anime is a very good anime, great story, art, music, characters. This is a anime I highly recommend.\

 CRITERIA\
--------------\
Story: 8.5 \
An Amazingly unique story of the likes I’ve never seen before. The main protagonist being a high school student, who like many others can see the faults in the world but is unable to act upon them. One day a he stumbles upon a mysterious book that has supernatural powers and one too many rules. The protagonist Light Yagami uses this book in order to ‘cleanse’ the world and make a new purer world with him as Kami.\
Ending: 4 \
One of the biggest disappointments I’ve witnessed in the history of anime and I’ve witnessed quite a few disappointments. So bad they had\
          \
        to make a re-write and the re-write wasn’t a lot different. They pretty much take away everything we know about Light and make him act in a way that is unlike him, he pretty much goes from a genius to insane in 5 minutes. Also due to the ending being so bad I went to read the manga to see if it was any different, it wasn’t…instead it was worse. In the manga they make him grovel and beg which is just pitiful and as Ryuk even says \"unlike you\". I don’t know what the writers where thinking, whether they got bored or they just ran out of ideas for a heroic death, but I hated the ending.\
Solid Plot: 7 \
The plot was done quite well however there are times where I would be thinking to myself that this event happening now of all times is just to coincidental. It’s like they threw it in there and didn’t smoothly fir it into place. It was ‘out of the blue’. And the times things like these did happen it was only to screw up everything Light had planned. However the plot was consistent well thought of and all the pieces of the puzzle always seem to fit together when they explain it to you.\
Moral: 8 \
Even though it wasn’t really out there the moral of Death Note is still quite obvious due to Light’s frequent actions and quotes. It’s simply we can’t attain true peace but we can attain something very close to it. However to get there blood must be shed in order to prevent the shedding of even greater blood.\
Sense: 7 \
As stated previously Death Note didn’t always seem to make perfect sense until they explain everything to you, but even then something will still leave you completely in the dark. One of the most annoying things I found with Death Note was the Death Note itself, all of a sudden after half through it’s like we have death notes dropping from the sky. One persona attains a death note then another and then there’s a fake and at some point you can’t keep track of what book is real and which one is fake… its mind boggling  \
Music: 9 \
The first opening to Death Note was amazing and I loved it the second opening however was like a screamo rock concert it was horrible. Apart from the second opening though all the theatrical music was awesome, some of  the best. Music played during, suspenseful scenes got your heart racing, and music played during sad scenes would almost bring a tear to your eye; really loved the music.\
Art: 8 \
For an anime created in 2006 the art is actually good, and I don’t have a lot of complaints about. Characters where drawn differently and all unique, making it hard to find any similarities between them. The art was good.\
Characters: 8 \
Quite a bit of character development in Death Note yet some could also say that in Lights case in the Second season he seems, for some reason, less smart. And I found that to be true as well. Whilst facing Near his decision making wasn’t that good compared to when he was facing L. It was also stated that L is smarter than Near. However all other characters in the Kira Case are shown to gain a lot more confident in themselves especially Matsuda. Overall The Characters, Character creation and Character development was all done quite well. \
Boredom Factor: 8 \
Never a dull moment with Death Note. The plot doesn’t drag, the story is interesting and I nearly watched it in one sitting\
Captivation Scale: 9 \
Nearly every single episode was a cliffhanger leaving me on the edge begging me for more with my heart racing wanting to find out what happens next. The story is intriguing and yes I wish they had made another season, except with the way they finished it and obviously the time between now and when they made it, there obviously won’t be one .\
Personal Score: 7 \
At the end of the day it always comes down to the final question. Would I recommend this Anime? This is a tough one because it’s an Anime I’d Love to hate but can’t and always seem to find myself obsessing over how much better they could have done the ending. So would I recommend it…Maybe both a yes and a no. Because the first 36 episodes of this anime are amazing I won’t deny it, but then in the ending they pretty much take away everything you know about Light and make him act in a completely different way. Also the first half of Death Note was a lot better than the second half.\
--------------\
  GENRES\
--------------\
Supernatural: 8 \
A great supernatural genre. You’ve got a supernatural book, a supernatural being (shinigami), supernatural deaths. and all other supernatural stuff happening. \
Mystery: 8.5 \
Leaves you guessing until the very end. You’ll never get it until they explain it to you.\
Thriller: 8.5 \
My Heart was racing every step of the way. Especially in episode 36 when it just ended I was in a fit of rage waiting for the next episode to finish downloading.\

    I was feeling in the begin of the anime when i was watching the first episode ''What a drag.'' I was after watching the first episode not very motivated to watch more. So i quited the anime and after 6 months. I was getting some animes at the day i was going at summer vacation. So i grabbed Death Note very fast and watched the whole anime in 5 days to a week. I must say that it was a good anime. I didn't like every person, like N or Mello.\
(The following is written contains spoilers, like deaths. Read at your own risk. If you\
          \
        didn't complete the anime or must begin with it it's not my fault that you readed this.)\
\
After L died(not Light but the guy with blue hair) i wanted to stop with the anime, because N was nothing but a copy guy. I hated N and everything he did, specially thinking with some figures of persons. I wanted that Light beated N. Allright, if L beated Light, i would not be unhappy. But when N beated Light, i was a little pissed off. No, i take back my words. I was really pissed off.\
The story itself was good. It makes you so scary and it's so good written i wanted to buy the fake Death Note, but i was still scared that i would kill someone in real but i knew at the same time it's fake. \
Further the art was okay, but some pieces of the opening specially the end image was very ugly designed.\
I really liked the sound, it was like a dessert for the anime. It made Death Note complete. \
The characters are good but N and Mello are the characters of the anime that i hated. If they were not in the anime, and Light would have won. The anime would be better.\
I really liked the brain games in it, cause i'm yeah, how should i call it, some kinda nerd. But without the brain games it would have a very poor rating for enjoyment.\
I would give the anime a 9. It's a masterpiece but it has it's cons.\

    A very popular anime that I somehow managed to avoid watching until now; though I caught a glimpse or two on Adult Swim back in the day, only in the last month have I managed to at last watch it  in its entirety..\
Immediately, I could see what caused such popularity.  Take a realistic, modern setting, add one solitary, yet very potent, fantasy artifact, some strong leads, a dark and tense atmosphere and a unique protagonist/antagonist relationship and you have a series that should interest even the most stubborn and particular anime fan.  And even those living under rocks or who staunchly defy\
          \
        modern anime or even anime in general as a medium likely know, to some peripheral degree, about the series and its basic premise -- which alone is enough to, eventually, draw in any viewer as it finally did myself.\
Following a brilliant young man who simply happens upon this artifact of complete destruction, the series sets itself apart by having a protagonist that, though with good intentions, is near-immediately painted as a bit of a twisted psychopath who would commit to the most dubious means in order to reach his apparently well-justified ends.... while the antagonist, a world-class detective tasked with catching this young man (and ironically about the same age himself and just as thoroughly gifted), though cold and quite far from 'pure', has a more humane justice in mind, one that, in all but the most dire of circumstances, would avoid the death of any human being, no matter how sinister -- and one that clashes rather directly with the protagonist's views.  Basically, the main character's the bad guy and the antagonist's the good guy, though it's a bit more complex than that.  Kinda like Code Geass.. and in fact this series shares another major point with that one as well which I'll mention later... although it should be more like Code Geass is kinda like Death Note, though I personally watched the former first.\
 Now, I'm going to do my best to avoid any type of spoilers here, but I'll forewarn you that this and the next paragraph will contain spoilers as to the structure of the show, at least.  Basically, from the very beginning to about 2/3rds through, the story is interesting, engaging, and constantly builds up, introducing and expanding upon various interesting sub-characters and weaving deftly through entertaining and gripping sub-plots, all the while keeping the main focus on the brilliant and engrossing battle of wits between the \"hero\" and \"villain\"... as well as the thoroughly amusing relationship between the main character and his death god... \"friend\", the original owner of the note whose job it is to follow him as long as he owns it.  (Ironically, this character is the closest thing to a mascot or comic relief, despite being the only physical 'monster' in the initial cast...)  The anime continues this trend, each mini-storyline becoming more interesting and tense than the last, threading the overarching plot forward bit by bit without pushing things too far in any direction; the raw genius of both leads and the prowess with which they're written equates to a story that manages to feel as if it's satisfyingly moving forward, while no real weight is put into either corner, allowing things to become further and further exciting and riveting with each passing episode, but without interfering with the delicate balance of the wondrous cat-and-mouse game.\
But then, most suddenly and for seemingly no good reason, something happens.  About two-thirds through the series, an event abruptly occurs which thoughtlessly renders several of the most interesting and enjoyable characters in the entire series moot for the rest of it.  Chief among them being a particular character who I did not expect to like very much at all,  but who ended up growing on me far, far more than I would possibly have expected.  That being said, after this point many new and very intriguing characters are indeed introduced, but given the honestly sloppy and rushed feel of this last leg of the journey, they mostly fail to live up to the incredible potential that they might have had.  Plus, one of them is just too shameless of a lesser clone of one of the extremely likable and memorable previous characters, so much so that even trying as I might, I couldn't force myself to like him very much at all.  Quite the opposite effect of the predecessor which I mentioned having a turnaround about a bit ago, in fact... And yes, as mentioned before, this is the other point this series shares closely with Code Geass.  In many was, the last third of it feels like R2.  Either way, the finale of the series ended up being quite satisfying in some ways, and did help to redeem these characters at least somewhat, but for all it did well it feels like it fell short an equal number of ways...\
When all is said and done, Death Note is a thoroughly fascinating series with enough thrilling moments to warrant a watch, if only to see what all the fuss is about and be able to acknowledge that you, like the apparent majority of anime fans by this point, have watched it.  And for the majority of the series, it really, truly is crafted quite masterfully, to the point at which it even pains me to give  it less-than-stellar scores... but I cannot overlook the fact that the latter story arc came so abruptly, came about so disappointingly and was handled so poorly, that my infatuation with the series very quickly dwindled down, like the flame of a candle being blown out to leave only a cinder on the tip of the wick.  To put it in one blunt but factual way, i went at that point from watching about five episodes a day to watching about two episodes a week.  Not good.\
Even still, I can't go without mentioning that the artwork for the series is quite nice; many characters have unique and memorable designs, the use of subtle facial expressions to great effect as well as indulgence in completely over-the-top expressions in other scenes done equally well is great, and the rarely-used but done-so-with-great-effect \"action shots\" are a treat.   As well, the soundtrack is quite superb, from haunting melodies to glorious choir pieces to understated \"detectivework\" themes and catchy character songs; \"L's Theme B\" is a particular favorite.\
The long and short of it is that Death Note is a good series and is worth a look if you bear even the slightest interest in animated thriller; though the last act mars the overall series, its quality is high enough that I can say with certainty that it's worth a look.. and for its shift in tone to bother me so much, that only further proves just how wonderful the majority of it is.\

    This anime is one of the few that I would rate with a 10. The story is great and the anime itself gets you to think what will happen next. It keeps the suspense going most of the time, and the constant battle between a delusional teen/adult mastermind who thinks he is \"God\" and who effectively manages to slip away from suspicion that he is the killer behind all the recent murder activity and yet another mastermind along with the help of the police task force, that try to uncover the real identity of the so called \"Kira\". It's great if you finish the anime\

        in one go, unlike I did. I suggest this anime to everyone, cause it will keep your attention till the very end.\

    If you're looking for an anime that's a bit different, you may want to try Death Note. This may seem like your typical everyday anime, but it's really not. To be honest, it actually has a very unique and well thought-out plot, so you don't get confused as easily. Even if you happen to get confused in a previous episode, you don't have to worry, because they make sure to explain it to you in the episodes to follow. \
Plot-- This anime follows the story of Light Yagami, an innocent high school student with the top grades in class. Although he does seem like a\
          \
        typical \"innocent\" teenager at the beginning, he's really not. After his classes one day, he finds a black notebook on the ground reading 'Death Note.' He thought it was a complete joke, but he decided to try it out anyway, and took it home. After he finds out he can kill people and that the notebook is real, he feels like he can bring justice to the world. While he's busy plotting his next victims, there is somebody that will do anything to figure out what is causing all these deaths. Enter L, the Japanese Police Force's top detective who has never left a case unsolved. 'L' is an alias of course, because the top detective in Japan is bound to have people come after him. He also goes by the aliases Hideki Ryūga, Eraldo Coil, Ryuzaki, and Deneuve. According to the outsiders, they're all completely different people, but they're mistaken. As L works with the police force, he stays secluded and continuously moves to prevent anybody from finding him. No spoilers, but as the anime goes on, the situations for the police force are getting harder to deal with, which will obviously work to Light's advantage. \
Art-- Although the art is not above and beyond, it is done exceptionally well. It's done well enough to where you can tell what's going on, but another thing the art does quite well is expressing each characters' emotions at a certain point at any given moment in the story. It very well illustrates their emotions by their face and their body as well. Even though L is expressionless most of time, you're still able to tell what he's feeling for the most part. I really enjoyed the art, because it does a great job of distinguishing all of the characters' personalities, whether it be spontaneous and happy or serious and hard-working.\
Sound-- I checked out both the English dubbed and Japanese versions of the anime. The voice actors in the English one seemed like they were absolutely perfect for the voice of that character. Each of their voices also did exceptionally well depicting the characters' personalities and emotions as well. As for the Japanese version, the voice actors were chosen very well too. In both versions, it's very easy to tell what the character is feeling. Now, for the background music. I thought each soundtrack was very well-placed to express the tensity of each moment. Some of the background music they placed into the anime does sound a bit strange, but either way, it still does a wonderful job of getting the point across to the viewer. \
Characters-- Although there were a few characters I didn't like out of mere opinion, I can't say that I hated how any of the characters were done and portrayed. The personalities of every single character were very well shown throughout the whole entire anime. Almost all of the major and minor characters stick with you until the end of the anime; they don't just randomly disappear for an unknown reason. If a character does happen to die, they make sure to emphasize it  just enough to where you wouldn't forget it. It is easy for many people to develop strong attachments and relations to the characters because of the way they have been portrayed, and how each of them fit into the story. There are absolutely no filler episodes for telling a characters' background or anything, yet the creators still did an outstanding job of letting you understand what was going on with each character.\
Overall, this was one of my favorite animes. This was also the first anime I had ever watched, and it was the one that got me absolutely addicted to anime. The plot and characters were very wonderfully done, and the details were impressive. The creators of this anime made sure every detail of it was easy to understand, yet insanely interesting to the point where you could never stop watching it. If you haven't watched this yet, you should really give it a try.",

    Death Note is definitely one of the most ingenious anime I've ever watched. It was very enjoyable, and it is great for beginner anime watchers. What I loved about Death note was that it held my interest. It was full of suspense, and always kept me wondering about what would happen next. I usually try for about 5 episodes of anime a night, but with Death Note, I was knocking out 10 or more episodes a night. I would definitely recommend this anime to anybody.\
Story:  10/10\
The series begins with Light Yagami, a smart teen who is just plain out bored with life. He is\
          \
        also tired of hearing of all the crime going on in the world. One day, while he was sitting in class, he notices a notebook falling out of the sky with the words \"Death Note\" written on the front of it. Out of curiosity, he picks up the notebook and reads the inside cover. He reads the first sentence which says, \"The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\" He assumes it is just a prank, but he is curious, so he takes it home to test it anyways. He writes down the name of a criminal mentioned on TV, and nothing happens. He is about to turn off the TV, when the news reporters say that the criminal had started dying of a heart attack. Taking it as a mere coincidence, he runs a few more experiments with the notebook to eventually find out that it was for real. He starts using the notebook to kill as many criminals as he can. He hopes to rid the world of all the criminals, and to become the god of a new world. A shinigami then shows up, claiming that the notebook was his, but lets Light carry on with his plan because he is also bored of life. However, the police think that what Light was doing was evil, and with the help of L, a genius detective who has never failed to solve a case, they try to find this killer and stop him. Light and L try to stop each other, and fight for justice.\
I thought the plot of Death Note was outstanding. The story is very exciting, and there was a cliff hanger at the end of every episode that would just make you desperately want to watch the next episode. The story is unique, and stood out from a lot of other anime.\
\
Art:  10/10\
The art in Death Note was amazing in my opinion. It looked very realistic, and there was a lot of detail, especially in the shinigamis. Death Note was the only anime that ever creeped me out because of how a character looked. The design of the characters were impeccable.\
\
Sound:  10/10\
I thought that the music and sound effects in Death Note was one of its best features. Each song fit the mood perfectly, and the music made everything much more exciting to watch. The opening and closing themes also fit the series very well. The voice acting was flawless as well. \
\
Character:  10/10\
Death Note has some of the best character development I've ever seen in an anime. Each character is unique in their own way, and have special characteristics that make them stand out. There were a lot of detail put into every character. L was my favorite character. That dude was hilarious, weird, and a genius. He made me want to laugh every time I saw him. This was an easy 10/10.\
\
Enjoyment:  10/10\
Death note is easily one of my most enjoyed anime. Like I said, it is full of suspense, and makes you jus want to keep watching it. Most of the time, there are parts in anime that I desperately want to skip because of how boring they are, but I didn't really find any boring parts in Death Note. The story was short, and amazing.\

Overall:  10/10\
Death note is definitely one of my top 5 favorite anime. This is a great series for any anime watcher. The story was excellent, and it was very enjoyable for me to watch. \

    This review is hard to write. Since I only care for the story (in general), for me the anime starts off as a 10 and ends as a 4. \
The first dozen or so episodes really are the mind war brilliance people had told me about. They are a 10.  However, right around the introduction of a certain blonde character, the show takes a plunge. And it NEVER recovers. On the contrary, it even manages to become less entertaining still after more new characters appear (while others disappear). It stays Near the bottom to the VERY end, unfortunately, despite what I had heard about\
          \
        it.\
Impressive potential devolved into an unsutisfying and streached out anime that would have been better if ended within 15 eps.\

    Death Note. This anime initially got onto my radar when it came to my attention that it was considered one of the best anime of all time. The premise sounded interesting. A high school student picks up a notebook that allows him to kill anyone he wants just by writing their name into it. It intrigued me, since I initially couldn't fathom how that could become a highly adored story. So I dived in and didn't regret it.\
The first thing that immediately stands out is the artwork and the animation. It is definitely the best quality I have seen yet. Even Darker than Black, which\
          \
        I consider to be the best overall anime of the ones I've seen so far, didn't have art of this caliber. It's a fairly unique style that just somehow fits perfectly with the story. You get a true sense of understanding a character by looking at their expression, and it gives a sense of realism that makes all their actions seem even more plausible.\
For the characters overall, they're characterized exceptionally well. This anime puts a lot of emphasis on reading into a character's thoughts. For an anime that's based around mind games between two different people, this is an excellent tool for figuring out just what is in the heads of L and Light as they continue dancing around each other. Light's mental degradation as he continues getting possessed by power is incredibly realistic, even giving several hints throughout that he truly becomes heartless. He becomes willing to do anything to protect his secret from those looking to find him. L is a world-class detective who becomes the best character in the story just by his sense of humor and unique habits. I'd even go so far as to say that L does a huge part in making the anime as great as it is. He provides a lot of the comedic value of the anime, since his humor fits perfectly with the overall dark theme of the story. The supporting characters are mostly solid as well, although Misa and Mello didn't seem to be quite on par.\
The only blight on this excellent cast of characters is Near. Without spoiling anything that happens within the story, Near is a character that appears fairly late within the story. He gets very little characterization from his initial debut straight to the ending of the show. He fits into the story just as well as the other characters do, but he doesn't have anything that the viewers would like about him or remember him by. He's mostly just there, which is very discouraging since he's a huge part of the last arc in the series.\
However, every arc before the last one is incredibly strong. They all cleverly tie together and give the sense that the story is progressing. As mentioned before, L and Light's constant dance around each other is compelling and never seems to get stale, even though it's a large focus of the show. It's always fascinating to see how these two young geniuses interact and try to figure each other out. Their plans and ideas are always explained with just enough detail to make their intentions clear, but still remain complicated enough to make the viewer ask themselves what the two of them are going to do next.\
The last arc was overall disappointing, but the last episode was just as much an ending that I could have wished for. The story winds down to a final showdown that would result in either Kira's demise or ultimate victory. It's built up well and is resolved just as strongly. It's the big climax that brings a faltering storyline to a blazing finish.\
Overall, this series gets a strong recommendation for anyone from me. If Near was a stronger character and the last arc a little less dull, this would have easily gotten a full ten out of ten. However, for anyone who likes a strong cast of likable, intelligent characters, a mystery told from both sides, or an art style that is both unique and effective, this anime is definitely a must watch.\

    This show is stellar. TL;DR is that if you enjoy smart, dark shows, like Dexter, you'l like this. The story is very twisty and turny, with lots of confusing logic and deductions. A TINY bit too much, which is why it got bumped down to a 9/10 for story. The art is good, and it gets a bit above because of the theme song imagery. It really sets the tone for the show well, with godly images of Light. However, the theme song changes halfway through the show, as with many animes. The second theme song is terrible, IMO. It is heavy metal, set to\
          \
        insanely trippy and unrepresentative of the show. Everyone I know also does not like it. The sound is superb. The songs in the show sound like church choirs singing dramatically. (I can't describe it much better, I apologize) The characters are creative, with Light being an anti-hero that wants to rule the world, and L, the fabulous detective who can solve nearly any case. I feel that smarter people will enjoy this more, and I openly admit that it threw me for a loop several times, but people smarter than I will not, I predict.\

    I'm not going to bother writing a long explanation as to why I didn't enjoy Death Note. Before this I thought Akira was the most overrated thing I've ever watched. But no, this show baffles me at how popular it is. \
Everything from the main character becoming evil over the course of what, 3 episodes? To having episode after episode of \"HE KNEW I WAS GOING TO DRINK THE COFFEE, SO I REPLACED THE COFFEE WITH WATER AND PROCEEDED TO DRINK. I KNEW AT THAT MOMENT HE WOULD BE WATCHING SO I MADE SURE TO-\" to having two of the most uninteresting main characters I've\

    Okay, before everyone goes all psycho on me...\
Death Note is, and will continue to be, one of my favorite animes. Then why rate it so low, you ask? Well... I'm trying my best to review honestly, and not let the hype get in the way. (If the above sentences made no sense at all, well... think of it like this.. I'm very critical of animes that receive endless applause and praise. There must be /something/ wrong with it. XD Take, for instance, Twilight. Why's it so popular if the writing's truly, academically disgusting and the plot nonexistent, not to mention the characters? It's the same\
          \
        here, except with smaller differences, of course.) \
So... let's get to the review, shall we?\
Story/Theme: 7\
To the untrained eye it is a rollercoaster full of ups and downs and drama and people kicking the bucket- or rather, clutching their chests. To a person who's read and watched such masterpieces (or, at least, know a close someone who's passionate about them) as Jane Eyre, 1984, Macbeth, (not to mention Discworld, Ender's Game..), and such like, it is full of holes. Like cheese. \
Take, for example, the theme of corruption in Death Note. It is, has anyone noticed, remarkably similar to Macbeth (which, in a nutshell, is about a guy going insane for power after he gets promoted and gets a whiff of it). However, Macbeth is done in a way that is totally realistic, in a scenario where you completely understand the character and what he's gonna do. In other words, the corruption part and all that follows is imaginable, within the \"human spectrum\", and godforsakenly human. All this without having to rely on a Death Note. \
No, I'm not saying this series would be better off without the actual killing tool- that would defeat its entire purpose. All I'm saying is, the story takes you to a point where you just enjoy the ride and not think about what it means to us, as humans, anymore- especially doing the \"deduction\" and \"masterplan\" scenes. And that's all they are. Scenes to make you go \"Wow! These people are SMART! I wouldn't've thought of that!\" Basically, the show loses its \"true\" focus often (that IS my opinion, despite what others have said) and doesn't rely on, say, our conflicting morals to advance the story as much as really intelligent people playing mind games. What I mean is, they should've put more scenes like the \"Money means all\" thing that Near did. It unveils the human condition while being realistic to the situation at hand.\
I also have a huge, huge problem with how the world \"accepts\" Kira- which is, luckily for the show, not expanded upon very much.  What the author's trying to say, I think, is that humans, at their root, are cowardly and corrupted. Face it. Not many characters are acting on \"good\" morals (aka the ones we live our daily lives by), and when they are, they never get anywhere. Truly, is this what the world has come to? Acceptance of Kira?\
Don't forget, it doesn't matter if the author/artist didn't choose to put that explicitly in the anime/manga, \"they didn't need to, it was implied\"- But why is it that in the entire plot, not one character achieves something good while being simultaneously good? I'm very, very confused about what they're trying to say here- that humans all all corrupted? (That's the easy \"moral theme\" for a series, for sure.)\
And this is where Death Note fails- it fails to look at how things actually are, instead looking at how they /appear/. The world accepting Kira is something that the watcher almost subconsciously EXPECTS- they go, OMG, this is the true humanity! This is totally, like, deep and profound! when in actuality, the sort of thing might not happen. That is the difference between a masterpiece and a plot built upon a contrived, superficial theme. \
Plus, the actions were coincidental enough themselves. It was almost as if the characters were playing parts in a play. \
Okay, enough with the story, let's move on. :)\
Art: Solid 10\
Nothing to qualm about here. The art is simply beautiful, and the subtle tones delicate and succint, pushing the story wonderfully. \
Sound: 9\
Very good here, too. Just one thing, though. Remember that guitar note pattern we heard in the first or second episode? It started with, \"da da dum dum dum\"? (And I think later it became L's theme...)\
Is anyone else reminded of the \"Brothers\" song from Fullmetal Alchemist? It starts with the same five notes, I'm pretty sure, so all the time I was waiting for the sixth note- it's coming, it's coming.. uh, no it's not.. Aww..Wait.. it is, but it's not THE RIGHT ONE!!!. And it annoyed me 'cause I felt like the composers might've been plagiarizing. \
Character: 7\
Points for L!!! Yay!\
...Not so many points for Light. :( Sorry, but the whole evil genius thing didn't strike any chords with me. I mean, if the authors couldn't imitate some aspects of Ender's Game, at least they would've created a character we could've connected with more successfully. Most of the time he was a gibbering, conniving megalomaniac- an awfully stereotypical sort of character, and not interesting at all. His intelligence is almost like an afterthought. \
L was a bit better, although I would've liked to get into his head a little more, and have kind of a sense of the isolation he must've been in, not being part of society and all that. (Seriously, just one word... Ender. L /must've/ been Ender in a past life.)\
(Oh yeah.. to the person who wrote about 1984... SQUEEE!!! I love that book! It's like one of my favorites of all time! I wish we could talk about it together.. there are so little people online who know about it, and even less who could connect it with anime like Death Note. XD)\
Enjoyment: 9\
One thing kept it from being a ten, and that's the lack of humor- a purely personal preference. (Terry Pratchett, anyone? ;)) I enjoy a story most when it has the capacity to make fun of itself- things tend to get... bad... if the show takes itself too seriously. Death Note started well in that aspect, until the later eps, when things just... dragged on, and there was nothing funny plot-wise or character-wise at all. In the beginning there was the entire absurdity of the situation (something that the Discworld series is very well known for), which was appreciated. Then, L with his quirks. Then, people died. Then, MORE GENIUSES. Holy crap, Artemis Fowl must be irritated. XD\
Overall: 7\
I'm going to be honest and different. :)  I would give it a seven, without hearing about the hype and all that jazz. Death Note's biggest faults are its story and character development, although it is far better overall than a lot of shows I have watched and books I have read. So.. let the anti-personal bias curtain be raised... \
But it'll always be my cherished fan object! -hugs L- Fics and fanart galore! Death Note is AWESOME!! \

    Only two words can describe this anime series Suspense Incarnate and is really one of the most thrilling anime of today. It combines mystery, supernatural, and philological elements which make it really epic and the themes of justice, corruption, godhood, and control can truly make it awesome and relate to the flaws of society. The characters have complex but aspiring personalities that it can make you relate with and even feel sympathy for them as they struggle to reach their goals. However light yagami is a character I despise as he becomes more ruthless and egocentric with the death note to kill innocent people, L,\
          \
        and even his own family members too just because he thinks himself as the only true saviour of humanity. I admit that he had good intensions from the start but he becomes not only a despicable villain but perhaps one of the most hated anime characters ever for being so blinded by his pride and letting it make hurt so many people and led to his own downfall eventually. But also I think the real villain of the series is the death note itself for having the power to turn good modest people into monstrous killers and and just being a simple book can cause so much destruction and chaos and reminding us that with great power comes with great responsibility. Overall the series was astounding for having diverse characters, themes, music, animation, and a story that really packs a punch into the gut. In a way the death note series is like a shonen anime but without the action and crazy adventures they have, instead have a series battle between brains and with a cat and mouse style too as well as a memorable protagonist villain. The series gets an 8 out of 10 from me for being filled with suspense but needs a little more action and heroics for the characters too, so please read my review please and thank you as well.\

    If you happen to look at my rating, it may seem rather low, and for some reason, my singular rating might discourage your from watching/reading. DO NOT DO THIS. I ended up disliking Death Note after an occurance about halfway through. I think. It's been a long time since I saw it. Anyways, I just couldn't deal with it and was unable to continue. It's still a wonderful anime. The artwork for the Shinigami's is amazing. They're creepy and almost gross, yet acceptable. You can't help but like them. The whole idea of a diary/journal that allows total control over someone's life is mind blowing.\
          \
        I want one. I think a lot of people do. And now I'm rambling. ANYWAYS, go watch/read it. I have yet to read it, but I do believe I shall try. I shall also try to rewatch the anime. Good day to you all.\

    Death Note is one of the best animes out there.  If you haven't watched it yet, you are missing out on one epic plot and epic set of characters. The conflict is between doing what is right in the right way and doing what is necessary.\
Story: The story is a masterpiece. The idea of the notebook of Shinigami belonging to a human is terrifying in itself. But, the use to which it can be put is explored quite well by Light(the main character). The 'experiments' carried out to discover all the rules of using the book are something which only a genius could think\
          \
        of. And the best part was the constant chase. By chase, I don't mean one like Tom and Jerry. The chase here was 100 times more exciting. That was because, no one would even dream of a Death Note existing, but still L is able to narrow down the possibility of someone being the culprit quite well. The plot is so good that if there was even a small mistake made by either of the characters, the cost would be their life. And yet, both being absolute geniuses manage to trick the other for the greater part.\
Art: The art was quite nice. I especially liked the character designs of Yagami Light, Ryuk and L. Every character was definitely likeable and looked a lot more realistic than the characters in most other animes.\
Sound: Just like the art, the sound was also good. The VAs did a really great job in the series. The background music was also nice.\
Characters: The characters Yagami Light and L were my favorites among those in the series. While Yagami Light had the looks of someone who people would idolize, L was someone who would freak people out. Yet, they were both masterminds and took every action with the utmost care(of course, their life was on the line). L was one of the best characters I have ever seen in an anime. I was so obsessed with L while watching the anime that I used to sit like him(which looks quite awkward BTW) and watch the anime. \
Enjoyment: With a plot as good as this one, you are bound to be watching almost every episode at the edge of the seat. Except for the first few episodes, where the things were quite obvious(and hence a little boring), almost every other episode was exciting. You will be so involved in watching the anime that you will almost imagine yourself to be living in the world of Death Note. \
Overall: The concept was amazing and so were the characters and the plot. The only reason why I give it a 9 is because in my opinion, it could have been a bit better in the first few episodes. That said, it ended almost perfectly. \
Death Note is indeed one of the best animes ever. It has mystery, supernatural stuff, a little bit of action and also a little amount of romance. If you haven't already watched it, you are missing out on one of the masterpieces among the animes.\

    Death Note is, IMHO, perhaps the most overrated anime of all time. While it starts off as a fun, invigorating thrill ride, it fails after that, for a number of reasons.\
Death Note begins with Light Yagami receiving a notebook with a special power: any name he writes in it will die. Immediately, Light makes things interesting by choosing a questionable route: he begins writing in the names of criminals. When he starts pushing it too far the police get involved and a battle of wits ensues between him and the mysterious \"L\" a superdetective with a hidden identity. \
Sound intriguing? It is. Watching the two\
          \
        match wits is fun and entertaining. \
So why does Death Note fail?\
It's actually rather simple: Death Note fails because its protagonist doesn't stay morally gray. No, Light Yagami may start off that way, but the fact is he becomes as black as the devil after only a few episodes, killing innocents and doing pretty much nothing to redeem himself. As a result he becomes shockingly boring and annoying on his own. His character, in fact, really only has value as an antagonist to the vastly popular L, which is a flawed way to design a TV series. Put simply, the MC needs to be more likable than what we got here. Look, I'm not saying protagonists should be saints or even overall good people. You're talking to a guy that loved watching Walter White in Breaking Bad, but the fact is that Light very clearly becomes a simple villain early on in this show. It's no shock, then, that (HOLY SHIT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT W SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT) the show largely goes to shit after the death of L. What exactly happens next you ask? Basically Light acts more Light-y and fights a couple of one-dimensional L ripoffs and loses. I had my hopes up that they could carry a storyline without L, I really did, but they simply did not do so. They failed, and badly. \
What's all the more shocking is that, despite picking a fairly interesting premise, Death Note fails to provoke any thought after its first batch of episodes. Basically we just see that Light's vision for humanity is totally f---ed. A stronger choice would have been to make it a deeper shade of gray, forcing the audience to consider some really tough questions, but Death Note doesn't do that. They instead depict an irredeemable little bastard that no one has issues rooting against. It's no better than the completely flawless and noble hero that's pure good. In fact it's honestly worse. \
Look, Death Note isn't a \"bad\" anime by any stretch. Hell, the suspense we see early on is enough to make a damn good one. But it's time to freaking stop with all this bullshit about how it's a \"classic\" or \"masterpiece\" because anyone saying that is ignoring the godawful quality of the latter half of this series, not to mention how poorly written any character not named \"L\" is. There simply isn't much too this show in terms of depth or motif, either. At best this show is shallow suspense--- at worst it's shallow boredom. I've noticed the Internet tends to simply overrate any media that's \"dark\" and this seems to be no exception. That's not to say dark anime, movies, etc. can't be good. They can. It's just that being dark doesn't automatically make you good either, despite what many online would have you believe.\
Side notes\
-The dub actor for L deserves a medal, he is to date my favorite dubber\
-Some of the weirder OPs and EDs in this show, that's for sure. They seem rather random, almost arbitrary\
-Writing female characters certainly was not a strong suit of this staff. The only major one is a boring, failed play on the yandere trope \
-\"I'm L.\" Can't deny I got chills.\
-Backwards, Light's name is \"I'm a gay moon\". Probably my favorite piece of anime trivia ever\
-Matsuda deserves two medals",

    This anime was amazing. It kept me interested and it was overall just an awesome anime. If any of you reading this have not watched Death Note, DO IT. NOW.\
Story~The story line in this anime was very captivating and it kept me on my toes. I legit binge watched episodes because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It is very plot-driven and because it has a great story line it's perfect. 10/10\
Art~I honestly didn't pay much attention to the art here lol rip but L is HOT so I kinda had to give this a good rating. 9/10\
Sound~In my opinion, the voices\
          \
        for each character completely matched their personality. It was all spot-on. On a different note, the first opening of this anime is AMAZING. I actually have it on my SoundCloud so I can listen to it whenever I want because I love it so much hahaha. However, the second opening (starts art episode 20 if I remember correctly) is NOT GOOD. It's ACUTAL SCREAMO MUSIC. But overall the sound here was great. 9/10\
Character~The characters here are phenomenal and each one was developed very well. I also mentioned earlier that their voices matched their personalities perfectly. Also, I need to mention again L! HE IS THE BEST EVER. 10/10 \
Enjoyment~Once again, I mentioned earlier how this anime kept me so interested and how i binge watched and blah blah blah. But it really did! It was intense, unpredictable at times (which also made things very interesting) and kept me obsessed lol. I'd be in homeroom watching Death Note because I loved it so much, and I still do haha. 10/10\
Overall~All I have to say is that if you haven't watched Death Note yet, please do. You'll do yourself a huge favor lmao. Basically if you like thrillers and mystery (kind of) and intense shows/movies you will love this. 9/10\
Watch this anime right now lol\

    Much has already been said about Death Note and its intense scene of potato chip eating. I think I've heard people talk about the plot as well. As one of the breakout hits in a period many refer to as the golden age of anime, it's hard to write a review of the show and feel like I'm actually adding anything new to the conversation. My basic feelings: I like Death Note. Sometimes, it's brilliant. Sometimes, it's just okay, but I can't say it wasted my time.\
Light Yagami and L might be one of the greatest rivalries in any story. What makes this psychological brawl\
          \
        so appealing is that neither one of these guys is a great human being. Light starts out with intentions to make the world a better place, but the writing soon makes it clear that this character is a lunatic, someone who uses the notion of justice to justify his own megalomania. According to conventional morality, L is doing the right thing; he is working his butt off to bring the bad guy in, after all. But, he's not really doing it because he wants to do the right thing. Moreso, catching the world's most mysterious mass-murderer is the latest puzzle for this whiz kid. L has no care for social norms or human connections, and his tactics would make the NSA proud. It's the psychological battle of the century.\
Then, about two thirds of the way through, the show becomes different. Is it a good different? Most viewers seem to say no. I hesitate to call the last third of the show utter trash. Sloppy and directionless? Maybe. But, it is interesting to see how the character dynamics shift radically following the big moment, and the final episode does wrap the whole series nicely, with a payoff worthy of the Phoenix Wright \"Cornered\" music.\
At the very least, watch the first 2/3 of Death Note. If the last section of the show isn't doing it for you, feel free to drop it, but with its morally ambiguous characters, nailbiting tension, and brilliantly melodramatic use of music and animation, it's easy to see why Death Note caught on the way it did.\

    I always thought Death Note was over-hyped, so I avoided watching it for the longest time. Partway through finally watching it I found myself thinking, \"Why didn't I watch Death Note sooner?\"\
The art is good. I had no issues with it. One thing in particular that I enjoyed was how they illustrated Light when he was thinking devious thoughts. You know, the red hair and red glint in his eyes. The sound was good as well. The music captures the right mood for all of the scenes. The opening and endings were good enough. Not amazing enough for me to watch through every time, but\

        good enough for me not to groan every time I hear them. There are certain reoccurring tracks that play at dramatic moments. I liked those.\
The premise of Death Note is simple enough, and almost everybody knows what it is. The story progresses realistically in the fact that every action the characters perform has some sort of consequence. There are twists upon twists, and the drama builds up in a gripping way. The pacing of the story was great. There was never a dull moment for me. Everything that happened was important to the plot. The way that Death Note ends is a topic of endless controversy, but it's a matter of opinion. I personally thought the ending made sense and liked it. Anyways, the story never deviates from \"people trying to outwit each other,\" so if you get bored of that stuff easily, Death Note isn't that great.\
The characters of Death Note are a mixed bag, but mostly interesting. Yagami Light, our main character, isn't exactly full of depth. All we know is that he's intelligent and wants to change the world, using anything at his disposal to do so. Then we have L, who we know is intelligent and wants to stop Light from changing the world, using whatever he has at his disposal. They basically have a d*** measuring contest, except they want to kill each other after the contest. Misa actually has more surprises to her than Light. Some may find her annoying, but she played an integral role in adding some spice and emotion to the story. The rest of the primary characters introduced are pretty one-dimensional but are necessary to create a believable world. The N&M pair is no exception. Their introduction seemed pretty forced. It would have been nice for them to be introduced gradually. Despite them, the relationships between the characters is what makes them great (Light and L, for example), not the characters themselves. Some side characters appear during the course of the anime, and one pair of them in particular tugged at my heartstrings. Alas, what we must do to achieve our dreams!\
I really enjoyed Death Note. Not every anime can make me want to click Next Episode as soon as I hear the ED play. The art and sound are fine, the story with its twists and turns is amazing, and the characters interacting with each other and fumbling for control is very good. I look back now and see the flaws of the characters, but given that so many characters were introduced, it's quite a feat that they each had some sort of individuality. I find my heart and mind conflicted at the ending of Death Note, and it has left me thinking about the morality of what had transpired through the whole show.  You should definitely check Death Note out. If you're expecting a masterpiece, it's definitely not perfect. But... there's a reason why it's so famous (besides the eating of potato chips).\
An interesting premise executed beautifully with notable characters battling themselves and each other for what they think is \"right\" gives it a final score of 9.",

    Death Note is honestly one of the best things I've ever watched. I've tried not to play favourites (between Light and L+Near) in the review so you can decide who's right yourself. I'll try to keep it short but without further ado, let's get straight into it...\
Story\
The story is all tied up very nicely. It's told trough the eyes of both Yagami and L, it's really unpredictable and keeps you entertained all the time. It's not (too) rushed and best of all is that it has no fillers. The ending is the best part but I won't spoil that. The part where [Spoiler] Light forgets\
          \
        everything and they're after that group (don't remeber the name) wasn't the best but it's not that bad\
Art\
The art is amazing and the Shinigami look great as well. The character designs are awesome and fit their personalities well. In my opinion, L and Near have two of the best designs. I also love the way characters are shown when they're thinking (with the different hair colours and all).\
Sound\
I mostly paid attention to the subtitles rather than the sound but as far as heard the voice acting is nice and so is the background music. Though the second theme song (episodes 20-37) caught me a bit off guard.\
Character\
The characters are all amazing. It's made in a way that leaves you to decide for yourself who is the good guy and who is the villian. There is depth to every character and they all have their own motives. I personally like the relationship between Near and Mello. The supportng cast (the policeman who work with L) all have dfferent characters as well and some of them even get some \"character development\" towards the end.\
Enjoyment\
Death Note is one of my all-time-favourites, if not my favourite, anime. I'm looking forward to rewatching it (even if there will be no mistery) since there are so many view points. Last time I checked it was the most popular anime on the website.\
Overall, it IS one of the best things I've ever watched. In my opinion it trully is a masterpiece. Hope I helped...\
Thanks xx\
P.S. Here are some quotes to sum up how things \"stand\" in Death Note:\
Light: \"I can do it, in fact I'm the only one who can do it, I'll do it, using that Death Note, I'll change the world!\"\
L (in L: Change the world):\"No matter how gifted you are, you alone can't change the world.\"\
L and Light: \"No matter what, I'll find you and do away with you! I'm... JUSTICE!\"\
Light: \"I protect the innocent and those who fear evil. I'm the one that will become the god of a new world that every one desires!\"\
Near: \"You're just a murderer, Light Yagami. And this notebook is the deadliest weapon of mass murder in the history of mankind.\"\

    You won't regret watching this gem of psychological thriller anime!!!\
Death Note was the first anime i ever watched so it has a special place in my heart. But that aside, i love anime's that keep you on your toes and make you think about them long after each episode, that was exactly what Death Note did. The characters are amazing and have very unique personalities and, THE PLOT IS AMAZING, it is so well thought out/written and is full of suspense and i honestly couldn't get enough. I love the opening song and the graphics are okay but the characters and plot definitely make up\
          \
        for this minor flaw. You definitely wont regret watching this anime.\

    After a long time, finally I finished Death Note, what a trip! Without a doubt this one of my favourite anime ever and it's truly a masterpiece that I must write a review on it.\
It makes you question one of the most basic morals \"What is good and evil?\"; Is what Light doing right? Is it really that bad? Is it that good? Would you like to live in a world where an invisible identity is watching every step you take in a way?\
During this anime, I've wanted both Light and L to win since they are both genius and they just kept blowing my\
          \
        mind with their amazing plans even though it was impossible for both to win. Even though what Light was doing was wrong, it really wasn't all that bad in a way. Considering his father was head of the Police Force, it's almost obvious he would have a strong sense of justice and surely to have a power like the Death Note in your hands would most likely than not, corrupt you eventually.\
When I started this anime, I couldn't stop watching. I kept wandering what would happen, I wanted to see more and more. It's really difficult for me to find an anime like that and I was obviously more than happy that I found Death Note. However not everything is perfect, hence why I'm only giving it a 9 instead of the 10 I would love to give.\
The second arc was a flop. I lost the interest and I actually skipped right to the last episode (and dear God I cried a river) and I didn't pick this series for a long while until today to finally finish it.\
All the excitement and the rivalry that existed with Light and L was suddenly gone and Near and Melo got me seriously annoyed and irritated. It wasn't all that bad though, there was a time where my interest picked again and I was hyped as hell but it was all too easy!\
Near seems to have a supernatural ability to suddenly know everything (like when he suspects Mikami is X-Kira), I mean even L struggled with Light/Kira, how could he know things so randomly and spot on? That pissed me off a lot, just like Light said he isn't has good as L.\
In the end I was honestly hoping Light would kill everyone and he would win, though deep down I knew it wouldn't happen.\
I'm willing to give the manga a try since I've been told that the story is more well explained, specially the second arc. In the anime it was too rushed maybe then I'll appreciate this arc more since it kinda pains me to say it was a flop.\
To sum it up it was a genius anime that just keeps blowing your mind with it's fierce intellectual battles between good and evil.\

    Death Note Review\
The Death Note anime, directed by Tetsurō Araki and animated by Madhouse, began airing in Japan on October 3, 2006, and finished its run on June 26, 2007, totaling 37 twenty-minute episodes. \
\
STORY\
Essentially at it's core, death note is a story about A genius teenager named Light Yagami , who is bored with life and one day after school, finds a book entitled 'death note' which states the person who's name is written in the book will die . Light Intrigued by this tests out the book and when realizing it is the real deal, goes on a quest to become the\
          \
        god of the new world by controlling who dies.\
This series has gained such critical acclaim due to it's unusual protagonist or more appropriately named 'anti-hero' for his moral questioning choices and his maniacal personality as he descends into madness.  The story begins at the point of view of light as he seems an innocent high schooler but as the story progresses you start to question whether you want him to be caught ,or get away with it. This is what makes the story of Death note so amazing. Further along the story we meet another genius, only he is a detective and in charge of finding out who the person killing everyone is (referred to as Kira, which means killer in japanese). The natural pacing of the story is so brilliant as it rapidly increases the stakes with each passing episode, making you wonder how he will get out of each situation and how is intelligence pulls through in dire moments. The only negative regarding the death note story is the fact that on an intellectual level it may be a bit hard to understand / follow as you have to pay attention to what every person is saying and if you miss something, something else may not make sense.\
CHARACTERS\
The characters are what make Death Note, in a nutshell. Each character is fleshed out and explored, with even minor characters getting a good amount of screen-time. The main three characters are Light, L & ryuk. Light is obviously the main character as we follow him throughout his power trip of becoming a god. Light is very interesting to watch as you don't know if his reason of doing what he does are truly good or evil. L is an eccentric character that loves sweets and never wears shoes. Aside from his weird mannersims he is a genius on the same level as Light which makes for a perfect game of cat and mouse throughout the series. Ryuk is a very unique member of the series as he is what is called a 'Shinigami' or a death god, who was actually the one who dropped the notebook into the world in the first place. Ryuk doesn't often show emotions nor does he tell his intentions so his screen time is very interesting as you don't know which side he is really on or what he plans to do in the future.\
SOUND\
The score in death note is truly breathtaking. Each piece fits the world and is the definitive factor that creates such an effective attempt at world building. Many scenes would not have had the same impact without the jaw dropping music that was produced to fit the scenes. Whether it be the desolate sounds of an abandoned shinigami realm, to the upbeat piano sounds when Light and L are thinking over their plans, each piece is perfectly suited to the mood of the scene. The voice acting is also superb, Mamoru Miyano (a very well known voice actor in japan) portrays Lights maniacal side perfectly with pitch shifts and crazy laughter, even down to the scenes where Light is smirking is done superbly.  Ryuk's smart-alec behavior also shines through thanks to the work of Shidou Nakamura(most iconically his cackling when Light is doing something he finds interesting). Japanese is the original language and the language it was supposed to be watched in, however the English dub cast also do a great job of portraying their counterparts.\
ART & ANIMATION\
The art in Death Note is top notch. Character models are done with great detail and one of the most real looking characters to date in anime history. In scenes where characters are talking to eachother , great attention to detail has been produced , with things such as Light putting his hand on his face to think or L sitting in a certain position to accentuate his strange personality. The famous pen writing scenes are a great example of brilliant animation. Each one is done with such fluidity that it almost looks as if it is of movie level production levels (for a tv series that's quite good). \
ENDING THOUGHTS\
Death Note is a series that clicks on every level and is indeed a true masterpiece that is highly regarded by fans of anime, tv and even regular film. However if you are the type of person that does not like alot of dialogue and wants alot of action then this may not be the series for you. However, if somebody was to give this a go, It is highly doubted that one would be disappointed.\

    Let's talk about Death Note, and anime that almost all of my friends know and praise it because it's soooo amazing without giving me solid arguments.\
A young student name Light Yagami found a book on the ground after being on a depression state, and discover that by writing a full name on it will kill the guys after several seconds. After wanting to save the world by punishing criminal, Light slowly fall into a demonic mind and his justice throwed away after being wanted by the most fear investigator with a acronym : L.

The story is not exceptional but still have some strong cliffhanger. So sad that the story is just a Tom and Jerry like with some books, and the basic romance stuff...\
Art : 6/10\
Death note art was not exceptional,it was regular. It didn't appeal me really much, and the face of some characters were not my taste at all.\
Sound : 5/10\
I didn't had so much feelings by listening the soundtrack of this show and neither remember them correctly because of that.\
Character : 7/10\
Some interesting characters were present, but some of them were too boring too watch which greatly reduce the enjoyment i had.\
Enjoyment : 6/10\
I couldn't finish the series after the middle of it because it was something that i didn't find bad, but also not good. I while maybe finish it when i will have a lot of time to spend.\
Overall : 6/10\
Death Note is something that i find too much over hype, and like i always said,it's my PERSONAL opinion.\
This anime was not my taste at all, because it feel like it's missing something.",

    This anime is honestly my favorite of all time and a lot of that has to do with the battle between the protagonist, Light, and the antagonist, L. Unlike other anime, where the two would battle it out in some huge epic fight scene, Death Note doesn't do that. In fact, unless you count a tennis match (which I don't), there is really only one actual fight between them. This anime is more focused on the two trying to outsmart one another and it instantly got me hooked on the show. Some people say that the show went downhill in the second half of the\
          \
        show, but I don't agree. I think that the new characters introduced were, maybe not as great as some other characters, but still had their personalities used in a way that creates an interesting dynamic between them and Light. Another thing that is great about the way Death Note structured its story, is that there is no clear hero and villain. I've seen many people say that Light is the hero, punishing criminals, and I've seen others (and myself) say that L is the hero, stopping Light from his wrong way of doing things. In the story category, this show gets a perfect 10 from me.\
The character designs in the show, while not outstanding in most cases, make sense. The characters aren't meant to be flashy because the police force are trying to stay hidden so they don't get killed, and Light is just trying to pretend to be a normal high school student. However, there are a few character designs to bring up in specific, L and the Shinigami. L looks like a polar opposite of Light, which makes perfect sense considering their clashing ideologies and the Shinigami all look unique and interesting which all convey a different emotion. Ryuk's permanent smile tells us that he is just there to watch the show unfold in front of him, and he is enjoying it. While not the greatest character designs I've ever seen, they certainly aren't bad. However, the art surrounding them in amazing. Once again, unlike most anime, Death Note uses more dulled out colors to show that, except for the Shinigami and the Death Note itself, the entire story is grounded in reality, so don't expect fighting in giant mech suits. 8/10.\
Now for the sound. The first opening in the show is amazing and I could listen to it on repeat for hours. It is seriously one of my favorite OPs of all time. As for the second OP.....not nearly as good as the first one. I honestly skipped right past it most of the time. I'm not a huge fan of that song, but moving onto the EDs, they are both great. I'm not a huge music nerd so I can't tell you much else than that. Another 8/10\
I've already touched on the fantastic dynamic between Light and L, so let's talk about some of the supporting cast. Misa Amane was too whiny and clingy for me to enjoy her in this show. I might have liked her if she was in another show, but she doesn't really seem to fit in with the rest of the characters in Death Note. Unlike Soichiro Yagami who is probably my second favorite character (after L) and who fits perfectly into the dynamic of the show. Whenever L brings up a piece of evidence that seems to link Light to being the one they need to catch, Soichiro is always there to try and counter it. This not only points out flaws in L's ideas, but also forces L to think harder and figure out the case, which I personally think it really cool. For this, Death Note gets a 9/10.\
I've only ever seen the English dub for the show, because I don't like to read when I'm watching a show, but I can say that every voice actor captured that character perfectly. From Light's moral dilemma and psychotic laugh to L's always monotone voice to Ryuk's sinister one, there all just fanatastic. This all just adds to my overall enjoyment of the show. Death Note is a brilliantly crafted cat and mouse game that I think everyone who is looking to get into anime, or is already watching anime should watch. Have you already seen it? Go watch it again! It's amazing!\

    As of writing this review, I have seen Death Note, from beginning to end, about four times (though I have watched specific moments, like the potato chip scene, countless times): this is more times than I have watched any other anime.  If I were to have written this review immediately after the first time I saw it, I probably would have scored it ten, but after seeing it over and over, and being welcomed to other anime (like Monster and Cowboy Bebop), my feelings have sobered up. This (minus like Dragon Ball, Pokemon, YuGiOh, Naruto: anime that I watched as a kid) is the\
          \
        first anime that I completed, and boy did I love it. \
I felt enchanted by the cool story, awesome characters and memorable moments. I loved the conflict between Light and L, and found Misa and Matsuda able to lighten up the tension perfectly. I felt like this show had zero flaws ... until much, much later. This is a fantastic anime to welcome any newcomer, but be aware that Death Note has flaws, something many fans will refuse to see at first. The most notable, without spoiling, is a big moment that occurs a little over halfway through the show that changes its entire dynamic and Death Note slows down. Still interesting, but not as much so. Most of my complaints, though, are with the latter half of Death Note, because the beginning, almost like a chess game, makes Death Note one of the most binge-watchable shows ever. The latter, on the other hand, feels like cheap and wasted potential. \
All and all, Death Note is a beautifully crafted show that most will enjoy for its interesting story and unforgettable characters. While the show has its flaws, it makes up for them by taking you on a splendid adventure that will stick with you for the rest of your life. \

    Death Note, an anime masterpiece not only is the story well plotted and a good concept but unique and intriguing characters. I actually was recommended to read manga from a friend and I didn't know what to chose. In the end I chose Death Note and after the 1st chapter I was hooked to the story. Afterwards I decided to watch the anime as well and it did a good job recreating the enjoyment from the manga.\
Story- 10/10\
The thrilling excitement between evil mastermind and genius detective makes up a good and interesting story.\
Art- 8/10\
It's decent, but they didn't put much effort in the artwork and\
          \
        it looks kind of bland as well.\
Sound- 10/10\
The soundtrack of when Light was writing down a bunch of criminals names fit the moment very well and had a fearsome touch too it as well. Also Light's laugh is very good example of nice voice acting.\
Characters- 9/10\
Very unique characters like the Intelligent Light's obsession to clean the world from evil doers and L's obsession to have Justice over the limits. All the characters have a amazing personality that makes the story more exciting.\
Enjoyment- 10/10\
I enjoyed it so much I became addicted to it to the point of creating a fake Death Note and imitating Light's laugh.\
Overall- 9/10\
Good plot, admirable characters, well fitting soundtracks, and exciting visual. Overall I give this anime a 9 out 10. Also check out the manga it's as good as the anime. 1 word about this Anime... MASTERPIECE \

    (As it will be with all my reviews, TL;DR version at the bottom)\
What would happen if by sheer coincidence you were at school on a break and you found a notebook that says \"the person whose name is written in this notebook will die\"? How will you react to it? Furthermore, if this is real and not a gimmick, what would you do with such power?\
Death Note starts with last year at highschool student Light Yagami in this particular scenario, he finds the Death Note and doesn't trust so much that its power is actually real. After trying it on a random criminal at public\
          \
        TV, he is left baffled at the sight of his newly acquired power.\
The story focuses on Light using this notebook to create a crime-free world in where his will should be followed by everyone. Those who dare commit a crime against others will be punished by death instantly so as to keep the world a safe and peaceful place to live in. That is, until the mysterious detective only known as L gets into action to stop the madness. Back and forth between Light and L, the story told in this anime is a battle of wits and power, a battle of minds, a war of egos.\
The artistic side of this anime still holds up to 2016, although barely, considering it came out 10 years ago. The scenarios presented, though empty and rather dull at times, they all have a meaning to where the story is going to. It's not eye candy by any means, but it's not something forgettable either. Kudos to the guy who created the shinigami designs and their world.\
As to what sound goes, it doesn't hold up really well but still it can be beared with. Both ops and eds are what save the day for the anime. Both Nightmare and Maximum The Hormone fit what is presented at both parts of the anime. The ambient music in the anime is a hit or miss. At times it sounds really good ambiented, but at other times, the classical, operatic music played sounds off and is almost a moodkiller, leaving you with sort of a bitter taste.\
Now, the greatest part of the whole anime are the characters. There are few animes of those I saw that really get inside of the character and develop it as deep as Death Note does. Each character, from protagonists Light and L, to side characters like Matsuda have their own stories to be told and their characterizations are unique. Each chapter in this anime has one more tiny bit of information on each character and what their purpose is in this situation that is going on in the world.\
All in all, it's not the most epic of animes, but it can give a pretty nasty fight to newcomer animes in the drama department. It's a grim story, filled with mystery, religion, karma and power that is not going to let you go so easily.\
TL;DR Version:\
Light, a highschool student finds a notebook called Death note that assures the user of it that anyone's name whose is written in it will die according to the will of the writer. Light embarks his journey to kill criminals with this notebook to make the world a clean and safe place to live in without fear and pain, but he'll have to fight his way through the mysterious detective L's sight and investigation. A story with elements religion, power, karma and moral that has something to teach.\

    Death Note was the first anime I truly enjoyed in a long while. It's overall compelling story, well-written characters, and the ideals that it tackles all contributed to my amusement.\
The show started off at a running pace, but began to loose steam by the middle of the series. The middle story arcs seemed to drag on for too long. And the ending episodes, no doubt the best part of the series, seemed somewhat rushed. The characters introduced should have had more time to be developed, though their arcs came to a close rather eloquently. \
I must say, Light Yagami, the main character of the series,\
          \
        was too smart for his own good. It was interesting to watch him play the game so intently and intricately. Honestly, there were some parts that had me confused and feeling like Light was walking everyone around in circles the way he had things set up. But, nothing a re-watch wouldn't fix. And I'm happy to say that I will be re-watching this series in the future. \
The art style for Death Note had many high notes, and many low notes. The high notes left an impression on me, with intense, bold lines. Complex expressions and beautiful colors and backgrounds. There were times the animation was superb and so well orchestrated that I had to watch it again. \
The low notes were basically character models that looked out of place for a split second, and backgrounds and props that just looked bland and phoned in. At least those low notes didn't last long.\
Overall, Death Note made for an enjoyable watch. It was put together nicely, despite its slow down in the middle of the series, had a great English voice cast, and had you on the edge of your seat at certain moments.  The best entertainment is that which has you completely smitten. And Death Note did just that.\

This anime is a giant game of spy vs. spy.\
While I rated this a 7, that is my bias opinion on it. For as far as the story goes, MAL gives a good overview of it. The artwork and sound track are nothing to be overly impressed or depressed about. But what kills me about this show is the MC, Light. I admit, he is brilliant, tactical and cunning. But he is also a giant douchebag to the point of no salvation. Why I rated this show a 7, is because of him. He is a fucking useless prick with his only redeeming quality\
          \
        being his intelligence. Fix him and overall a better show. But since it didn't happen that is why I am bias about this.\
But also another issue, is they lost sight after L was killed. I have watched this show several times and I am still trying to figure out what the author was trying to do. I do enjoy this show but it is sad to see a masterpiece get lost in itself.\
Overall, I recommend this show. While it is not old enough to be a classic, it a \"classic\" as in a must see. Kind of like Claymore or Code Geass. It is good. The ending is kind of terrible but for how shitty it is, it was well executed. If you haven't seen this show, get out from under your rock and see it. This overall is well done and a brilliant show. \

    === STORY ===\
The story (at least for the first arc of the show) was fairly interesting. Definitely a unique plot, and it was interesting because it is told from the perspective of the bad guy. It was fun to see how planned to avoid being caught for the crimes he commits, and how the main detective in the story (L), is planning on figuring him out.\
Here's the issue. You can only pull off this type of story for about 15-20 episodes, and my interest was waning around the 20 episode point. But then stretching it for another 17 episodes with a new cast of characters\
          \
        really killed it for me. I ended up skipping about 5 episodes and just watching the last 2.\
And I have to say, the ending was one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in an anime. It just cuts off at the end. I guess you could argue that the sudden ending resolves it well, but I thought it was just lazy writing (for various reasons - I won't spoil anything). But overall, the second half of the show, including the ending, felt like filler.\
=== ART ===\
Art was fine. Generic stuff, nothing really fancy to catch your eye.\
=== SOUND ===\
Main theme at the beginning was good. I literally skipped the theme for the second half every time because it was just screamy rock - extremely grating. Somewhat repetitive themes in the soundtrack, but they're definitely recognizable.\
=== CHARACTER ===\
There was only character development in the first 14-ish episodes of the show. After a certain point, the characters didn't change (especially the MC, since he couldn't get much more evil - unless he started killing puppies or something). The MC is a total dick, and is really not someone you want to relate to.\
There weren't too many interesting characters in this series, as it was more focused on plot, so I was a bit disappointed there.\
=== ENJOYMENT ===\
I sort of liked it at the beginning. After a while it got too repetitive and was almost a chore to watch. I mostly finished it because I'd already seen 20 episodes and wanted to see if the ending was worth the time I'd spent watching (it wasn't).\
=== OVERALL ===\
I really think this show is overrated. It's definitely not the best anime of all time, and though it's somewhat original, the execution gets boring after a while. If you watch it, I'd recommend that once you hit the 15 episode mark, skip to the last two episodes. It'll save you time, because there isn't much that happens in between.\

    When I was looking for something to review on MAL(My Anime List), I decided to review deathnote just to spite all the people who are saying its a masterpeice and deserves to be part of everyones life. \
And sadly, I have to agree that this series is a superb example of what Anime can do.\
The premise follows the two examples of Shonen by giving a young man(Light, a inteligent man mind you) A incredible power that only he possesses(The Death note, a book where if you write the name of someone while thinking of their face, that person will die) and he wants to become\
          \
        the top of his society(Where Light wants to kill all the criminals in the world and rule as the new god).\
But thats where the similarites end thankfully. When the Deathnote is explained I would be as smug as Light. How can anyone connect him with a death of a person he never met, he wasn't even near them, and their is no explanation for their demise? This is where we introduce, L.\
L, a famous dectective who never shows his face or real name to anybody, decides to take up the case of all the deaths happening and suprisingly tracks down all of the deaths to a specific city in Japan and determines that the killer is a student...all within 4 episodes.\
You hear that sound? Those are the chess peices at work. L at one end, and Light at the other. If either of them reveals their true identity, they will be killed within moments. But each of them must take one gamble after another to figure out what their identies are.\
The most perfect example of this is where L goes to the graduation cermony of Light(even knowing that all the killer needs is a face and name,which L provided before) and whispers to Light this: \"I am L.\"\
The Shock that came from it amazed me so much that I had to pause my video to think it over. The thought of people actually stopping a anime just to ponder why the F#CK did that character say that is usaully from a bad dub, not from such a clear and truly shocking development.\
I continued on to realize that L was trying to trick Light; If L were to die within those few days of meeting Light, Light was to be suspected and immetialy called the killer. And their is also that L could have used a fake name and Light might accidently kill the famous actor that has that fake name,thus proving he is the killer!\
This Cat and Mouse tatic is continued even farther, and we get to see each of the characters brilliance and sheer cunning.\
But Here is the kick...I immetiatly stopped watching the anime at episode 25.\
And if your a fan of the series, you will know which moment I stopped at.\
I later went on Wikipedia( the bastard I am) and found out that to replace a certain element of the show, we get two kittens after the Cat left. It's not the same as before and will certainly will not be the same for me.\
The Opening soundtrack is just loud and unbearably deppressing for my tastes, the animation was good for a shonen, and the character development...not so much.\
No matter what I said above, Light will still remain the bastard child of Jesus Christ striking down judgment on others that already got whats coming to them. But I am a L person just solely for the fact that L develops a sort of one sided bond to Light that makes me want to kill Light with a hatchet.\
In conclusion: Death note is a strikingly good example of a cat and mouse game, with instantly mind turning moments and shocks and smiles that make you want to jump up and down.\
My advice: watch the series on Youtube. the series twists and turns will make you stay up all night.\

    Death Note is a brilliant story. It has amazing battles - yet instead of swordfights or fighting with ninja techniques, one witnesses a battle of two genius minds. \
  This anime never stopped becoming interesting to me. Every episode, I'm wondering, \"how will Light get out of this seemingly-impossible situation without getting caught? What is going to happen next?\" \
Characters:\
There is a wonderful cast of characters. There's a cool genius, an awkward genius, and a Death God (shinigami) who's antics switch from frightening to totally endearing and hilarious. There's also a lot of other great characters.\
Flaws:\
There were a couple of flaws, but they could\
          \
        be forgiven.\
Soundtrack:\
Every opening and ending sounded great. The other soundtracks were great also, and they fit very well with the situations.\
Dubbed Version:\
The dubbed version is a masterpiece. The voice acting was perfect, the script wasn't changed too much, and they actually managed to pronounce every significant name right! That is something that you almost never see in a normal dubbed anime. \
Death Note is a brilliant anime. It has an amazing battle of wits, but it also leaves room for debate. Which side is justice? \

    Yagami Light finds himself a notebook, dropped by a Shinigami: the Death Note. If you write down the name of a person in this Death Note, he’ll die, no matter what. With this new Death Note, Light begins to create a perfect world, killing off all criminals. Then, a detective who goes by the name of \"L\" gets assigned to catch him.\
Let me first state that Death Note is unique amongst shounen-anime. There are nearly no fights, and nearly the entire anime consists out of people planning and plotting to outsmart each other. Through the course of the anime, Light makes optimal use of the\
          \
        Death Note, and he comes up with a number of really smart and careful plans.\
Because of this, the main good points of Death Note, especially in the beginning, are its surprises. Some plot twists are ingeniously incorporated in the storyline, and they make sure for maximum shock-value. This makes sure for a number of really intense episodes, even with the lack of fighting or other forms of physical action.\
The graphics and music only contribute to this. The art that is used in Death Note is unique, and incredibly detailed. The animators made some really creative \"action\"-scenes, which you won’t be seeing in any other anime, and they really makes sure that these scenes are as creepy as they can get. The music consists out of a number of very addictive choir-songs, which fit the mood perfectly.\
Still, despite the awesome climaxes, this series didn’t make it in the 9/10-range for a reason, as it’s got quite a few humps and bumps along the way. The most obvious one is the middle part of the series. Death Note has an excellent beginning, and an awesome ending, but the Yotsuba-arc in the middle was so bad that it made me almost lose my faith in the series. The climaxes stop being interesting, and the creators turn the series in some kind of joke of itself. Luckily, the anime picks up again with episode 24, and delivers an awesome climax, but the thorn remains. The beginning is also filled with a couple of nasty coincidences, for example Light’s father being the police-officer who is in charge of catching Light.\
There are also a number of rather annoying characters in this anime. I’m referring to the ones that mainly exist for comic relief like Misa and Matsuda. They usually have no purpose at all, and they whine too much to really become interesting. The characters that are introduced later in the series also need a lot of episodes to get enough development to stop getting annoying. There are also quite an amount of people that lack a bit of background. To give one example, we learn just as much about Aizawa’s (a minor character) background as L’s (a major character) background, and believe me, that isn’t much. There’s also a time-leap somewhere in the middle of the series that just lacks proper development as well, with the result that it makes no sense in lots of areas.\
Still, despite this, there are a lot of good characters with enough background to become interesting. Light himself is a fascinating person, and it’s interesting to see how he develops and eventually declines. Some temporary and side-characters also turned out really touching, and L, despite his lack of background is well developed and turns into a really enjoyable character.\
Overall, it’s not the best anime out there, but it’s definitely worth a watch. It has awesome climaxes, but the fairly low rating comes from the fact that it just has too many areas that could have been improved. \

    After watching Code Geass, everyone suggested watching this, so I gave it a go, and was overall disappointed. It was a good anime, but it didn't live up to the anticipation of it. \
Story: 7\
First story arc (before the events leading up to the introduction of near) was 9/10\
It was good, thrilling, interesting and all round amazing. However lost points for how many Marry Sues were in the anime. \
Second (after near was introduced) was 5/10\
It was ok, but WAY to predictable and I didn't enjoy it for that reason. If you watch it you will know what I mean. \
Balanced to 7/10\
\
Art: 9\
Great art,\
          \
        if you have read any of my other reviews you will know by now that I don't like going into detail. So when I say the art is relatively good or great, it is relatively good or great. I mainly rate art based on how good it is compared to other animes of its time. So in this case the art was good, but it was two recent to deserve 10/10\
Sound: 6\
Not that it mattered much in this kind of anime, but the soundtrack was only ok. \
Characters: 3\
WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY to many Marry Sues. The characters were either perfect in every way or imperfect in every way. \
Enjoyment: 8\
First arc 10/10\
Second arc 6/10\
Balanced to a 8/10\
I think I went a little nice on Death Note here, but I give it points for presentation, as it didn't do much else write, but was presented perfectly. \
Overall: 6\
I'm a tough marker, so 6 still means worth watching, but not the best. If you don't want to waste your time, don't watch it. but honestly, if you enjoyed Code Geass, this is worth a watch. \
And to those who haven't watched Code Geass, watch it, its a good anime, unlike this ok anime, and WAY WAY better. \

    Death Note is certainly an Anime I can't help but touch on. Definitely one of the higher ranking Anime out there, this series comes across as one of the most successful shows that has valued intellect and planning over action and fighting. Judging by its individual characteristics, Death Note has decent art and sound, but an outstanding plotline that makes 37 episodes feel like it's gone the same distance as series such as Yuu Yuu Hakusho or Rurouni Kenshin. The downsides to this Anime IMO with regards to its art/sound, is only that I can't stand the dubbed version voicing(even more-so than most), and the\
          \
        lighting is a bit dark(even for an Anime centered around death). The intricacies of all the character actions with their different senses of justice really compel you to not want to stop watching this show until you've figured it all out. The main reason I give Death Note a 9/10 is because I very much disliked the ending, but don't let that discourage you from checking out this series and seeing it all the way through! \

    What can I say about Death Note that hasn’t been said before? It is truly one of the most interesting, suspenseful, exciting animes I have ever seen. \
Most people would say that they lost interest after the second arc. At first upon watching it was quite displeased with the second arc, but in time I grew to love it. In my eyes it took a risk and completely changed the game, it was as if they pulled the rug from underneath you. Then I understood the brilliance of Death Note. \
The characters are compelling. The dialogue and pacing are just as close to perfect as\
          \
        you can get. The show is very dialogue heavy so be prepared to read a lot. \
Death Note is truly one of the most interesting anime’s I have ever seen. It was my crack, because I just wanted to watch more. If you don’t like dialogue heavy animes then probably this isn’t for you. For everyone else come and jump on the Death Note train. ",

    The Death Note is a notebook used by Shinigami to take the lives of human beings, but if it comes into the possession of a human he too can wield its power. Brilliant high school student Light Yagami is bored with life until the day that he finds a Death Note on the ground. When he discovers that its power is real, he becomes determined to create a utopian world free of crime. As Light kills criminals through supernatural means, he becomes known as \"Kira,\" gaining followers and adversaries. With the police helpless to track Kira down, the world's most famous detective, L, takes on\
          \
        the case.\
Death Note is something else. Get ready for an incredibly original premise with non-stop suspense and a level of intelligence that should have you on the edge of your seat. The game of cat and mouse between two truly brilliant characters provides for an entirely new way of watching and interacting with anime: unlike any storyline before it, Death Note had me constantly guessing and, thanks to the twists, I was often wrong. Animation is superb and distinguishes itself from that of comparable series by way of its use of lighting and color to set mood. Audio, too, is commendable: the OST is religious, dark, and creates a sense of suspense perhaps better than any other series that I've yet seen.\
As for voice actors, the Japanese cast is perfect, particularly for Light and L. The English cast, while acceptable, is so different that it often changes the personality of the character entirely (this is especially the case for Light, L, and Misa), and for this reason I strongly recommend you view the show subbed.\
Death Note does have one significant setback, though. While the last 1/3 of the series wasn't bad, the story loses some of its appeal after episode 25 and I think that it would have been held in higher regard had it ended then. This tends to be the response of other viewers, too. Still, Death Note deserves all of the attention that it receives and is one of the few shows that I insist you watch.\
Animation: 8.8/10\
Audio: 8.6/10\

 It is most likely by far the best anime out there.\
Unlike most anime you can watch nowadays, this has the smartest and most twiseted story line in existance. Howeverit is a bit 'heavy' and you'll need your full attention to know what's actually going on.\
The first L arc is completely perfect with L battling light in a test of Intelligence, however the second Near and Mello Arc ends up slightly dragging on. Nothing wrong with this, but towards the end you  may find it quite hard to keep with the storyline and events.\

    Story:\
Very unique.  I have never run across anything like it before nor after.  This series has an intelligent feel to it, and always keeps you on your toes.  However, the second half of the series became a little redundant, or rather- predictive in a sense.  \
Art:\
The art is magnificent.  Not the most beautiful, frilly art per se- though definitely talented.  Eye-candy indeed.  This series uses different angles and view-points very well, and the entire time I watched, I was constantly impressed by how the artists chose to place things on the screen.\

Character:\
Yagami Light (main) is a very interesting fellow, and I found constantly compelled to be on his side.  I will not spoil anything, but he definitely grows and changes throughout the show and in the end is someone entirely different than who he used to be, though in a completely natural way.  You can see the patterns that lead to his final being.  The other characters are generally interesting as well, and it is nice to be able to watch some of them develop.  Although, the second half of the story it seemed the new characters introduced were mainly made to shock the audience, and lacked the depth that a few of the first-half characters held that made you want to really know them.\
Enjoyment:\
An enveloping series.  It draws you in immediately, and keeps you firmly seated to the finish.  Although towards the end the series began to just make me feel dirty, and not in the good way.\

The story itself is really something. Each and every episode is a challenge to the mind  as it makes you wonder what the meaning of each action really is.

    'I'll never turn to the Dark Side'... but Death Note balances you between light and 'Light' in this epic, mind-blowing anime.  There's just something about cheering for the bad guy in this one, and I was constantly torn between good and evil throughout.  The main characters seemed to have everything planned out immaculately, and even when things went astray, they had it under control.  \
     This is an INTELLIGENT anime, and on more than one occasion I had to watch a scene over again to understand what the characters were doing and the logic behind it.  I\
          \
        just kept waiting for the one fatal mistake, but it is definitely the buildup before that's the reason to watch.  It just feels so good to watch a complicated plan come together.  Death Note does not, however, dwell on morality, even though it straddles it constantly.  I wouldn't consider this extremely deep, and while it has several serious tones regarding life, death, and human depravity, these are not what makes this show great for me.  \
So, if you're looking for something smart, different, and a bit dark, Death Note is for you.\

    dont have intention of stealing others work, but this anime is one of the best, no doubt about it ^.^\
the reason i watched this anime is because it got me favourite voice actor, Miyano, Mamoru, from Ouran to Eureka Seven to Death Note. and i have to say he is a very talented voice actor as well :=)\
i actually pretty surprise how the story goes, because most of the story within anime is pretty straight forward and kinda easy to understand, but with Death Note, one must stay ahead of the other in other, well, not to be capture, or kill.\
the art of Death Note\
          \
        is, in my opinion, to see the nature of human being after acquire a god-like power. again, blending the storyline in the art of human being is simply terrific.\
background music and tones of voice actors are amazing, thats one of the reason i prefer Japanese voice than english voice. especially with the background music when Light commit those writing in The Note.\
Character design ? brilliant. simply brilliant. all characters acquire different roles and those short-appearance like FBI agent, Ray Penbar, amazing. some anime do have some short-appearance like him, but with Death Note, you can see some characters like him.\
enjoyment ? max. enough said.\
overall, best of the best. thats why this anime still in top 5 after weeks and weeks. ;-)",

    Every episode from beginning till the very end was very interesting, and I just could not stop watching it !\
The story was very well-considered, and in each episode was at least one plot-twister, which made the plot unpredictable till the last episode.\
There was lots of personality in each of characters, so it was interesting to watch it, and more interesting was the thing how they changed after those 5 years that was displayed in anime. \
It was also very interesting to watch, how almost all of the main characters met their end. :))\
Every episode was very exciting, and now I just can't find any anime\

    Death Note is definately one the best animes ever produced. For me, it's where fantasy met reality. It has a normal high school student bored out of his mind and the worlds greatest detective out to find him. The only unrealistic thing (in a good way) is the notebook itself. \
The characters are similar in that they are so unique. Each character has a special trait about them or unusual habit such as eating sweets, playing with their hair, interesting ways of sitting, eating chocolate constantly, or eating apples at every chance. One very interesting quality of this anime is that there is no definite\
          \
        good or evil character. You decide for yourself what is justice in the world. Are the rotten better off dead?\

    Anime: Death note\
Title: My expectations have been satisfied.\
About the Anime: Have you ever felt like the world would be a better place if certain people weren’t around? Such grim daydreams might occur when watching the dismal daily news, but on one fateful day, Yagami Light finds that these daydreams can become reality. By pure happenstance, he comes across a black notebook entitled \"Death Note\", whose text within states that whoever's name is written on its pages will die. With the aid of the death god Ryuk, Light takes it upon himself to rid the world of its corruption, ushering in a new era of purity\
          \
        one death at a time. But as Ryuk foretells, Light's actions will not go unchallenged...\
Story 9/10: Ordinarily, I make a point to avoid series plagued by fanboyism, as they generally suffer from pitiful characterization, flimsy storylines, and sub-par aesthetics. Yet, Death Note carried some strange allure and managed to pique my interest, so I decided to give it a shot. I would not be disappointed. It's one of those gems that graces the anime world only every so often and certainly deserves a considerable amount of respect.\
At its core, Death Note is an anime that captivates you with a story fashioned around logic, wit, trust, and betrayal. Filled with deep characters and weaved with intensity, it grips you from start to finish with amazing vice. It traces the story of Yagami Light, a young college student who has become disillusioned with the pervasiveness of crime and corruption spread throughout the world. Purely by accident, he stumbles upon a book called a Death Note, which allows its author to kill any person of his or her choosing by merely writing their name inside, given that they know the person's name and face. Though at first skeptical, Light decides to use its powers to cleanse the world of evil, and thus begins his quest for justice.\
What immediately follows, however, is a conglomerate struggle of ethics and morality. Death Note presents a surprisingly detailed scenario in which the definition of absolute justice is blurred and the true nature of morality is put into question. Unlike other pseudo-intellectual anime that attempt to provide naïve approaches to such tough subjects, though, it does not step lightly around any of its subject matter. The script writers do a fantastic job at presenting the storyline in dramatic fashion without drowning out its substance in philosophy. There are a number of such elements that the series touches upon, but each and every one is seamlessly streamlined into the anime.\
Due to the nature of Death Note's story, however, it's incredibly difficult to present an accurate, detailed reflection of the plot without giving important details away. The drama is presented in a very cumulative fashion, with each individual episode building upon the intricacies and complexities of the last. For a series built so strongly around logic, this is definitely a strength rather than a weakness. You'll find yourself gripped from the first minute until the last, carried on by numerous twists and turns that keep the story both fresh and intriguing with each installment.\
Animation 10/10: Death Note takes the liberty of incorporating some of the best shading effects to date. Grasping emotions and moods with unrivaled precision, detail pervades every inch of every scene. One of Death Note's greatest assets is its ability to immerse the viewer into the anime itself, and the animation here definitely plays a major role in making that happen. Camera angles are taken to accentuate facial expressions, shadows fashion character designs, and the scenery defines moods. Death Note's aesthetics reflect the essence of the storyline itself, and are awash with metaphorical splendor that can be appreciated on a number of different levels.\
Sound 8/10: Oddly enough, two of Death Note's lowest points are the average quality opening and ending themes. Though they certainly capture the mood of the series well enough, they aren't too impressive as individual tracks. Aside from these songs, however, the vast majority of the insert music is above par; save for a very few select pieces, it's surprisingly well orchestrated. The voice acting is where Death Note's sound score really shines, though, especially with Light -- I felt his actor captured his personality and expressions with pinpoint accuracy. By in large, this same standard of quality assumes itself in all but one character, so be prepared for a treat in this category.\
Character's 9/10: Again, commenting on the characters is hard because Death Note continually builds upon itself the story progresses. Though I didn't particularly care for some of the development of a few side characters, every person to appear throughout the series has a distinct purpose. The number of extraneous characters is kept to a virtual minimum, and those who serve little purpose only appear for as long as they are needed; you certainly won't find a plethora of useless fluff here. The writers went through the series with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that each fills his or her respective role with the utmost of precision, making sure only to assimilate those who are necessary for the dramatic elements of the plot.\
Overall 9/10: To conclude, I'm incredibly impressed with Death Note. While, like any other anime, it does have its flaws, as a whole they are relatively minor. There are a few ups on downs throughout the course of the thirty-seven episodes, but the vast majority of time is spent very wisely. To its fortune, the series is constructed in such a way that it has a nearly universal sense of appeal, and as such should not be passed up. Most definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so make sure to check it out if you have not done so already.\

    This anime is all about a notebook which fell from the sky and Light Yagami picks it up. \
This notebook is known as \"Death Note\" for whoever's name is written on it, the person will die with sudden death. It will be ineffective on people who are 200 year above age.\
I first watched death note in the live-action movie.\
We are introduced to Light Yagami, a brilliant genius who made good use of the death note to destroy evil. He used his name \"Kira\" to cover up his identity just like Lelouch used his name \"Zero\" to cover up his identity too.\
L, the charater and my\
          \
        favorite in this series, a genius like Light, he is a detective who solves almost difficult cases in the world. L wanted to get to know Light so that he could understand the relationship between Kira and Light. L is stoic, calm and collected just like Yakumo Tskamoto from School Rumble.\
Ryuk is like this guy who talks like a grandpa.\
The annoying brat, Misa Amane, who is useless and always has a clingy personality. She always relies on Light in everything she do even though she is smart. \
The art is not so dull but this anime is about a detective story of hunting the serial killer. In fact, like Detective Conan and the bone Collector.\
If Light made use of the death note for good, then that's ok. However, if he is using the death note for his satisfaction and glory then that's terrible. They say that killing is not a way to solve everything and in fact people may change from bad to good. We wouldn't know.\
To me, the characters even though they are likable except for Misa, they still didn't leave enough impression to me.\
I always grade based on the plot and characters. I also wanted Light Yagami to really learn how to understand people's feelings rather than seeking for glory.\
Misa Amane pulled down the grade for me because of her useless and annoying personality. She keeps saying her name twice.\
The music was not so engaging. To me, the story was all right. Nothing let for me to say. \
But overall, I would say this anime is all right. 6/10 \

Light and L's motivations are at the core of the storyline and you will most likely be cheering on one or other.\

    Critic's Log - Earthdate: March 17, 2013. Review #40: Death Note\
*Robotic computer voice* To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven: A time to be born, And a time to die. Oh... *Ahem* Greetings... I am G... *sigh* Let's just get right into the review, shall we?\
Light Yagami is an above average student with great prospects, who's bored out of his mind. One day he sees something fall from the sky and then he finds... The \"Death Note\", a notebook from the realm of the Shinigamis, with the power to kill people in any way he desires. With the Death\
          \
        Note in hand, Light decides to create his perfect world, without crime or criminals. However, when criminals start dropping dead one by one, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer, and a battle of wits, deception and logic ensues...\
\
To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse production and the animation is really damn gorgeous in this show. and there are some epic moments of animation in this show, so expect some really cool effects when you get to them. The designs, backgrounds, and certain effects are simply just dashing to looking at and Madhouse doesn't disappoint here.\
\
\
The music by Hideki Taniuchi and Yoshihisa Hirano is also another highlight in Death Note. Every song in this show gives Death Note its epic-esque atmosphere and the soundtrack fits the mood greatly in Death Note.  These two guys don't really have a lot of musical scores before and since and I hope to hear either of them do more anime scores in the future. The openings and closings are also nice. The first opening is a pretty good J-pop song and the first closing theme is also pretty good too, The second opening sure grabbed many people's attention with its heavy metal beat and heavy lyrics and it kicked ass. The second closing also kicks ass. With that said, the music does not disappoint.\
\
\
When it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is really...really damn good, but it's not perfect. Mamoru Miyano really nailed this one as Light and he is one talented seiyu. Kappei Yamaguchi is also pretty good as L. Aya Hirano was...uh... a little too eccentric as Misa and the voice is a little slightly off. The standout extras include Keiji Fujiwara as Aizawa, Kimiko Saito as Rem, Maaya Sakamoto as Takada, Masaya Matsukaze as Mikami, Naoya Uchida as Soichiro Yagami, Noriko Hidaka as Near, Nozomu Sasaki as Mello, and Shidou Nakamura as Ryuk. On the English Dub side. Brad Swaile is terrific as Light Yagami (but I think Mamoru Miyano perfected the role) Alessandro Juliani is also terrific as L Lawleit and this is one of his rare anime roles in his career because he's more of a TV actor then being a voice actor. He outshines L's seiyu and he's the highlight of the dub. Shannon Chan-Kent is also terrific as Misa Amane and she also doesn't do much anime roles. She is also a great singer.\
Speaking of singing, did you know she was the singing voice of one crazy eccentric party animal?\
\
Yes! She's the singing voice of Pinkie Pie from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Besides that, the standout extras in the dub are Brian Drummond as Ryuk and he sounds like he had... SO MUCH FUN as Ryuk.Cathy Weseluck as Near, Chris Britton as Soichiro Yagami, Colleen Wheeler as Rem, Kirby Morrow as Mikami, Trevor Devall as Aizawa, and Vincent Tong as Matsuda. Death Note is an anime that's great in both versions. Karl Willems is also the one responsible for directing the dub and this guy is known for directing one famous dub such as InuYasha. This is by far one of his best ADR director roles to date and he did fantastic with the dub of Death Note.\
\
\
The characters themselves are fine but there is some problems with character development. Light and L have great psychological development for sure but everyone else is a bit underdeveloped. Light on the other hand is quite the interesting case, even though he was bored before he picked up the Death Note. He does develop a God complex and becomes corrupted by the Death Note. That is an interesting part of Death Note. L is a bit odd but he's also an interesting character as well for someone who's a persistant little bugger when it comes to finding the suspect. Even though some characters are a bit underdeveloped, some are interesting and memorable.\
\
\
I will say that Death Note was starting to turn out to be a total masterpiece until the story shifts into its second arc, that is when the show went from being a masterpiece into a show that is barely watchable. The first 25 episodes are terrific on their own and if the show were to have its own ending and end right after this arc, I would have marked this show as a Masterpiece, but this second arc exists and it is nowhere as terrific as the first arc. If there's anything that redeems this, it would have to be the last 3 or 4 episodes of the show. Those last 3 or 4 episodes are actually pretty good and I actually think the second arc is actually a decent second half of the show, it's just not on the same level as the first arc of Death Note. Toshiki Inoue did pretty good with the composition in writing and Tetsuro Araki's directing was pretty damn epic. The show could've been a Masterpiece if it was just as well thought of during the second half, but most of the show is very good and Death Note is proof of that.\
\
\
Death Note is available by Viz Media, The manga written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated in fine detal by Takeshi Obata is also available by Viz Media. The Death Note Novel \"Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases\" is available by Viz Media. The Death Note \"Rewrite\" movies which are compilation movies of both arcs is also available by Viz Media. The Death Note video games never made it stateside. The Death Note Live-action film series is available by Viz Pictures and Warner Bros. An American live-action film was proposed years ago and it has never been green-lit to this day and I hope it never sees the light of day.\
\
With all that said, Death Note is a work of art with its beautifully detailed epic animation, and an epic soundtrack. Some characters are underdeveloped and the show falls short with a second arc that doesn't live up to the first until the show is near its end. Death Note is still a show worth checking out for all the reasons I believe the show is good for and for other completely different reasons. If you haven't seen this anime yet, make sure to write this down on your notebook on your list of animes to watch.\
\
I give Death Note a 8.6 out of 10. It is VERY GOOD!\

    Death note is a well done strategy anime and deserves its hype.\
The fun of the death note is the it isn't just shock value like Madoka Magica, Attack On Titian and SAO,it is more about how he goes about killing people in creative ways. \
Not just pity death, but real weight behind them.\
The protagonist, Light Yagami,(like keima from the TWGOk).is one of the more genuinely smart protagonists. He is smart not just cause of his status and knowledge, but how he uses what he  knows.\
Long term, multi- step planning is his forte and it shows. It isn't just about one isolated scene but the\
          \
        narrative progression.\
The death note has well-defined established rules and is CONSISTENT(I'm looking at you Madoka).Death note takes its plot seriously.\
His character development is special and is downward, and yes it can be negative.\
He starts off as a guy with lofty ambitions to want to make the world a better place but being corrupted by power became is own worst enemy till the end.\
Two major problems with the show that it lacks a theme, its more about Kira himself that the implications of his actions.\
Another one is that the villans(good guys is this series) could be better done. The first one can threaten light by pure luck and chance there is a method  to his madness, but yes it is a bit contrived.\
The 2nd half featured a villan that defeated light in the most bs way possible. Considering that the contingency was already in place.\
Great yes, but did not live up to its true potential.\

    death note is an anime that will make you think, sit on the tip of your chair,and even choose a side, who are you rooting for, L or light? \
the best thing about this anime is that it completely strays away from the norm, there is no ''i can't do it and then on the last moment suddenly get power'' in this anime and no ''the power of friends!'' bullcrap. we have had enough of that and both those things need to go.\
the anime is a battle with smart executions, and a great soundtrack to support the crazy dark feeling this anime can sometimes give.\
          \
the animation sometimes looks a bit weird, but i think that is intentional as it supports this feeling.\

    Where do I begin with Death Note? I loved the manga (for the most part). The series was a brilliantly thought out game of cat and mouse with dark undertones. It was like watching/reading a twisted mental chess game between L and Light. Oh...L and Light. As a girl who loves Death Note, most people would assume I'd go all girly over the fanservice given in the anime series. The scene on the roof in the rain where Light seems all concerned for L's health and even helps him dry off on the staircase...I wanted to puke. It was despicable. \
Also despicable was the change\
          \
        in the very end of the series. \
SPOILERS AHEAD*\
Manga: Light dies like a worm begging for his life until the very end.\
Anime: Light dies beautifully on a staircase in the warm sun, having barely begged Ryuk to save him. \
It was awful! I sadistically laughed in the end of the manga when I saw our hero-turned-villian turn into a whiny little baby and then die, broken and betrayed by Ryuk. I didn't fully hate the anime, other than these two points it followed the manga as well as it could. Nonetheless, I wouldn't watch it again. \

    I started the series quite enthusiastically having received great reviews, but I was not mesmerized or hypnotized by the series at all. I mostly crawled my way through most of it. The little battle between L and Light was definitely something  and Light's genius cannot be ignored but major portions were a drag. and some of the scenes were overly dramatic. I would definitely not count it as one of the best anime, it was average, yes but not great.\

    How To Use It\
The human whose name is written in this note shall die.\
DeathNote is a Mystery/Psychological anime based on the manga by Tsugumi Ohba and published by Shueisha. The 37 episode anime comes from Madhouse, originally airing from October 2006 to June 2007. Viz Media holds rights to both the anime and manga series. Two light novels, two games, and two live-action film adaptations were also created between 2006 and 2009.\
Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects, who's bored out of his mind. One day he finds the \"Death Note\": a notebook from the realm of the Death Gods, with the power\
          \
        to kill people in any way he desires. With the Death Note in hand, Light decides to create his perfect world, without crime or criminals. However, when criminals start dropping dead one by one, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer, and a battle of wits, deception, and logic ensues... (Anime News Network)\
The art and animation stye of DeathNote are simply stunning! Mixing a gothic art style with minimal animation and a very over the top soundtrack, this series is just a real visual pleasure that you can watch over and over again. The downside of all this, however, is the small amount of animation because almost the entirety of DeathNote is dialogue. From people talking to each other to the many, MANY monologues,  all you hear is talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. When the animation does comes into play, Studio Madhouse certainly took it over the top! I never knew writing in a notebook would be so awesome! That and eating chips.\
The main plot of the story is a fun one to watch because it is all just mind games. You don’t even care about how Light keeps killing people, or L eating sweets, because your attention is drawn to the logic battle between these two characters. For the first half of the series, you are just sucked into the battle Light and L conduct with each other and you pretty much have to force yourself away from the screen in order to do simple tasks like eat, sleep, and use the bathroom... Okay, I’m over exaggerating a bit, but you get my point. Th In the second half, when things are turned over to Near and Mello, the story kind of dies and at this point you’re wondering when something really awesome will happen, so it ends up taking away what makes the series truly amazing, but not by a staggering amount. It just wouldn’t have made a difference adding in Near and Mello and just stuck with L. The mind games are still there, but you’re mostly focused on Light more then anything for the rest of the series. However, the last episode truly makes up for it, and it certainly will leave the viewer satisfied. You may even wanna watch the last episode again and again because of how well done it is!\
The characters of DeathNote have no development to them what so ever. Now, usually, I harp on an anime for lack of developed characters, however I can’t really do that here. You can tell that Madhouse wanted to focus on the story and the art style instead of fully developed characters, but is the series terrible because of it? Not in the least. Outside of Light and L, the characters are one note, leaving all your attention on what really matters, the mind games.\
Both the Japanese and English languages were done very well, so when picking a version to watch it will have to be personal preference. Even though both are well done, there are a couple pieces to point out for each one. If you’re looking for a very well done portrayal of L, then look no further then the Dub. Alessandro Juliani (Ranma 1/2) was the perfect choice for the role. He adds the right amount of intelligence and, sometimes, childish behavior L gives off. To be honest, if you watch the English version it should be for L because he carries the show partially on his own. Kappei Yanaguchi is just as well done in the Japanese version, but Juliani is far more superior. Now Light is a bit of a different case. Both versions are well done as well, however, if you want to find a better consistent version of Light then I suggest Mamoru Miyano and the Japanese version. Even though Brad Swaile (Mobile Suit Gundam) did a very good take of Light, it took quite a few episodes before it seemed more natural sounding. After that, Swaile even ends up on the same level as Miyano. Some other voice actors for DeathNote include: Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa Amane, Brian Drummond as Ryuk, Chris Britton as Chief Yagami, Vincent Tong as Touta Matsuda, French Tickner as Watari, and Kirby Morrow as Teru Mikami.\
Now, I mentioned this in my \"Memorable Anime Villains\" with Hasteaguy back in August, but I feel it’s worth mentioning again. A lot of people get into the debate as to whether Light was doing the right thing and is just an anti-hero rather then the villain of the series. The most used claim is that he was mislead by the DeathNote. However, like I’ve previously said, you have to have bad intentions to begin with if you want to create a new world where you can be God. Plus, declaring that you’ll be God in the first episode doesn’t show that you have the best intentions from the start. Sorry, Kira clan, but Light is in no way a hero. But he does make for a fun character to watch.\
At the end of the day, DeathNote is a visual stunner that takes simple things like writing in a notebook and takes it over the top. If you’re not bothered but constant dialogue or very underdeveloped characters, and LOVE mystery and psychological anime then I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this anime. Admittedly, I was a bit hesitant about watching DeathNote, and didn’t see why people are such huge fans of the series, but after watching this a few times now I can understand why.\
GO TEAM L!...... Oh wait....... Nevermind.......\

    Ever thought of killing someone you disliked to make the world a better place in almost a blink of an eye? Well death note is the perfect example of this\
Light Yagami believes this to be true, why not watch this anime to find out how fun it is for light yagami to start killing people without even physically touching them? It will be worth the watch...\
Overall I thought the anime is a masterpiece because the main character was evil unlike most main characters in other animes and he has a goal which he is determined to achieve through any means. \
If you like mystery animes\
          \
        and don't mind a lot of people dying then this might be a good anime for you to watch.\

    I deciding to take off my hipster-specs and watch the insanely popular anime I couldn't stop hearing about. After watching Bakuman (from the same creative team) I was curious. I decidedI might as well watch this BS since I had nothing better to do. I shrugged and turned it on, then in a few hours I was halfway through the series watching nonstop with my eyes glued to the screen.\
Story- I'll try to keep it simple. Death Note is about a high school prodigy named Light Yagami who stumbles upon a notebook with the power to kill anyone by visualizing them and writing their name\
          \
        in it. Contrary to what his name would imply, he soon becomes a raging psychopath and sets off on his mission to murder every criminal he can think of. Soon enough, the government decides to investigate the so called \"Kira\" and enlist the help of the mysterious genius L..whose face, whereabouts and overall identity have been revealed to no one.\
SPOILERS AHEAD:\
If I was reviewing this series of the first major story arc alone, it would probably fall in the 9-10 scale. I'll say without a doubt that L has to be one of the greatest characters ever created. He's by far the most interesting thing about the show, and I found him more compelling than his adversary Light. Light's the villain (He's the main character and all but any way you slice it he's the villain of this story) the problem, at least for me, is that he's unlikeable. And by that I mean he's not a villain you \"love to hate\" his a villain that just makes you sick. I guess that's a good thing, if that's what they're going for, but he doesn't have any charm to his character. Imagine the Joker if they took away all his clown stuff and made him stop laughing, then sent him off on his way. I understand this approach may appeal to some people (A lot of you in fact) but personally I dislike this writing. Which leads me to my next point, something I think most of us here can agree on: After L dies the show begins to suck.\
As I said, L is by far the best character, and the most interesting. The fun of the series came from seeing him go up and battle against Light in the intellectual Cat & Mouse game that drove the series initially. As I said, it's fantastic this way. No matter who you route for (in my case L) you're at the edge of your seat the whole time. However, no matter who you route for, after L is taken away from the story, that fun is gone and we see L replaced. And I'll scream this from the rooftops: NEAR SUCKS! \
Near (and to some extent Mello) is a character thrown in last minute to replace L. 1. L was so great that he set the bar pretty high 2. They didn't even try to top him and just made Near almost a carbon copy. Except without all the eccentricities that made L work.\
Near doesn't come close to the amount of impact that L had. He's not entertaining to watch, and thus the thrill of watching him battle Light is not there. I do kinda like that he wins in the end and Light dies (I hadn't been ever that happy about a fictional person dying in my life) however the means by which this conclusion was brought on are painfully lackluster at best. I honestly had to skip a few episodes to get to the end because I honestly couldn't take it.\
In the end, I'd say this series was worth a look for the disturbed, eccentric genius of L alone, but with the added benefit of a great story, and compelling writing it far surpassed my expectations, even with all the hype surrounding it. However, with a second half so astronomically inferior and the classic mistake of killing off the best character in effect, it's sadly brought down to a 7, at least from my honest opinion.\
..............Seriously, f*ck Near\

    Let's see here... Death Note is a really f*cking great anime, the only bad thing I can come up with is one character, and one character only: Misa Amane, god she was annoying, other than that it's flawless, IMO.\
Now, enough about pointless stuff.\
Story: You already got a synopsis of the story so I won't go too deep in it.\
Light Yagami, a 17-year old genius who finds a notebook with the words \"Death\" and \"Note\" on it.\
With this book he wants to cleanse the world from criminals and become the god of the \"new world\".\
Art: I really loved the art style, the animation and the character\
          \
        designs, there's not one bad thing that I can come up with about the art.\
Sound: Holy f*cking sh*t I loved the openings of Death Note,\
\"Season 1\": Standard anime theme. I thought it was the better one if I'm going to be honest with you.\
\"Season 2\": DEATH METAL! Don't get me wrong, I love Death metal and this song. To be honest, I didn't exepct Death metal on a Death Note intro, it didn't quite fit as an intro for Death Note.\
The voice acting was outstandiong (even in the english dub).\
Character: And now the characters, we have Light, L, Misa, Ryuk and some police officers (not trying to spoil too much), I liked the idea with Light trying to bring justice to the world and become the new god, L, a professional detective (mush like Cole Phelps in L.A Noire), really likes sugary things and hate socks. L is my favourite character in Death Note, I don't know what it was that made me like him so much (no gay), Misa Amane *sigh* she was really annoying as I mentioned in the beginning of my review, I can best describe her as \"an annoying goth girl\" (assuming she's gothic, just look at her room).\
And last but not least: Ryuk, a shinigami who is really addicted to apples (much like me and energy drink) and doesn't really do much to help Light with the Death Note thing, like, not giving him important information.\
Enjoyment: I enjoyed Death Note really much, I would say that it's the best anime ever if it wasn't for Azumanga Daioh, the reason it took so long for me to finnish is was that my computer crashed in the middle of it and I tend to forget some important things, but it worked out in the end.\
Overall: Death Note, a really geat anime, can't really remember why I think it's so f*cking great, but go see it if you haven't, and if you have...well go see it again cause it's really good.\
Bottom line: Watchable, re-watchable, but not too much, it get's boring that way.\

    Oh my god this is one of the best things I've ever seen I cant believe this is only 17 this should at least be 5 or 6 I love this show to no content. Bleach and Dbz were not even close to how amazing the story is . It is about a high schooler named light who hates where the world has gone all of the sudden a note book falls from the sky and lands right in front of him and he takes it home cause wouldn't you? When he starts reading it he thinks it's a joke that if you write someone's\
          \
        name in the book they will die so he tries it and it works so he plans he will use the book to make the world free of evil. This is not only cool but awesome in every sense. The art I could not believe how good it was and the music holy cow is it awesome the opening the world is permenintly on my phones ringtone it is just so awesome. The characters are also amazing light is so cool L is such a great character and ryuk is a funny as heck and the side characters are also great except for one if you have seen the show you know who. But fanboy aside this is a great anime with one of the best storylines ever so I give it a 10 out of 10\

    This, which was my first-ever-seen anime, is yet one of the best I've seen so far. And it's name's quite known along anyone you pass it by.\
The story is really amazing, and you should prepare yourself for watching this knowing that you won't have much of a will for not to go watch the next episode. One of this anime's strong points is the 'chess match-like' structure of the story, so if you've already watched other animes such as 'Mirai Nikki' or even 'Code Geass' and enjoyed them, you should be able to enjoy this one as well.\
Regarding the art, I'll feel like saying it's\
          \
        one of the best I've seen so far: it fits the story and creates an atmosphere that matches every single character and turning point.\
The sound it's pretty good, and about the openings, don't worry: if you think the first one doesn't match the nature of the show at all, just be patient. Maximum the Hormone will match it wildly.\
The characters are just marvelous. I can't say more or I'll start spitting 'til my mouth's dry, so I might just better shut up.\
The result is a very enjoyable and solid anime, just as said, one of the best I've ever seen. Though I must say that it's definately not the best.\
Anyway, I hope this was helpful, but furthermore I hope you enjoy the anime!\

    I love love LOVED Death Note! It is definitely the best anime I've seen so far. The story is very interesting, an average high school boy who goes from, well, average, to a 'psycotic murderer', as I like to put it. The story is pretty much a game of cat and mouse between L and Light/Kira until Near and Mello arc starts. I love the way the characters think, they are extremely smart and I feel by watching this anime my deductive skills have raised. Even though I dont particularly 'like' Light, the way he outsmarts L, the greatest detective in the world, numerous times\
          \
        is beyond my mind. Although L outsmarts Light quite a few times as well(the 'only broadcasting in the Kanto(or however you spell it) region was a nice move), and in the end, I think L did solve the case, to bad he wasnt there to officially do it.\
Then there is the characters. L, for me, was definitely my favorite character. He was so smart, not to mention attractive.What more could you ask for? His love for sweets is unique, and I have no idea how he can wear the same clothes every day. As for Light, I think you cant exactly judge him. His perspective of right and wrong is different from others, so this is what he saw as right. Its a shame; when Light 'awakens' from being Kira while being locked up, you can see the innocence and kindness in his eyes. The Death Note turned his in to a killer who simply killed anyone who got in his way. \
After the L arc, we see the Near and Mello arc. I dont understand why people dislike it. Of course, L died, and it IS sad, trust me, I was depressed too.But that same old Light and L thing would get boring after a while, dont ya think? I think a \
new arc really spices it up a little. \
In the beginning, I liked this arc, but hated the new characters introduced(Mello and Near), but I grew to like them (no just Mello) and now I am in love with him.\
My opinion on Near is a heartless, emotionless person. Even L had more emotions then this guy. Near just doesnt really do anything. He makes everyone do stuff FOR him, instead of doing it himself, like Mello. He depends on others to do so many things for him, and his child like nature may seem cute, but it is weird at the same time, who would want to date a guy like that. He also doesnt show the slightest bit of emotion or sorrow when some of the SPK members die when they are standing by him, and in one of the movies when that other guy takes the shot for him and blood splatters on his face, he really doesnt seem to care. Plus he mocks L(stating he is a 'looser') and he is such a copycat of L as well.\
Mello is another character who shows up in this arc. My first thought of Mello was a gay angry girly person who is a horrible character. But after a while I started to like him. He shows emotions, something a few characters fail to provide. He is genuinely angry and sad that L is dead, while Near seems to not care at all. The way he went to live on his own at the age of 15 is daring and just goes to show, Mello will do anything to get to where he wants. He eventually joins the mafia because that is more his style and even goes as far as blackmailing the president to catch Kira. Mello will do anything to get his way, and he is very out there, thats what I love about him. He is very emotional(even stating himself that he is), but it eventually ends up costing him his life .\
The end was amazing, I didnt expect Light to die in such a way. I think the ending was perfect, but I kind of wish Near wouldve died. To me, the only good character that lived was Matsuda.\
 That is why I give this a 10.\

    First I think I should say that I LOVE Deathnote .It’s really amazing in almost every way but I think anime ruined it. I bought Deathnote box set with all 13 manga (yes 13! The thirteenth one was detail review of all characters story and tons of cool stuff like how to draw characters and extra chapters from other characters life's). Manga is really much better! If you like Deathnote and haven't read it then you must (and if you can BUY IT. Believe me it’s much better to have it around and much more enjoyable to read than on pc)! Anime skips some small\
          \
        parts from story and just feels unfinished. It looks like people who made anime were not concerned to make high quality one and you can feel it. It’s not enjoyable : / I read whole manga about 4 or 5 times and couldn’t finish anime (even 10 episodes). So if I would give manga 12/10 than anime deserves 6.5/10. Sorry all anime fans but that’s just my opinion. (Also sorry for my bad English :D I’m trying my best!)\

    Death Note is great anime because it composes of many vital elements that make a anime good. These elements are a fantastic story line, life-like art style, and one of my favorite is the music. The story was so good I had to watch it again and again, and it got better until the cliffhanger in episode 25. Episodes 1-25 really had a impact on what anime I watch today, and days to come, but what really caught my attention was the art style. The art style compared to other anime just seemed more realistic and had a greater effect on the viewer. It just\
          \
        had a element to it that no anime has come comparable to. Music is what I think gives this show its credit, but I still have to go with the story. The music in Death Note was more classical instead of what you here today in anime. Not only that but the classical music was sometimes blended with techno which gave it more of a modern day feel to it. Death Notes formula to me is what I like to call the perfect storm because mostly everything was great except episode 26-37 which I thought killed the series and totally ruined my point of view of this anime. But in the end Death Note to me still reigns as one of the beast anime's, and is still today.\

    This is, by far, my favorite anime of all time. Everything about it was just amazing, with an absolutely awesome storyline packed into 37 episodes. \
Story 9/10\
The story of this anime is perfect, and i liked it a lot, because the story was complex and very interesting. I would definitely have given this anime a perfect 10/10 if it were not for the ending! Because of spoilers, I'm not going to say anything about it, but for all of you out there who have watched the anime, I'm sure the majority of you would agree with me. (this is just a personal opinion, feel free\
          \
        to think otherwise!)\
Art 10/10\
The art was overall very nice. I really loved all the character designs and compared to some other animes, the art design of the entire anime was spectacular. The art in this anime really gives off the dark aura that it is supposed to be about. \
Sound 9/10\
The music played in this anime is really nice, and most of the time, usually all the time, fits into the story perfectly, matching the evil vibe the story gives off. Another personal preference, but, my favorite music piece in Death Note is definitely Light Yagami's first theme. The voice acting was truly amazing, but FOR SURE, WHAT TAKES THE CAKE, IS LIGHTS LAUGH! \
Character 10/10\
As i stated above, i really liked the character design of all the characters, specifically L, with a truly distinctive personality, and one you wouldn't really expect from a master detective. The rest of the characters were drawn out nicely, and i really liked Light's design theme. \
Enjoyment 9/10\
I really liked this anime. For sure. The beginning storyline is great, especially his struggles against L, but like I said above as well, the ending disappointed me a lot. (No spoilers!)(also a personal preference!) This anime really kept you on the edge of your seat, and in the final two episodes, cliff-hanged the sh*t out of me!\
Overall 10/10\
For an overall rating, i would give this anime a 10/10. Easily. Everything about it was great, and i loved it all because everything just slid into place, truly forming a fantastic anime. I would definitely recommend this anime to people, as it is only 37 episodes long, (imho, not THAT long of an anime, especially when compared to Naruto, Bleach, or One Piece.) Plus, i garentee that this anime is not going to bore you at all.  ",

The story is dark and is little bit complicated. But its fast paced and really works out well. The back story of L and Light is not much told but it doesn't take the fun away.

    Death Note.\
This is the best anime i've seen, Untill they destroyed it. I enjoyed every minute of the anime, for story, and what made me like it is that most people would act like Light if they had the guts.\
However the series is unbearable after 15 episodes, and there is where they destroyed this anime. They had the option of making the worlds most watchable anime or they had the option of creating a sucking cloaka that wouldn't even be touched by roaches. Seriously I were angry and screaming and felt hate inside my brain. If I had a Death Note the whole production crew\
          \
        would die within five minutes.\
They just couldn't resist making a bad anime. It was like they had a gun and was pointing it towards a person and actually pulled the trigger.\
The first part of the anime is 10+ straight trough. the second part is 0- yea, it have good parts like when Light devices the plot to get back his memory. But that not the point. They should have stopped in the begging.\
The art was exeptional, the sound was exeptional, Carachter was great. Enjoyment was great, overall great. \
I choose to belive that the later plot line never happened. There were 16 episodes in this anime. And Light were busted after that and learned his lesson or something like that. and everything went well.\

    A Fantastic and Intruiging Story..\
Death Note is an anime that will keep you glued till the screen because you want to find out what next plot \"Yagami Light\" or \"L\" have up their sleeves. \
The plot and idea revolving Death Note is so original. I think we all know that.\
The characters are VERY unigue in each of their own way (both appearance and personality), the entertainment and especially the dialogues are supreme. I couldn't stop watching it, I was so attached to the show! \
The music fits the show perfectly, this very dark and sometimes bright side of the anime makes a great blend. All\
          \
        I gotta say is: Fantastic job both Yoshihisa Hirano and Hideki Taniuchi, for composing such amazing soundtracks.\
The art style is pretty detailed and looks fantastic. Especially the characters, but also all of the objects that occur in it.\
Death Note is one of those anime series which I am proud to have watched. Unlike many other anime, Death Note does not rely on completely outrageous actions. Just as the entire anime is based on a very impossible notion of Death Note, the beauty comes from all is deductive element, that make it rise above all that supernatuarality. It took only one episode to get me hooked into the series, and just three more to make me a fan.\
Pretty much everything about this show screams awesome. \
Yup, Death Note is undoubtedly one of the greatest anime's I've ever seen.\

Tsugumi Ohba's (creator of Death Note) real identity is a closely guarded secret.

    This is a story of the ultimate cat and mouse game where the lives of many solely depends on who can outsmart the other. Death note creates an idea of what happens when one is given the power over another human life and showing that absolute power corrupts absolutely. \
The anime tells the story brilliantly and every episode keeps you wondering what will happen next as how a good story should. The characters are well thought-out, showing the viewers different perspectives of what people believe as justice. It's refreshing to see a story that doesn't force you to support the main character as many shows\
          \
        does and gives no indication of a real antagonist. Instead, it shows two men, who seems to be two faces of the same coin, fight in a battle of wits to prove who is smarter player and lets you decide on whose idea you agree with the most. \
Adding the fact that the animation perfectly shows the brilliant techniques and strategies and good plot twists, this is definitely a show to keep your brain wide awake. If you're looking for an anime with a great plot, astounding character development and thought-provoking moments, this anime will leave your brain in awe.\

This anime is like, super awesome. I don't even know where to start... Uh... Well, let's start with what everyone starts with, the plot.\
Plot - 10 - This anime is enthralling to the maximum. The plot is unique and original, and makes for a ton of fun. I suppose it depends on your taste in anime, but you should really give this a try at the very least. The show NEVER gets repetitive or boring, and it kept me on edge the whole time I watched it. Every human who's seen this usually asks themselves this same question... \"What would I have done with a\
          \
        notebook like that?\" Killing is scary, but the power of the notebook seems to suck you into it, and it's probably best (if this book really existed) to not even pick it up in the first place. \
Characters - 9 - The characters are way too amazing. They don't have this really stupidly overdramatic past, and it's not like they don't have hard lives either... But the anime doesn't focus on all the hard parts of their lives. It moves along more with plot and a lot of character development, which is nice.\
Light is an interesting character. (Understatement of the decade, but oh well.) He develops quite a lot, and does it somewhat subtly, but in the end has changed dramatically. He goes from being a rational genius college student, to a literal madman drunk with the very power of the Death Note. Sometimes you feel a bit sorry for him... I don't know why.\
L's battle of wits with Light is more than epic, but he's more than that. He may be a genius as well but he has a fun, cute personality that only occasionally he will reveal. He has the silliest quirks that make him even more fun, even though sometimes he might seem just a little... Cold.\
The only reason the character gets a 9 is because when Near comes in? Ugh. He's like a block of hard, cold granite with nothing on the inside but more granite. He acts like he's playing nothing but a simple game of chess, and all the living, breathing humans around him are just pawns on his way to victory. He just... Annoys me.\
Soundtrack - 9 - It's too good to be true. Every beat goes with every movement in the anime, and it makes otherwise boring scenes into the most entertaining ones. Penmanship has never been so epic... Heehee. I love the first opening theme. It goes well with the first \"arc\" of the series. Although, the second opening may go well with Light's now-twisted mind, I still can't bring myself to like it. It's too... Ugh.\
Art - 10 - The movements are usually smooth and fluid and I like the realistic touch Death Note brings. The art itself is very amazing. The dark colors and atmosphere fit quite well with the plot, and it makes this anime even more of an enjoyable ride.\
Overall - 10 - This anime was just too epic. I watched it five whole times since I loved it so much, and learned something new each time. I eventually got sick of it, but after a couple months I'm considering a sixth time watching.\
The second \"arc\" of the anime slows down quite a bit, but is still very entertaining... And those final two episodes? Ohhhhh, W-O-W. They make up for any lack of anything the  second arc ever had. This anime was just great, and no matter your taste in anime, you should give this a try at some point... Even if you end up not liking it, it's still worth a watch.\

    Death Note tells the story of Kira, a serial killer who uses a death note to create a new world under his sense of justice.\
Story (spoilers):\
The first few episodes of Death Note have one of the best plots I have ever experienced. It is smart and captivating, and keeps you engaged. From the first episode up to Ray Penbar's wife death, the story was simply flawless. However, I would not say that it became predictable as it certainly was not, but later on the story was as captivating. After the first few episodes up to L's death, the plot was good, but not exceptional. However\
          \
        after that, the story lost part of its charm and was not a engaging. The anime's premise is great, and overall Death Note had a good story, however I believe that if shorter, the anime's plot could have been a masterpiece. 7/10\
Art:\
The art fits the dark theme of the show masterfully and reaches its goal. The atmosphere is clearly appropriate to what's happening. However because of the nature of this anime, there is not much action or special effects going on, so it can't be considered a masterpiece in animation. 8/10\
Sound: The soundtrack of death note is great. Although I disliked the second opening, the first one was excellent in my opinion. However, it is not something out of this world that I'll remember in my deathbed. 8/10\
Enjoyment:\
I liked Death Note a lot the first time I saw it. It is captivating and the themes of morality the anime touched on are certainly interesting. What is just? Do the ends justify the means? The corporate arc even took a jab at the greed of corporations. However, Death Note remains to me a slight letdown plot wise. 7/10\
Overall: Death Note served to me as a bridge from classic shonen animes like DBZ and Naruto to deeper and more engaging ones. The dark theme is great, the premise was excellent and overall, despite everything, the story was fairly good as well. The rivalry between L and Light can be exhilarating, and you are always wondering what will Light do next.  Be it him explaining to Ryuk how his drawer works, to him realizing that his long con plan of erasing his own memories worked, the unveiling of his plans are always exciting to watch. 8/10\

    Death Note was one of the first Dark animes i got into. The first half of Death Note was simply amazing. The character development of Light is easily one of the best points in this anime. What differs Death Note is the fact that fighting is limited. Instead of fighting Light and L battle it out with mind games and strategy. But as the series progress and the show introduces new characters, Mainly Near and Mello it really starts to trend downward. In-fact after the death of one of the characters everything starts to seem out of place. In the end Lights character seems to\
          \
        get stupider as the series goes on and does things he would have never done at the start. It seemed as if the show was trying to wrap things up to quick.\
If not for the second half of Death Note my overall rating would be much higher. The first half of the series is a solid 10, but with the second half seeming out of place and rushed it brings the series down to a 7.6.\

    Never has an anime made me think and contemplate life as much as this one has. Death Note truly takes you on a journey. It speaks to you and says, \"I'm going to mess with your head so bad, that you end up overthinking, and under thinking everything I have to offer.\" If you want an anime that messes with your head, makes you think things through, the Death Note is for you. You know its funny. I see my little brother watch mindless shows on TV day in and day out, they have nothing. They're so pointlessly dumb, they make money off of being\
          \
        dumb. Death Note is not like this. I spent a solid 30 minutes contemplating life after the last episode. This anime is for you if you like having your head messed with.\

    I LOVED most of this series... most...\
Lets start with the good stuff...\
Seeing Lights plans unfold and L's attempts to stop and counter them and then Light's counter to L's counter... It's just so fucking good!\
Ryuk as a character was hilarious! What else can I say but, APPLES!\
L was an amazing character as well! He is a believable genius! Seeing his thought process is great as well.\
The following contains a Spoiler so if the Kira of Yotsuba hasn't been captured, stop reading here.\
When Light gets the Notebook back would have to be my favorite moment of the whole anime! It was so cool to see the\
          \
        old Kira we knew get his memories back then go on to attempt to finish what he started \
Now for the bad parts. \
I really only have 4 complaints. \
The first 2 are really just Nit-picks.\
There are scenes when Light is practically yelling about the Deathnote to Ryuk and NOONE HEARS HIM!!!\
When the Misa's video talks about Shinigamis L flips shit! but later when L finds out that it IS a Shinigami he's completely calm!\
I know these 2 points are Nitpicks but they really bugged me.\
My third complaint is Yotsuba... just the whole segmant! it was SOOOOOOOO BORING!\
and now, my final complaint. This part contains a spoiler. If you don't know who Near is then stop reading here.\
Near... as a character annoyed me. They took L, turned him into a 1 dimensional character! Did I mention he's annoying? \

amazing rival\
a little original\
2011\
new genre\
amazing villain\\\
\
it was 2011 when i saw this anime. back then i only had watched anime like naruto,bleach,etc. anime in physical strength was stressed. but a friend of mine recommended Death note to me. at that point i was kind of reluctant to try any other anime since i had some way to catch up to the latest episodes of the one piece and bleach. however, i gave it a try and it only took me less than two days to complete the whole series.\
          \
        never have watched a show with such focus and interest.\
to begin with,death note was different from anime which i had experienced at that point in time. light yagami and L's battle of wits has to be one of the best things. \
Story: i would give 9.5/10 to it. episodes till L were flawless. after the death of L,i felt that deathnote feel disappeared. i am not saying that it became unwatchable. those episodes were great,however, the series will make you raise your expectation. This will make you disappoint.\
the artwork of this series was impressive as well. i loved it \
as for the sound,it has one of the most catchy opening. apart from that,other music is amazing and augment the storytelling.\
this series builds it characters brilliantly. we see how light's ambition takes over him and he ends up becoming a person which we wanted to clean the world from.\
overall, i would recommend series to anyone. \
this series has only 37 episodes. one can easily finish this in less than 2 days. it not like one piece or naruto which has 100's of episodes,and most of them is fillers. after watching this,you would come to know why people consider death note as one of the best anime series of all the time.\

    Death Note is very original and even though its art is very out dated it makes up for it in its amazing plot. Light has a grand plan to take over the world as ,Kira, by killing all criminals with a Death Note, which he found while looking out of the window at school. Light meets Riuk, the death god who owns the death note, and even though he is basically useless and only eats apples and makes witty comments, Riuk kind of just a mascot. But the FBI soon catches on and reluctantly sends L, the genius and anonymous, FBI detective who no one\

        has seen in real life. L is an original and adorable character that loves sweets and sits weirdly. But soon L is forced to show his face to a few people in the FBI. The teams mission is to hunt down and kill Kira. And with L's help they might have a chance to solve the case.   \

First of all, the story is great, it was really smooth and excited, and even logic too even for a supernatural anime.\
The art and sound are in good quality, make the anime so smooth and in rhythm,\

    This anime was great. It had a great hook, one unlike any I have ever seen. It's story is very unique and original, and despite the thought of how many different ways you can die, this anime conveys the thought of how many different ways you can kill someone. What makes it amazing is the thought of killing someone by writing their name in a notebook which makes the viewers' imagination run wild with thoughts such as \"if I had that kind of power...\" It's soundtrack is very, very fitting and has a magical feel to its atmosphere with tracks such as the Shinigami song\
          \
        that plays in the very first few minutes of the first episode. Although it has a great hook, Death Note eventually got a little boring and I almost quit watching it due to moments such as \"I'll take a potatoe chip, and EAT IT.\" Really? It's funny but WAY too dramatic. Visuals were great until the very last episode where Lights blood doesn't even look like blood. All in all, I'll give this anime 8/10.\

    Such an outstanding story.\
Death Note. It tells you what happen, when a person discovered it. A book that can actually kill people. Instantly. The decision is on your hand. You can control the world. Or destroying it. \
The series itself is not just have a dark or gloomy story, but also engaged you to roll up your minds. Somehow can make you feel tense. The protagonist Light Yagami however, is not what protagonist look like. So does L. In the end it can conclude on one sentence. \"As clever as squirrels jump, will surely fall.\"\
The art itself provided a gloomy, dark, a dystopian city, just\
          \
        like the series. So it might annoys you. But overall that makes this series great.\
The soundtrack provided a thrilling experiences, however I didn't like the OP and ED. It so annoys and wreck my ears. \
The character, yes. I cannot say if there is any character development. The MC provides an enigma. You have to know what happens in front of you. Yet is not an easy task but surely make you think twice or thrice. I think it's fair but it is enough to really enjoy this show.\
Overall it was great anime. 9/10. Since it has minor flaws but yes it is very enjoyable show. Especially if you like mind games or thrilling and dark show. This show is for you.",

    Death Note is very good. Most Hollywood movies couldn’t do it any better. There is variety in faces, so nobody looks the same and most characters change clothes all the time. There are also too many static frames that ruin a perfect mark but aside from that it is excellent, as long as you like dark palette colours. Opening and ending songs are simply mind numbing.\
The story is about the Death Gods in the series getting really bored with their existence, and from time to time playing tricks with mortals, just to kill the boredom with a little laugh. Once of them is throwing supernatural\
          \
        notebooks that kills anyone whose name is written in it, in the human realm. An ingenious and amoral teenager named Yagami Light finds one of those notebooks, and like the megalomaniac he is, decides to use it for killing all the criminals in the world, establishing a new world order of peace and justice with him adored as a God! All of which will be done in secrecy, since he is not almighty and a simple cop can arrest him if he is found out.\
Since the protagonist is not your average boy scout, he doesn’t really care about morality. In fact, he clings towards the opposite direction. He doesn’t believe in universal morality, God, after-life punishment, or ethics in general. Heck, the very atmosphere of the series promotes such beliefs. God is either uncaring with the world or non-existent, and all beings in Creation are left to do as they please, with morality and justice being just human fabrications for maintaining social order. Yagami is beyond such ideals. He believes that the end justifies the means and that brilliant people like him are superior and thus always correct before the opinions of pitiful commoners. If HE gets what HE wants, then nothing else matters. He is willing to do anything it takes to promote his way of thinking, including taking advantage of people’s feelings and good intentions, winning their trust just to abuse them, killing good-willing people who don’t agree with him, killing supporters who don’t follow his commands to the fullest, and even killing his zealots when they are no longer useful to him. And all which are done without lifting an eyebrow, since what he does is in his mind always correct.\
Yagami’s rival in the story is \"L\", another ingenious teenager who believes that upholding the laws is the closest thing people have to justice and morality. Logic and thorough examination are his ultimate weapons. The story is mostly about Yagami vs L and his followers, trying to outsmart one another with various, cunning, multi-layered mind tricks. Yagami tries to hide the fact he is Kira, the supernatural killer, and dispose of L & co. without leaving incriminating traces around him (a VERY hard task).\
The detective aspect of the series is exceptional. Unpredictable and yet ingeniously planned-out, most of the time, with the two of them standing next to each other most of the time and yet are unable to eradicate one another. Not without an ingenious planning that doesn’t leave room for openings for the other guy’s ingenious planning. It feels like watching a chess game between two world champions with the rest of the people being just pawns in their hands; manipulated to do their bidding, without even realizing it most of the time.\
On the other hand, the supernatural aspect of the series is simply bullshit. There is no realism or reasoning with the Death Gods being bored. What the hell; boredom as driving force? There are several attempts to explain and reason the powers of the Death Note, but there are no explanations about its general existence in the world.\
So, ok, some can arbitrarily think that God made the Death Note and the Death Gods and then stopped caring about His creations’ actions, thus depriving everything of a reason-for-being. And that the Death Note works with a \"Word: Death\" spell, which is triggered by translating the victim’s written birth-given name to its True Name via the Death Notes’ metaphysical energy.\
And it becomes even messier if you consider Yagami’s depiction of an ideal world. A world of total justice and peace, based on the fear of death would be a world of terror and hopelessness. Also, in theory every human being loses his/her temper and does something really stupid at least once in his/her lifetime. There wouldn’t be anyone left alive in Yagami’s ideal world! As cool as it is to have such a protagonist, he is eventually delusional, insane and megalomaniac. In other words, he is a villain. And no, he didn’t become because he found the notebook, he always was like that. He simply went overboard when he was offered the power to kill without being punished for it. Throughout human history, people with total control over the lives of others don’t become more just and caring, as time goes by.\
As much as I was enjoying this show, I have to admit that it changed for the worse after a time skip took place. Without a main rival around, Yagami starts making silly mistakes and L’s side starts reaching to verdicts seemingly out of nowhere. The scriptwriter simply reached to a story dead-end and yet still had to wrap up the story in a way that wouldn’t be too evil for a teen’s story. Well, he didn’t do a good job, the storyboard is a mess in the last episodes and got ruined like a tower of cards with a badly placed card at the top.\
As far as characters go, Yagami/Kira and L are the only characters that really matter, thanks to their non-stop mind-trap competition. All the rest are just there for support, commenting on events or being peons in greater than themselves schemes. You cannot really connect with any of them because they have the same demeanour and a weak presence. They may not look the same but really feel the same, no matter where you look. Even the top two characters are essentially two sides of the same coin.\
Regardless of all that, Death Note remains as one of the best thriller detectives in anime form. Its problems become apparent only after you watch it again and pay attention, but it is definitely a very memorable series, with great production values and no filler episodes.\

    Death Note has a good start, with the possibility to become one of the best anime ever, but it only gets worse and worse as the show goes on.\
The problem for the writer of the story was to find interesting challenges for a character as overpowered as Light. \
He failed, sacrificing the plot consistency and logic by creating conflict who doesn't originate organically from the flow of the events but uses plot devices who undermine its credibility.\

    \"I'll take a Potato Chip...and EAT it!\" - Light Yagami\
...Yes, that's a direct quote from the dub of Death Note.\
I'll get right into this and say that when I watched this show for the first time, I thought it was so true, because of my pessimistic nature at the time. In a nutshell, the self-proclaimed smartest student in the world, Light Yagami, finds a notebook used by gods of death (Shinigami, in other words) to end people's lives. So what does he do with it, instead of trashing it? He gets greedy and takes it home with him to test out. Fast forward about 2-3\
          \
        weeks if I recall correctly, and we see Light talking to the original owner of the notebook, Ryuk, about how he would become the \"God of the New World\".\
If I had been in his position, I would've just either looked for the owner, even if it had fallen from the sky, or just put it back where I had found it. So yeah, I knew right off the bat what he was going to do after taking it home with him.\
Anyway, the plot from that point thereafter until the ending of the show was so brilliantly complex that it was amazing to see all these plans hatched by a single college honor student. Oh, and Watashi was my favorite character in the entire show. Also, Watashi, in that context, as I'm sure many people know, means \"I\". So, over the course of the show, you got I, L, M, & N.\
Illuminati confirmed. Heh.\
In summary, Death Note was a fantastic show with a longer-than-average run, which actually gave the creators of the show plenty of time to focus on the story it wanted to tell. I highly suggest you check it out, but only if you can stomach blood and gore.\

    Just my unprofessional opinion!\
First of all, shame that there is a 2nd season. The first season was fantastic, the 2nd 'meh' at best. The scores I'm giving are really only for the 1st; I'd suggest watching it and then stop.\
Story\
It's great! The premise is easy enough to understand, albeit a bit ridiculous. Also, they keep adding new rules which might be a bit \"convenient' at times, but I find this is off-set by the constant suspense. 2 guys; one evil, one good. But which one is truly evil? They're practically sitting next to each other, yet neither is able to bust or kill the other.\
          \
        This is accomplished by brilliant deductions, evasions, smart decisions and crazy conspiracies. The psychological part, the traps, the ideas, the mind games are fantastic!!\
Art\
It's fine, but it's hard not to be. There's no fighting, ever. So, there's a lot of room for other scenes, somehow making writing and eating crisps look epic.\
Sound\
A lot of choir, a bit repetitive, but otherwise fine and fitting.\
Character\
The two main characters are super interesting and brilliant. Somehow, I was vouching for both, but of course only 1 can win. The love interest is somewhat irritating at times, the side cast isn't super useful with some exceptions, but otherwise it's totally fine.\
Enjoyment\
Really enjoyed the first season, very easy and thrilling to watch front to back!\
The reason why I didn't like the 2nd season, is because we lose 1 of our favorite characters, which gets replaced by a bunch of sudden mary-sues who popped up out of nowhere. The story then goes on as if that never happened. Also, I found the ending not satisfactory.\
Even so, I'm still giving it a 9 for season 1, good going! The Japanese movie is pretty good, too. :D\

    I'm well aware that Death Note is an incredibly popular anime but I didn't expect it to be number 1 on this sites popularity list. That being said Death Note really does deserve it. Despite a few gripes that I have with the show, it's definitely worth the watch.\
Story:\
 The story for the first 25 episodes fall nothing short of fucking epic. For a shounen anime, there's not that many fight scenes but the show doesn't need them because the show blends suspense with careful strategizing on both Light and L very well  and that's enough to make the first 25 episodes engaging. However\
          \
        beyond episode 25, the show get's quite boring and the payoff is a little shit. Although the last 10 episodes aren't really enough for me to call Death Note not worth watching especially compared to other anime out there that started great but ended terribly. (like SAO and Evangelion)\
Art:\
 The show is very well animated and the darker color palette really fits with the tone of the anime. Although for an anime where a lot of characters ,both minor and major, die perminately, there's not a lot of blood in the show unless it really need to have blood. A bit lame if you ask me but the excellent presentation more than makes up for it.\
Sound:\
 The first opening is great, the 2nd opening is a bit lame, the in show music is very atmospheric and the voice acting for both the sub and the dub are good. Overall, the sound is a pass.\
Characters:\
 L is definately my favorite character. Not only is he rather smart but he also has a few fun momments. Ryuk serves as a decent comic relief. Light and his family are okaybut for a protagonist, he's a little psycho. Misa is annoying as fuck. Matsuda is probably my favorite side character mainly because I can relate to him. And most of the new characters in the last 10 episodes are dumb.\
Overall:\
 Death Note certainly is a great show. Not my favorite anime, TBH the last 10 episodes were pretty fucking boring, but the show is still worth watching if you haven't seen it before/ in a long while. Just be sure to not watch the Netflix movie!\

    Might seem a bit boring or old for some people but I tell you-you won't regret watching it. Character development is not bad, the artwork in unique and sound is pretty pleasant.  The plot isn't really bad and you just need to turn on your brain and remember every detail since it has a lot of important details. The best part is that even a break in the middle of the episode is interesting because it explains how to use the Note. So if you like a bit of action with a bunch of mystery this anime is definitely for you. \

Spoilers ahead:Light Yagami is a genius high school student who discovers the \"Death Note\", a notebook that kills anyone whose name is written in it, as long as the writer has seen that person's face. After experimenting with the notebook, Light meets the Shinigami Ryuk, the notebook's original owner, who dropped the notebook to the human world out of boredom. Light tells Ryuk of his plan to rule as a god over a new world free from criminals, where only people he deems morally fit to live remain. Light becomes known to the public as Kira (キラ), which\
          \
        is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word \"killer\". Ryuk, invisible save to those that possess the Death Note, follows Light around and takes enjoyment from Light's meticulous actions as Kira.\

    I watched this anime quite a long time ago, and my current tastes in anime have changed quite a bit. I appreciate the anime for what I watched it for initially: a bit of an edgy crime drama with minimal occult-related scenes and themes. The script was well written, and the story is unique. It is a good anime, but it is no longer my most desired anime genre. I tend to prefer something a bit more light-hearted, which is definitely not what one would be seeing in this anime. I believe that young adolescent me would have given it a higher score, but for\

    I had read opinions of people saying that it is one of the best animes of life. AND WERE NOT WRONG.\
The plot is very original. A notebook that can kill with writing the name and visualize the appearance of the person we want. The chapters were short, it's an anime that catches you, that hooks you. I saw 8 chapters in an XD afternoon.\
It deals with a subject of which there has been controversy. On the one hand, Light (Kira) thinks criminals must die. Instead, who will try to capture Kira, he thinks justice prevails.\
In addition, shinigamis appear like Ryuk (wanted by many) and Rem.\
          \
        The endings of the chapters are apotheosic. We can see well-built characters like Light, L, Detective Yagami or the nice one from Matsuda.\
The only glitch I see is that in the middle of the anime, the plot becomes lioso and getting bored sometimes. I also think that Near and Mello should not have existed, as it will always be Kira vs L for me. Moments that leave you in shock and the end of anime is sublime.\
It is possible to emphasize the spectacular soundtrack with that sacred music and the voices praising Kira. Also the 1st opening is great (unlike the 2nd that I find horrible).\
In short, Death Note is a great and mythical anime that must be seen.\
Note: 9\

    *WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*\
Story 8/10\
Light Yagami is a high school student who one day discovers a \"Death Note\". With it, he plans to rule the world free from criminals. However, his killings catch the attention of notorious world famous detective, L. Now, it becomes this game of cat and mouse. Who will win at the end?\
I gave the story 8/10 because the second half of the series was weaker than the first half to me. Like, I'll be honest, there were times I felt bored. But, the story is still amazing. It's one of the best\
          \
        stories I've ever seen, along with Dangaronpa. And man, that ending.... (Of course I'm not gonna spoil the ending that'd be stupid :P)\
The story also raises questions on moral. What is right? What is wrong? If you're a person who likes to debate with yourself and talk about issues, then you'll love this story.\
Art 10/10\
The art is very dark, which fits with the tone of the anime perfectly. 'Nuff said.\
Sound 9/10\
The soundtrack is amazing. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because opening 2 to me didn't fit with the anime. I just wish they kept the first opening. And, the endings weren't all spectacular, but they were still good.\
Character 10/10\
What makes Death Note truly special is its protagonist, Light Yagami. You got this high school kid that turns into a hero because he's getting rid of all the criminals in the world and then he turns into this horrible evil villain in the eyes of the government. Light Yagami is a protagonist that you can sympathize and really understand where he comes from. But then you see how the notebook changes him. And you see how he manipulates other people into doing the killings for him. It's so rare to see an anti-hero character in anime. And Light Yagami is really one of those characters that I really understood where he was coming from and why he did what he did, but at the same time, he's one of those characters I also hated because he would manipulate people and take advantage of their desires to his liking (i.e calling his father an asshole at his funeral).\
You also get these other characters that really add to the story because you get their perspective on the situation. The characters will really pull at your heartstrings and maybe even make you question yourself more.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
This experience has just been mind-blowing! I really love thrillers (shows like The Mentalist, Dexter...) and Death Note is the very first thriller anime I've seen and is the best thriller anime ever in my opinion!\
Overall 9/10\
This anime is a MUST WATCH for any anime fan and anyone looking to get into anime. I don't usually like to say that an anime is a \"masterpiece\" because I believe no anime is perfect, but this anime is a \"masterpiece\" in that it has its own unique story and characters that we can probably relate to in real life. I really recommend you guys to check out Death Note if you haven't already.\
If you like Death Note, then I also recommend you check out Dangaronpa as they both raise questions on morals and they both kind of have the same feel, but not really. Yes, I could've probably recommend Code Geass and Monster like everybody else has but I haven't seen those shows yet. I'm not going to recommend shows that I haven't seen yet.\
Thanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!\

    If you're planning on watching Death note, but you're not sure?? Just watch it!! It's a must for all anime fans! This was my first anime ever and it's now the reason why I fell in love with anime!! After completing 200 different anime, this one is still my favorite. \
The story is just completely different. This is more a battle of geniuses and that's what makes it interesting, complicated plot twists! And the psychological part in the series is outstanding! I really loved this series, although, like most of the fans say... It loses a bit of the ' perfection ' at the end\
          \
        of the show... But it's still amazing! The voice actors are really good in sub ( and even in dub!!).. The music is also matching and epic! They couldn't pick something better! You may have some trouble with the famous second opening :D ( if you're not a metal fan, it might be weird the first time, but you will like it eventually!).  I've seen this series three times and I keep enjoying it to the maximum. I've also read the entire manga in a week and read the extra 13 volume. The anime is almost identical to the manga! Although there are some very interesting scenes that aren't in the manga! This series is a must watch, you're wasting your time by reading this!! You should be watching RIGHT NOW!!! :D \

    \"I'm going to make the world know I'm here...that somebody is passing righteous judgment on them.\"\
Light Yagami said. He thinks that he's right. The reason is the world have been rotten, criminal, unfairness.\
This can say against real world, too. Various Incident and Conflict are sometimes influence upon our lives.\
War is happening in other part of the countries. Mostly extremists. True peace is far away.\
But these things will end someday. It is even after a few hundred years.\
Well, Let's get down to the main topic. DN is the best show that I've ever seen. This show can teach me about morality and sociology.\
Keep an eye to\
          \
        the end of configuration, dense drama, and attractive elements.\
I can't explain well, but there is an impact that you don't forget after seeing it once.\
Aside to that, I watched this show by Complete DVD-BOX. I bought Blu-ray version after a few years.\
Story is drawn full of ups and downs life of Light Yagami. He grows up with each episodes. For better or for worse.\
Light picked up DEATH NOTE in a certain event. He uses it for kill evils every time he can't relinquish, and he decided to correct the world.\
In some cases, he utilize his people. But not all goes well.  There is no denying that conditions surrounding him are formidably strict.\
Main Theme is psychological battle to all sorts of men. That's the point. Not simply kill opponents.\
Especially remarkable character is L. He also has brilliance and extraordinary clairvoyance, and to confront Light.\
They have firm beliefs. Personality is completely different, but two strategy are beyond your expectations. Hold their ground.\
In other words, it shows how much characters are very cool, unique and intelligent.\
My explanation lacks persuasiveness, but I can only write this. It is deep characteristics.\
Animation quality is so good. It stand out reuse something, but basically stable and beautiful.\
Of course, city and scenery also fascinated without realizing it. They may not matter much.\
Characters look are reproduced faithfully to manga version. This point is same to story, too.\
Execution-Punishment By DEATH NOTE is surprisingly impressive. Hardcore and bloody.\
Mental state of each characters are always tense. Special effects for represent it also spur on.\
Human is usually difficult to read someone's mind. If someone can, the person is the work of GOD.\
Light and L can do it. Because they are genius. So you can enjoy seeing them.\
BGM also great. My favorable music are Light's Theme, L's Theme, Jiken, Kitai, Kodoku.\
OP and ED songs are very catchy and exact lyrics. If anything, I like songs by Nightmare. \"Alumina\" is my No.1 ED song.\
Voice acting is amazingly skillful. I heard Japanese voice because I'm Japanese. Especially Light's voice is awesome.\
Calm, Anger, Laugh. Every emotional expression are acted perfectly. Well done, Mamoru Miyano.\
L and other character's voice also fitting. If you interested in Japanese voice, then you try it.\
I raised a lot of advantages so far. But not all good points. Most pros and cons are...story since middle stage.\
Advantages from the above are not almost utilized, and level of riddle solution became down.\
Intelligence quotient of certain characters are high in cheat class, and the logic is slightly inconsistent.\
Light as he was, he is struggle with these characters. Interest itself is sharp drop in an instant.\
Nevertheless, The reason why I rated top grade is LAST EPISODE. That saved my heart.\
DN never perfect show. But If I rate without excuses, after all top grade. I love this show so much. Manga version also, too.\
This show is not for everyone. But If you want to experience thrilling, complain CRAZY society, then you worth seeing.\
Thanks for reading my first review. I hope I can be of any help to you.\

    I must say, that this anime is really something! I think that the autor made a great job with thinking of this kind of story and especially Character. He is truly original and, believe me, watching this anime is choice that you won't regret afterwards. I must also say that Character, story and music which is suited to it perfectly makes outstanding impression. The fact is that this anime is not good for watching it more than once because it is still the mystery... But if you are looking for some other kind of anime you can watch it right away!\

        Storywise Death Note is kind of a mixed bag.  It starts off with sort of an \"antagonist-of-the-week\" format and these early episodes are pure unadulterated entertainment.  Once it gets into the plot proper, it's still very, very good, but in a more measured way, if that makes sense.\
    A major event occurs part-way through the series, and in its aftermath the show just isn't as good.  To say more would be unduly spoileriffic.  Which brings me to the other problem with the story:  this isn't a a problem with Death Note itself, so\
          \
        much as it is a problem with any show that relies so heavily on suspense.  Let me say this: Death Note is riveting, very nearly all the time.  But once you've seen it once, the suspense is gone, and though I've only watched it through the one time, I seriously doubt it would have much re-watch value.\
The art is simply amazing.  It has a busy, yet gloomy look to the scenery without looking overly washed out.  The character designs are all lavishly designed and the series frequently uses stark color contrasts to drive home an emotional point.  These moments are very poignant and help give the series an unmistakably unique aesthetic.\
The music for the openings and endings is very good, and sets an appropriately melodramatic mood.  I say \"melodramatic\" in the best possible way, mind you.  This is the only show with epic potato chip eating after all, and if it flinched for one moment with the melodrama there'd be no point.\
The characters are mostly archetypes and caricatures, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in such an allegorical story.  The show as a whole, at least the first season, can be viewed a grand metaphor for capital punishment, but the series seems to lose track of who represents what in the second season, and that may be why it didn't resonate as much with me.\
Overall, I had a great time with Death Note, and while it had its share of problems, the unified whole really doesn't suffer a great deal as a result.\

    The greatness of this anime can be found in many ways of viewing. Death note is one of these anime shows which aren't limited to the borders of one particular genre. And this is that magical place in art life where we can find real and persistent enjoyment. Innovative, wonderfully passionate characters, smart plot, thrilling sometimes pretty depressive atmosphere, astonishing soundtrack etc..\
Even the last thing that I've mentioned can be interpreted as medium between high inteligence of the main character and his very human, natural efforts to be global alfa male. It's really not that hard to find part of ourselves in the God kissed\
          \
        character Light Yagami, although the fact he's mass murderer and sociopath. It's just natural that the only human being who is actually able to oppress this evil power must be just another sociopath- L. They are very similar, for example, both of them are addicted to some kind of catalyst. In L case is everything eatable with dangerously high sugar level, on the other side Light needs to be admired and dreaded as every great dictator who loves applause maybe even more than the extraordinary fact that he has ultimate power. But in this story are more characters who were punched by God complex. Principal similarity between them and other unusual characters lies in the unceasing attempts to solve problems and mysteries, especially in the Light case, these problems happen to be much more catastrophic for his persona than for others, but this is not rule in a real life and it's not dogma in Death note. Despite this likeness they all have something very special, what makes their personality unique.\
There's no need to be worry about boredom in this anime. Dynamics is almost perfect mainly because we are invited to watch megalomaniac heroic battle between good and evil from the first line, since we are reading in the minds of both sides of coin.\
Also there are so many things which can possibly go wrong, people are quite predictable but their revelations on the screen are sometimes rather shocking.\
The animation is also hardcore. The animators created a piece very playful, stylish, closely connected to the psychological apects of characters. Death note is one enjoyable, inspiring show with little flaws.\
Now, I'm not going to fall into pointing at the negative attributes of this anime, because all those thing I've written about can be peacefully taken as a bunch of disadvantages, anyway.\

    I got introduced to this anime because I remember my young cousin mentioning it. Before I knew it I was poking around pages of information and mentioning it to other anime enthusiasts. Ultimately I decided to watch some of the series for myself, and I was instantly hooked. This is, hands down, one of my favorite anime, and for good reasons.\
Story: Death Note has one of the most compelling stories I have seen. To me, a psychological thriller about an insane mass murderer with a perverted sense of justice sounds totally cool, and Death Note lives up to this expectation entirely. I love the plot\
          \
        twists and the psychological battle of wits between Light and L; it's well-orchestrated and immensely engaging. If there is one flaw in the story, it's that Death Note, though a drama, is barely a drama; few of the characters are looked at in-depth as people.\
Art: In Death Note, dull, dark colors are the order of the day. Light, for example, has toned brown hair, dark brown eyes and wears a lot of clothes in either black or muted colors. Most of the characters follow this same pattern; even those who do possess features in bolder colors are still toned, to a degree. This extends to the scenery as well; even decidedly attractive objects, such as the cherry blossoms at the ceremony where Light enters university, look dull; the blossoms are more grayish-white than pink. Nevertheless, Death Note, while not the most attractive anime out there, is still technically very competent, especially because the image the story is attempting to project is a dark one. In fact, Death Note, given its dark, serious nature, is as artistically perfect as it can be! Another stylistic fact about the art of Death Note is that, not only is it very realistic in its own right, but there are no facefaults. Although there is humor in Death Note, all the characters maintain relatively realistic facial expressions and body gestures. However, as Death Note is darker and more serious overall than most anime that do have facefaults, this is perfectly appropriate.\
Sound: Sound in general is very good; the background music generally works well with the various characters and occurrences. Particularly noticeable is the music that plays when Light writes in his Death Note, which sounds like a choir; this helps to add to the mood considerably. The opening and closing songs, at least for the first half, are quite good, too; I like the first OP so much that I feel let down if I cannot watch Death Note with the opening theme. The first closing theme, too, is very good.\
Character: The characters in Death Note are quite incredible! Evil protagonists do not get any better than Light; his motives are clear, and, though he is insane, it is obvious that that is a result of his experiences with the Death Note, and not his own personality; this helps make him seem more realistic. In addition, his transitions between 'good Light' (primarily seen by his family) and 'Kira' (the side of him that manipulates and murders) are incredible to consider as he spirals into deeper and deeper insanity. L, too, is an immensely strong character, a complex insane genius with a few well-developed eccentricities. Even Misa, though extremely difficult to like, is nevertheless still at least an okay character, as she freely agrees to do as Light tells her; she would be a lot worse if her relationship with light simply happened to her, but instead she orchestrates it by seeking him out. Furthermore, even more minor characters (e.g., Raye Pember, Naomi Misora, Sayu, etc.) are still fully fleshed-out characters; only the criminals Light kills seem to be anything less.\
In consequence, Death Note is truly one of the better anime out there. It is, of course, for somewhat more mature audiences (suggested for ages 15+), because of some of the dubious content and the fact that most of the characters are either criminals or insane or both. However, if you happen to be 15 or older and you are interested in psychological thrillers, stories with evil main characters, or anything Death Note can possibly offer, then Death Note is definitely an anime to watch.\

    To start it off, this will be my first review; so I'm sorry if it's not helpful to some ^^;\
Okay, anyways, before I started watching the anime series, I actually watched the movie of Death Note first since my older brother recommended it to me. And I fell in love with it! It was such an amazing movie. And because of that, I decided to watch the anime series.\
The anime is mainly about mystery; so if you're into mystery a lot, I recommend you to watch this anime. And even if you're not, you'll still enjoy it either way.\
Story: The plot was really unique since\
          \
        it's rarely been used or have never been thought of. The story line was well constructed and enjoyable. Even though it kind of went down a bit later in the series, it went straight back up and maintained it's outstanding eagerness of the show.\
Art: The art was nicely done and very descriptive. It wasn't too magnificent and nor was it too shabby. It was just drawn and put together in a very dark, and mysterious aura. I also really liked the way they drew their faces when it gets to the intense part; it was purely defined.\
Sound: I love the sound in this anime; especially the first opening song. The background music gives intensity and a mysterious vibe to the viewers. Although I wasn't really into the second opening song, but you'll end up getting used to it; unless you like Japanese screamo, that is.\
Character: The development of the characters was really well thought of. As a protagonist of the series, you hardly see them being the bad person trying to fight off the good, which is why I thought the characters were quite interesting. Besides, most of them are quite lovable in my opinion. An addition to that, the way their minds work are unexpected and wise; they just somehow know what's going on.\
Overall: All in all, this anime has opened a new pathway in the anime wolrd. It's different, twisted, and very intense, making you want to watch more and more. It's one of the best animes in my opinion and it has totally made it onto my list of my favorite animes. I highly recommend anyone to watch it. You won't regret any of it.\

    This show isn't like normal anime. Usually, they start off slow then, after a couple episodes, you can get into it. With Death Note, it gets interesting from the first episode.\
Story~\
It starts off with a Death God named Ryuk dropping his notebook into the human world. Naturally, he has to go down there to get it but soon, he finds out, it has already been taken. A 17 year old highschool genius named Light finds it outside of his school. Written on the front are the words Death Note. Apparently, if you write the name of any person and picture them in your mind, they\
          \
        will die in 40 seconds. Light, bored with life, decides to try it out. To his surprise, it ends up working and with it, he tries to rid the world of evil having his strong ambitions. Ryuk comes to help him, but soon, he finds out this isn't enough. Light begins to get hunted down by the police whom have a detective which has the same level of intelligence as Light. It turns into a battle. Will Light's dream come true? Or will he be caught by his enemies?\
Art~\
The art is really beautiful and everything is well drawn for the most part.  Misa wears quite complex, lolita outfits and there are a variety of characters in which they don't all look exactly the same.\
Sound~\
I really enjoyed the sound, music, etc.  It fit when there were dramatic scenes, scary scenes, and romantic-ish scenes although there weren't that many of those.\
Characters~\
You learn a lot about the characters and even learn of other \"sides\".  Light seems like a good kid trying to bring justice into the world, but then, when he finds the Death Note, he goes crazy.  L, seems like just an incredibly smart detective until you find out that he is actually very lonely.  All the characters change and develop.\
Enjoyment~  \
I really enjoyed the anime because of the suspense and actually sort of original storyline.\
Overall~\
Overall, this was a good anime and it gets an 8 from myself.\

    Death Note is an excellent series about a young adult named Yagami Light who gains possession of a Death Note- a small notebook which, if you write the name of a person who's face you know, will kill that person.\
The show revolves around Light and his use of the Note. It took a very interesting social critique aspect after a while and I thoroughly enjoyed the different characters as they popped up through the 25 or so episodes. This show does a very good job of making it's characters change through time and not just be as they were from the beginning. Major plot twists,\

        dispersed through the entire show always do a good job of keeping the watcher on edge, however, some of these twists which I will not spoil, did leave a large gaping hole in what the show had set up. Some mysteries are left unsolved, but this still remains an excellent show, easily one of the best around in the genre, and in anime in general. A very good mystery/detective show.\

He starts with good intentions and capitalizes on them, but we keep asking ourselves, is he doing the right thing? We see groups on both sides of the arguments and the watcher has to choose a side.

     I could say that we see throughout the anime Raito gradually turning into Kira. But that is not what happens. Raito is already a born killer, he was ready when he finds the Death Note, he only lacked the means to carry out the murders.\
    L is the balance in the scales of justice that is created in the anime by\
          \
         Kira, he as well  hunting and hunter by Kira.The plot becomes increasingly tense as Kira and L are one after another, with its climax with the death of L. And from there, it leaves something to be desired, it's like Kira lost a little interest in his ideals.\
    The loss of focus of Kira's not something that would seriously damage the anime, because that's room for other characters like M and N.\
    The loss of focus Kira is not something that would seriously damage the anime, because that's room for other characters like M and N may intervene in the plot, which will seal the tragic fate of Raito.\
    Thus, anime is a great site for those who enjoy suspense, mystery and police action. With its remarkable characters and worked very well, it makes us paranoid with their finely calibrated events calculated by L, M, N, and Kira.\

    ^^^ I re-edited this review and made it better^^^ enjoy\
Death Note is a complete masterpiece with a gripping story, amazing art, a creepy and fitting soundtrack, and some of the most interesting characters developed in anime or any form of media!!!\
Story:\
I am not going to provide any spoilers, but Death Note has a gripping story with lots of plot twists and turns. There is never a dull moment in this show.\
Character:\
The story revolves around the young psychopath named Light Yagami, who is an interesting antihero/villain. At first, Light Yagami is a normal teenager to be a rather disturbed and egocentric teenager who looks down upon\
          \
        everyone. Given ultimate power, the Death Note, Light embarks on his descent into madness and insanity. Light Yagami is a realistic portrayal of an intelligent and ruthless psychopath who deceives and murders the people around him to achieve greater power. Death Note is different from other television shows and movies in that the main character strives for justice, but looses himself in that same conquest.\
A unique and brilliant detective who goes be the name, L, has to track down a seemingly impossible to trace series of murders, where all the victims have heart attacks. The next second L is on Light's trail, where both play a game of cat and mouse to catch each other.\
All the characters in Death Note are well done and are memorable, even the minor ones such Ryuk, Mello, and Mikami.\
Art:\
Done by the studio, Madhouse, Death Note contains breathtaking Gothic artwork and symbolism. The artwork is simply amazing to look at and is well detailed. \
Sound:\
The soundtrack to this show is filled with eerie guitar riffs, creating a suspenseful atmosphere. I recommend watching this show with English dubbing, but the Japanese voices are also pretty good. The first theme song fits the anime, but I found the second theme song to be kind of strange. Both ending songs were well chosen though.\
Overall:\
Overall, Death Note is a one of a kind series that I recommend for everyone. I even showed this show to my parents and my brother who don't normally enjoy anime and they all thought it was a masterpiece. If you haven't watched Death Note and you are reading this review, then I suggest that you should immediately start watching it now!\

    My first impression.....WOW, I never actually expected such an idea to work out the way Tsugimi Ohba had done it. This is one of the two Anime I can say I was hooked on within the first 3 episodes. This did not bore me at all, I am very much impressed at its originality. *spoilers below*\
The character development is amazing, you will not end this series wondering or believing you missed something from one of the main characters. And to be honest, Light is the most impressive villain I have ever seen or heard of (including non anime creations.) And Lawliet far surpasses any detectives\
          \
        I have seen, second guessing everything? Even if it is the truth? There is a one-in-a-billion person you will be able to see. Now Nate and Mellow....although I did feel after L was killed...that no one would be able to match him, I was badly mistaken. Although L's wits as a singularity were far superior to either Nate's or Mellows, the both of them evenly matched L if not passed him.\
Enough of the characters and onto my thoughts over the actual story line. I thought the story line was magnificent and a masterpiece. I have NEVER heard of this idea before and have never seen anything close to it. Although I strictly rooted for L the entire time, I believe many might root for Yagami as he is very well organized and a mastermind.\
I obviously give this anime a 10 and will, in time, read the manga. The artistic and visuals in this are not at 100% but are nothing to worry about at all. And the sound sometimes crackled here and there while I was watching, but nothing hardcore.....thanks for reading!!! (srry for the spoilers but I warned you :)!!!\

    death note is a very popular anime, and it is not hard to see why.the idea of two very intelligent people trying to defeat each other in a mind game centring around a note book with the power to kill is not the norm for most animes.no robots.no superpowers.no fanservice and best of all no filler.Death note is a psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.\
Story:death notes story is brillant.Light yagami finds some smart way to use the death note and the master detctive L find some way to put light in a corner and the process repeats, each time the\
          \
        mind games get bigger and more imaginative until episode 25, were a certin event happens and the story keeps going but not quite as good as before.\
Art:Death note's animation is very good and the character designs are excellent.the use of darker colours suited the shows atmosphere very well and gave the show a real epic feel to it.\
Sound:Again, brillant.Memorable tracks all around that give the anime a real epic feel, despite L's theme sounding like tubular bells.\
Character:Death note's characters are unique and interesting.Light has strong views about the world and wants to change humanity for the better and never loses sight of his goals.On the other hand we have L the master mind dective out to catch light.he is ecentric and funny but smart and deductive too.\
Enjoyment/Overall:death note has high production values, brillant, unique characters and most of all is very enjoyable.\

    this was actually my frist anime that i actually really enjoyed show after show i wanted more. it was like i was getting pulled in deeper and deeper. some parts i laughed some parts i was in ah and some parts i was even amazed at how smart the character Light was. i loved the story line it was so inviting. the art work was terrific, the sounds and characters was something so different i love it. i enjoyed so much i was up so hurt when it ended. .. but to me so far this is #1 in my book of best anime..\

    Story (10/10): the story is quite unique. With the main character- Light Yagami- thinking that he could just change the world by killing all the people who have done wrong in the world and will continue to do wrong. He believes the world will be a better place and he will become the \"god\" of this new world. He is faced with the legendary detective who has solved every case he has attempted and he only works on the cases that no one else can solve. overall the stroyline is excellent and unlike anything i have seen before. I truly cannot think of a reason\
          \
        not to like it.\
A lot of people who have watched the anime might think otherwise but i think that even after the 26th episode, it was still as suspenseful as ever. every aspect of it made me want to watch to a certain point where i could not stop. \
Art (10/10): the art was amazing! It amused me how it changed depending on what people were thinking and who was thinking. Everytime Light Yagami had an inner thought, he would turn red and this is one of the things that made it more dramatic aswell as entretaining. \
One of the best things were how they could make a simple action so epic. For example, the potatochip scene. and they are the first to make writing on a sheet of paper look so fun. They always moved the camera around to make it more energetic.\
Another thing you cant help but notice is that from time to time it seems like they change the artists in the middle of the episode. But this isnt really a bad thing. Just the fact that the art changes up a bit adds to the effect.\
The coloring is great. It fits the overall atmospheres or feeling of the anime. Since it is tipically a dark background that suits the anime pretty well cuz of its plot.\
Sound (10/10): The sound was great and it was a big part of the overall effect of the story. I think the most effective sound they had was when they put in the church music whenever Light would go off killing a whole bunch of criminals as part of his plan. The music made it extremely dramatic and was there for most of the story. After episode 26 it wasnt as epic as it used to be, but it still kept its good reputation. Some people might disagree with me here  but i still loved the anime as much after that check point in the story and the sound had a lot to do with it because it just added to the effect.\
Character (10/10): This is what i think is the most important part of the anime. One of the most interesting characters in this series was L. He was a geneus detective who was all against Kira (the killer using a notebook that you could write someone's name and the they die) and went out of his way to catch and kill Kira. I also love how he is so hilarious and fun to watch- something really unexpected from his personality.\
Light Yagami is the reason i say that L is only ONE of the most interesting characters in the series. Im not saying that Light Yagami is better than L, I am saying that i cant pick between them. You'd think that i would hate Light for killing all those people and be god of the new world, but i am one of the few people that followed him throughout the series (yet at the same time i follow L, a little confusing right?). Light is very unique and is the one that i think has changed the most. He started out been reallye calm but as he kept fighting, he became more and more phyco and had no control over himself. (still love him though)\
I wouldn't count enjoyment as part of the review because it is just one opinion. but for those who actually care, this was THE most enjoyable anime i have ever seen. I was at the edge of my seat from the very first episode! And for those people who like anime that make u think...this is the anime to watch. It is something that to watch it you need to pay attention, but it doesnt matter cuz you are gonna WANT to pay attention anyways.This anime has changed my view on everything and has verywell changed my taste in anime- a way better taste.\

    OK there are so many reviews for this series its insane but just in case someone out there somewhere thinking the same thing i was then hopefully this helps\
first off i was interested in watching this series but then it just became so popular i was going to wait until the hype had died down a bit, but a friend got the series on DVD and i borrowed it....\
Story...\
i do not understand how someone came up with this story its a good one and isn't a subject that's all to popular and over done, like many other people i do feel that they threw all\
          \
        the writers out and tried to head in another direction in one point but by that stage i was hooked and still wanted to watch...\
Art...\
the art style is quite good like some series the background objects and people can sometimes look a bit scary and not drawn but thats just me being a little picky...\
Sound...\
sadly i watched the english dub version.. why? no idea if im ever to re-watch it will be in japanese some points the sound is a bit strange that could be for effect .. the voices in japanese are fantastic and thankfully the ones in english arent too different...\
Character...\
i quite liked all the characters in the death note.. i was happy because usally i fall in love with a character and that can make the show more watchable in this each character has legs to stand on, great minds and well developed characters...\
Enjoyment....\
i did  enjoy this series at one point i was going to stop watching but i persisted and very glad i did.....\
\
Overall..  \
the episodes leave you wanting to watch more and although like previously stated some parts i thought they murdered all the writers and wrote it standing on their heads the series i believe does rescue its self... and had has a clear ending... \
it was a lot better than what i expected and a lot different i can see why so many people are fan crazy for the series....  \

    Death Note has been highly regarded as one of the best anime/manga of all time. This is very true, if you are one of the few that haven't seen it watch it now! The Story is very complex and interesting from the start and it continues to draw you in. It contains some very great music from Lights theme to Ls and the openings. If there's one thing Death Note achieves over any other Anime/Manga its the characters. L is possibly one of the coolest characters I've ever seen in an Anime. He is very smart and provides many moments of comic relief throughout. Light\
          \
        is also an amazing villain despite my pure hate for him. Overall Death Note is an amazing ride from beginning to end and will have you on the edge of your seat killing you with suspense. \

    Well this is gonna be short review so il get to the point. This anime was pretty awesome form beginning to end with a pretty cool story and characters. Even though the art and music is awesome i found that the true genius of this anime is that its not really about what the characters do but about what YOU would do if you where in their place you can basically choose your own protagonist and antagonist depending on your point of view. I for one would have backed up Light as i saw that what he did was for me the right thing but\

    Death Note is the most amazing story I have ever seen. It remains to this day my favorite piece of fiction.  The story is incredibly unique. The story has some dark themes, and really makes you think.\
The story is mostly split up into 3 parts, but the majority of the series breaks down to the battle between the Japanese police department and Kira, a mass murder who kills criminals by writing their name in a notebook. The epic battles of intelligence between the police investigation and Kira are what make this serious so endearing to watch and so mentally engaging.\
Story: The absolute best part\
          \
        of this series. The twist and turns make you demanding to watch the next episode. The strongest and most interesting story I have ever encountered. You will not be able to wait to see what Kira and the police department's next move will be. 10/10\
Art: It is very well animated, and everything from the grimness, to the insane look in kira's eye, to L's hard stare, set the mood perfectly. You can tell how far the world falls and how much desperation and insanity set in as it progresses. The quiter moments are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. 10/10\
Sound: From the exciting themes as Kira and L go head to head, to sutle background music as they lay in thought, set the mood perfectly for the story.  10/10\
Character: I have not met a single person who did not fall in love with L, and while light may be a little harder to like those who think similar to him, and even some who don't will cheer for him throughout. The cast is filled with a very diverse and interesting set of characters who almost all have some impact on the plot and help move the story forward. My only gripe with this is Misa can sometimes be really annoying. 9/19\
Enjoyment: I finished the entire series in 2 days of almost straight nonstop watching, and afterwards I felt like m best friend had just died. One of the most amazing experiences, one I would relive over and over if given the chance. 10/10\
Overall: If it is not clear yet, let me summarize: if you enjoy and engaging tale of intelligence, action, with some darker themes then you must absolutely watch death note. ",

    Death Note is the perfect anime for those who like the darker genres of anime, or very detective/mystery type things. You always have curve balls thrown at you, and the characters are loveable. Each one has their own likableness to them, but they all have their weak points as well. Well rounded foundation, good plot, great artwork. Now, for the live-action movies.. Equally as great. I loved every bit of the anime and the movies, both live-action and animated. The manga I haven't read really, but I read How To Read 13, and it gives wonderful information about each character and has some cute trivia\
          \
        inside. The two novels, The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases and L: Change The World were both beautifully written pieces. I loved every page, and even found something very puzzling about the word at the end of LABB. Maybe you can figure it out on your own, but I flipped out when I did some math and looking at the book. Very interactive.\

    Sometimes more than having any legit gripes, you'll be unable to get into something just because it's \"after your time.\" I just don't get the appeal of Death Note, it's like anime for the Hot Topic/nu-metal crowd. Really bad metalcore music, angst angst angst, a general goth pseudo-creepy vibe, and characters who seem to have more obvious quirks than personality. (Imagine all the awkward middle-schoolers who probably tried to imitate that tired looking guy's weird mannerisms and try not to retch.) \
I'll give this at least a 5 because I'm sure there's probably a decent plot in this somewhere if you're not instantly offput by\

    Ah, Death Note...I really recommend this anime...to basically...anyone...\
I'm one of those otaku that like the girly girl anime- shoujo or BL for this girl...very typical. And I saw a lot of Death Note on anime sites but I never tried it because it didn't look like my kind of thing...I sure was wrong though!\
It's not scary! It's more like a mystery, and that's what pulled me in. At the end of each episode there was a cliffhanger which made it so I HAD to watch the next episode. It's one of those \"just-one-more-episode\" types of animes. \
The story is solid, the main character, Light Yagami,\
          \
        has an actual motive. Although I will say that once Mello and Near come into the picture, well, even Light says himself that it's not as fun. But I had to watch it to the very end. \
It's the type of anime that will put you on the edge of your seat and keep you wanting more. L is a great character and so is Light's father, surprisingly, since most anime parents are constantly 'out of town'.\
I will admit that I hated Misa at first but you eventually get used to her and I sort of respected her toward the end. Things can get frustrating toward the middle of the series but keep with it! The end is well worth it~\

    Death Note is an outstanding anime. The ratings it gets are sometimes for the wrong reason. (In my opinion.) The story is great. I love the suspense and the characters and soundtrack play so well in to it. The show is unique, which makes it good, and it's not predictable. The characters are so well done. Especially Light. I love Light, he's very cool and I relate to him a lot. The character development is excellent, which is what makes him so cool. Definitely an anime to see before you die. \
The ending was sad but well done, I highly recommend it. You have to\

    Death Note is one of the most popular anime series that have ever been aired, and there is good reason behind that. There aren't any big robots, crazy samurai, scary monsters, or talking dogs, so how does it get it's popularity? It's because of the suspenseful plot, likable characters, and extremely interesting music.\
STORY:\
Death Note's story is a sight to behold, as every episode is filled with well thought-out twists. You will be sitting on the edge of your seat for every minute of every episode. And for those of you who enjoy fillers, there's bad news. There is not a single filler episode in the\
          \
        entire series.\
ART:\
The art was outstanding. I still have each and every expression Light used forged into my memory. Each character had their own look, unlike many shows that only really change the hair. \
SOUND:\
I have never come across a series with better music. Each opening and closing song fit the atmosphere of the series perfectly. And the background music was so fantastic it gave me shivers. I even downloaded the background music onto my iPod.\
CHARACTER:\
Each characters thoughts were displayed excellently, keeping any viewer from feeling lost. I could relate myself slightly to every character, making every moment even more enjoyable. Some of the character's backgrounds were not shown as well as the could have been, but that just made the characters even more mysterious. \
ENJOYMENT:\
I enjoyed every moment of Death Note. It was suspenseful and had no major holes in the story.\
OVERALL:\
Overall, I give Death Note a whopping 9.8/10\

    death not is a great anime that i would reccomend to everyone it may not be as long as bleach or other animes like it but death notes does a fantastic job of getting in a plot that is unmatched to nearly any others. \
it starts out as light (the main character) trys to find meaning to his life when he stumbles across a note book that can kill people. finding this hard to belive he tests it to find out its the real thing. he starts out with good morals but becomes power hungry and starts beliving he is GOD and that he should\
          \
        pass down judgment to all who oppose him\
\
the writters of this anime show that those who have power will lust for more they will go until it is absolute the same goes for light who tries more and more to controll the world so in conclusion all those who have power will be corrupted\

    Hello fellow Otakus  and welcome to my Review of Death Note!\
Death Note is a 37 Episode Anime Series Animated by Madhouse Studios from 2006-2007.\
Story:\
The Story for Death Note is brilliant and Original. Presenting intriguing situations for Light to experience, the Mystery setting is very well done with very serious and Dramatic moments. Actually everything is dramatic in Death Note even eating Potato Chips. Now to talk about the 2nd half of the show, a lot of people seem to hate it saying its dull and that the show should have ended sooner, I however disagree, I had no problems at all with the 2nd\
          \
        half, did I prefer the 1st half? Yes, but did I think that the 2nd half was bad? Not at all. But yeah the Story is very well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire duration of the show.\
Characters:\
Death Note presents you with some great characters, the focus of the show is on them, and the series wouldn’t have worked as well as it did if they hadn’t been presented the way they were. Now lets take a look at the main cast.\
1st you have Light Yagami, the lead character of the series, he is intelligent as all hell, he is always out smarting the enemy and even when you think he can’t find his way out of a situation, he comes up with a way that you never would have thought of. He was a great anti-hero of a main character and by far my favorite of the bunch.\
Next up is Ryuk, he is the one responsible for the Death Note coming in contact with Light. If he hadn’t dropped it into the human world there would be no series, therefore you would be doing more important things right now than reading my Review.\
Next on the list is L, L is a detective who is almost, if not, as intelligent as Light, most of the time you can’t figure out who is going to do what its very unpredictable because L is such a good match for Light. Now, a lot of people say L is their favorite character, mostly fan girls who squeal every time he’s on screen and although Light is my favorite Character, at first I had a hard time deciding who I liked more L or Light, it was difficult until the 2nd half of the series.\
Now we get to Misa, who is essentially the love interest for Light but really isn’t, because she wants the D while Light couldn’t care less, so it’s really that Light is her love interest. She also has a really dark back story, which I will not spoil in case you haven’t seen the series.\
And finally we get to Near, who to most people their most hated character in the show. He is the reason the 2nd half is hated, I personally, like I said before, enjoyed the 2nd half and I liked Near he wasn’t nearly as good as L but was still a nice match for Light.\
Sound:\
Death Note was English Dubbed by Viz Media and I have to say they did a great job, I think all of the actors did a really good job in their roles especially Brad Swaile as Light. The sound track is great providing dramatic music to make things more exciting during scenes that might otherwise be boring, the openings and endings are really good, Personally my favorite of them all is the 1st opening \"The World\" by Nightmare, being one of my favorite openings for an Anime Evar! So, there were no problems with the sound of this show.\
Final Score:\
Taking all of this information into account I give Death Note a 9/10 for being a great Dramatic Mystery show that anyone can watch and enjoy. That’s all for now, hope you liked my Review!",

    Story\
By far the best story I've read in a manga or seen in an anime.  It was short, but if it would have been any longer it would have been too long.  So many twists and turns!\
Art\
Looked good to me.\
Sound\
LOVED the music!\
Character\
Light and L are by far the two best characters I've seen in anime/manga.  There is no comparison, the chemistry these two have actually makes this series.  Near and Mello aren't as good as L, but they were entertaining and made a good combo.\
Enjoyment\
I could not put this down.  It was so gripping that I had to finish it.\
          \
         I wish it would have been longer, but if it would have been then it would have been too long and lost some of its luster.\
Overall\
Hands down the best Anime/Manga I've ever seen/read.  It will take a lot to top this one.  I'm hoping that Monster can get close!\

    I liked the change of pace at having the \"villain\" (according to some) is the protagonist instead of the \"hero.\" Also like the test of moral of it's audience since Kira is vouching to kill only those who have done wrong. Well, at least in the beginning anyways. However, Death Note is a far cry from Monster as far as testing the edges of morality.\
(Spoiler)\
Once L dies the good tension that was created died, and therefore the whole anime died at that point. There was no point in watching any further.\

    See all those 10s?  It earned all of them.  This anime is hands down one of the best anime I have recently released.  Old school anime has it own place for me.  Death note is an intense series and you'll always be wondering what Light or L will do next it has a fair amount of action but it's a engages your mind on a much deeper level than the typical action/intense anime.  No episode is a disappointment.  No matter what preference in anime you have, everyone should at least TRY this series.\

    To begin with: Death Note is one of my favorite...if not my favorite anime. It has a unique plot line, and you have to keep up with the story or you'll be lost.\
Story:\
A note belonging to a Shinigami falls to the human world. Anyone whose name is written in the note will die. A student named Light Yagami picks up this notebook, and uses it to rid the world of all criminals. \
...Basically, if you yourself found a Death Note, would you use it for the same goal? What would you do if you found a weapon this deadly? Murder is still murder, isn't it?\
          \
\
Art:\
I've never seen an anime that has art like this (I'm pretty sure there's some out there, but I never usually watch this genre). It matches beautifully. \
\
Character:\
Very well developed characters. Though, of course, they have to be for the idea to work. Logical thinking is a must, and most of the episodes are taken up with what is going through their minds. \
\
Overall, it's an amazing anime. It's the best I've found so far ^ ^\

    Death Note was a great show. The plot in my opinon was so deep and spanned out to be something way more than i expected. The characters are all wrapped around in the plot followed by a ton of wonders and mysteries that drove me to keep watching. Also this show includes one of the most saddest anime deaths in history. All the people who have seen death note, know who i am talking about. The rest of you, you will just have to watch it to find out! :)\

    Death Note is one of those anime's that after episode 1, its really boring but it moves on fairly quick to your excitement that I have to say from what I've seen, Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. \
Where in other anime's, it relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note has that refreshing feel that changes its pace. It's sneaky, slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric \"L\" who leads the investigation against the protagonist. Its basically like of cat and mouse, both \"L\" and \"Light\" trying to outwit each other. Yeah, the plot can be a\
          \
        little complex and complicated but its easily laid out for the viewer that its easy enough to understand that you would quickly notice the intelligent and remarkable plot that it gives you. \
Two geniuses who battle it out against each other who's IQs both turn out to be completely impossible since both L and Light's theories are both correct and that's what makes them two protagonist scarier and that you simply cannot stop admiring the theories the two protagonist makes and that if you view the anime in your own personal view, you'd be brainwash by your own genius that you'd go insane. \
There was not a time where I was watching, I was sitting down or laying down just watching it with a straight face, no my eyes were literally in front of the screen every minute Death Note is playing. \

    This has to be the best Anime ever created. Period. Light Yagami may be a psychopath, but I do understand his vision for a better world. He's like... Saint Dane from Pendragon. He started with a good vision, but power corrupted him. He made the mistake of thinking himself to be a God, and he payed with his life. He also made bad decisions in choosing his disciples. Misa Amane was a complete moron, and Teru Mikami was insane. Light's mind games with L and Near, and even Mello, were all interesting. Ryuk also kept it funny. And I will forever worship Touta Matsuda for\
          \
        shooting Light in the end. That was awesome! Matsuda was so... friendly towards Light throughout the whole series. He was the only one who never doubted Light, and Light was really his only friend. It really showed how badly Light messed up. He may have been at the top of his class, but he really wasn't all that smart. He was just a visionary with too much power.\

I heard about that anime from my friend who has fall in love with it, but I was a bit disappointed.\
Maybe it's because of taht noise about ' the best ' anime ever.\
Well :\
The story is great, I have to admited. It's intresting and unique - everything will be all right, if number of episod wasn't so big ( it becam boring sometimes ).\
Art is average, it isn't very good, but also isn't so bad.\
Sound was the best part what move me ! Specially the opening.\
Characters : hm, our famous L - yea, I like him, he was strange, but thanks to that,\
          \
        he was also mystery, and I really like that person. What about main character? He was tricky and inteligent, but in the end my opinion about him became smaller.\
If you like psychological anime, than you should watch it, but don't have too mych of hope.\

    This show is something that I think anyone who likes to watch anime should watch. And when they are done watching, they should grab the manga and read it too. The plot is amazingly well developed, and the you cant help but wonder who the real bad guy is.\
I loved this show. The development of the characters and how they interact is great. Every episode is just a buildup to the finale, which, unless you know the story or are a fairly skilled detective, it will keep you guessing up to the last minute.\

    Well what should I say and where should I begin\
Death note is one of the fewest Anime out there that can really make you believe in the brilliance of Animated shows for real, and quite frankly it is an Anime with no need for reviews, one can just simply cry out (WATCH DEATH NOTE) instead of pointlessly trying to convince people who didn't yet watch it\
From beginning we are graced by our anti-hero Light Yagami, a brilliant high school student who happens upon a Note that exacts death on any human whose name is written in it, to make things even more thrilling, Yagami is\
          \
        frustrated with the world as it is (fantasy meets reality), infatuated by the ideals of justice and the visions of a new world, our protagonist begins his amazing battle for dominance (not your average high school idiot who screams I WILL PROTECT MY FRIENDS slogans all over the screen, and yet he is the main character in a quickly expanding setting of Drama versus Psychological thriller) what follows is a series of unbelievable character cast, and story line that will most surely leave you breathlessly hooked starting from episode 1\
A serious show that is without extra needless fillings, not something you can find that easy, featuring stunning artwork, crazy mind battles, this masterpiece is not for the light-hearted or the easy going, Death Note is about anything but easy\
From unbelievable plot twists to character depth to art to thrilling soundtracks\
it truly is the ultimate form of Anime, because by the end of it the viewer is guaranteed to be left with quite an impact\
Aside from all the flattery I would say that what really makes Death note a masterpiece is its ability to make you think (and forcefully) you can never let a scene slide easily or you'll suffer the consequences of being left in the dark or being unable to clue out a primary piece of the plot\
you see, Death Note is all about focus (and hard), and one of the few shows that made me really feel what I thought about, only rivaled by NGE (Neon Genesis Evangelion) this show is certainly not for people who want to have a good time watching some splashes on the screen \
Not just that, Death note urges you to take sides, share in character motives, and finally feel (through understanding) what makes each person do what they do, that too shares in the magnificence that makes Death Note what it is\
In my honest opinion, this is one show you cannot leave unseen\

    Hmmm. . . . . . . Ladies and Gentleman, the masterpiece of the dark series has finally arrive at the name of Death note.\
Story : pretty well written, flawless plot twist, first half is good and pretty well done, but the second half is better for me.\
Animation : HOLY GOD! Animation is awesome, hands down for it. Although it didn't get the perfection of drawing the special effects are awesome.\
Characters : sorry L fans but i like Light more than him, Light is a simple student but HOLY FUCK he's so intelligent. He's good at strategy against L, sorry guys but L underestimated Light\
          \
        since start so Light easily beat him, which Near didn't do to Light at the second events. Misa also bring us that it's not to be always serious, she is the reason why the series is so enjoyful.\
Soundtrack : MASTERPIECE, well done to our musicians named Hirano Yoshihisa and Hideki Taniuchi, i was speechless, so perfect, they are the make version of Kajiura Yuki. The light's theme is the great one, also the low of solipsism is pretty well done.\
Opening and ending soundtrack : \
Opening - nice choose of opening, the world of nightmare is awesome and it brings me to a Final Fantasy feeling. But i was disappointed at the second opening the,e song, my ears just broke at the second OP and i was like \"WTF\"\
Ending - Alumina is the best Ed TBH, it surpass the opening level, so far it's the best song of Death note (excluding soundtracks) the ending, Setsubo Billy is awesome too, but it didn't surpass the Alumina\
\
Overall : Death note is worth watching, some said if they didn't show the second Half,it would not be a masterpiece, but for me the second half is very awesome, the actions there are superb\
WELL DONE Tsugumi ohba and Takeshi Obata and Madhouse studio for this masterpiece\

    The first 18 episodes or so consumed my life.  In my opinion, they're flawless.  I found it unpredictable and suspenseful and I couldn't get enough.  The middle arc bored me a bit, and I stopped watching it.  I then proceeded to find a full  plot synopsis online and was blown away with how it wrapped itself up.  I finished the series and I truly wish I hadn't lost faith around the middle.\
The main \"protagonist\" is one of my favorite characters of all time.  In fact, a good chunk of the characters are really well portrayed.  They have\
          \
        clear (but often complex) motives and thought processes.  They're easy to hate to love, or love to hate.  Or love to love, as the case was for me with some of them.\
It's an original plotline.  If you're into the idea of social justice but don't want something that's full of graphic murder or drawn-out fights, this is the anime for you.  All of the fighting is more mental than physical, which is what I really liked.  If you're looking for something that will make you constantly wonder \"what next?\" this is definitely for you.\
I still stand my ground that the middle part is  drab and almost unnecessary compared to the beginning and the end, but stick through it.  It's worth it.  I wish I had remained patient and stuck with it.  If you intentionally find spoilers, it takes away a lot of enjoyment.\

    had this retained the cat/mouse tension and had more of the intense / brilliant gambits this would be a no brainer 9+, but unfortunately this series dies with the main antagonist. it's unfortunate the illusion of the protagonists and antagonists intelligence / wit falls apart with critical errors in logic (made later on) that are seemingly made for no other reason but to help the series meet its anticlimactic and overdue demise. it's a shame, this was gripping early on. i can't help but feel like this was one of the biggest let downs ever in anime, but at the same time for a few\

    This is my first review. I had heard the name Death Note quite alot but until very recently ignored it. What a mistake this was from the first episode I was hooked ok it was not the best first episode out there but it left that feeling of wanting to know what happens next so I promptly put the next episode on and that was it full blown hooked. the introduction of L was pretty decent but it was not until I saw L's true identity that I fell in love with character his addiction to the sweeter things in life never failed to put\

        a smile on my face. the score in Death not is also one of the best I have heard I personally prefer the second intro music it reminded me of a Japanese system of a down.

In short this is a fantastic Anime worthy of anyone's time if you have yet to see it I strongly suggest that you give it a try. well done to everyone who made this small masterpiece. \

      When I was 16 years old, I was aware to the anime ''Death Note''. I always wanted to watch it, but I didn't have a time, because of the studies.\
But after I've graduated and the anime was still popular, after it was finished airing, I decided to watch it after I've finished D. Gray Man in the holidays.\
And thus, any Wednesday (Every day I am watching a different anime), I found myself as a following after Light's steps on the way to kill his victims, while he uses a powerful notebook which called: ''Death Note''.\
Story: Exceptional! During the most shounen animes are busy\
          \
        in to cut monsters or evil guys, Death Note brought a genuine story that wasn't in another anime.\
Because after all, this anime, you learn that you can't change the world and decide who will live and who will die and only god can do it by itself. What makes the anime educational. LOL\
Art: The art was very dark ling, proper to a plot which have dark elements. The background suits well the occupations that happened in the anime non-stop.\
But, can someone tell me why Ryuk and the other shinigamis went ugly with scary faces? Why they have no humanity faces such  as the human, which have normal faces? I don't know, but, so be it.\
Sound: The sound is such as the art. Suits the plot very much. But I don't understand one thing: Why there is a returning continuity that there is a sound of flowing water and after that, Kira's theme? But still, the songs are addicting (Ask also the people who that their favorite song is ''What's Up People?'') and the voice actors in Japanese made a good work (Luckily, I didn't saw in English): Miano Mamorou made a good work as Light, Aya Hirano, went out Misa as well: Dumb as a popstar can please. Yamaguchi Kappei did L very mysterious and after that how he did an awsome character after InuYasha.\
Characters: Although Light was the main character, sorry to tell it, but Ryuk is the real star of the anime. Although he dropped the Death Note to the human world and followed after Light, while the second was busy to kill criminals for a better world, Ryuk didn't do anything without eating apples, but still, in the end he went a king.\
But with all the respect for Light and Ryuk, my most favorite character is Lawliet L of course. The fangirls (of L) behind me are whispering to me that he is hot. Yes, he is very hot, but it's not enough. In my opinion, the reason I loved L so much, is because he was very smart and very intelligent. He was chasing Kira in any sophisticated plans that for them, he needed the Japanese police and acted them well. You can say that Near is very smart (He leaded the SPK) or Mello is very smart (He used in the abduction way), but still, a guy who plays toys (Near) and a guy who always eats chocolate and leads a mafia, can't beat a guy, although eats sweets all time, knows what he does.\
Although Misa was my hated character, because of her foolishness (That maybe came from her voice actor), Misa was a character with a very sad personal life story, and that's why she values Kira's work, although she has a shinigami by herself (Rem).\
Enjoyment: I was very enjoyed from the anime. It was such as a spinning roller coaster in specially. Maybe some people think Death Note is overrated, so, guys, you didn't see anything. Death Note is an anime with a very big lesson to your life, in my opinion, but say what you want.\
Overall: If you are looking for a shounen anime with ideas that would never been in the other animes of the genre, go to watch Death Note and you won't be disappointment even for a minute.\

    For me, Yagami Light is an adolescent  who get tired of studying, watching tv or using his computer. He get bored of following the rules of a society that he dislikes a lot; when he found a note with the ability of killing people without letting a clue of his identity, he wanted to create a perfect world, a world in which he would be a god.\
Although the idea of a world in which there are no \"bad guys\" is something wanted by most honorable citizens, Light will find out that he cannot make the changes he desires. \
Death Note is an anime that\

    THIS WILL CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS: Well Death Note is a very good anime but I feel as though it really does make some really bad choices. The anime is unofficialy broken up in to three parts. The 1st part i felt was very good. It kept a very good tension with the search for the mysterious Kira aka Light Yagami. At one point it had me rooting so hard for Light to figure out this girls name so he could kill her, which i found terribly morbid but it was compelling enough to make me wish death on her. I also found the man leading\
          \
        the search for Kira, L, to be a very fascinating character id like to know more about. The 2nd part, Light actually joins up in the search for Kira, which i felt lost alot of the tension the series had been building up because they started looking for a different Kira. In the 3rd part, again spoiler warning, they kill off L, who i thought was an awsome character and needed some characterization but gets killed off. Then the worst part is that they replace him with some gay kid named Near who i found was trying to be L so fucking hard im surprised he didnt shit himself. Then the biggest insult is he actually catches Light when L could not. Seriously that little shit was nothing compared to L. I wanted him to die sooooo bad. but the ending was emotionaly satisfying shitty Near nonwithstanding. Overall a good anime that wastes a very interesting antagonist.\

    I absolutely loved Death Note from episode 1 right to the end, It is a very good horror anime with not that much comedy, yet I still enjoyed it.\
The characters of the story, particularly Light Yagami, with his dual personality really deserves an extra point on the character part.\
The story was also very well planned out over the 37 episode run, and I personally felt that it deserved to be that little bit longer to see what would happen next with the other main characters.\
The art was just amazing, the way they used different colours in thought sequences was very good too, also that the\

    I've never been one to like anime.  I could never get into it.\
....Until...  \
...I saw 'Death Note.'  I was instantly hooked by the first episode.  Usually, with anything I watch, it starts to get boring after a few episodes.  The more episodes that I watched, the more I got into it.  Not only is it filled with suspense, but there's also a comedic edge.  \
Personally, the downfall for many television series, is the same \"outline\" being used over and over again in episodes.  This results in having the same boring beginning and ending.  Everyone knows what's\
          \
        going to happen.  This is not the case for 'Death Note.'  That's what I found most enjoyable and what instantly hooked me.\

    Personally, I thought the Death Note story line was perfect and as a manga enthusiast, first and foremost, I found the little add ins and changes a bit disturbing but the anime did attempt to be faithful to the original story which earns this an enjoyment rating a ten. The music, to my belief, was suited. The voice talents matched the character well. The story pacing good. Over all it was a good time spent.\
Story-wise, the watcher is confronted with the cliche, age-long question \"Does the end justify the means?\", \"Can killing be justified?\" entwined with psychological attacks, tactical mind war. The watcher takes sides\
          \
        and root for their player which usually representing something the individual believes personally. It's wonderful experience, a story that I believe shouldn't be missed. It's a cliche idea revolutionized and packaged for the modern time.\

    With mediocre art and good-but-not-great sound, Death Note has to win the audience with other things. There are very unique and likeable characters. But unfortunately, all characters are one demensional and lack depth. You only need no more than 2 words to describe each of them. Again, good but not great. What truly makes DN stands out is its story and the enjoyment come with it, at least for the first half. The first half of the story is a masterpiece. It keeps taking unexpected turns while making sense, and full of thrills. It becomes a bit sloppy between episode 17-20 but quickly peaks again\
          \
        until episode 25. I'd give it 10/10 for story and enjoyment for the first 25 episodes. Unfortunately, the story goes down hill from there. There were still moments of brilliance but becomes an average story. It feels the writer runs out of ideas. The twists becomes less logical and the ending is pretty lame. As a whole this is still a very good story but no long a masterpiece.\

    \"I have two rules. First: I am never wrong. Second: If I am wrong, then back to the first rule.\" -L\
All right. So here it is. My second, sometimes first favorite anime, for very good reasons. Let's delve into those reasons, shall we?\
First thing I have to say is, that there is a reason why a lot of people call it the best. And that's because in my opinion, it really is. It's really deep, and the show focuses on mind game after mind game. If this show were a game of chess, it would be one of the closest and most beautiful games since\
          \
        the creation of chess. The comical thing about this show, is that Ohba, the believed writer of the anime, is just as mysterious as my favorite character in the show: L. He's also my favorite anime character, again tied with somebody else in Monster. And there is a monster in this show, too. The one that calls himself the God of the New World!\
Story: 10\
One of the most creative ideas for a supernatural element in an anime would HAVE to be the Death Note. It's so fun to think about what you personally would do if you had one. The story follows our main character, Light Yagami, and his ideals about what the world should look like. The only PROBLEM is that he's absolutely evil. But at the same time... In a way, he's doing something good. It's a moral gray. Perhaps Light is evil, but the amount of evil people in the world is also decreasing. So it's no surprise that there are Kira supporters in the show (and in real life) and people who are opposed to Kira and want to catch him. The brilliant plot is about Light's struggles with creating the New World, as people through wrenches in his plan. Also, it's very rare that you get a villain as THE main character.\
Most people that have seen Death Note will have no problem saying that the first 25 episodes are masterpieces. It's the last 12 episodes that a lot of fans have problems with, and for reasons that I'm not going to get into, because of spoilers. So... What's my verdict on the last 12? Honestly, I like them just as much as the rest of the show. And the way that the show ends is so beautiful and sad that it makes me cry. But if you don't like it, that's understandable. A lot of people don't. But also realize that a lot of people do.\
Also, this anime doesn't contain any plot-holes, and only a few minor continuity errors (for example, the Death Note is shown to fall face-down. But when Light goes to pick it up, it's face-up). This anime also contains the whole \"Becoming God\" cliché and the \"That's impossible!\" cliché, but it's done RIGHT!\
Art: 10\
Has a very unique and creative animation style. A lot of the colors that they use are brilliant, especially when the show reveals a character's \"true colors\" quite literally. A different color is assigned to each color. For example, Light's is red (because he's evil, of course) and L's is blue (because it's mysterious and also looks great with him). Definitely contains some of the prettiest artwork in anime (in my opinion). Though, I have seen better, surprisingly!\
Sound: 10\
\"Kira! Deus! Vici! Canti!\" which roughly translates to English from Latin has \"Kira, our unstoppable God, will be victorious\" is sang frighteningly by the choir in \"Low of Solipsism;\" one of Light's main themes. In fact, all of Light's themes are good. All of L's, all of Near's, all of Mellos... Everybody's! And don't even get me started on the intros and outros. They are just as good as the rest of the soundtrack and it really knows how to set the tone of the show. I applaud whoever composed these. Probably my favorite anime soundtracks.\
Character: 10\
Here we have some of the most lovable and deep characters in anime. They aren't deep in the sense that they really have backstories (because most really don't), but they are deep in a sense of what they stand for, and how realistically they deal with situations. The characters have to make sense of something impossible (the ability to kill with only a name and a face) and try to be optimistic when dealing with the most DIFFICULT murder case the world has ever seen. There's not one character I disliked. In fact, a couple of characters that some people hate, I actually love.\
Enjoyment: 10\
Before Death Note, the only anime that I had seen was pretty much DBZ, Yugioh, Yugioh GX, Pokemon, and other long anime. DBZ was my all time favorite and I didn't think that anything would be able to top it for me. But as it turns out, Death Note, and quite a lot of other anime, top it for me. And it's all because I decided to watch Death Note. People at school were talking about it and I asked questions about the Death Note and I thought that the concept was really cool. I even liked it before I watched it. And although I knew the biggest spoiler in the show, it was still surprising when it happened. If you haven't seen this anime, you are certainly missing out. There's also a lot of humor sprinkled throughout the show.\
Overall: 10\
This is ONE of the deepest anime I've seen, but a few may surpass that. But regardless, Death Note is just fun. And awesome. And sad. And exciting. And so many other words. I'm sure a lot of fans will agree with this review, because of how overwhelmingly popular it is. I mean, its popularity on this site is #1 after all, and for a good reason! So, thank you so much to you Ohba and Obata for creating such a masterpiece. I even own six figurines and Near's finger puppets. That's how much I love Death Note.\

    This show is an incredible journey exploring the way that the Death Note affects human society and especially the ones who possess them. The show is like a roller coaster that moves very slowly.  It also features some of the most incredible characters I have ever seen, L and Ryuk in particular.\
Pros: Original characters, OP and EDs are heavy music but deeply symbolic, musical score is deep, the tension created by the dialogue is fierce and meaningful, and the show combines Western religious ideals and entwines them together with Japanese spirituality in a soul-shattering detective hunt. The show forces you to think about sacrifice,\
          \
        and the painful decisions characters have to make as a consequence of the looming death and lies around them. The art style is very bizarre and beautiful.\
Cons: The 2nd arc is too convoluted story-wise. New characters are rushed in without being properly developed first, unlike the first arc of the show which took all the time it needed. The 2nd arc didn't feel as novel as the 1st.\

    I thoroughly enjoyed the anime while watching, however, I do believe there could've been a few changes.\
Honestly, I thought the art was great, and the main idea of the show was definitely intriguing.  At first, I had enjoyed watching, but there were a couple times in which I believed it was lame, mainly on how they figured out certain parts of the mystery.  If I brush it off, then it was a good start.\
Later on in the series, it did seem to get a little jumpy, and I found myself rewinding on parts.  Other than that, as long as I continued to\
          \
        keep my focus on the show, it was a good mixture of mystery and action.  \
Overall I was really into the show and could enjoy it.  If you are ever looking for a show that you can watch to just enjoy, this is absolutely your show.  I was able to finish the series in about two months and found myself pleased with the ending.  On a lot of shows I would want a sequel or at least a different ending, however, I think this ended the way it should be.  \

    Death Note is one of those anime that almost everyone knows about and for good reason the show has some of the most well written characters and an even more well written story.\
The story revolves around the concepts \"is it okay to kill someone evil\" and \"should anyone hold the power to end someone's life on a whim\". The story starts off with Ryuk a Shinigami Death God and Light Yagami, they are both bored in their world so Ryuk decides to drop the Deathnote (a notebook with the power to kill any person whos name is written in it) Light happens to find the\
          \
        notebook a doesn't believe in it at first until he tries it, this gives Light the idea to \"make the world a better place by killing off the worlds criminals\". This causes a chain of events that lead to the world's greatest detective L who is known for being able to solve any case to take up the charge of capturing whoever is responsible for killing the criminals. The story takes many twists and turns making you wonder is this it for Light? Or is this it for L? Through masterful storytelling Death Note's story is no normal mystery you already know who the culprit of the murders are it is a matter just sitting back and watching the events unfold. Death Note contains many journeys through lies, deceit and the mind games and suffering that those bring.\
The characters are extremely well written in this story. First Light Yagami, a genius high-school student who is bored out of his mind. Once Light gets a hand on the Death Note things start to finally seem interesting to him and he decides to use it to make the world into a better place or at least what he believes to be a better place. Throughout the series we see many sides of Light such as cruelty, caring, acting, a mastermind and a god like persona. After seeing all of those sides to Light you come to understand him and ultimately hate or love his character.\
Next we have L the worlds greatest detective who has decided to track down the killer of the criminals, no one knows his name or face except for his special assistant Watari. L is the same as Light in many ways but different in many as well, their conflicting values and morals leads to many mind games between the 2. L is a great character because if you end up hating Light you will probably love L's character they are so similar yet still remain as different as can be due to the wonderful story telling.\
Other characters include Misa Amane who is in love with Kira (the name the public gave to the mysteries killer of criminals). Misa is the perfect compliment to Light she is able do things Light can't but also hinders him at the same time making Light extremely frustrated at times. N and M are also major characters in the story as they are rivals yet must work together if they wish to achieve their goal.\
The investigation team are also major characters in the story as they provide some comedic moments in the story as well some help to L and Light throughout the story.\
The art and the sound of the show was good fluid animation well placed sounds and good scenes. The opening and the endings of the show's first and second half are great to.\
Overall the series was extremely enjoyable as it brings out the concepts I listed before and gives the viewer the question \"what is right and what is wrong\".\
This show will always remain in my top 5 best shows I have ever seen and it might just make yours as well.\
I would highly recommend this show to anyone especially if you like psychological anime.\

I can say that I loved this series. The story is very good, it is tense, it is fun, it makes you think what the next move will be, but, I must be honest I didn't like the end, I am Team Light. \
Characters were very well developed, at least most of them. L was extremely good, but they overdid it with Near, I mean, L was supposed to be better than him, but Near solved the case too fast,  even with the help of L's notes, it was too much.\
          \
        As the end was nearing Light was getting more nervous so he started making very obvious mistakes that helped Near and that wasn't the Light that we knew before. I mean, I guess that was planned, but we could have had some more fun if there were more episodes with more cases, developments, research. And Mello's character was absolutely the weirdest one, everytime he appeared he was different from before. ",

    This review will be in two parts, the reason is because, for me I feel like the plot changes a lot after episode 25. So in this review I'll call every episode from 25 and before season 1, and every episode after 25 season 2.\
{Season 1} \
Story(10/10): It's hard, really hard to make a good characters... Its even harder to make him seem highly intelligent. It's also hard to give an intelligent protagonist a realistic threat... But the story achieves this perfectly and it feels like their is no plot armor between the main protagonist and main antagonist. \
Art(7/10): For the time it had good\
          \
        art, and it even holds up today with having better art than a lot of anime that came after. But compared to the top shows of today, It doesn't compare. The art style does fit the tone and story really good but that's about it.\
Sound(8/10): The BG music really fits the tone and hypes up the moments, not a fan of the death metal OP, but that's just an opinion.\
Characters(9/10): There is one character that makes me not give this a perfect 10/10, but the main protagonist Light, and main antagonist have a really good conflict that cannot be told without spoilers.\
{Season 2}\
Story(7/10): This is where the story starts to lose some momentum... Some plot holes are thrown in, sure just about every anime and show has plot holes though... But the difference is that its more than what where used to.\
Art(7/10): Same as before.\
Characters(7/10): The only character you'll mostly enjoy is the main protagonist. (Light spoiler: The main antagonist changes and is just a less enjoyable version of the last with a different name and less likable personality.) Also, the side characters lack.\
Overall: You'll enjoy this series, it's a must watch for any anime fan and was the best early 2000's anime. (Opinion)\

    Here it is. The infamous anime by the name of Death Note that took the anime world by storm in fall 2006. Studio Madhouse was not pumping out 2-3 anime a season anymore and went back to their ways that made the Studio such a powerhouse a few years prior. The director chosen for the role was an ambitious story board guy by the name of Tetsurou Araki whom later went on to direct some other hits like Attack on Titan and Guilty Crown. Death Note is a different anime to say the least and in the psychological thriller genre which focuses on plot rather\
          \
        than the characters.\
Motivation and plot are rather simple. A Shinigami/death god was bored and \"lost\" his notebook. A young man named Light finds the notebook and learns that if you write someone’s name in it as long as you know their face would die. Light then begins his quest to cleans the world of evil using this book as well as remaining secretive from a detective named ‘L’ and his crew who are hot on his trail to capture him.\
This plot is rather interesting and thrilling, but what makes Death Note so enticing are the characters. L is the most interesting as his personality is beyond a simple explanation. The eccentric cat and mouse game that Light and L play make the first arc of the story one of the best ever in anime. One issue though after the initial arc, the second tends to repeat scenarios from the first going from Light using the death note in an interesting way, followed by L finding some invisible clue, and Light somehow arbitrarily escaping, thus continuing the cycle. Finally, once certain events happen and a time skip occurs, this is where the plot falls straight off of a cliff. A few more characters are introduced each contributing greatly to the arc they are part of, but fails to even come close to the thrilling tales and moments of that original arc. So much of the plot drags and the viewer loses that sense of caring why events occur. \
Sure, the animation and art quality is top notch. The music more or less fits the show, but more often than not over dramatizes moments creating an unintentional comedic relief. Voice acting in both English and Japanese are fantastic, so picking either or is a hit.\
Summing up Death Note could be best stated as a series that went to 37 episodes that when the second arc concluded end at episode 25 would have made for an almost perfect show with only a few flaws. Instead, a third arc was made to continue the story (as did the manga with rumors ensuing) that ultimately kills the show. Such a shame for such an iconic anime.\

I won't jump into bandwagons. Really.. umm.. well maybe a little but this will be a bit different since I'm not a blind follower, if that makes sense.

    The anime was rated as a \"Masterpiece\" by Anime News Network's users. The writer Zac Bertschy defined the series as a \"surprisingly gripping and original suspense tale that raises a handful of interesting questions about morality\". Death Note was one of the series to win the Best TV anime at 2007 Tokyo International Anime Fair.\
Death Note was one of the series that influenced me the most since I started to watch anime. Before watching this series, I was not watching any suspense/thriller/mystery anime and sticked myself to action shounen. However, Death Note made me realize the richness of this type of anime. First, the story\
          \
        is incredible, the idea to have a killing notebook is amazing and the fact that the main character uses it to kill criminals instead of being a criminal himself is also incredibly well-thought. The story is flawless without contradictions, which makes it very entertaining and nice to watch. The suspense generated by the mind fights between Kira and L creates an amazing climax which makes the viewer always willing to watch another episode. The only thing I could say that is a stain on the table is that I found the series too long and I think that it would have been better to keep it to 22-26 episodes. The fact is that this series is heavy and deep, and that makes it difficult for new viewers to watch many episodes. The soundtrack is insane. It makes the viewer feel the same discomfort as the characters and it makes him feel like he is in Death Note's world, and that's pretty amazing. The characters are a great asset of the series, especially Light and L, because they have a personnality that is very specific to them, you cannot find someone like that every street corner and that makes the series very attractive, because we are interested in what we don't know. The animation was made in 2006 so I found it less interesting than some other series that are more recent. This series deserves a 9 on 10.\

    For me, Death Note wasn't a very a good anime.\
The characters were fine, but there were too many to develop in only 37 episodes. Light was left mostly mysterious, which is bad considering he's the main character. We only knew about his family and the reason he wanted the Death Note. THATS IT. We never learned about his personal life, more about his perosnality, etc. Ryuk was fine, and i honestly think he was the best character. He had the biggest part in the anime, being the shinigami and helping Light 'become god'. Without Ryuk, the show would never had existed, because he was the\
          \
        one who dropped the Death Note. L was honestly pointless because in the end he just died and was replaced by Near. Speaking of Near, he wasn't really important either. Sure, he caught Light, but that was it. He wasn't critical to any other part of the anime. Mello was just another bad guy, and Matt, WHY. Matt had no point at all! He was there for like, 5 minutes! Misa was just there to help Light, and Rema ended up dead as well.\
\
The story was a 5. It was kinda plain and boring and didn't have a twist in it. Although, it was a bit cool when L died because the fans went crazy, leaving excitment into the goddamn fandom. But otherwise, it was OK. Not the best but not the absolute worst.\
The sound was very well done. The voice actors for both the sub and the dub matched the characters very well. The first opening would not leave your head for a while and would get fans up and dancing! The second opening leaned more towards the metal side, and was pretty good. The endings i never really payed attention to, but they were pretty catchy. They could've been better though.\
The art style was very detailed yet impressive. Some of the facial expressions were a bit scary to be honest. Ryuk and Rema were EXTREMELY detailed which made it hard to made fanart, and L wasn't detailed enough. \
I'd give it a 3 for enjoyment. Before watching it, i was very excited. But as i got into it, it became boring. There were very few plot twists and to be honest, i didn't cry at all when L died. My emotion during the whole thing was 'bored', and i love animes that throw so many emotions at you at once.\
Overall, i give Death Note a 5. It wasn't the best, nor the worst.\

    Death Note was a different kind of mystery than what I expected at first. The story's a classic set-up of two genius masterminds locked in a spectacular battle of wits full of intrigues and lies, but told from the point of view of the culprit rather than the investigator, which made the series about seeing the various ways Light tried to keep L from finding out the truth about the Death Note.\
The art and sound were decent, but nothing to write home about. However, I felt like the show really gets to shine when you get down to the main conflict. The first 24 episodes\
          \
        were all great as they managed to develop Light and L's relationship really well and keep my hooked, but it felt like the series overstaid its welcome by trying to keep going after it had lost most of its momentum, story-wise.\
All in all, I'd definitely recommend this series in spite of its shortcomings because of how well it managed to present interesting twists and turns in the plot without creating glaring inconsistencies or ridiculous plot devices such as deus ex machinas. If you like spy fiction or detective stories told from the culprit's POV, you can't do wrong with giving Death Note a try.\

And the ending is perfect. I'm not really sure what to say about this anime. Is it perfect? No. But that doesn't mean it's not an outstanding 10/10. There is no way you could regret watching this. The plot is perfect and it takes so many fast turns. Death Note keeps you on the edge the entire time wondering who will come out on top. The character cast is excellent! Everyone they introduce brings something important and game-changing to the table. All in all, Death Note really does deserve its #1 spot. It's a rare masterpiece.\

    Overview-10 out of 10\
Death Note is probably the most different of the shonen anime I have been exposed to. As all the shonen that I have been exposed to, which include excessive combat, Death Note is more phsycological and cat and mouse. It is thoroughly entertaining and suspenseful, keeping me hooked and on the edge of my seat, leaving me eager to see the next episode. \
Art: 10 out of 10\
Death Note's Illustrater, Takeshi Obata, put a lot of work into his illustrations. They are detailed and almost eerily realistic. I am blown away by his great attention to detail. It is an anime/manga drawing\
          \
        style that I humbly follow.\
Sound: 9 out of 10\
I watched the Death Note dubbed series in it's entirety on AdultSwim.com and I must say it is the best dubbed anime I have ever watched. The voices are perfectly cast, though sometimes (but rarely) annoying. The backing music is surgingly powerful and perfect for the anime. \
Charachters: 9 out of 10\
The Charachters are very well-constructed. They keep the story moving with their in-depth observations and personal quirks. Being a sucker for the charachter of L--I gladly admit it--I can definitely see that in the charachters. I also loved that when the plot was enriched in its progression, the charachters were stripped away to their core, like biting into an apple, the main symbol of Death Note.\
Enjoyment: 10 out of 10\
Death Note was an anime I watched in its entirety it was so good. I reveled, laughed, cried and was even thrilled by the thickening and complex plot as more and more of the charachters were revealed. I get chills at how good it gets. \
Overall: 10 out of 10\
Death Note is reccomended for those fans who like to see a different side of shonen, the side that isn't physical combat, but psychological and mental puzzles. If you like seeing charachters fighting through mind games, then tune in and be prepared to be on the edge of your seat!!!\

    This is a Review out of 100. 35/100 for Story, 35/100 for Characters, 15/100 for Sound, 15/100 for Animation.\
Story - 28/35 - The story was very original, especially for a shounen series. Instead of physical fights, this show opted for mental fights, or mind games. You never really knew what would happen next, and while the show followed a cat vs mouse flow, you never knew who was gonna be the cat and who was gonna be the mouse. The show also brought up the question of what you would do if you were in a similar position of power, and shows how easily power\
          \
        can corrupt people. Sadly, I was not a big fan of the Near and Mello arc, as I think the writing in the series took a nose dive. Characters also started getting stupid for plot convenience, especially Light. Personally, I'd have a lot more nice things to say about the show if it would have ended around episode 25/26. \
Characters - 29/35 - I really like Light Yagami as a character. You almost want to agree with what he was doing. L is equally as appealing. Really, a lot of the characters are good, but only those two really stand out. There are also quite a few annoying characters, like Misa and Matsuda.I already expressed my dislike of the near and Mello arc, and they are no small reason as to why. Also, for a group of people trying to track down someone so important, they seem pretty lax most of the time. I felt they were a little too unprofessional is all. Overall, an above average cast of characters. \
Sound - 14/15 - The Music was really good, although it felt a bit out of place a times. We can all agree that the chorus was not needed when Light was eating that potato chip. The opening and ending songs were especially good.\
Most people would agree that the English Dub of the show is pretty good, probably rivaling the Japanese. I'd recommend you watch it in English unless you really hate Light or L's voice or something. \
Animation - 13/15 - The animation was very solid. I also really like how the director chose to use Red to represent Light and Blue to represent L. It was a nice effect. \
Overall - 84/100 - I like Death Note a lot. It was one of the series that really changed my outlook on anime and helped mold the kind of shows I like today. But I can't ignore it's shortcomings, specifically in the story department. I'd consider this to be a potential classic if it weren't for that last arc. \

    In my opinion Death Note was truly a masterpiece, it was so well made and always a step ahead, the watcher could never predict what was about to happen. What i liked the most was the main character not being the stereotypical protagonist,you can't say  he was the bad guy either,if you agree with his ideologies then certainly he isn't \"evil\",  then again he showed some traits of a psychologically disturbed person, later on the final episodes, he was obsessed with  creating this \"Utopia\", and him being the new God.\
The dialogue is intelligent and brilliant. The characters are just amazing and the\
          \
        soundtrack makes you headbang, i really don't have anything bad to say about it, even when the unexpected happened(one of my favorite characters dying) I was so fascinated that immediately i found a new favorite character.\

    Many say Death Note is a smart anime, ofc it is a smart anime now lets talk about\
the story.\
Story: 8/10 The story was great and all those plot twist were a surprise specially the deaths :( :) of the others just to make the plan work ( Light Yagami's evil intentions ^(-.-)^) \
Art: The art was good, it wasn't like any other anime that had the same as this one, this art gave more emotions specially the reaction of the characters being surprised.\
Sound : 8/10 sound was good but some few scene didn't had any sounds at all (you'll notice :I)\
Character : 9/10 OOOOOOOOhhh \"L\"\
          \
        was the most fun character in the show, he's a funny character specially when \"L\" replied to misa something like \"Because it's dark\"\
He's behavior is really a type of person who takes risk and reduce any evidence he left the way he sits, holds a book or a paper, speaks quietly, the way he socialize and lots are precautions in order to avoid clues left out.\
Enjoyment : 9/10 Ofc it was enjoyable but again at the same time, TEAARS OMG \"cries around the corner\" \"L's\" Death, Light's Father, Misa, and Light too of course :I but L was my most emotional tears O.O.\
Overall: 8/10  GREEAAAT ANIME, YES it was fun and enjoying, just because it's 8/10 doesn't mean it's bad , it's my favorite if you can see it in my profile even if it's 8/9/10 they're going to be my favorite              (Sorry if I'm bad at english :P)",

    A high school/college student with the power to kill anybody who wants, is a genius, and has an extreme god-complex; all the ingredients to make the most generic and awful story of all time.  Thankfully, Death Note does not fall into this unremarkable category.  Instead Death Note is one of the best anime series around; a rather dark theme is present through the entire show which is complemented by a complex and suspenseful story line.  Character development is premeditated and well conceived to such a point that you even sympathize with Light up to the very end. The animations in the series\
          \
        are above average but not top notch.  The art style and animation even though not the best are appropriate for the theme and setting for this series.  One of the best points for Death Note is the music; the timing of the music is well placed to increase the intensity of different situations through the show.  As a whole Death Note is one of the most addictive and intense anime series one could choose to watch. \

    At One point in this Anime i felt like this was a contender for Best Anime but I was wrong.\
Everything in this anime is just stunning the voice acting by Aya and others are perfect and the plot is very unique, then to top it all is the animation styles and backgrounds they are just stunning and beyond words..\
The story revolves around a guy called Light who see's a notebook fall from the sky from class he goes to find it and when touches it meets a moster called Ryuk, he finally finds what this notebook can do which is kill people with writing there\
          \
        name down in that Death Book, then it follows as he tries to get rid of the bad people in the worlds and make it a new world.\
Another key thing is the characters i found them so easy to watch and even funny at points example ( L and his cakes etc...) \
The way he gets out of being detected is amazing and the things he does to not be arrested is insane.\
This Anime had everything but when it was going all too well in episode 12 (I think) something big happens and its all goes downhill from there althrough its ok from that point ever episode before that you couldnt take your eye of it.\
To sum it up this is a stunning example of how an anime can be near perfection but then having a flaw in the story has ruined it its still amazing through and worth watching.",

The story was very well put together, its a smart and very developed anime.\
Its really the viewers choice onto who is the \"bad\" guy and who is the \"good\" guy. \

The art was also very good, im very picky with the art. If something has a good story line, characters, etc, but bad art, i cant force myself to watch it, it will bug me till i eventually quit watching. \

Overall this anime deserves a 10! Props to the creator for making such a wonderful anime!\

The psychical fight between L and Kira has suspense, surprise, accion and is very entertaining. The drawings are very good, the music accompanies every part of the story, but most of all, this anime is incredible because history catches whoever, without concerning the age of that person.\
The possibility of killing persons, only writing their names in the note, raises the discussion of if is good to kill bad persons or not. \

    Death Note is an anime (and manga) that surpasses all boundaries. Its characters are believable and interesting, and like no other seen before--The protagonist, Light, is the killer, and the antagonist(s) are the ones fighting for the law. It appeals to both sides, however, and makes it hard for the viewer to choose.\
All of the characters have qualities and mannerisms we can traces to thousands, maybe millions of people (such as a love for chocolate or the need to do something a little different for your comfort), but do it in such a way that it seems unique and intriguing. The looks into the minds\
          \
        of these amazing characters is always thought-provoking for yourself, too--not to mention when it looks into the mind of otherworldly Shinigami (no matter how brief all of these insights may be).\
The plot is riveting and suspenseful, and whether or not you like supernatural aspects you're sure to forget such a thing is so unnatural as a notebook of death. I, for one, watched the entire series within a 24 hour period--it's definitely the video equivalent of a page-turner. It has many interesting allusions to such things as the Bible, while not being a religious story--regardless of the main character wanting to be a God--it manages to fit in the references perfectly.\
Overall, this anime is for anyone--regardless of whether you like the anime style, or the supernatural genre, it's an instant classic and such an amazing story, you shouldn't pass it up. Everything about it is positively astounding.\

    Death Note- My favourite anime of all time. This show was outstanding. Absolutley amazing. To start off, the story. The story is like none i've ever seen, and the combination of mystery, action, and the supernatural is brilliant. The constant twists and new developments in the story will keep you up to the early hours in the morning, convincing yourself that you have to watch \"just one more episode\" I should know, i've seen the show 3 times and i still do that. Also, the character is death note are amazing. They are so in depth and well-developed, and so easily admirable, you can't help\
          \
        but get attached. The intelligence and life-likeness of the characters is  amazing. Finally, the music. To me, music plays a big part in an anime. Music can easily set the mood perfectly, or get it all wrong. But Death Note hits the mark. The music is beautiful, and perfect for the atmosphere of the show. \
Overall, Death Note is a masterpiece of an anime, and definatley worth watching/reading. \

    To begin, this anime follows our 17 year old high school student Light, as he finds a notebook known as the death note one day during school. The story then introduces a pleasure seeking death god, who purposely dropped the notebook to see what will come of it. Light discovers that if he writes someones name in the notebook they will soon die. Thus the madness begins. This anime is brilliant, it will drag you into situations were you are forced to use your brain and will most likely fail trying. I will try not to give any spoilers in this review, because I consider\
          \
        this a must see anime. Light is constantly drug into impossible situations on the verge of being discovered as a murderer, by the worlds best detective L. This anime will mind fuck you until your brain cums and goes into a state of comatose. I truly felt the intensity of the story line, and at some point actually cursed Light out because, to put it simply he could have won. If your brain can take the heat, this is one of the most psychological animes I have ever seen. You must see how Light becomes the worlds most wanted criminal, and still manages to fool the world, even while literally sleeping next to the enemy.\

    Death Note is easily the most well-thought-out anime I have ever seen.  Unlike some anime that you have to watch a few episodes to get into, Death Note hooks you instantly by combining the supernatural with a real-life moral dilemma.  The atmosphere is the perfect combination of dark, witty and thought-provoking.  The characters, despite their utter genius, are just flawed enough to make it extremely interesting.  Light Yagami, for example, is perfect.  Good-looking, popular and extremely smart.  Throw in the fact that he's kind of evil, and you've got yourself an awesome story.\
One of my few complaint is that\
          \
        it got a little too slow toward the middle.  It was too drawn out... I feel that a lot of characters that were added later were unnecessary, and also that a lot of things could have been omitted.  I feel that the story would have been more profound if it had been more concise.  Another thing that bothered me was the ending.  It was too tidy, and did not leave a lot of unanswered questions, not to mention it was very abrupt.  \
 That being said, this is still my favorite anime of all time.  It is a must-see.\

    Story(10/10)\
The plot line of this series is one of the most clever ever conceived. The entire of idea of a death note that can kill people with just knowledge of there name and face is completely unique with nothing else like it out there. This then evolves into a story of a genius battle of wits between 2 characters on a level of their own cleverness that makes the Criminal Minds writers look like they sit around and drool all day long. There is even an explanation of other world shinigami who's world is touched over although is not too impressive, although this is obviously\
          \
        for the purpose of wanting everything to be set on the characters in the regular world and their interactions. The evolving mystery is likely the greatest of the mystery genre of anime of all time.\
Art(8/10)\
The designs for this show are done well with the character L being the by far most memorable as one of the greatest designed characters. Reminiscent of what is described as the look for the lead protagonist of the Artemis Fowl youth novels. This is topped with an awkwardness to the maximum and a unique sitting position imitating its gensukusha Taugumi Ohba. There is the frequent use of colours to represent people thinking just as studio Madhouse likes to use frequently. \
Sound(9/10)\
This series is absolutely amazing with its music. The backround music used in the series is absolutely incredible as it perfectly sets the moment and can make any moment intense as proven with the now infamous \"potato chip\" scene. I believe it sounds sort of like a medieval use of an electric guitar. There is also the 1st opening and closing songs which are very good as they present the darkness and themes involved in the story. The 1st ending song is completely different from the melodic first in a heavy metal barrage of Death Note although it manages to present the essence of the 2nd season just as well as the 1st. The 2nd ending theme also does the same. \
Character(9/9) \
The characters are lead by the main two Light Yagami and L who both posses incredible intellect and cleverness. L being one of the most incredible characters who possesses both the most awkward and genius characteristics of the series next to the very charismatic and equally as genius Light Yagami. The side characters are not special although none are boring. The weak point is the introduction of the character Near in the 2nd half who seems simply as a complete rip off of L. \

    Death Note is one of the most powerful anime I have ever seen. The story and thought behind it are amazing at every turn. You have to keep up and pay attention, but if you do, this anime will give you immense satisfaction.\
Right up until episode 25. I have watched the entire thing, and with that in mind I can reccommend everyone to stop watching after that episode. That's where shit really goes down the drain. My score is based on the first 25 episodes. If I had to judge them all, the overall score would go down to 7 or 8 because of this\
          \

    Story (Tsugumi Ohba): If you have a taste for mystery, then Death Note is the Anime/Manga for you. Despite all the absence of gun-slinging, kicking and punching and all the stuff like that, Death Note is still somewhat....acceptable as an action-genre. For some reason. Death Note, for me is and will always be one of the most unique and mind-blowing Anime/Manga in recent history. Let's face it; when you see \"Shonen Jump\" on the front of the page you will probably think it's a bad manga. But then, Death Note carries story elements and an intellectual integrity that is more commonly seen in your literary\

        classics than your usual Shonen Jump title.\
Art (Takeshi Obata): Particularly notable is Ryuk, who could have been turned into a fan-pandering bishonen-style character but instead is a scary, hulking beast, the kind of thing most people would probably think of when they're asked to imagine what a grim spectre of death would look like. But I would say they looked like having more fun drawing L, the childish detective and deuteragonist of the series.\
Sound: Amazing music.Particularly notable is the opening theme, which is dark and heavy. Good pick for a genre- rock\
Ok. to act like a real reviewer. I'll display a grade:\
Story: A+\
Art: A\
Overall: positive, thumbs-up, A+, 5 stars.... hehe :P\

    Death Note. What an anime. It was and is so well developed, it must have taken Tsugumi Ohba a while to make sure that everything in this Anime was Excellent or to his liking and it turned out to be one of the most awesome present day animes in my opinion. \
The charcters were beautifully written and developed, each character had there own unique personality and style about them.\
The Story line was written with dept, and in my opinion you would have to watch every episode to get the full understanding of the Story and thats what made it So enjoyable. It made me eager.\
          \
        After each episode i think I was wanting more it made me intrested and put my in a state of mind where all i could think about was, What going to happen next?\
Please take a look at this anime if you into, Mystery and a bit of supernatural. \
One other thing i think that this Anime reminded me of was, a type of Crime show :)) Mystery? Supernatural? Law? Some of my favouraite things put together in one= A good anime :) (for me)\

    Death Note is well written and awesome anime for any audience. It starts off very fast, but it's amaizingly handled and stabile. There are a lot of moments that just blow you away and it gets better and better through time. Art is very good with dark tones wich go very well with story telling motives and characters. There are few 3D scenes that are amazingly well done. Soundtrack is just perfect for this kind of anime, dark and powerful. It really gives you the sence of adrenaline and enjoyment through story. The main characters are better done than support characters, but each of them\
          \
        has their own story behind them, some of them are more detailed than other, but quite well. I can say for myself that I enjoyed the story, amaizing soundtrack and great main characters that you can bind with. I recommend this anime very strongly.\

    This anime was so good it made me want to just go outside start walking around to see if there are notebooks on the ground that I can pick up and write my professor's name into it.\
This anime is so well thought out that it's unbelievable. The supernatural beginning will immediately draw your attention. Like a mentally challenged kid running to candy, you will be glued to the anime.\
Even if the logic in the anime isn't real it still managed to make the readers feel as if it's genuinely intelligent, which is where the anime has succeeded in doing. Such as one of the scenes\
          \
        in the anime where L consulted/tested Light about the people that Light used to test out the abilities of the Notebook, it went pretty much like this...\
L: Which one do you think is the answer? A, B, or C.\
Light: hm... B\
L: Wrong! it's D.\
But never the less, a must read.\

    Does criminal who comited crime should die? Is this justice?\
That's the main question in this anime and I think that's what make it most interesting because whe have 2 protagonists Kira and L both of them do what they think is justice and what should be done. As you watch the anime you try to find an anwaser to this question, every one have different opinion and there is atleast 3 topics about it on most of anime forums.\
DN is first no shonen type anime that I watched and it make me love it. Since I though what anime was the best ever, DN always\
          \
        was on top no matter what.\
After I watched for the first time, I went outside for a walk though about the question asked before and when I went back I watched DN again, and after that once more, and after that once more 25 first episodes. In the end I watch it atleast once a year :).\
In the story we have a fight of minds between, Best detective in the world and young genius who found note of death god. Thanks to that he was able to eliminate every person in the world as long as he knew thier name and how thier face looks like. \
Yagami Raito who found Death note decided to eliminate all criminals which commited crime which was too extrime. Does he have right to kill them? All nations in thier belief decided that should be stoped and it's wrong doing, some of them belived it's how it should be and some did it because they couldn't just say it's a good thing that criminals die. That how society work, although first codex of laws in history was simpler An Eye for an Eye, that was something like codex of Hammurabi, That how it has been. Why does it changed, because someone though that killing someone was a wrong thing to doeven if he did kill 3 small childrens in a bunny siut with fork. That was extreme example but whatever. If you knew that a criminal killed someone close to you and then was released because there was no proof how would you fell, or he got small panalty, wouldn't you prefer that Hammurabi was still alive. On the other hand however can you let some unknow person do judgment on all people, What if he is wrong, what if he is someone who kills because he fell like it and suddenly decide that he kill every leader of country noone will know what to do and some retard will start another world war. It's isn't that simple.\
Anyway this anime has it serious tone in it, for me it's best anime ever.\
It has 2 great protagonist, Interesting plot, graphic is great and fit the story, and music great as well.\
Although I think that not everyone have to like this anime, the things that I love in this anime others may not, or there are so many other types of anime which have thier good points and are completly different, yet for me DN will always remain nr1 and it was catalyst that made me fan of anime, although I would want to find anime that will be better than this one, \
I hope that one day DN will be removed from number one because the anime that will beat it will be so great that I have no idea what should be there\

    Created in 2004 by writer Tsugumi Ohba and illustrator Takeshi Obata, Death Note originated as a manga that received critical acclaim a month after its release. The anime, released in 2006, was given great praise immediately after it‘s TV distribution. Having heard of its fan base and popularity, I decided to purchase a few volumes of the manga and rent a few episodes of the anime, careful to not have big expectations.\
What I got was simply a riveting masterpiece that I have no shame in calling this the greatest manga/anime series in the world. Regardless of whether you love or hate comics or animated\
          \
        TV shows, Death Note is a series that should be enjoyed by those who love thought-provoking concepts, endless twists, turns and main characters that are so complex that pages of literature can be based upon them.\
The story centers on a teenager named Light Yagami, an intelligent student who finds a notebook simply titled \"Death Note.\" After discovering that he can kill people by writing their name in the notebook, he decides to use the book to rid the world of criminals, believing them to be the cause of all grief. After killing countless criminals, half of the world embraces Light as a god, while the other half labels him a mass murderer, even giving him the nickname \"Kira,\" Japanese for killer. Soon, the amount of criminal deaths catches the attention of the International Police Organization, which immediately attains the help of a brilliant private detective, commonly known as \"L,\" to capture \"Kira\". A psychological cat-and-mouse game quickly arises between the two.\
What makes Death Note so riveting is just how much detail was given to the story. Every character, event, subplot, etc… seems to be brought to life with the use of superb writing and a beautiful art style. Throughout the series, Light seems to be headed down a self-destructive path, which may lead to his possible downfall as he acknowledges that he is in fact some god meant to pass judgment upon the world. Another factor is the way the story is told: each episode gives a lot of information, but offers just as many questions and mysteries, guaranteeing an addicting experience.\
If Death Note gives you the unlikely impression that it’s a kid’s show, think again. Not only is this the most serious anime/manga I have seen, but it also contains vast amounts of adult content. Death Note is the story of an anti-hero, a disturbed individual who tries to play god but ends up losing his humanity and everything that is dear to him in the process. The tragic story is probably not going to attract people below the age of 14 because of its complexity and R rating.\
Death Note is not only one of the greatest Japanese products I have ever seen, it also deals with a controversial subject worldwide: capital punishment. It cleverly discusses this issue without alienating the viewer and leaves room for lots of post-episode discussion. Death Note is an enjoyable TV show and comic book, which will entertain those who are interested in a series that offers many captivating concepts, regardless of what your opinion of cartoon shows and comic books might be.\

    Be warned, this review may contain /spoilers/.\
Death Note is one of those anime that every \"true\" anime fan will inevitably, at some point, encounter and watch (or read, as is in the case of the manga). While I have not yet had the pleasure of actually reading the manga, I have watched the anime, therefore I shall review it for your viewing pleasure.\
Most people who shy away from Death Note use one of the following excuses:\
Oh my god, it’s so popular, so it must be crap.\
Interestingly enough, it’s become a silent rule that most anime or manga that are \"popular\" (and here I speak in\
          \
        terms of Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fushigi Yuugi, and Sailor Moon) are garbage, stupid, and simply a waste of time to watch or read. If it’s mainstream, then it can’t possibly have any redeemable qualities. While I do agree, there are many non-mainstream series that are very good and, in all honesty, much better than most \"typical\" anime or manga, there are also the few mainstream series that are gems in and of themselves. One of those being Death Note. Sure, it’s popular, and likely has a near-cult following, but that doesn’t mean that it’s a bad series because of it. It has a cult following because of how good it is. It’s not your typical shoujo or shounen series.\
OMG, Light is so hot, especially if he’s paired with L, Misa should go to hell, etc. etc.\
Yeah…yeah. If you’re one of those animanga fans that likes to fangirl/boy over how hot character X is and how character X should be paired up with character Y because they’re such a good couple, and character Z should go die in a hole because they’re messing up the oh so wonderful chemistry of the entire relationship…then this isn’t the anime for you. Quite frankly, watching Death Note requires you to have some patience and understanding; which means all the dialogue and all the characters are, in some way, important, whether it be important to the plot or as merely another plot device. And, like I mentioned in another review, it’s rather pathetic to watch or read something and debate the sexual orientations of the characters, or to say that because character X made this sort of facial expression, s/he must be in love with character Y. If you think like that…it’s rather depressing. Plus you’ll be entirely lost as to what the actual plot is if you let your mind wander like that. And, as I mentioned, it’s rather pathetic.\
Also – Misa should not go to hell. Really, girls/boys, I understand that you’re jealous because she gets to spend so much time with Light, but that doesn’t mean she’s stupid, or useless. Is it because she’s blonde and happens to be pretty, or rather happy-go-lucky in nature? If you have a semblance of a brain, as is required to watch this anime, you’ll realize that Misa is actually very important to the plot, and is also intelligent. Maybe not as intelligent as Light or L, but then again you’ll have to take into account that they are geniuses, while Misa has average or above-average intelligence. After all, she was famous on her own, and worked very hard to be as such.\
I don’t understand why Light is so nice in the beginning, but then he suddenly turns into this evil bastard.\
It’s called \"corruption\". \"Degeneration of character\". \"God complex\". All of these can be applied to Light. I would say he is the embodiment of what happens when we let power go to our head. I think I recall him being a Pisces – both men and women born under this sign are very easily influenced. Obata-sensei and Ooba-sensei did their homework.\
What is the crazy guy with the book’s name anyway?\
Oh, Light. Yagami Light. Or Yagami Raito. It depends on what you prefer. Light is the \"Romanized\" name. Raito is the Japanese pronunciation, and how it is written in katakana.月 kanji, with the katakana ライト beside it to specify the pronunciation. There, you learned some Japanese. Light himself states in episode six that his first name is written with the character for moon, but pronounced like \"raito/light\".\
Death Note begins by introducing Yagami Raito, a young student who is bored with his everyday life and believes that the world is rotting. Later on, we are also introduced to the Shinigami Ryuuk, who is bored with his life in the Shinigami World, and also believes the world is rotting. Because he wants something interesting to happen, he drops his Death Note into the human world, inevitably sparking the chain of events that would lead to Raito’s corruption and triumph. When Raito discovers that he can kill a person merely by writing their name in the Death Note, while keeping their face in mind, he decides to use the notebook for good. He takes on the alias \"Kira\" and sets off killing criminals as he sees fit, writing their names down. Soon, he begins to experiment – manipulating the times and cause of death of his victims. Raito wants to become the new god, he wants to become the \"god of the new world\" – he sees his goal, can almost taste victory on his tongue. He has planned everything, only to have it ruined by L, a mysterious genius who is the number one detective in the entire world. Death Note is essentially a \"game of cat and mouse\" between Raito, the protagonist (antihero) and L, the antagonist – who most everyone inevitably ends up rooting for in the end. The anime uses psychology and the sheer intelligence of these two main characters, Raito and L, to drive the story forward, as well as the suspense and thrill, tension, and anxiety that the whole anime manages to push down on its viewers. The first half of the anime, the half that includes L, is flawless – simply because we have such a fascinating and interesting antagonist. The second half, the one that has Mello and Near as the main antagonists, is not quite as flawless.\
Near, although a character in his own right, could easily be called a clone of L. He even looks a bit the same. Simply put, he is not quite as compelling or even as likable as L. Mello is a much more interesting character, in my opinion – simply because of his mannerisms and appearance. Both characters, however, play their role and inevitably catching and destroying Raito. Because, during the entire anime, we have witnessed the growth and corruption of Raito’s character – he was first the \"good schoolboy\" with very good grades. Then he became the \"good schoolboy\" with the ambition of cleansing the world. And then he became corrupted in his power, his elation – drowned in it, if only for the appearance of L. Because of L, he became caught up in his game, in his quest, and his true purpose was lost. Instead of cleansing the world, his one goal became that of vanquishing L.\

    Death Note is probably my favorite anime for a trillion reasons. This supernatural thriller is one of the best series out there. The plot is nail biting and each episode will have you on the edge of your seat. This is true for one main reason: the characters. The characters in Death Note are so well developed that they might as well be given an Oscar! And when put together you get a collision that is like a bunch of fireworks on New Years or the Fourth of July. You get an amazing show.\

    This anime is just Amazing, and a masterpiece, the only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is simple, this anime should have ended at episode 26 and it would have been the most perfect anime ever.\
After certain 'major event' the plot just can't keep up with the awesomeness wich it started and I feel like Yagami Raito (Light) is not as genius as it was in the beggining, guess he is clouded or something. But well, it dissapointed me in the end.\
STILL, this is a masterpiece, really enjoyable wich keeps you in suspense the whole time, you can't wait for the next episode\

    First of all probably everyone in existence would say that everything after the \"good part\" was useless, but the ending was dominant bizness.  Not sure what I can say about it, but it was perfect ending for Death Note with the time that occured during the story.  Lots of unfortunate things happened during the anime, which built up for the dominant ending.  The thought dialogue was excellently written and directed and probable is what made Death Note so popular.  Although kind of slow as in action/entertainment.  It helped with bringing in more audiences.  The Animation/Art was usual for a\

    Death note is probably one of the most strategic, suspense filling anime out there.  pretty much every episode is very well thought out and keeps me at the edge of my seat which i appreciate  because not many anime can keep this up through out the series.\
The story is very unique, and the concept of it all is truly a masterpiece.  a death note owned by the shinigami's is capable of killing a person simply by writing there name . sounds scary right? this note book falls into the hands of yagami light. But what will he do with this power is\
          \
        the question ? \
yagami light and L are perhaps the most intellectual characters i have seen in an anime. the story, plot and characterization are all very well executed which makes this anime such a masterpiece.\
The art is very nice but isn't appreciated to its fullest because of the amount of  dialogue needed to watch this but isn't really  a bad thing.\
every minute of every episode fills you with suspense if you blink , turn around even for a second you might miss some vital information which very few anime are capable of.\
Death note is a very impressive anime in a whole lot of ways, not to mention the very well thought out plans with very little loopholes.\
This is a very highly recommended anime from me for those who are into detective or strategic anime or even if your not i  would still recommend it as it is probably the most ingenious anime ever ! ",

    Though I'm relatively new to anime, certainly this genre, I decided to give it a try and hell was that a great decision. This story gives you a character that you should hate, however, sympathies with because he is \"trying to do the right thing\". He has a very dodgy mentality like that of most criminals and it is scary to see how he is so capable of creating chaos by manipulation. Those who go against him you will hate at first, but then realize they are the good guys in the story.\
I marathoned this in about 3 days. I recommend this to everyone who\

    Death Note is such an amazing anime. The best part about it is that the suspense just keeps rising untill the very end. It was so well thought out and planned that it amazed me and makes me wonder how someone could have come up with such an intelligent story. If you like suspense, mystery, or supernatural anime types then your sure to love Death Note.\
-Story-\
The story is very unique and doesn't drag what so ever. It's about the battle of wits  between Light Yagami and his rivals (Who ever tries to discover the man behind the murders). Though it sounds quite simple it's\
          \
        so much more than that. The reason i give this story a ten is because it's so unpredictable, and just when you think  it can't get any better, it does.\
-Art-\
The art for Death Note was quite good, the drawings and character design were so realistic and detailed. The colour was great and always went with the mood of the theme.\
-Sound-\
The sound was good, and the music was perfect, the music of Death Note made it so much more worth watching. each characters theme suits them well. The music is always right for the situaion and timing. As as for the english dubbing, which for most, but not all, was excellent. I might even say it was better than the japanese :P. Overall the voice acting was really good for both languages.\
-Character-\
The most imporant role in Death Note was most likely the characters. Everyone had their own unique and original character, and without it death note couldn't be possible. Most all of the characters were unbeilveably intelligent. They weren't annoying, (except maybe Misa) and it's pretty hard not to love each of them.You'll find that you will get attached easily. Their personalities are so imporant to the show, and let me tell you, Light Yagami is a pretty good liar! and i think that's his signature fact. But their all simply amazing. Each of them, and at times, they'll even surprise you.\
-Enjoyment-\
Death Note is the most enjoyable anime i've ever watched. You'll enjoy it the whole way through. It'll pull at your heart strings at times, and make you think about which side your on, and it gets you pretty emotional.\
-Overall-\
Overall, with the story, art, sound, character and enjoyment Death note is amazing in all aspects. I would call it flawles. Personally, i thought the ending couldn't have been better.If i could sum it all up into one word, that word would be Brilliant. \

    It's hard to write a review on a famous anime like Death Note without being incredibly redundant. How should I describe it...\
Imagine Muhammad Ali vs Myke Tyson for 37 episodes, now imagine that they're geniuses, and that they're fighting it out with their overwhelming intellects.\
Make it \"Pele vs Maradonna\" if you're into soccer.\
Or \"Wayne Gretzky vs Michael Jordan\" if you're high.\

    Death Note,\
Story(10)\
I gave the story a 10, because it really drags you into it. I couldn't stop thinking about things and could'n't stop watching, it was just too good. \
The story is a story where the writer really thought about. All the episodes connect and form one great story.\
Art(9)\
It is just done very very fine and you see someone getting really evil, but can see that person like a very good one. All the faces are just done perfectly and they give the anime a special thing, which makes it sometimes really cool to watch.\
Sound(10)\
The sounds are just way too good. The character may be\
          \
        some sort of evil, and the music refers to that, but it has something like heaven in it as well what fits in perfectly. I can't explain but maybe you can figure it out yourself or if you eatch the anime you will.\
Character(10)\
As I already said, there are a lot of things which make the characters very good, but the battle between them is the most important thing. That's when you really see what they can do and who they really are, and later on you see how everyone can even change a little bit. And the anime isn't even that long.\
Enjoyment(10)\
Just as I said earlier, I enjoyed it very much. Everything is just very good. It's all a bit secretly and you never know what will really happen. There always popped some questions in my head like: Will he really do that? How is he going to solve this? and more like that.\
Overall(10)\
Well, I think I don't have to say more why I like this anime.\
The question is, will you? I think everyone can find something in this anime, and if you think it's like horror, it's not.",

    First of all, I would like to preface this review with a summary before I write anything. Death Note is an amazing anime, and you're an absolute fool if you've never watched it before; it's one of the top animes of the decade, and of the medium itself. \
That said, I suppose it's time to delve into the actual scores given and why they were given.\
To start, let's talk about the story. I, for one, weight the story as 40% of how I feel about an anime. Generally, if the art is glitchy or the sounds inappropriate, I can overlook it if the story is\
          \
        compelling enough to cause me to ignore the inconsistencies and faults of the aesthetics. That said, on my scale, Death Note receives the full 40% of the grade for it's peerless ability to tell a story. It may seem corny or an easy cop-out, but I simply can't describe the sheer effort that goes into the pacing and structure of the story, which is told in such a way that linked actions remain fluid, yet the overall arcs are rigid enough to be distinguished from each other.. Put simply, if you were to watch all 37 episodes consecutively, the flow would be balanced enough that any transition in setting or feel would not stick out enough while in the process of watching; however, upon thinking, much has changed without being necessarily distinguishable, which is a good thing. Honestly, I feel that discussing details other than the synopsis would merely spoil the experience for a viewer, so just accept that Light finding the Death Note creates a strange synthesis of suspense, horror, mystery, and intelligence which weaves an elegant tapestry of a plot. To keep score of the composite, 40% * (10/10 = 1(staggered score)) = 40%\
Now to the art, I only weight this as 10%, as I feel that a story can be told in any way, and allowing for visual recognition only boosts comprehension; however, art is merely a medium for a point, the story. The art for Death Note is absolutely beautiful. It may not be the brilliant colors of a GaoGaiGar or a Gurren Lagaan, but it serves its' purpose, as a medium for the story. The color palate is noticeably dark and gritty, yet the lines are generally smooth and concise, illustrating the precise nature of the story's twists and turns while also underscoring the dark consequences of the actions taken. As a medium, it really sets a tone and drives home that the story is about one mature person's beliefs and how one man can really make an impact on the world, in this case in a negative light (sorry for the pun). To continue the composite score 40% + (10% *[10/10]) = 50%.\
The sound of an anime is similar to the art, in that it portrays the story in some light and is therefore a medium for an idea. If I had choose the weakest aspect of Death Note, it would be the sound. Now, don't get me wrong, all the VAs and Seiyuus are in rare form, with the most noticeable voice actor being Brad Swaile as Light in the English dub, whose performance is arguably the greatest in dubbing history. Rather, the problem with the sound lies in the earlier parts of the series, the first opening being the example. Although the anime itself is not necessarily all blood and gore, murder as a motif is still a brutal subject forming a brutal theme; however, a J-pop rock song that sounds necessarily whiny does not set the tone for such a brutal theme; and, in reality, it is sound track choices like \"The World\" by NIGHTMARE that are confusing. The second opening rectified this and was appropriately brutal and jagged, with a feeling of dread setting in from the first line of the song; however, musically, \"The World\" is just too soft of a song for the series, as are a handful of the earlier episode's orchestral cues. The sound does not necessarily take away from the experience though, and the effects are greatly reduced over time to the point where the sound becomes as excellent of a medium as the art by midway through the series. Continuing with the composite score 50% + (10%*[8/10]) = 58%\
Characters in anime work as the actors to directly portray the actions assigned by the writers. While also technically a medium for the story to work through, the characters take a larger role as a medium; as, in addition to telling the story, they must also appeal to an audience, giving them two distinct roles, as a medium of such importance, I weight them as 20% of the score. Death Note is a prime example of what a cast should be in an anime. Upon retrospection, I couldn't think of a character without a defining characteristic or action at some point in the story that had relevance. There are no wasted characters here, and every character is developed fully until the writer has simply written them to their full potential. Light's transition from antihero, as a person who would use any means to achieve a noble goal, to megalomaniac illustrates the fluidity and balance of the character development the show holds. Light's character, beginning to end, changes almost completely, yet during the 37-episode run, the changes are never instantaneous or obtrusive and remain gradual enough that the characters appear to be just as normal in their behavior as they were in the start of the show, even if their changes are drastic in nature. Additionally, connections are established to the characters easily, as each characters motivations are understandable and rationalized from some perspective, resulting in very few, if any, unlikable or underplanned characters. Even Light, a man attempting to play God, is shown to be tangible and coherent, even if most would peg him with a Messiah complex and file him an overpowered or unrelatable character. To further the composite. 58% + (20% *[10/10]) = 78%.\
Enjoyment is something I define as my ability to accept a series for what it is, and even if the parts aren't perfect, the whole is generally greater than the parts, leading to it holding 30% of the value on my scale. Let's be honest, the only part that hasn't been an absolutely glowing review is the sound, which was excellent by the end of the series. I couldn't put this series down; I watched the first 13 episodes in one night; it's that good. There's really nothing I can say other than opinion at this point, since this is how I personally felt about the series, but I can't really think of any point in time when I wish I could have changed something about the story. To finalize the composite score: 78% + (20% * [10/10]) = 98%\
Placing the composite on a staggered scale would give this a 9.8 out of 10, which rounds to a perfect score of 10/10. In my eyes, no anime can be perfect, but I have to say that I have never seen an anime define a genre and influence a generation of series the way Death Note has already. The series has shown that it has replayability and is enjoyable at all points throughout, with no filler being distinguishable in the story; I give this high marks for being an overall enjoyable ride from start to finish.\

    I've read all of the manga and light novels and watched all the episodes and movies and I never grow tired of it. It's definitely an original and I'm very proud to say I was living as the legend was in the process of making and that it has made a huge impact in our generation.\
Death Note challenges the topic of \"divine judgement\" in a rather amusing way. I think the way of using the Death Note is an original. I mean, who would've thought you could kill someone just by knowing their face and name? It also made me think twice about what I\
          \
        think of as justice. As I was watching/reading it, it really had me think and I think that's one of the many charms of it. I actually think it made me think a little bit better, having paid such close attention to it. \
Of course, because Death Note is so popular around the world by many different people their opinions will be different from mine, but I think many of us can agree that Death Note is one of the best anime EVER.\

Not much action involved, so that's one downside.  The art is really pretty however, and each character is awesome.  Not the best anime, (that's black cat - MAKE SURE YOU SEE THAT IT SHOULD BE WAY MORE POPULAR) but it's second on the list.

    Well death note, to be honestIi put this off as I like anime's with a fair bit of comedy and moe so I didn't bother touching this anime. But I saw a youtube video recently which made me watch this anime and O.M.G was i missing out. This anime is so well planned and some of the way the killings are planned in this anime is unthinkable. My favourite character is L as he does have a bit of comedy element to him but to be fair every character is amazing in their own way. But that's not what makes the anime great the amazing\
          \
        story line and plot is just perfect. It makes you feel for the characters just like i did with L (you will get what i mean when you watch the anime). So to some this anime up it is amazing but half way through it slows down a bit but as soon as the plot thickens your in for a ride. Great anime brilliant characters amazing plot. 9 \

    Death Note was the third anime I started watching after Naruto and Claymore and I enjoyed it the most by far (or am enjoying it, seen 35/37 episodes) \
With Death Note I had to hold myself back from watching it all in one day, and decided to watch two episodes every Tuesday, sometimes 3 >.< I recommend to watch this anime over a period of time as watching it all in such a short gap with just ruin it, (you can do that with Bleach and Naruto); the anime is really THAT good, take your time get a drink make some popcorn, connect your pc\
          \
        to your TV with an HDMI cable and your all set for an evening of entertainment, the time will go fast you wont even notice and by the next day you will be longing for more. Even though I say take your time with Death Note, it really is your choice, watch it in 3 days if you must, just make sure you enjoy it. \
Ok so Death Note is ultimately a battle of wits between two young geniuses (I hope that’s how you spell it )  neither knowing much about one another but both intercepting each other at every turn, everything is one the line in Death Note where one wrong move could cause death. \
The owner of the Death Note is said to always be sodden with unhappiness and depression, The new owner Yagami Light will prove that theory wrong in every way you can imagine. ",

    Death Note is a pretty good show about this guy called Light Yagami. Light is a smart man. Really smart. Like a genius. He is a genius, and that is the plot of Death Note. Genius verses genius in a battle of wits. \
.\
In his death note, Light can write down the name of anyone once he pictures their face and has their real name, and once he does that, they will die. But he has an enemy, L, who tries to stop him.\

When I had first encountered Death note I must admit that I was a relative newbie to anime and the only exposure to the medium was merely through action shonen. Death note however was incredibly different to your average shonen anime, not only was the viewing of the show an adrenaline rush but the series was intricately crafted and beautifully told as well as incredibly thought-provoking. This anime opened my eyes to a completely new perspective of anime. Death note was the first anime that I’d seen that had somewhat of a dark sub-text and the story’s intricate plot as well as the questions of\
          \
        morality that were abundant throughout the story really intrigued and kept me hooked on what was such a thrilling anime. If I had to class Death Note into a specific genre I would have say that this anime is a Fantasy/Thriller with elements of Mystery. \
Death Note is a unique anime which tells the tale of a young man named Light Yagami, a very intelligent higher school student with huge prospects and high aspirations. Very suddenly his life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers the Death Note, a magical book that has the ability to kill anyone whose name is written within it. With such a huge power bestowed upon him we see Yagami Light change as he start to question his own morality and starts extraditing his own sense of justice.\
 If you were granted the power of a god, if you had the power to kill, would you? Would you kill to save others? Would you kill for justice? Would you be able to maintain your own sanity and morals? Would you be able to prevent yourself from greed for recognition, or maybe even simple fun? Where will it stop, how will it end, how many innocent people will you have to sacrifice for a world of peace? These are all questions Yagami Light faces .When he realizes the full power of the Death Note, Light knows exactly what to do. He will kill all those with evil traits and will lead a new world into sanctuary. His excitement is frightening, never once does he regret his actions. He’s hollow, his only emotions come at the thought of eternal glory as Justice itself, and when he must mentally battle his equal, his only obstacle, L. Light, dubbed as Kira, is able to kill simply knowing the name and faces of his victims, by writing their names into his Death Note, but his plans for greatness continue to be thwarted by the mysterious and cunning L.\
The mental battles between L and Light can be astonishing, but they all boil down to one thing: \"Will he out-think my out-thinking?\" It’s a constant turn-by-turn board game. Both are 15 steps ahead of the real-world, the one who wins won’t be decided on wit, but rather by trust. The trust in others will be what makes or breaks these players. Trust the wrong person and you’ll die. Trust the right person and you’ll survive.\
The animation is average for the more recent popular anime, but the key scenes are delicately touched up. However they art style was great, I must give plaudit to the manga artist Takeshi Obata for the characters designs, they realistic, to give that feel of connection with the viewer. The music is great, minus the last opening and endings which sound like a middle-school band banging on garbage cans and ripping their vocal cords with retched screams of incomprehensible lyrics.\
Death Note is an amazing anime; the plot and story are perfected beyond greatness. But there’s one thing that keeps this anime from being renowned as a masterpiece, character development. There’s very little depth to the main characters. They are all clear-cut with no inner-emotional battles. Light himself never once thinks twice about actually killing thousands of people, he uses and abuses the few allies he has, which will end in his destruction. He has no conflicts with himself, yet he’s not a senseless killing machine; in essence, he’s nothing. The creators of this series failed to recognize these inhuman attributes as just that, inhuman. When viewers cannot fully understand the main character, they cannot connect with him.\
Thankfully, I can forgive the shortcomings of Death Note. What really made me love this series is its unmistakable perfection of suspense. Every episode will leave you begging for more, and yet there are no horrible cliffhangers! The ending of this series really pushed it to become one of my all time favorites. In the second to last episode I honestly felt like I was about to have a heart attack. My heart was pounding against my chest, my blood was rushing. I knew what would happen, the only way the series could end, but it didn’t matter! I was so enthralled with the emotion of the episode; it sends chills down my spine just thinking about it! No other anime has ever given me such a thrill, the emotions I experienced were surreal. This anime is without a doubt a must watch for ALL anime fans!\

         This is an excellent concept that had unlimited potential.  The power of judgment via death is given to the brightest young mind in Japan and his ridiculously in-depth strategies to remake the world in his image and avoid capture.  The antagonist is one of the most finely tuned and fascinatingly entertaining characters I have encountered  -  the great detective L.\
     I will do my best to not put spoilers in my reviews but let it be known that about 2/3 through this series it's intrigue and glory start to fade...culminating with a two-part ending\

        episode that....well it ruined the show in my opinion.  Completely wrecking a prime character was more of a 'Well....we....we should probably finish this thing shouldn't we?' feeling than the more appropriate 'How should these events play out in the circumstances?' method.\
     All in all  -  worth watching, the English dub (if that's your thing *shudders*) isn't too bad ... at least until they introduce a character near the end...where the translation and execution of the lines made me quite furious at the actors take on it.  I highly recommend the original Japanese audio (as I am wont to do) however.  Nightmare and Maximum the Hormone's music adds perfect touches to the opening and end credits  -  wrapping this up in a neat little macabre package.",

    Never, in my whole life have i watched a better show than Death Note. It's the only show i rated with the most 10's in it. \
Story - 10/10 (A+)\
At first you might think 'Oh woop-dee-doo. A notebook. How uninteresting.' Hush, or else your name will be written. lol. Jokes aside, the originality of it all is so amazing. The only thing that isn't original is the whole Shinigami deal, but that's not a big deal. Every episode feels like 10, it's just so long and full of suspense around every corner. You won't be disappointed for a millisecond.\
Animation - 10/10 (A+)\
Beautiful, just beautiful. Every\
          \
        scene is decorated with such vibrant displays of wonder. The animators make every little detail stand out so well, you can't help but notice it. When Light writes his first name in the Death Note, the way they made it look was full of horror and suspense. I was even somewhat frightened for a few seconds. That's hard to do.\
Sound - 10/10 (A+)\
This is one of those rare occasions where the english dub is just as good, perhaps better, than the original. If you still have negative views on dubs, than you really need to watch Death Note's dub. Brad Swalie nails it as Light, calm and collective to everyone else but maniacal and plotting on the inside. Even that one laugh from the last episode was nailed. Mamoru Miyano, can you beat that?\
Characters - 9.6/10 (A)\
Well, this is what stopped it from getting a perfect score: The whole Yotsuba Arc and it's characters. I didn't think they were meaningful to the plot, including Higuchi. Just felt like they wanted to stretch the episodes out a little bit. But as for everyone else, it blends perfectly. L as the mysterious detective who's known for always catching the criminal, Misa Amane: the idol-wannabe with a soft spot for LIght and AKA the Second Kira, Ryuk: the malevolent shinigami with no cares about anything. Rem, the somewhat mother figure to Misa. All these kinds of characters wouldn't normally fit together, but Death Note made it happen.\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
Watch this freaking show. Dub or Sub, heck go for the dub first. Once you start watching it, you will not stop even when the show finished. There's a special OVA and two Live-action films to accompany your need for Death Note. If your tired of shounen animes like Bleach, Naruto or tired of fanservice shows like Rosario + Vampire, than watch this. It'll blow you away.\
Overall Average: 9.92/10 (A+)\

    (Possible spoiler?) This is the best anime I've seen so far. The second after I read the rules of the Death Note in the synopsis I wanted to watch this anime; and I'm glad I did. \
The effort taken to right this story is far beyond my imagination, even as an author myself. It just kept me guessing the whole time of how he would solve things. \
The art was also great. I'm not much of an artist, but I know good art when I see it. \
I've listened to many dubs, and I've got to say, this one was done well. \
The characters were\
          \
        great too. L was sort of a creep, but he's just a guy who likes sweets and to be in closed areas. Light was an evil mastermind. However, it did disappoint me a little that he wasn't capable of love. That didn't matter much in this anime because he was supposed to be evil. I must admit, killing people is wrong, but at least he was only killing criminals. It was only when he started to kill those who were getting in his way that he turned evil. \
I enjoyed this anime very much and even though it wasn't listed as a comedy, I found most of it funny. The ending disappointed me a bit because there was a detective better than L, but Light shouldn't have been so ignorant to little details. (I was especially impressed by the invention on how to hide the Death Note in his desk.)\

    Death Note is by far one of the most interesting anime I have ever watched. The storyline is very unique and the main characters are far from boring. This anime plot is just so different from all the other anime plots I've come across. The story is very suspenseful, but luckily there is some comic relief in most episodes. The characters are all very different, and it's hard to hate any of them. This anime will definitely get you thinking and it will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat.\
There are very few things I do not like about this anime. The tension\
          \
        is very thick at the end of the series, and the comic relief has dissipated around this time. While I enjoy the suspense, I feel there has to be something in there to give you a smile or two. Also, some of many peoples favorite characters are killed off. Even though it adds to the storline and helps it progress, I honestly think some of those deaths could've been avoided.\
Other than that,  I think this anime was outstanding. I would recommend it to any anime lover.\

    I can say that Death Note is one of the best anime ever. Well, it's the best I've seen, so far. It stands on a different level from those poorly written anime. This one is very well-executed.\
Story - 9. The story is so well-written, about 98% perfect. A notebook falls from the sky and Yagami, Light, a very intelligent young man, coincidently finds it. This notebook is very different from the ones that people use, because it is owned by a shinigami (death god). Whoever's name that's written in the note shall die. The plot really is amazing. The twists will sometimes leave you wondering\
          \
        or shocked. I didn't give the story a 10 cause I found the 2% of it boring and lacking in action.\
Art - 10. The art in Death Note is very detailed. The environment is realistic and the characters are well-drawn. I found the character design, unique.\
Sound - 8. The opening and ending songs were, okay, I guess. The background music on the other hand, was genius. Music that was played while a maniacal Light was writing in the note was perfectly matched with the character's mood.\
Character - 10. I'm very impressed at the characters of Death Note. Maybe you'll praise their intelligence. Yagami, Light, the main protagonist, is a top student with a certain perspective. He thinks that the world is rotting because of evil. Thus, he uses the note to kill off all of the criminals, thinking that this will result in a pure world where he will become the new \"god\". Because of his non-stop killing, the public calls him \"Kira\". This is where L, the main antagonist, comes in. He is the best detective in the world and is out to capture Kira. He only eats sweets, stating that even though he eats sweets for breakfast, lunch and dinner, he does not get fat because he \"exercises\" his brain. He is highly intelligent and maybe even more intelligent than Light. You only need to know of these two characters cause when you watch, you'll be focusing on them.\
Enjoyment - 9. Although a bit of it was boring, I enjoyed Death Note.\
Overall - 9. I really admire Death Note. It is 1% away from being the greatest anime of all time.\
If you're looking for an anime that will keep you thinking, then Death Note is for you.\

    Death note's writer Tsugumi Ohba and manga artist Takeshi Obata are geniuses for the formulaton of mystery and the difficult layout of this series! The idea of a notebook combined with the character's brilliance made it a great watch!\
Death Note concentrates solely on plot and the pyschological thriller aspect. The plotline was  psychologically good. The protagonist turns into an antagonist. A girl is devoted to her feelings rather than killing, and she would die for the one that she loves. Besides that, I think the action is good too.\
This was one of a kind, hardy and rare story lines that the main characters bent\
          \
        on changing the world. Hard to find any other animes left involved in strategic and maniuplating situations. \
The suspense was very edge-of-your-seat and girl-squeal sort;\
The story line was a bit too extended and there were some uninteresting or details in between which made this anime series very long. However, the parts of the thriller made equated for the long explanation and conversation of the characters.\
L was neither uninteresting in character nor portrayed as a typical detective. The thought of using L as the same age group as Kira enchances the formidable match of logic and strategy and increases the tension and thrill for the protagonist and antagonist to interact in the series.\
None of the characters develop throughout the story though, except for Light.\

    I started out with the Death Note manga, and at first I will admit, I wasn't really sure if it was any good. I thought since it belonged to Shonen Jump, that it was going to be one of those regular main-stream animes like Naruto, Bleach and One Piece. I was very wrong. It starts out very good. The shinigami realm in the beginning may freak out some people, but you have to stick around. It starts you off with you know what is going to happen, yet you don't at the same time. Light Yagami (Main Character) is a very strange character. You never\
          \
        know what is going on with him. He is never the same. His emotions are tricky too. You never know what he is feeling. That's what makes the suspense feeling. Every episode leaves you wanting more. They don't leave you with boring filler. It stays so close to the plot of the manga it is like they just took every page of the manga and animated it! Every death, reveal, secret or changes to anyone or anything always catches you by surprise. All the characters get fantastic backstories. No one is left unexplained except for the one character you don't need to know every about. They don't end the series with one of those open endings. They ones that prepare you for another season when you know there won't be. They show what every character is doing at the end just so everyone knows and no one asks \"Hey what ever happened to so and so\". They complete every arc perfectly. Don't leave anything unexplained. The right characters come and go at the right time. Plus, the art style is beautifully done. The plot is one of the best I have seen in anything. American or Japanese. Or any country for that matter. No matter what genre or plot-line you are a fan of, you will absolutely love Death Note. Anyone who doesn't didn't listen to the story-line. It is not your usual \"Who will live and who will die\" kind of Murder Mystery/Supernatural/Psychological/Horror show. Both the anime and manga are fantastic. If you read it or watch it doesn't matter. Both are utterly amazing and mind-blowing. One of the best animes of all time. \

    This anime deserves to continue it's series forever with such entertainment it shows you. The show death note entertains with the secrets the characters hide and there thoughts, but there is nothing more said from me that this show is for many who like suspense and drama. Death note can entertain in many ways with it's parts that will always be a shock to you if you see it over and over, there maybe some scenes in this show that might make you more curious, but with the shows series ended i'm not surprized...it leaves you hanging 'it told a story but didnt finish it.\
          \
        People should understand that when you make something you should always finish it. But it was dramatically said to be a sucess to it's series, but they should know that there are some people wanting more to this coming of the show...theres nothing more to say from my point on. Also it was a good show!\

    If you were to ask me to list my top 10 favorite anime series of all time (excluding one-shot movies) then Death Note would definitely be on the list. \
The story is very unique, especially considering the times this series came out in with loads of generic action/comedy shounen series popping out every couple months. It's decidedly dark, serious and mysterious tone immediately draws the viewer into the story.\
Probably the best part of the story is the characters and the interactions between them. It's a very character driven narrative and with the way that each character develops as the story progresses, it really shines. The\
          \
        exchanges between the main protagonist Light and his rival L are tense and never disappoint. Probably one of the best, if not the best, rivalry I've ever seen in an anime/manga (and I've seen a lot). \
Everything else about the story is above-average.\
Now, I would give Death Note a 10 overall, but there was one big flaw that I have to mention. I won't give anything away, but about halfway through the series there's a rather big change to the character roster. If the series had ended there, it would have had a pretty dark ending, but it would have been a satisfying conclusion in my opinion. Instead we are given a few new characters and the whole thing starts over almost from square one. Plus these new characters really pale in comparison to those that are lost soon before. This essentially splits the series in two with an excellent first half and a less than average second half.\
I think it's a real shame that the author took the story in this direction, which seemed really forced to me. Plus it seemed to me that he only did this to make for a \"good guys win\" kind of ending, which also seemed really forced.\
I know I'm going on about this, but compared to the first half of the series, the second half was crap. Even the intro/outro music was crap. Overall, an excellent anime/manga with a disappointing ending.\

    Light Yagami is like any regular teenage student. He goes to school, and goes home afterwards. But he realizes the wrong in the world today. Murders, robbery, ect. But what he wasn't expecting was to find a book that could possibly change everything. Light notices directions on the inside of the book that states that by just thinking of someone and writing their name on one of the pages could kill them within seconds. Light decides he is going to try to change the world and starts targeting criminals by writing their names in the book. But what he thought was a good idea can\
          \
        either bring him to his death or make him an idol. But a detective is determined to stop Light no matter what the consequences may be. The detective goes by the name \"L.\"\
Animation:\
     I would say, the lighting in the anime does set a dark mood, which goes along greatly with the storyline. But I believe, and most will agree, most people who watch this anime are watching it because of the character \"L.\" Of course, he is cute, but thats not the only thing that made the anime so great.\
\
Characters:\
                                                           Main Characters\
     Light Yagami: A teenage student that wants to create a \"new world.\" I didnt exactly like his God complex, but others may disagree.\
     L: A detective that rarely shows his face to anyone in fear of putting his life in danger, but is willing to risk anything to catch the murderer \"Kira\" (aka. Light). In my opinion he was very comedic and was definatly mine and most others favorite character.\
\
Overall thoughts:\
     In short, Death Note is an amazing anime. But i will say this, don't just watch it because of L. I realize he is the top loved character, but with him aside, the story is interesting and Kept me hooked on it until the end. Highly recommend this anime........ :)\

    I first watched Death Note on a whim in 2008, and it completely won me over in 2 episodes. It's such a special anime, that is cerebral and cunning. The protagonist and antagonist are just so enjoyable and interesting, its impossible to not be drawn in and watch for hours at a time. They play off each other so well, it really does warrant mention. \
Of course, the excellent story is accentuated by the slick animation, and of course the sound. The Voice Acting is among the best of the medium, and really bring life to the characters, even the dub was amazing. All this\
          \
        is backed up by an excellent soundtrack that's catchy, and yet hightens the drama which a soundtrack should do.\
The length of the series might be too short for some, but I think it was perfect. It doesn't overstay its welcome, with a very nice 37 episode length. This also means that there aren't any filler episodes, and that the story moves at a brisk pace. It works very well in the series's favor.\
If you haven't watched this series yet, do yourself a favor, and just watch it.\
If you have watched the series already, do yourself a favor, and just watch it again.\

    What would you do if you had the power over life?\
Death Note explains this very concept and presents it in a very interesting way. The main character, Light Yagami, discovers a notebook (the death note) on the ground at his school and learns of its use. Being a young man who believes that evil men should be punished, Light attempts to use the power of the Death Note to mold the world into one that is crime-free. However, the police are working to catch him (dubbed 'The Kira Killer'), the main leader of it being Light's own father.\
DN is a very tense story about crime,\
          \
        trust and betrayal, the justice system, and whether the death penalty is right or wrong. I give this series a good 9/10, mainly become of the (in)famous twist that happens roughly halfway through the series. The story is still good, but it loses some of its appeal after this event. However, despite the series having some small faults here and there, DN comes highly recommended if you like psychological thrillers. The concept is very original and leads to a very entertaining show.\
Bottom line: check out Death Note if you want a shonen manga that has seinen-like themes to it.\

    Death Note is a fantasic anime in itself. I simply enjoyed it SO much because the story is just one big thriller from start to finish. You never know where Light is going to end up because to be a hero, there must be sacrifices. \
Although this anime is really dark and may sock you in the stomach a few times, i will recommend this to ANYONE even non-anime fans to give this series a try even if they hate suspense :).\
The only things i dont like about this anime is when they introduce the new characters (AKA N and Mello). Also i believe that\

        this anime is a bit overrated, like Naruto. But dont worry, you will hooked into the story anyways.\

    First off, DAMN... Who hasn't written a review for this? ANYWAYS...\
This is a revolutionary anime, which delves into the human sub-conscious, questioning if your more of a pessimistic or optimistic person. In the beginning, you are introduced to Light, the main character, who obtains the power to kill whomever, where ever, and whenever (well at least 45 seconds from now.). I loved this anime because it really gets to you. Although everybody, when born, is naturally good spirited, you often find yourself cheering for light. A man who becomes a murderer for the better good of man, or so he says. Then overtime, the plot\
          \
        flourishes, turning into an international story.\
All in all, I give this anime an 11/10, because of it's new ideas, and it's potential to relate to the common man.\

    Death Note was different to what I normally watch, but I like the elements they put in to make it interesting were what hooked me. The idea of the whole battle of wits between L and Kira made this anime turn from one side to another, not knowing who was going to win. But the thing I hated so much in this series, was Near. I hated Near so much, his character just annoyed me for some reason. Also the ending, it was horrible compared to the manga's ending. If anything, the last couple of episodes were what dragged this anime down. I'm not saying\

    *Note I watched the english dubbed version of Death Note\
Of course, when one writes about a 'suspense/crime/thriller' anime it is hard not to include spoilers while getting to the meat of what makes said anime good in the first place, regardless I shall do my utmost to avoid any such spoilers.\
For me, Death Note is one of the most original animes i've seen, rather than using some tired 'good vs evil battle' style it is a 'good vs evil battle of the minds' a tremendous clash of schemes, plans and deception. The complex story is well told using exciting, and at times frenetic dialogue between\
          \
        the characters, alongside the protagonist's inner thoughts and exhilirating action scenes. The characters themselves are very believable and the artists do a great job of showing the characters emotions in facial cues.\
I have to say though, the highlight for me was the musical score, It tied together the great artwork, story, characters and suspense wonderfully. The music really hightens the suspense and drama you feel when watching, even now when I listen to some of favourite Death Note tracks, it brings back memories of the emotion I felt from watching the characters in their enthralling adventure. \
There are only a couple of bad things I can say about Death Note: number one being that, by nature of the genre, the rewatch value is pretty low although this in kind of unavoidable in this genre and shoudln't count agaisnt it, in fact some people may see a whole different side of the story as they watch the events unfold while already knowing the conclusion. The other thing is the weird trend it has started; according to the Death Note Wikipedia entry a few school and university students have been excluded or temporarily suspended for creating immatation 'Death Notes' and subsequently writing the names of teachers and fellow students in the 'Death Notes' in fact, the chinese authorities have banned Death Note in major chinese cities for this reason. On the other hand, one can hardly blame the creators of Death Note for the misdemeanours of a select few people.\
In conclusion, I would say Death Note has all the elements of a fantastic anime and is well worth a watch, more so if you havent seen any other anime from this 'suspense/crime/thriller' genre.\

    You ever wish for an anime that surprises you and gives you enjoyment overall? Death Note is the anime for you, it's by far an outstanding anime in nearly every prospect, but many people feel light hearted when it comes to this show, many thing it's a bad ass horror, but it's actually more of a thriller.\
This was the first anime I watched, back when YouTube was all retro, retro meaning when anything could be uploaded about 6 years ago. I have watched it several times since, thus it's not out of my mind. It was quite weird looking back that it was my first\
          \
        anime because of the genre of anime, many people starting anime would have been watching the big three or from watching animated movies such as Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, but it was different, it was unique and most of all, it was brilliant.\
The story begins as Yagami Light, a highschool student, son of a detective. Baring hate to this world, one day he's staring out a window and catches a book falling from the sky, his attention is then put onto the book, from which he takes it home, and from there he finds out it's purpose. the book is called the \"Death Note\" and simply put, when you write a name into it, they die. The main requirement for killing is, you need to know their name and their face in order to kill them, and you can specify how they die.\
The Death Note origins: The book is a book of the Death Gods (Shinigami), they use these to keep an eye on the real world, Ryuk, the owner of the death note Light picks up comes down from the limbo like world to find the book, but to find a human has found it, which he sticks around to see what the human does, thinking much will not come from him. When you touch the book, you are able to see the owner of the book (Death God), thus when Light touched it, he was able to see Ryuk, only because he is the owner of that book.\
Since Light hates the current world, he wants to free the world from despair and rid it of all the inconsistencies and become god of it. He sets out killing people whom have committed crimes of mass load. But after so many people dying, a special detective is called in, the best of the best, his name is simply \"L\", nothing more, nothing less, and nobody knows his identity. His job is to catch Kira, Kira being the holders of the Death Notes, Light went with it after fans went about calling him Kira online.\
Many openings open up and many new characters come in, expanding the show and the entertainment from it, the art of this show is great, but not outstanding as it's not the newest of animes. the Sounds are awesome, insert songs are to die for, awesome riffs. Openings and Endings are perfect, Both Artists whom did them \"Nightmare\" and \"Maximum the Hormone\", were one of the first bands to get me into Japanese music. One being a japanese metal group and the other being rock, it's quite different, but good.\
Conclusion, by now, you should see that this anime is awesome, everything is pretty much perfect, right down to the characters, nearly everyone will like this show, I won't lie about that, but as per usual you do get the odd case of people not liking things, be that it's not their genre, or it's a fad.\
Signing off, go watch it, it's a great anime, you won't waste your time with it.\
It's very enjoyable and the rewatch value is quite good.",

    I gave the story an 8 and everything else a solid 9's across the board.  The story would have gotten a 9  if I rated it on or before about episode 20, and an easy 10 if it was within the first 5-10 episodes or so. Without giving too much away, it's hard to explain why -- but I just felt that certain plot arcs were drawn out longer than they needed to be, certain characters didn't need to be introduced to the story at all, and certain others should have stuck around until the end.

        anime as a whole, despite absolutely dispising the opening credit song for the second half of the series.\
Everything except Art could have been a 10 though (I save 10s for art that makes me actually jump out of my seat and go \"OMG the art in this is AMAZING!!\"), so in the end, yes, Death Note is a great anime definitely worth watching, but not enough to get 10's across the board... but it was.. so.. close.\

    This is my first time writing a review for any anime, I honestly wouldn't have watched Death Note because I am a rom/com fan but I did anyway due to my friends constantly telling me it's one of the best animes out there. and I had to agree.\
Story 8: A High school student who so happens to find a notebook that whoever has their name written on it will die, at first I found the idea.. stupid and I really thought this anime's story would be stupid but it wasn't. It showed how a person with great intelligence, looks and a good background gets corrupted\
          \
        and turns despicable due to power. The reason why I was so interested on this anime was mostly due to the twists and the great mind games fought within the main characters, though I didn't completely like the ending I had to admit it was hard to find a suitable ending for this anime, though I believe a better ending would be achieved if the new characters didn't come into play.\
Art 10: I don't know much about art styles and such, but I can say Death note was well made, I loved the coloring, it suited the certain moods being displayed and it made me think of how dark our world has really become. \
Sounds 10: Soundtrack is very important for anything, it can complete a mood wished to be displayed or add effect to a reaction the audience would display, the soundtrack for death note was nearly perfect, it was well done, fast and intense for those parts where action is displayed and a mood that made you ponder for the parts where there was a battle of the minds.\
Character 9: Death note has given me two new favorite anime characters, Light and L. Light was despicable, twisting people's emotions and everything around him for the betterment of his \"New world\", what made me like Light's character the most was probably when he lost all his memories of the Death note or all his power, at this moment of the anime he stated lines similar to, Not twisting a girls feelings and wanting less people to be killed, but as soon as the power was returned to him you see him as a different person, you can see how power can corrupt even the greatest of people. L was just, mysterious. He kept my attention his dark eys, his weird patterns, he was different and he didn't trust anyone, to me he shows how humans will be in the future or possibly today, unable to trust, a loner and would only display talents for him/herself. Characters like Near and the new people had to reduce my ratings for the characters, sadly.\
Enjoyment 9: As I said, I am more of a rom/com kind of person and I never thought I'd be into psychological animes but death note proved me wrong. I loved the anime I couldn't stop watching it till I completed it, though the endeing as I said was disappointing I did enjoy watching the anime\
Overall 9: Death note truly is one of the greatest animes out there in my opinion. it isn't perfect but perfection depends on the person judging, i would recommend this anime to anyone who has the brain to know that minds do battle not only fists.\

'Death Note' is a unique anime that appeals to almost anyone who's a fan of Anime (and even to those who aren't). Not just for the plot, but for its appealing for its animation and soundtrack.\
'Death Note' is ahead of time. With the writers thinking beyond what other script writers create, Death Note takes anime in a new, enjoyable direction.\
Light Yagami is a straight A high-school student who discovers a 'Death Note,' dropped by the shinigami Ryuk. With its user following the proper rules of the Death Note, it can be used to kill anyone by writing their name into the book. Light takes it\
          \
        upon himself to 'clean' the city by killing criminals using the Death Note. Shortly after Light begins, the police become suspicious and investigate the mysterious killings, taking the show in an incredible direction of conflict, entertainment and surprise.\
While the plot alone would be enough to win over any viewer, it's also its animation and soundtrack that's entertaining. Death Note takes its animation to a breathtaking level of realism (such as the cars, helicopters, city landscapes) and adds good detail into the characters. The soundtrack suits the show well, not just throughout the show itself, but it's opening and closing songs (Except the second opening...)\
Hands down, one of the greatest anime around.\

      Although conformity (and being against it) seems to be an issue with most diehard anime fans and this anime, it seems that Death Note has rightfully earned a spot as one of the most watched Animes. \
  I, like many others, give an anime a very small time to appeal to me. Death Note was able to not only grab my attention from the opening theme, but also to somehow manage to keep me excited, even during moments where he was simply staring out of a window. That excitement stays strong until after the credits have long been finished. \
  Part\
          \
        of that is due to the artwork. No, not graphics. Artwork. Something as simple as biting an apple (opening theme) takes on the image of beauty and force-feeds you the fierce emotions they want you to feel. \
   As for characters, there has probably only been a few other animes that develop such realistic (well, realistic in the matters of serial killers and their oppositions) characters. Aside from Light's internal rantings, you aren't given every thought of the main character, therefore you are forced to create a relationship with him, as well as a few other main characters, that is like a relationship with any person. You are given what the character wants to give you (in regards to their intentions and beliefs), and you base everything on that, just as you have to do in reality. Because of this, every person's actions seem to stun you, because these characters are definitely dynamic.\
   The plot (a notebook from a God of Death falls into the hands of a confused, over achiever teenage boy) is unique in itself, however the amount of climaxes in this anime is ridiculous, in the best way possible. Nearly every episode keeps you cheering for some, and feeling confused about cheering for others. \
   Death Note is truly a series that should be enjoyed by every anime lover, at least once. This anime is not able to be described in phrases such as 'Good vs Evil' 'Detective looks for serial killer' or 'Makes you think'. Every person will react differently to this anime, but I assure you, you will not regret it.\

    The animation is excellent and polished, the plot is one of the most intense psychological/philosophical/intellectual I've ever seen. It is original and compelling with its unexpected twists and turns  which kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time.  The characters are colorful, interesting and prone to make you feel extreme contrasting emotions (For example I would switch between hating Light and cheering for him).\
I love a show that still  makes me think even after each episode ends.  Though I started reading the manga first, I believe this is a strong adaptation (The ending is faithful to the\
          \
        manga although they should have included the epilogue and tied up all the other loose ends).\
However, what kept me from giving it a perfect 10 would be the pacing and the fact that the second arc is weaker than the first.  I wish they could have stretched the second arc a bit more in order to build up the characters of Near and Mello.  And I wish Ryuk, the character i was most interested in, showed up more. (He disappears for a large amount of the show as the focus was more on Light and L). It just felt like the show was rushed. \
Anyway other than that I have no qualms. It is surely one of my favorites.\

    Although it’s been said many times, this is ONE OF THE BEST ANIME. \
There’s a long review coming…………\
About the STORY\
The story is so rich. Every episode you get so excited, you can’t help but watch it again. It is also very much original and at the same time very risky. I mean to make the protagonist to be so irritating, that is very risky but I find it so courageous. But setting aside how exciting the story is, I absolutely believe that the strongest edge of this series is the lessons that one can learn. This is beyond a mere entertaining story but rather a\
          \
        story that can really change how you view the world. Well, I do. It might be a very fictional story but weight of the story is definitely moving. At first, I am just getting excited one episode after another and before I know it I am genuinely involve with it and would reflect for a very long time whenever I am alone. For that, the mangaka does not only gives birth for an entertaining piece of work to the viewers but rather a master piece that would change life and would define how one perceive things in our world. \
About the CHARACTERS\
The characters are very much unique and original on their own way. A bored Shinigami who owns the most dangerous weapon, well, at least for human beings; is so original I don’t even remember encountering something like that before. What I like about Ryuk, I also find human beings to be so interesting. They can be so pathetic but that makes them so interesting. The length of what they can do with their beliefs is so incomprehensive. Let’s not forget the very unusual L, who I love so much. He maybe looks so weird but he is so smart, competitive, but most importantly strong at heart. But of course, let’s go with the most irritating protagonist in the history of anime world, Light. He is just as smart as L, but the only difference would be he is weak when it comes to his heart. As dramatic as it sound can be, it is definitely a fact that it if wasn’t for the notebook, together with L, Light could’ve been one of the greatest individual who can change the world for the better. But he is defeated by the notebook. However, the most amazing thing about his character is that he can be so irritating and magnificent at the same time. He can be so absolutely amazing whenever he does his lies, plans, and schemes but at the same time you would despise him so much that you would want to go to the Death Note World just to kill him yourself. Having those conflicting feeling about him is an obvious prove how amazing his character is. I consider him as the most amazing anti-heroic character in the history of manga and anime world. With that all said, I love the rivalry between the two. In fact, their rivalry can be considered as one of the most amazing. Their competition is beyond being exciting.\
About LIGHT AND L\
After watching, you can’t help but choose side between LIGHT VS. L. I think that at the end of all it both side has a point. At first, I could understand why Light is doing it because everyday you watch the news, read the newspaper, read the internet, you really realize the horrible fact that the world is really rotten. You just can’t judge him. But he became so conceited because he was given so much power and even thought that he has the right to choose whose right or wrong. And the worse, he thought he should be the God of the new world. He flattered himself so much and even sacrifice innocent people and even his family. His reasons at first maybe justifiable but he was doomed the moment he thought of himself as God. At the end of it, L and Near was right that all in all Light was just a mass murderer and the DEATH NOTE was the worse weapon in the history of the world. This is what happens when people achieve so much power that they even thought they can be Gods. You can’t justify the wrong things that you do with beautiful reasons like \"cleansing the world\" and thinking that because you have power you have the right to choose who dies and who lives. If killing the bad guys will really cleanse the world, War and Conflict would not be still here after so many years of battles. It’s not as simple as that. I think that as long as people perceive things differently, conflicts and wars will stay. But despite that who don’t have the rights to snatch from people their hopes of changing things and more importantly of changing themselves. I think at the end of the day, the story tells us about people who fights for the things that they believe in. Is Light right or wrong? I don’t know but what I do know is that it is not wrong to do the things you believe in. I think the story was not about whether Light was wrong or not. I think more than anything else this was about a person who has great potential of changing the world but was doomed at the end because he was given a weapon that was too much for someone who was crowned with so much self proclaimed justice. \
About the ANIMATION\
I strongly believe that Takeshi Obata is able to illustrate the storyline and the characters so well. Every important scene is just heart-pounding and so exciting. I also love how the character of Light can look so cool and really handsome and yet so disgusting whenever he shows his true colors. \
This series has moved me in so many ways. It touches my heart and I definitely learn a lot from it. This is one of those very few mangas and animes that really leave a lasting impression to any viewers. Something that would be remembered even after so many years. All in all Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata are just GENIUSES…….",

    The show had a great main idea and was full of suspense and thrills. However, lots of times during the show it tended to lose it’s momentum, using crazy plot twist that just didn’t feel like they fit and made me feel like I was watching a completely different show. The ending left a lot to be desired. Sure it was a logical conclusion, but not a desirable one. It’s hard not to say the show is good, because it has so many good aspects. Thrill, excitement, interesting characters, a great plot…. But the extreme plot twist tended to just ruin the whole experience, and\
          \
        the ending made it feel like it wasn’t really worth all those hours, despite all the good things. For a show that has so many plot twist and always leaves you thinking you know everything, than being shocked to figure out you were completely wrong, the ending just seemed… too easy. It was a basic sad ending, nothing more to it. Defiantly not the kind of ending I’d expect from a show of this kind, so it was a big let down.\
Considering how popular it is, and how thrilling it was, I can’t really say I regret watching it, and I defiantly think it’s worth it for the thrills and to be able to say you saw it. However, don’t get your hopes up for the ending. It was a very dull way to conclude a thrilling series.\

    Story 9/10: Why I say 9 and not 10 is because of the repetition of the first main supporting character's attributes otherwise it was a very interesting series. \
Art/Animation 8/10: The art was okay but I give it this score because at times you can't see the person's expression.\
Sound 9/10: The only problem with the sound is that it probably would be better if they put a little more music dealing with the theme of mystery.\

    Well, Death note is definatly one of the best anime i've ever watched, though it was produces like 8 years ago. I seriously like the detective work which gets your mind involved and the love scenes are really overratted and unrealistic (The acting he does with the girls isnt satisfying). The series is epic from the supernatural point of veiw and somwhat unbelievable in the common sense sideway.\
            Its actually about a boy (last year in highschool) that gets a weird notebook that says \" DEATH NOTE\" the rules are that if he writes\
          \
        someone's name on the notebook and have their picture in mind they'll die within 40 second if he specifies the cause of death they'll die within 6 min and 40 sec otherwise they'll die from a heartattck. he uses it with the intension to make a perfect world free of criminals and kills criminal he sees on TV. International matters lead to a British boy (originally living in an orphanage) to get involved in the investigation as L the famous detective which then meets Ligh-kun (the main character nicknamed Kira) they become friends and investigation partners though L has his suspisions in Light being Kira \
                       Im not goint to spoil it cause its much fun watching it then reading it I say. \
     Finally, I personally love the good guys to win in all the stories and anime I watch, but this is the first time I felt sorry for the bad guy and even wanted him to WIN can you believe that.\
               Well its a great series I can tell you that all I want, but you wont know until you've watched it yourself, Right?\

    I heard about this series so frequently before actually having the desire to watch it; I almost never watched it because it seemed insanely popular, and I worried that the popularity indicated that there wasn't really something special or unique about it for *me* that would make me interested. Yet once I forgot about my preconceptions of the show, and observed where the plot was quickly heading past the few first episodes, I became very interested. This is an excellent series to watch for anyone interested in: \
a. The darker side of human nature; the abuse of power and how power can corrupt us and\
          \
        change who we are consciously and subconsciously; and\
b. The true intensity of the struggle between light and darkness, showed through the crafty, profoundly intelligent and sometimes manipulative actions of the characters. \
A great series if you are into the concepts of darkness, injustice, the supernatural, and thrilling plot lines. As someone who is very interested in mysteries, shows that keep you on the edge, always wondering about the character's plan or motive or next move, this show captivated me and I was pleasantly surprised at how great it is. \
*TL;DR Version*: A show perfect for anyone interested in how we battle our innermost fears and desires, the battle between light verses darkness, the evil of human nature when power is abused. A thriller with dark, edgy overtones, and excellent character development. This show holds a special appeal to those who enjoy shows with that 'disturbed' feel - there's something particularly dark, almost gothic about DN you won't be able to miss. \
OVERALL: 10/10 :))\

    *dont worry, the following does not contain spoilers, i am not a douche bag who is going to ruin it for you without warning*\
Definitely one of my favorite anime series out there, the story development and character personalities are intricate and unique. And the mystery/crime solving based storyline makes for great suspense. Even without too much blood or intense action scenes, this anime is sure to deliver an interestingly different thrill ride. The events are thought provoking as the story takes you through the minds of eccentric and extremely intelligent characters. \
You can tell with how the plot develops that the creators obviously spent a\
          \
        lot of time developing the characters and making a plot that could have the most suspenseful impact possible. Even the stories ending is just right, it ends when it has to and doesn't piss you off with corny and stupid ways of continuing the storyline just to keep the series airing longer. All in all, death note is a great and very nicely developed series, and i am glad that it is recently getting the popularity it deserves. There are only 2 down sides, first: now i am going to have to find other great anime like this or i will be bored and drop them haha (btw, if you have any good recommendations, please help me out by messaging me with them or something, thanks) Second, i am not really a fan of live movies based on anime series, but i can see why they made it, so i wont judge those who enjoy live action.\

    Story:\
Death Note is one of the most popular anime around. For a good reason ! Death Note starts of with a highschool student ( Yagami Light ) who's the smartest kid in the entire school ! He's bored with his life , mysteriously he finds a notebook named 'Death Note' in the death note it describes the rules and how it Death Note works. But there is a click a Shinigami ( Death God ) drops his Death Note from the Shingami realm to Earth. Who ever picks up the notebook the Shinigami must be with that person until he/she dies. So basically Light wants\
          \
        to use the notebook to eliminate all evil in the world. \
Enjoyment: \
Most times during this anime you need to think which means what is going to happen and the reason for this and that. Overall there are times that are quite boring...\
Characters:\
I love how all characters match their personality. \
Overall:\
Death Note is a must see ! There is also a live action same as the anime. Enjoy!^^\

    This was a very good anime. while i was a bit reluctant to watch this at first, it drew me in pretty quickly. not to try and make a spoiler, but the first montage of light killing off criminals will forever be stuck in my memory as one of the coolest scenes in any media i have ever watched. i remember getting a chill down my spine as the scene progressed. \
characters are a bit predictable, but overall they are designed very well. L is one of the greatest characters of all time, he is the only character that will constantly surprise you with his\
          \
        methods and actions, very fun to watch him indeed.\
the story is well written, though some things seem to be thrown in randomly, it all comes to a close very well, you can not ask for a better ending.\
overall, i certainly recommend this anime to anyone who is not offended by a little death.. you will love this show, period. \

Note: There are spoilers.\
If you rated this series seven or higher, than you're either lying to yourself, haven't watched enough animes to know better, or didn't finish the show.\
Yes, I have a very unpopular opinion. \
Well, the first season was great, and it instantly pulled me in. I loved the first season a lot. \
But the second season, like that one family member at Thanksgiving who always brags too much, ruined everything. \
After a certain character died (trying to keep out the spoiler), the whole show just went down hill.\
          \
        You might as well not watch the second season- it was that bad. They took away the only enjoyable character and replaced them with a cookie cutter copy. The only differences were their hair color, age, preference of toys or food, and one of them doesn't die. \
It still makes no sense how a \"genius\" died so stupidly without any type of proper funereal, burial at sea, or some other s**t.\
I would have rated the show an eight if the second season wasn't so bad. I'm really being generous by giving it a five. If it wasn't for the first season, I would have probably given it a three. \
I have so much more I could say, but it would be a lot more personal than objective than it already is.\

    Watching Death Note is like witnessing two chess masters play an epic, years-long game, and being unsure of who's won until long after the game is finished. This is undoubtedly the most intelligent anime out there, and also one of the darkest.\
Death gods have books where they record who will die, how, and when. One god loses his book, and unfortunately for him, Light Yagami picks it up. \"L\" is the genius who tries to figure out how people keep dropping dead.\
This is an odd anime because none of the characters are relatable: both L and Light are sociopathic and probably insane, and they're the\
          \
        only ones who can understand each other. Unfortunately, they're also mortal enemies.\
Light's relationships with other people are deliberately creepy and disturbing (\"I love you, Misa,\" Light says very unconvincingly to his girlfriend). L is one of the most unforgettable characters in anime. Look out for that symbolic foot-washing scene especially.\

---------------------------------------\
***WARNING - SPOILERS!!!***\
---------------------------------------\
Hello everybody! This is my review of the anime series Death Note. Once again, you are welcome to add your own thoughts to this, as long as they are suitable! Please take note of the SPOILER WARNING above though!\
Well, what can I say. Since Wednesday 4th November 2009 until Sunday 20th December 2009, I do believe I may have been watching one of the all-time greatest animes ever written.\
Literally, almost everything about the series including characters and their personalities, along with the whole storyline and the way everything panned out was near perfect.\
But overall, there is not an anime I\
          \
        have yet seen that can even be compared to Death Note in the same sense of the amount of effort that was put into making everything about the characters pan out just perfectly.\
Nobody was ever predictable, a hard feat to achieve indeed. And also the creators forced the viewer/reader to choose a side, Light or 'L'. Personally, I fell immediately on the side of Light, however, this was probably intended, mainly due to the fact that L doesn't enter the story line till episode 2 and doesn't come into his prime until a few episodes later.\
This gives the viewer/reader a chance to build up a strong liking of Light. Hence, they develop a natural dislike to L when he first appears, as he appears to want to put a stop to Light's actions.\
However, as time passes, I found myself becoming ever more interested in the way that L put across his methods of thinking. Most of his assumptions would likely be classed as mad guesses in the real world, however, seeing as this is based on a story, the characters believe him.\
Another point is the way that for every single brilliant plan or idea that Light comes up with, L always seems to find a way to overcome it. However, the fact that this also happens in reverse. keeps the story in a well-maintained balance.\
Personally, I thought that the idea that Light had everything planned up to the moment that he and L, now working together, managed to retrive the Death Note from Higuchi, was incredible in that it was so hard and yet so easy to believe he would've done it.\
Then when Rem sacrificed herself to kill Watari and 'L', it came as a big shock as even I had not been expecting it to happen, and also not so suddenly. I believe this element of suprise is a key factor which is upheld throughout the series in order to maintain the audience's focus.\
From then on, knowing that any conventional anime has only 13-26 episodes, once I found out that there was 39 episodes (38 & 39 being OVAs) I realised that the anime was far from over with another 12 episodes left.\
When the USA got involved I felt kind of annoyed as it appeared that they were interfering with everything in the storyline. Eventually, I came to see that the way that Near thought and acted was meant to make you think that he was a kind of 'Son of L' so to speak.\
He was meant to give the impression that even though the real L is dead, there's remains a feeling such as his spirit is still present in order to seek revenge upon Light, using Near as his medium.\
And so another epic battle of wits insued until Episode 36 when they finally met: Light and Near.\
At this point I felt almost certain that Light's plan was going to working, what with the USA tampering witht the wrong Death Note and Mikami Teru having the real Death Note.\
How shocked/annoyed/confused I was to find out that Near had thought of this and also altered the real Death Note, and exposing Light undeniable as Kira.\
When Light pulled the tiny piece of the Death Note out of his watch, I felt that there would be a sort of 'Romeo and Juliet' type scenario, where Light would write Near's name on the Death Note, killing him and also be killed by both his and Near's associates.\
Unfortunately, Matsuda was too quick for him and managed to shoot Light's hand, stopping him from writing, then shooting him several times when he tried to do it again.\
I felt incredibly shocked that after all that had happened, all of Light's efforts to make what he thought would be a genuinely good new world, were all in vein.\
It was also quite sad to see him die at the end, knowing all that he had accomplished had been dashed in one fell swoop. And that also, he was eventually killed not just by the people he had been working with, but by the man seemingly the least likely to be able to accomplish such an act.\
So, overall a very well constructed anime.\
I have only one slightly negative point for this. Death Note appeared to suffer the same problem as Trigun, in that it rather dragged itself out slowly, but it was made up for by the multiple key points and developments that linked each episode.\

 L, who also uses the aliases Hideki Ryuga, Ryuzaki, Eraldo Coil and Deneuve, the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second&mdash;and third&mdash;best detectives in the world, is quite secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant Watari. He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\
 \
 L's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\
 \
 L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\

Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.\

Upon L's death, Aizawa returns to the investigation team to work under Light. Upon hearing that the 13 days rule (refer to written rules of the Death Note) is false, he begins to suspect that Light is actually Kira, and contacts Near. Aizawa passes certain information to Near that leads him to deduce Kira's real identity (i.e. Light), and Near briefly holds him at the SPK headquarters. Near agrees to release Aizawa and Mogi afterwards. In the finale, he becomes the leader of the investigation team.  \
 Aizawa has a wife and two children; Aizawa's daughter is named Aizawa Yumi and his wife is named Aizawa Eriko. \

 Misa is a famous model, singer and actress and has an immense crush on Light Yagami. She usually refers to herself in the third person by calling herself \"Misa-Misa\" and tends to be hyperactive. She poses as the second Kira to attract the attention of the first Kira.\
 \
 She decides to devote her life to Light because he punished the criminal that killed her parents when she was younger; a burglar killed Misa's parents in front of her eyes. Misa, unable to forgive the killer and wanting to kill the burglar herself, saw multiple delays in the killer's trial before Kira killed him. The Shinigami who follows her is Rem. Misa also performs two eye trades, cutting her lifespan in half twice; the first was with Rem, and the second with Ryuk.\
 \
 According to How to Read 13, Misa falls into despair after learning of Light's death through Matsuda. Misa commits suicide one year later on February 14, 2011. It is also revealed that the cloaked woman who appears at the end of the manga is not Misa, but simply a follower of Kira.\
 \
 At the anime's finale, Misa's suicide is neither mentioned nor seen. At the final credits, she is seen standing at the edge of a rooftop, with a sad face looking at the horizon.\

 Halle Lidner, real name Halle Bullook, works for Near as part of his investigation team, along with Gevanni and Rester. She is mentioned to be a former CIA agent.\
 \
 \
 In the manga, Lidner knows Mello and leaks SPK information to Mello; Near is unaware of Lidner's SPK information leaking. When Mello questions her and asks her which side she is on(Near or his), She replies that she is on neither side, and merely helps both of them because they are after Kira. Later on, she calls Mello and tells him about Near's plan(Having Mikami write everyone's name down in the notebook), and he replies \"I'm the only one who can do it.\". This can be seen as the real push that drove Mello to kidnap Takada and eventually save the lives of both investigation teams.\
 \
 Mikami views her real name, Halle Bullook, with his Shinigami eyes and proceeds to write her name as well as the other SPK members' names into his Death Note, but she remains alive due to the notebook being a fake.\

Lester also helps Near with actions he is not used to doing, such as booking a flight on a plane.. \
 He is often called \"Commander Lester\", and he is unable to match Near's in intelligence and analytic skill despite being very intelligent. Nevertheless, being trustworthy, athletic, and a quiet person make him very useful to assist Near. How to Read states that he can be seen as Near's guardian. He's also the only member of the SPK that Near is sure has never been seen by Kira.\

 The one shot happening after the main series reveals he continues to work with Near, the new L, and Halle Lidner.\

  synopsis = "A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.\
\
High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.\
\
With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.",
