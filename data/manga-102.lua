		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=93,   ["text"]="              \n    I find that there are people who absolutely love (this seems to be the majority) Furuba or people who can't stand it. \nI believe that it's hard not to like Furuba. At first I thought it was just going to be funny, because the first 7 or so volumes are full of hilarious scenes (mainly because whenever the Juunishi are hugged by the opposite sex, they change!). But once you get to volume 6 everything seems to start to gravitate in a different direction. \nThe story line, when it's revealed, is a little cliche in my opinion. Hence the rate of a 9. Don't get\n          \n        me wrong, its a beautiful story and one I find myself learning from over and over again no matter how many times I read it. It's about growing up and becoming who you're meant to be and finding the reason why you were born. It's almost hard to believe sometimes, the pain the characters have to go through in Furuba. But I'm so engrossed in each pain that it's not something that can be put down easily. \nThe characters are the winning point in Furuba. In reality they'd be a bunch of loners, depressing and sad. And just about every one of them is believable. Their personalities range from overtly happy (meaning there hiding the pain) to stubborn as a horse (go figure) and just down right conceited (he knows who he is). Even 'God' too. The growth of each of them is stunning and gorgeous and reading them grow is like watching the sun rise on a rainy day. I've laughed obnoxiously, cried until my chest hurt and felt the red hot burn of hatred while reading this manga. My favorite character is Kyo because he's absolutely adorable and I think I would also try to solve everything with anger myself. And the one character that I hated and grew to love was Yuki because he, in my opinion, is the one who grows the most. The one problem I have though is our main character. I love and I hate Tohru Honda. It's hard to place into words, what Tohru is. Because she becomes everything at once. A mother, a sister, a friend, a confident, a hero and the reason for someone else's life. But she's also the saddest girl I have ever seen. Bottled up with the most horrifying feelings. Even in the beginning it's obvious. Losing your mother would tear anyone's heart it two. I love her and what she does for everyone in the story. Because if I were to meet her myself, I think I would react much as all the Zodiac do. I would treat her as if she were the sun itself. But where, but in a manga, do you find someone so selfless.\nThe enjoyment I had and continue to have for this manga is absolute. I own every single volume and I'll pick up one all the time and just read it. There's a lesson in every chapter and words, that even though I don't think anyone in the real world has the heart to say, that make me want to become a better person. Someone who would give and give and give and ask for nothing in return. It makes me want to smile. To be the reason that someone else could smile. It makes me want to to the rock that someone can stand on. It's hard to read this manga and not feel ashamed for something you've done. It makes me ashamed to feel that I don't do as Tohru does. Which is why I believe that everyone should read this manga. Because it's heartwarming, sad, and where life continues to grow.\n"},

Not only was she recently orphaned with the tragedy of her mother's death, but she also has no where to live and is currently residing in a tent! However, when her luck to seems to be at its worse, she meets the Sohma family - and is invited to stay with them in exchange for taking care of the household chores.\nBut it isn't long before Tohru discovers the Sohmas have deep a secret. The family is cursed by the spirits of the Chinese Zodiac, and some of the\n          \n        children born into the Sohma family are possessed by these spirits. When possessed, they cannot be \"huggled\" by the opposite sex, or they transform into their respective Zodiac animal!\nHowever, this doesn't phase Tohru, who promises to keep their secret. She continues living with them, and her grave humbleness and thankfulness never wanes. As a result, they come to be very important people in her life, and the Sohmas begin to realize how very lucky they are to have her.\n--\nFuruba was the first manga I ever read, the first anime I ever watched. I finished it about a year and a half ago, but since I got the final volume the other day, and have reread the series a few times over now, I should be able to give it a worthy review.\n--\nThe story is like nothing Ive ever read before. Yes, Ive read lots of stories with people transforming into animals, or with the Zodiac as a genre. But Furuba was different. The more you get into the story, the deeper the meaning. Its tragic, yet cute, suspenseful and heart-wrenching. It kept me wanting more, kept me rereading each book over and over. The plot thickens, and doesn't have breaks like other stories do, like Naruto, Bleach, or anything like that. This is a story where once the plot thickens, it will not thin out until the very end. Its a mystery where you HAVE to read the whole thing to understand it. Skipping chapters and/or volumes will have you lost and confused, just like some characters in this story. Its a roller coaster ride of love, romance, hurt and tragedy. Its a shoujo manga that boys and girls alike can enjoy!\nArt - 10/10\nThis is my favorite thing about Furuba. The art. Natsuki Takaya's are was cute to begin with, but you can how much she evolves her art, through out the manga. As the years go by, her art slightly changed, and now, if you look at that in volume one, and the art in volume 23, you cannot even tell they are the same artist. Her most recent art is beautiful and smoother than her art from 8 years ago. I loved Kyou's design the best, he seemed to be the character she worked most on, and it showed throughout his smooth expressions and movements. I hope to see more of Takaya-Sensei's more recent arts. \nCharacter - 10/10\nThis is were Furuba has become on of the most popular shoujo manga out there. Character development. Every single fricken character in this story goes through huge transformations. In personality, looks and etc. Kyou especially. From the beginning there are characters I HATED, but by the time the end came around, that character had changed so much because of traumatic and heartbreaking events, they became one of my favorite characters. I had characters I liked from the beginning, and at the end, I LOVED them. I rooted for so many pairings, got what I wanted, hated some of the pairings that were strangely created, and wanted to murder a few characters. But without those certain characters, the story would have sucked, and that's what it didn't do. \nOverall -- 10/10\nFruits Basket was a perfect start to my shoujo obsession. It kicked it off and kept me going through the years. 7 years of waiting for the finale, and I got what I wanted. Each chapter was unique in a sense, and I loved the story. Like I said before, this manga is perfect for both girls and guys. There's: Fighting, blood, fear, death, suspense, transformation, tons of zodiac reference, lots and lots of romance, Tsnuderes, animals, and cute bishounen.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=45,   ["text"]="           \n    People underestimate children and teenagers. When you're a kid, you're a blank slate that can be easily damaged. When you're a teenager, you tend to go through a lot of crap and as you get older, the baggage from when you were a teenager can carry over to your adult life. Yet there's this preconceived notion in our society that children/teenagers are stupid and that the problems that they go through when they're this young are trivial in comparison to the trials and tribulations they'll go through in their adult lives. Fruits Basket is a manga which tells the story of Tohru Honda and her\n          \n        life with the Sohma family and is also a tale of emotional hardship.\nThough Fruits Basket might seem like a supernatural comedy at first with its reverse harem premise and some occasional cuteness/man service to boot, it quickly turns into something much darker and deeper as it dives into the story of the Sohma family (specifically, the 12 members of the Chinese Zodiac, plus the cat) and their history of abuse/neglect and emotional hardship. At the forefront of all this is our plucky heroine, Tohru Honda who by the start of the series is an orphan. While many people like to criticise Tohru's characterisation as being \"too perfect,\" I'd like to take the time to say that it's not entirely true.\nYes, Tohru is certainly kinder than most people and embodies certain characteristics that one might find rather stereotypical/idealistic. However, it should be noted that Tohru is not infallible. She actually is a flawed individual and is capable of making mistakes. Her cheerful demeanour simply masks the strife that she's endured. In fact, being TOO and cheerful and upbeat is her coping mechanism for all the shit she's gone through. Her behaviour doesn't go unnoticed. People do call her out on being \"too happy\" all the time, and what's more is that we get to see the child crying out for her lost mommy and daddy as the manga progresses. Each instance we see the part of her personality that her bubbly exterior masks is brief, but it's more than enough to remind us that she isn't perfect.\nAnother purpose that Tohru's cheerful demeanour serves is to lighten the mood of the overall story. This is a manga which deals with VERY heavy subjects such as parental/psychological abuse, neglect, and emotional codependency. Tohru and virtually every member of Zodiac is a seriously damaged individual with a history of great strife. Without something to lighten the overall tone of the story (if only a little), Fruits Basket would immediately become a work thoroughly entrenched in the melodramatic. Despite what most people who suffer from depression like to say, their lives aren't all bad. There's always going to be a light spot, some jovial mood every now and then, etc. In that sense, Tohru is even more of a necessity and not a hindrance to the storytelling.\nWhen it comes down to lightening the mood, Natsuki Takaya did an excellent job with Fruits Basket. In fact, this is what I love about it so much. Far too often in anime and manga, we tend to get what seems like a light-hearted narrative that quickly devolves into a melodrama which tries too hard to evoke an emotional response out of the viewer/reader and Fruits Basket manages to avoid these very pitfalls by carefully blending the comedy with the drama/romance without creating some sort of dichotomy between these elements. With the right blend of comedy, drama, and romance along with some very well-written characters who play off of each other very well, she was effectively able to throw something depressing at you while reminding you that it's not all bad and that things will eventually get better for the characters. \nWhen it comes down to characters, virtually everyone in the cast is properly fleshed out and play off of each other really well. Characters of particular note are Yuki, Kyo, Hatori, and Rin. We know exactly who each member of the cast is, we know their back-stories, and we see them grow and change as individuals. Tohru's friends, Saki and Arisa are also given their own time to shine in the sun and prove to be invaluable to Tohru's character growth. However, if there had to be a character that stood out to me more than anyone else, it would have to be Tohru's mother, Kyoko Honda. Surprisingly, even a deceased character is given time in the spotlight via flashback to show just how much of an influence that she's had on Tohru and vice-versa and for that, I applaud Natsuki Takaya.\nUnfortunately, I can't really say the same about Takaya's artwork. It's going to be hard enough for people who are unfamiliar with the shoujo aesthetic to get used to the artwork in Fruits Basket, and her artwork certainly isn't bad by any means. What's more is that her artwork does go through quite a bit of refinement as the series progresses. However, the biggest fault that the manga has when it comes down to artwork is the relative lack of detail put into everything along with the fact that it seems like character faces/hairstyles sometimes end up recycled for side/supporting characters. I had a hard time trying to figure out whether or not Kyo was in the panel, or if it was one of the student council members, just as an example. Regardless, Takaya certainly did an adequate job of the artwork and it works for what it does.\nSo final thoughts: Fruits Basket is definitely one of the best mangas I've ever had the pleasure of reading. People often think of the shoujo demographic as being rife with big eyes, man service, reverse harems, debauchery, idiot girls fawning over guys who are complete dicks to them, etc. That's not entirely the case. Yes, that is certainly true for anime/manga on the lower end of the spectrum. However, if you're really looking for a shoujo series to read that's in the top of its class, I cannot recommend this manga enough. Now, there is an anime adaptation currently available from Funimation that was produced by Studio DEEN back in 2001. However, it only covers the first 38 chapters or so of the manga which is relatively early in its run. It's still worth watching, don't get me wrong but you might find it a bit too jovial compared to the rest of the manga.\nCurrently, Fruits Basket is out-of-print. TOKYOPOP used to publish the series and it was one of their all-time bestsellers (with sales only being topped by Naruto, believe it or not). Unfortunately, TOKYOPOP went out of business in 2011 and as such, all their titles have gone out-of-print and Viz Manga/Yen Press/Dark Horse/Kodansha Comics have not yet picked it up for publishing. Fortunately, there are plenty of volumes in circulation for you to read at a fair enough price so you should be able to pick up the entire series on Amazon or possibly Right Stuf if you're lucky. \nWith all of that said, I'm done with this review. Feedback is greatly appreciated as always. This is also my first manga review so please be gentle, senpai >////\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="              \n    This was the first series that I actually finished, and it was also the series that got me interested in the whole aspect of manga and anime ^^.  I hope to one day re-read it if I can get hold of the books, since Tokyopop disabled their upload on online manga sites.\nStory: The one thing I love about this series is that there's no one set genre.  One moment, you can explore deeply into your conscious, the next you can be laughing your ass off at a joke Shigure makes.  Though the sudden change, the events that unfold still seem to follow\n          \n        very smoothly and it's very easy to link what's happening at any one part with any other parts of the series.  This series also has a really good ending, it wrapped up very nicely and it leaves you with a heart-warming content feeling.  \nArt: The drawing at first felt weird.  I think I was overwhelmed by Tohru's large eyes lol.  But I think it's becoming my idea of manga drawings now, I tend to compare other series drawings with fruits basket.  Just a habit of mine.\nCharacter: Developing characters worked nicely into fruits basket.  You find yourself following the path of each character, experiencing all their joy and sorrow; this allowed me to connect better with the characters.  I don't think I'll ever forget them :)\nEnjoyment: It's the highest scoring series in my list so far.  Only reason I gave it 9/10 is cause saying it's 10/10 is saying it's the best, but I don't know if a new series will come that will beat it.  So, for me 10/10 is reserved.\nOverall: So very good, if only the anime is as good as the manga.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=29,   ["text"]="           \n    I'm being a bit more critical in rating this manga series. It's a really great manga though. So its definitely recommended for anyone who has seen the anime and who want to see a closure to the story.\nStory [10/10]: The base of the story was wonderful and perfect to weave a long story including people associated with the zodiac. The main concept that keeps the story rolling is the fact that each person, who is possessed by an animal spirit associated with the chinese zodiac, suffers from emotional hardships because either their own parents won't accept them or society wouldn't. The one causing them to\n          \n        suffer even more is their head of the house who is constantly mentally pressuring them to obey whatever he tells. And the one who comes to ease their pain is Tohru Honda. Interactions of each zodiac member with Tohru and a change in their attitude and stance against their own curse and the head of the house is what makes up the full 23 vols of this series. The story is heavily based on human emotions - mostly negative on the part of the zodiac members and a mixture of both positive and negative on Tohru's part. I also should add that the manga is not all comic, as the anime was for most of the part, as the series progresses. From the point in the manga equivalent to where the anime finished, you'll get to read a lot of negative thoughts and emotions. Sometimes while reading the manga, it really made me wonder- is this the manga of the same story as the anime? Overall though the story gets quiet dark , there are also lots of good comic situations- most really well executed in the anime. Since the series has a lot of volumes, the story isn't rushed. We get to read about the family background of most of the zodiac members is quiet a bit of detail. Each character's story makes a definite impact on the reader. Their gradual acceptance of the situation they are in and attempts to break free of all that emotional trauma of years is smoothly conveyed.\nArt [8/10]: The art throughout the 23 vols is not having the same style. If you open the first vol and the last vol. and look for any character, you'll see the huge difference. I somewhat felt let down by that. But never mind since its the story that matters the most. other that the obviously changed style of drawing characters, the art is clean. Backgrounds are well drawn. Body proportions are also reasonably well drawn. Panels are not cluttered. \nCharacter [8/10]: Another strong point of the manga. All characters have distinct personalities which you won;t be able to forget. All the characters have quiet a bit of dark streaks to their personality mostly because of their surroundings and the hardships they have had to face all the more fuelled by their twisted head of the family. The head of the family is abusive. This is one thing I didn't enjoy personally. But its also what drives the other characters to behave the way they do. The other thing that I didn't personally like was the way Haru and Rin's relationship has been portrayed- a little bit too involved for their age. Similarly, Akito's relationship with his own relatives also seemed a bit uncomfortable for me. I'm only explicitly mentioning this since this manga has been rated Teen (13+) by Tokyopop, so I wasn't expecting mature natured interactions between the characters. Apart from that, none of the characters are annoying and their gradual change of perspective of things believable.\nEnjoyment and Overall [8/10]: Its easy to go berserk when you've been put in unpleasant surroundings or situations repeatedly. But to not break down in those situations and still enjoy today and look forward to tomorrow is what the protagonist of this series tries to convey. I think people today need such motivation more than ever. Overall, it was a fun long read. The plot was attention grabbing and the storytelling smooth. Recommended!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="              \n    Ok, first, I thought that Fruits Basket was a little weird. My friend recommended it and I wasn't really in the mood to read an awfully long manga. So... maybe after one month, I tried reading it and then I knew I couldn't et away from the computer:P\n I know you would think I'm crazy for giving it almost a full ten but they're true. Story - one of a kind, unique. I mean where would you get the idea of making the characters into animals when they hug the opposite sex? And I also love the development of the 'love' in the story. And\n          \n        it has drama, comedy, and romance which makes it my favorite. Fruits Basket is one of the mangas I first read and one of the mangas that I really enjoyed reading. \nArt - Like almost all mangas, first, the art was...ok but it got better and better. The guys in the manga are all handsome(*coughs* hot*coughs*). But the girls are ...ok too but not that much because some of the girls looked masculine.\nCharacter - Fruits Basket is one of the mangas that develops the looks of the characters. Try to look at the characters in the first chapter and at the very last and they looks matured and I like those kind of mangas, not the type that was shown for a year and still look like what they looked at the very first chapter. I also liked the attitudes and personalities of the characters. They were all funny in their own little ways. No one acted like emos. Some of the main characters changed over time from hard to soft(you know what I mean). \nEnjoyment - I again gave it a ten because it's an awesome manga that made me cry(Yes, I did), laugh a lot and I mean A LOT!, and moved with the sweetness of the characters with each other(the main couple). It's like a full package deal XD\nOverall, I loved it so much. I read it whenever I kinda feel lonely, and it always makes me laugh and somehow helps removing my loneliness :P It's a really really great read. It kinda refreshed my soul after reading it. It's the kind of manga that makes you want to read more and more. \nLast, I LOVE IT SO MUCH (I now officially want to re-read Fruits Basket lol)\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="            \n    Fruits Basket was my first manga and at the time, I got quite far with the volumes. However; I recently started over with the books for the sake of not confusing myself with the events. Just a little something to keep in mind. \nThe series starts out as a typical comedy with silly antics that you would usually see in almost any manga, which makes one believe Fruits Basket to be simple and light hearted tale. But the further you read in to the story, you begin to learn dark secrets that different characters are hiding about themselves. The interesting thing to note about the\n          \n        series is that it gets in depth about practically each individual character from the Sohma's to Tohru's friends, which in my option makes them far more likable and gives them a sense of realism. \nNatsuki Takaya's art style starts off somewhat off-putting (Though this is just my own personal opinion) to begin with, but her style begins to improve with each volume and eventually it becomes much more pleasant to look at.\nEach character in the story goes through some type of development, even though the steps are quite small, you do begin to notice a difference in their attitudes over a period of time. Again, giving of a sense of realism. You find yourself relating to the characters and even rooting for them. \nIf you have a lot of time on your hands, I highly recommend reading Fruits Basket wither you are new to the concept of manga or you are simply interested in reading it. Although you must keep in mind that the series is quite long and might take a few days to complete. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="             \n    Okay, I decided a long time ago that my first review would go to Fruits Basket, so I guess it's about time. Before I start I want to say two things: \nFirst of all, I finished Furuba almost a year ago, but I re-read a few chapters from time to time, and I still remember almost everything.\nAnd second of all, my english may not be the best, so don't be surprised if there's something that sounds weird.\nStory - 9/10\nAt first, it's not really something special. It's a cute girl who meets a family who turns into cute animals when they hug people. Cute.\nHowever, that's not\n          \n        all there is to Furuba. This whole story isn't about people turning into animals, so don't stop reading before you understand that.\nFuruba's story is darker than it seems. There are secrets, tragedies and unsolved mysteries that turned this 'cute' manga into something much deeper, something you'll remember for the rest of your life. And what's even more remarkable is that, despite all these tragedies and all this despair, everything gets a happy end. I admit it, I cried my eyes out.\nArt - 9/10\nAt first, I was thinking about giving it 8, but then I thought about one of my favourite pages, one where you see Katsuya holding little Tohru and smiling, and realized how much I love this style.\nNatsuki Takaya is, without a doubt, one of my favourite mangakas, and her style goes through a huge transformation between the first and the last book. Another thing you can't help but notice between book 1 and book 23 is how the characters have grown. If we take my favourite character, Kyo, as an example, I didn't notice until I started comparing. And wow, she's really done a great job here! Even when they're all grown up, you have no problem telling who the characters are. This gets an extra point from me, cuz I just happen to love to see characters grow up (and sometimes get a family, like in Clannad or Itazura na Kiss)\nSo, art is a 9.\nCharacter - 10/10\nThis is doubtless the best part of Fruits Basket. The characters.\nLet's start of with the main characters.\nTohru is probably one of my favourite shoujo heroines of all time. I've seen people who find her hard to believe, but in my point of view, it doesn't matter. Manga isn't reality, so she makes an excellent protagonist. She is sweet, helpful, a little slow, but with a heart of gold. Nuff said.\nKyo and Yuki were also good characters. I can say that now.\nKyo was my favourite right from the start, which is probably on of the reasons to why I disliked Yuki. He's acts mean and sometimes violent, but he really cares about Tohru (an excellent tsundere, that is). Yuki seems perfect at a first glance, but later you realize that he's not like you thought. After 23 books, I didn't hate him anymore.\nHowever, the supporting characters are just as important as the main. They all have their own problems and personalities, and you get to see them work everything out, with the help of our lovable heroine. Everything gets a happy end, and I can only think of two (fairly important) characters who didn't fall in love.\nIn the end, you'll like at least one or two.\nEnjoyment - 10/10\nI love Furuba with all of my heart. It did take me a lot of time to finish it, since I read online with a bad internet connection, but in the end I'm so happy I did. There were so many moments and characters that touched my heart, and in the end I was crying like a little baby. The best manga I've ever read since the day I was born.\nOverall - 10/10\nEverything that needs to be said has been said. Wonderful story, beautiful artwork, and lovable characters.

Anywho in the beginning I thought it was funny and  I liked the art a lot but towards the end it was a little disappointing. The character development was very well done and the story was a very interesting take on the zodiac. The part that did disappoint me was the fact that the author waited until the very end f the series to deal with everyone's problems and reveal bits about their past ..etc It was too much and too\n          \n        many at one time. It was confusing at times but this might've have also been attributed to the new scanlators who were definitely not the best. (sorry i'm still grateful but the grammar and punctuation made me feel that a lot had gotten lost in translation) The other thing I disliked was the protagonist. after a while you realize she really is just a typical shojo girl pretty, weepy, idiotic, and smiles through everything. Her character didn't develop as much as the rest of the characters. The end gave her a little more depth but not enough to really understand why all these boys were interested in her. And I feel honestly momiji was a weak rival later on even though he was so cute xp.I wish he had gotten a fair chance he was awesome:) I also feel the art style changed a little when they got older and I disliked the change for some of the characters. and akito?$#@%$#@@$?3 I don't know why this person had such power over them for so long. I liked Rin cuz even though she had a lot of issues she had depth and was very honest and true to character til the end. I with I got to see more instances with her. Also tohru's friends were great. they cracked me up especially hanajima:)\nOther than that it was still a solid read. Funny at times. and of course Bishies galore. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="            \n    Let’s get this straight, I suck at writing reviews. I go off on tangents, I have terrible grammar, I have unoriginal thoughts, and I’m not objective at all. That being said, I still feel compelled to write about Fruits Basket and express what it means to me. So, I want to make it clear that this review might be extremely bias. I cannot help it. The feelings I have for this manga goes beyond any love I have for other series that have been published so far. Regardless of how objective I intend to be, the infatuation I have for Fruits Basket is likely to\n          \n        show through my writing. I am not going to apologize for that. Whether it's a song, a book, a manga, or an anime, we all have something that we can resonate with. Regardless of how insignificant it may seem to others, we cherish it-- I will always cherish Fruits Basket. Always.\nFruits Basket is the #1 Shoujo manga sold in the United States and the number 2 in Japan. It has been 8 years since it ended, and I assume it is still as popular as ever.\nTypically, when something is ranked so highly, there is a tendency of having two distinct opposing opinions. People will like it. People will hate it. I personally abhor the # 1 selling Shoujo manga (HYD) in Japan. No amount of convincing can make me feel otherwise; it just left a bad taste on my mouth. Some may feel the same way about Fruits Basket, and it is totally understandable. For me however, Fruits Basket managed to gently grab my stained heart and wash away the dirt with the tears of the characters.\nIMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ANIME VIEWERS: Read the manga from the very beginning regardless of how repetitive or uneventful it may feel. The manga incorporates a lot of things that can appear irrelevant but are very important to the overall storyline (e.g. the boy with the hat). It approaches numerous important matters in a very subtle tone, and it is only later on in the story when everything starts to piece itself together. The anime on the other hand disregards almost all these details. It actually sways the viewers who are transitioning into reading the manga to have a much distorted version of the authentic story.\nPros:\nThis series is melancholic. For some readers, it will feel overly melodramatic and annoying. Every character has a past: almost everyone (asides for a few) suffered because their parents were incompetent, apathetic and scumbags. To some readers, the pain and the feelings the character go through might seem exaggerated, but for me, I sensed each and every characters emotions. It felt unbelievably real. I might have not gone through that extensive pain and trauma, but their emotions of helplessness and hope felt so relatable. I kept wondering how Natsuki Takaya could even write such a beautiful story and explore such psychological aspect of individual suffering. I was cheering for almost all the characters, and before I knew it, all I wanted was them to be happy at the end.\n1) If I had to name one thing that the Fruits Basket did right, it is the characters. They are ridiculously well developed. Almost all of them go through obstacles in order to grow, flourish and change. It is hard to not become attached to them because they are realistically portrayed. They’re not just angsty teenagers. They are characters with depth. They have both inferiority and superiority complex. They constantly fight their own environment and their inner self to create change in the way they are living and feeling.\nTohru, Kyo, and Yuki are the center of the storyline. They are the archetypical main characters. You have the overly empathetic female, the rebellious male, and the prince charming. However, what separates them from any other characters I have read about is the fact that they develop, and almost every part of them is explored. You can abhor Tohru for not being assertive, but you end up sympathizing with her because she is such a strong-willed fragile girl. You can hate Kyo for being insensitive, but you can find yourself empathizing with him because of who he is and how his circle of family views him. You can dislike Yuki for being prince charming, but you can relate to him knowing he is always battling the world as the people around him only knows him through a superficial lens. \nI can also go on about the other side characters, but tons of essays can be written about each individual. That’s why, all I will say is that each character was able to highlight the beauty and the flaws of the three musketeers.\n(If I had to choose one character I favored and related to the most, it was Yuki. I loved how he used the metaphor of opening the lid of a bottle to the suffering he was going through. He truly evolved throughout the manga, and it wasn’t just a single moment that changed him. He worked for his growth, and along the way, the readers were introduced to new energetic characters that magnified his bad and good qualities while supporting him at the same time. In my opinion, Yuki was just a dynamic character. His name fitted his personality so well. He was pure as the snow but believed that he was stained.)\n2) If you intend to read this series only for the romance, that is something you definitely will be served at the end. Moreover, the love triangle in Fruits Basket is unique. When first starting, this manga may appear to be a reverse-harem where everyone falls in love with the main heroine, and that is exactly the truth. All the characters care deeply for Tohru as she does for them (platonically). To be honest, if I hadn’t known the spoilers beforehand, I might have actually been sad knowing that the character I probably would have believed to end up with Tohru didn’t end up with her. However, that is the thing, do not read the manga just so your favorite character could end up with Tohru. There is more to the Fruits Basket manga than the surface level romance. Also, midway through the series it actually becomes very apparent who Tohru will be with purely because every character starts diverting and trying to find their own place in the world. If that does not satisfy you, Natsuki Takaya did mention that Tohru could have been suitable for anyone, even Momiji! However, Fruits Basket took us on an adventure where two characters just had the chance to become closer and grow feelings for each other.\nAlso, one of the most admirable part of the series is that the male character who did not end up with Tohru was given the last line of the entire series before the epilogue. I thought that was one of the most delightful thing Fruits Basket did because that character was able to sum up everyone’s feeling for Tohru in a few sentences and also create closure for everything that had happened to all of them. I could not help but become emotional by it. A happy ending might have appeared unrealistic, but after everything that the characters went through, a happy ending was the only thing I could imagine for this manga in order to be 100% fulfilling.\nFurthermore, almost all the side characters (with a few exception) gets the chance to fall in love and have their story told. And for some preternatural reason, those stories smoothly connected with main storyline. At the end, just like any shoujo, love conquers all!\n3) Fruits Basket actually felt as if it was planned from the very beginning. I can’t help but admire Natsuki for using so many literary techniques to foreshadow the ending. Sometimes, it was impossible to even recognize all the clues she gave about the characters and story until it finished and was read the second time. I have also noticed that Natsuki used humor to easily disguise some major plot and twist without making anything obvious. I applaud her for making the story go full circle—just like the cover of the books. The first volume had a picture of Tohru to introduce the main character, and the last volume had a picture of Kyoko (the mother) to close the series.\n4) There were numerous lessons in this story. The most significant one is \"just be yourself.\" Although this is one of the most obvious lesson that could be learned anywhere in the world, it probably is the most difficult one as teenagers. In a way, this manga was a coming of age story; the characters wanted to fit in and become comfortable with who they were. However, they were too busy comparing their own pain and suffering with the rest of the world that they could not accurately be who they were meant to be.\nAnother lesson I learned was that traumatized people can be the most empathetic. The first people that we as humans are introduced to/interact with in this world are our parents. And when parents are not doing their jobs well, it can easily traumatize the children. In this story, most of the characters are abused by their parents emotionally (with the exception of Hiro’s, Kisa’s, and Hana’s parent). However, what fascinated me was the fact that one of the most imperfect parent created the most perfect child,Kyoko. Kyoko was a trouble teenager, and she was devastated by her circumstances, but it was those experiences that allowed her to raise Tohru, the most empathetic human being alive.\nThere were numerous morals in this story, and the more you read it, the more you’ll discover them.\nCons:\nAs much as I love this manga, there were so many things I found distasteful while reading it; in fact, I probably wouldn’t have read it if I knew all these beforehand simply because the substance of the story did not completely fit the genre/intended audience.\n1) If you watched the anime or read only the first few volumes of the manga, you might begin to assume that Fruits Basket is a fluffy and sweet story of an overly optimistic girl. However, this is not the case. Piles of different emotions will be thrown at you from left to right as you further delve into it. The melancholic atmosphere was always there to begin with, but it simply was masqueraded by the main characters smile and overly exaggerated attitude. Although I do think this was a great quality of the manga, sometimes I could not help but think the shift of the mood was never intended from the beginning.\n2) When we were first introduced to the zodiacs, the animal form of the Sohmas were always censored with clouds. One would assume it was because the story was catered for a certain audience. However, when the horse was introduced to the story, the censorship toned down just a little. A part of me just did not like the inconsistency of that because I was not expecting any form of \"mature\" content especially if it was never hinted at the start. Even Kagura (the female zodiac) was censored when she first transformed back to a human during the introductory of the story… so why change that consistency later on? Moreover, there were some implication of sex. (Don’t worry. it’s not our 3 main protagonist; they’re just too innocent and pure to even remotely know what sex is.) If you’re uncomfortable with that, you might want to bite your lips and just skim those moments where characters are being overly dramatic and typical by accusing/ arguing with each other about who slept with whom. I can’t be the only one who was startled by this shift in Fruits Basket, right?\n3) The art is very subjective. Fruits basket has the classic Shoujo design from its bug eyed protagonist to its floral background in every romantic situation.\nAll the characters slowly grow physically as the story progresses (except Tohru. Starting at volume 8, she became cuter and younger for some odd reason).However, the biggest problem I had with the art was that almost all the characters began to look the same. It became hard to identify the characters at first glance. E.g. Kyo looked like Katsuya and Kureno, Yuki looked like Akito,etc. EVEN PEOPLE WHO WEREN’T SOHMA’S LOOKED LIKE THE SOHMAS’.\n4) A flaw that I noticed about Fruits Basket was that it sped up the storyline at the very end by having a character succumb to an injury. Although it blended well with the storyline, I did not think it was completely necessary to do so. It might have not been a cop-out, but I believe Takaya could have been more creative to bring closure to the series without forcing one last final drama when there were many dramatic moments on the sideline to begin with.\n5) Another thing about Fruits Basket is that it is a completely a heterosexual world. This did not bother me, but I know it may bother some. However, what did irk me was the fact that this story had pseudo-yaoi characters just for plot device purposes. Since I went in reading this manga knowing major spoilers, I wasn’t shocked by any of the red herrings, and I actually thought some of them were very clever and well written.\n6) Incest. Honestly, I do not believe any of the relationships were incestual merely because I put culture into consideration, AND because I believe the Sohmas’ were not actual cousins. Maybe it’s my way of justifying some of the relationships, but I’m on the boat that thinks that the Sohmas were a clan (that’s why some of them don’t even know each other).\n7) Whether you’re reading the official TokyoPop translation or the fan translations, some of the things will appear way off. It’s not noticeable the first time the book is read, but it becomes very obvious when it is read more than once. Natsuki Takaya foreshadows a lot of events, and sometimes things are lost in translation. Nevertheless, I do not think this should discourage anyone from starting this series. Heck, I have not read the original Japanese version of the manga, but I do know that Takaya did apologize once for having spelling and other mistakes. On another note, the TokyoPop English translation of Fruits Basket is no longer distributed in stores, so it might be difficult to even get the official English translation ( I heard it will be translated again soon under a different publishing company).\n8) Lastly, one of the biggest con I believe this series had was that there was a major age gap between two characters that were together. I have a very strong dislike for stories that romanticize student-teacher relationship (teenager-adult relationship). Although the couple were not the main characters, the story of their relationship still snuck up on me. I found myself actually being moved by the feelings and the journey that these two characters went through, but at the same, the other part of me felt guilty and disgusted for reading it further. I know for a fact that I probably would not have read this series if I knew there was even a slight chance of this a student-teacher relationship being possible. I’m mentioning this because some people might abhor this more than I do and might be repulsed by even the idea of it. As for me, luckily I was half way through Fruits basket when this was introduced, and I wasn’t willingly to drop this series because I was already attached to everyone especially the main 3 munchkins\nANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE: There is going to be a sequel to this manga. It is called Fruits Basket Another. The sequel does not need to be read because Fruits Basket in itself was completed. Also, I honestly highly doubt Fruits Basket Another will be as successful as the prequel, but I’ll still read it because I’m sadly a hardcore fan.\nEnjoyment- Fruits Basket is a special manga for me. Despite the flaws, I hold it dear to me because it touches my heart, and it motivates me to want to be better. It is a beautiful adventure to read, and it is very overwhelming as I can never help but cry and smile along with the characters. \nIt gave me butterflies the first time I read it, and it probably will give me butterflies every time I read it again.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="          \n    I love this manga. I was recomended by a friend to read this. At first, the story seems a bit cheesey and seems like another manga.

In the beginning, he seemed annoying but as you learned more about his past, you feel sympathy towards him.\nThe main character Tohru is lovable  but because there are a lot of volumes some parts in between are a bit boring.

I thought the plot was silly and I just avoided it for the longest time. But one day I was at the library, and I saw a DVD set of Fruits Basket. And this was this year, 2014. I knew it was pretty dated, but I was like \"hey why not, I'm more open minded now.\"\n          \n\nAnd I must say, from the first episode, I was hooked. I loved every minute, UNTIL the last episode. I was like \"wtf, that can't be it.\" And then it lead me to read the entire manga series in less than 3 days just so I could finish the story, the beautiful story(: I'm quite disappointed that the anime will never be completely finished, but I am so glad that I read the manga!\nAnyways! >.>\nStory: 10- People who say this is \"plotless\" really needs to analyze what this manga is all about. There are timeless life lessons in this. It's about a girl, Torhu, who's so strong & kind. She's a perfect example of someone who hides pain behind a mask of composure. This story is about overcoming a painful past. Every character has a story of their own, and that is what makes it relate-able in every way. Even Akito (the not so nice person in the plot) has a past, a story, and a dream. :3\nArt: 8- The reason I gave it a eight, was because it's not my cup of tea. But it is pretty old (10+ years) So I give it credit & it is diffidently unique. Every character has it's own lil features ^^\nCharacter: 10- Torhu is my fav female character of all time. She's just so sweet and loving , & she puts everyone ahead of  herself. She's really such an inspiration even if she isn't a real person. I wish I could be as selfless as her(: But the other characters are just as awesome. Kyo is the stubborn one, Yuki is the gentle guy, and Shigure is the pervert XD There's so many wonderful ones in this manga. Not to mention the cute little Momiji!\nEnjoyment: 10- Like I mentioned before, I finished this in less than 3 days. There's 23 vol people XD I couldn't even remember sleep. I couldn't do anything until I finished it. It is truly a beautiful story and I fell in love more and more as I kept reading. I promise you, the ending will leave you feeling complete :3\nOverall: 10-  I recommend this to any fan of anime. (because most anime lovers are also big manga readers) Unless you are me, and only read certain ones. And for a not-so-big-readers, give this one a shot! You won't be disappointed. \n"},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="          \n    I didn't exactly read this that recently (a week or two ago I think), but I really liked the anime of this manga, so I decided to give it a shot (forgive me for being too fond of such genres of anime/manga, but eh, it's what I like so just accept me as I am) :P. Well that and I seem to have picked up a weird transition from being an absolute anime fan ONLY to being a Manga otaku and JPOP aficionado (somewhat)...\nIn a nutshell, it's a story about finding one's purpose in life is, I guess. The central character, Tohru Honda, is the\n          \n        person who connects everyone together in this story (um, obviously), because she fills in a role that other characters seem to have lacked in them (mother figure, friend who understands..etc). In some instances, I guess I could relate in some way to the characters (not to mention I looove the idea of the Sohma family curse heehee!)...But to be honest, Tohru seems just too good to be true so that I feel she''s not as realistic as I would have wanted it to be...I mean, there is a limit to people's kindness ( I would believe)...anyway...\nWhat kept me reading on, past all the cuteness/comedy, is the fact that this manga does indeed tell some parts of life that I, from personal experience can relate to..on some level.\nAnyway, if it interests you..go check it out yourself. I'm quite sure your own perception of it will differ, since some can connect with it on different levels, given personal experiences and all.\nAt the end though...I can't say I'm sad at the ending (it's supposed to be happy after all), but I can't say I'm entirely happy either...eh, oh well...maybe it's just me.\nOf course, that still doesn't change the fact that it was a touching story, in its own way, and I enjoyed reading it (losing sleep for the whole time I did heheh).\nI'm disappointed though at the degeneration of Natsuki-sensei's style here, as the series began to finish up the story, as I had a hard time identifying certain characters after a while, since they began to look generic (alike) because they lacked distinguishing features. I understand however that the reason may well be due to the mangaka's hand surgery, so I let it slide somewhat.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="               \n    Fruits Basket is by far the greatest manga I have read and will ever read. It tops both my manga and anime experiences. So far, I have read 22 out of the 23 volumes, but I can say that it is my favorite with no doubt in my mind. The story is truly a Romantic Dramedy, a love story with extreme drama splitting it apart, but with comic relief intertwined within the pages. \nThe story blew me away with it's deep emotions and feelings. It is the kind of story that makes you experience a ray of emotions, but in the end you still enjoy\n          \n        it. It is only enhanced with the wonderful art, that really helps your own emotions come out as you picture the emotions in the eyes of each character. It is a wonderful ride as the volumes increase, and the characters both look and act older. The details become even more exciting as you think about how the characters have changed from the first volume to the last. \nFruits Basket is not just another manga you should read on the computer. Since I received the first volume, my goal has been to own them all. It is a very deep story that keeps you on your toes, and is even something that you can incorporate into your own thinking process and life. All of the characters have their own unique look, personality, back story, and dynamic changes that make it that much more enjoyable. Over the course of reading, I've laughed, cried, blushed, felt angry, overjoyed, and a rainbow of other emotions. I am proud to say that volumes 1-22 are sitting upon my shelf while my other owned manga stays hidden away in another area. Soon, 23  will be up there to complete my collection. Fruits Basket is amazing, and recommended for anyone who enjoys a dynamic story filled with ups and downs, but mainly ups. Once I finish the series, Fruits Basket will definitely be a manga that I reread, and be one that I pull off my shelf to read as my release.\n        "},

Then, we would learn to see ourselves through that person's eyes and learn to love ourselves.\" -Fruits Basket\nHonestly, Fruits Basket has been my favourite manga series for a while now, and I just unfortunately can't find anything close to it.\nIn case you missed the summary, Fruits Basket is about a young, clutzy, yet optimistic, girl, named Tohru Honda and her life being involved with the mysterious, cursed, Sohma family. Her mother passed away, and she had begun living in a tent, before moving in with the most popular boy in her school, and his\n          \n        cousins, Shigure, and Kyo. On accident, she quickly discovers their secret; their family is cursed, and when hugged by the opposite gender, they transform into animals of the 12 chinese zodiac (+ the cat). As Tohru meets more of the Sohmas, including the other cursed members, she discovers the curse is much bigger than she could ever imagine as heartbreak, sorrow, and corruption consume the family.\nIn the beginning, Fruits Basket seemed like nothing more than a simple romcom, but as the series progresses, mysteries were revealed and solved subtly, and characters were introduced and explained, you're sure to find something to connect with. There are so many lessons and quotes and morals you can take from Fruits Baskets, I found it hitting home on so many occasions. It made me cry more than anything I've ever read or seen, because it brought up points I could relate to and understand. \nFruits Basket did a wonderful job of introducing mysterious side plots and hints for something more, and making sure all loose ends were connected and tied up by the end. \nAnd while it can be tragic and mysterious, it's very funny and light-hearted. I remember laughing out loud or not being able to stop smiling. And the romance, is very cute =^.^= Maybe a bit too shoujo-ey for guys, but everything else is worth it, I promise.\nThe art is a complicated subject to talk about. I really have no problems with Natsuki Takaya's art, but around chapter 36, she began getting criticism for her art because she had to go through an art style change. Her drawing hand began not working and she had to get surgery, and because of this, it was very hard for her to go back to her original style. Towards the end of Fruits Basket, her art begins to change, and some would say it's not as good as her original art style.\nCharacters, this has to be my favourite thing about Fruits Basket. When you have at least 12 members of the zodiac curse to go over, and every other relevant character who isn't cursed, there are obviously a lot of characters, and you would expect some to become forgettable or be unoriginal. \nDespite this, Fruits Basket has a wonderful cast of characters who are so vastly different from each other, and all have traits so... human, that it made it impossible for me to choose just one favourite character, I just couldn't. They're all memorable in their own way, to go over them all would make this review far longer than it already is. \nAs each character comes into play and you learn their story, they all have something to teach us or remind us (Usually with the help of the main character Tohru.). Tohru's deceased parents even get a spotlight. With so many characters and different heartbreaks of their own, you'll be able to resonate with at least one, if not two or three. (Personal faves includes Kisa, Rin, Kyoko, Kyo, Yuki, Hana, Momiji, Shigure, Ritsu, and sweet Tohru.)\nAs for enjoyment, I really can't express how much Fruits Basket means to me. No series has made me cry out of both happiness and sadness so much, laugh so hard, smile so long, or truly connected with me as much as Fruits Basket did. I only wish it was even more popular, and I don't care if the reviews for it all give it a 10 or a 9, because to me it'll always be highly underrated.\nI once joked that I'd recommend Fruits Basket to my parents, and not too long later I saw my mom reading one of the volumes I owned. I can't see a reason why I wouldn't recommend this to someone, even if you usually read shounen or aren't a fan of shoujo romance. If you're looking for something funny; read Fruits Basket. If you're looking for something sad; read Fruits Basket. If you're looking for an unique shoujo, read Fruits Basket. If you've gone through hardships, experienced a heartbreak, and you want an emotionally uplifting story; read Fruits Basket.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="              \n    I wrote this assuming you read the description!\nI gave this series a 10 in almost every category (the category that I didn't was art, because it was admittedly unimpressive at the beginning, but it does improve). It is my favorite story of all time. It doesn't matter if you bring me novels, animes, comics, cartoons, movies, or anything else, because I'm sure this series will rein supreme.\nFrom the outside it looks like your average shoujo series: cute, optimistic, orphan girl living in bishi heaven and knowing something secret about them. But it's not! Natsuki Takaya writes characters that really take flight into a life of\n          \n        they're own. No character is perfect (even miss-goody-two-shoes main character has a few dark secrets). \nThe \"curse\" that the family who's lap she's fallen into is under is no laughing matter. Essentially the curse is simply a social setting within the family, only that the members of this social circle turn into the members of the chinese zodiac (as well as the cat) when they are hugged or bumped into by a member of the opisite sex. As the series goes forward this seemingly silly curse becomes something of dark nature and you see that the people living under this curse have had to give up so much, including love, family, memories, and hope. \nYou see through the eyes of every character from the main characters deceased mother to the head of \"Prince Yuki Fan Club\". This continuous switching of perspective makes it impossible to hate any character completely for the mangaka always seems to be making you sympathize with them. \nYet the series stays lighthearted. It's sweet, cute and hilarious in the weirdest ways. If you give this series a try i can garuntee you'll never regret it!\n"},

I might be a little bias about how good it is simply because it was the manga that started my addiction. But I can back up why it is one of my favorites. Fruits Basket while chalked full of cliches is an endearing story that just touches your heart. You fall in love with all of the characters even the ones whom you hated at first. At first the naivety of Tohru might grind on your last nerve but over time she grows on you and you really support her through all of the\n          \n        trials that she has to go through. My favorite character by far is Kou, he just pulls on my heartstrings and I always wanted to gather him up and sooth all though worries and frustrations away. I honestly could go on and on and give several very detail lists about why you should read this manga but that would take up too much time, so I'll just end this with review say that I highly recommend this manga!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="               \n    If there ever was a story worthy of praise- it would honest, to life be Fruits Basket. \nFor, it is not one of those typical mangas where the main protagonist is a good-for-nothing clumsy [Tohru is clumsy... but never mind that] girl, whose life gets delivered to her lap on a silver platern. No, this is a manga where ones happiness is earned through honest effort, good friends, and the person herself who brings everyone together in the end [because of her personal experiences], Tohru. \nThe way in which this manga is paced, introduced and concluded is brilliantly woven into a story perhaps a bit\n          \n        non-puzzling. \nThe way in which it introduces its characters is peculiar, because it is done in a way that makes all the characters memorable in their own way- I swear, I could possibly name all the 12 animals of the zodiac, and from there describe their individual story. \nIf not remembering their name, I remember their zodiac sign. \nFor it is that unforgetable. \nThe story itself is pretty simple- a girl getting to know about the deep secrets of the Sohma family, thereafter meeting each and everyone of them. Learning about them, healing them and recieving a special place in their hearts. \nWhich is pretty much all she does, and is what pretty much concludes the story. \nThe art is simple, and beautiful. Nothing to flaw about it, because it fits the theme- the seriousness, the silliness, the warmth perfectly. \nSo, who are the characters you ask? \nTohru- a clumsy, air headed girl- whose parents have both died. Because she does not wish to trouble her friends while her Grandpa [who took her in] is gone, she moves into a tent in the middle of the woods. She has a peculiar gift of talking her way [through her mothers words] into others heart. \nKyo- the Cat of the zodiac [though he's not one of the twelve zodiac animals...]. He is shunned by all, and hates Yuki, the rat. He is a rather hot headed, though kind fella. \nYuki- the Rat of the zodiac, your typical kind and conciderate \"prince\". In my opinion- he has a somewhat split personality problem, couse he seems rather cold sometimes [to me at least... I don't like him much -nod nod-].\nArisa Uotani- One of Tohru's friends, a \"delinquent\". Her big inspiration in life was Tohru's mother, and she holds true to that, for she still loves her even after death. She loves Tohru very much, and threatens to beat people up from time to time. \nSaki Hanajime- Tohru's other friend. She is seen as a pretty weird person, and she ALWAYS wears black, no matter what. She can read peoples thoughts and send weird, electrical signals. She also notices that there is something \"different\" with the Sohma people.\nAkito- probably the biggest antagonist of the story. Can't really tell much about this person, because most of it is spoilers. Lets just say, I took a liking to him near the end. \nAnd lots more; including some of my favorites- Momiji, Haru, Ayame [xD], Rin [She comes in a little bit late in the manga, and doesn't even get an entrance in the anime...].\nAmong others, of course.\nThe enjoyment of this series is absolute- whatever the reason for picking it up, it will have you laughing, rejoycing, crying and more without fail in doing so.\nEnjoy reading. =)\n        "},

The manga is perfect for any fan of the anime since it tidies everything up and creates a satisfying end for a great show! \nThe story was great, although at certain times it felt like there was too much going on at once, which made it slightly confusing. But the story was truly accented by the characters themselves, once I stated reading I couldn't stop and I read for eight hours straight because the characters drew me in so much. The relationships within the manga were written\n          \n        extremely well and I felt like any one of the characters could be a real person (well without the curse of course). \nThe art was a bit confusing at times because some characters looked similar which left me wondering who was talking at sometimes but it certainly didn't detract much from the story.\nOverall, I loved this manga and I'm glad that it was the first I read,; it's perfect for fans of the anime or for anyone looking for a wonderful story with awesome characters. I rated it a nine instead of a ten due to the slight problems I had with the story and the art but it is a manga that is worth the read!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="             \n    When I was in middle school I used to rent this from the library, but I never completed it as they didn't have all the copies. Now that I'm an adult I decided to purchase the collector's edition after receiving Barnes and Noble gift card for Christmas. I bought and read the entire collector's edition series in a month. I own a bit of manga but this is the first series I have owned and finished.\nStory: The story is probably my favorite part of this manga. The Synopsis is a pretty good description of what it is about. If you love folklore, fantasy, friendship, romance,\n          \n        and overcoming hardship, this story is for you. The way in which the lives' of all the characters intertwined was truly spectacular. It made me laugh, smile, gasp, and cry. I can't really say what I want without spoiling it, but READ THIS SERIES. The last volumes, chapters, and ending made me quite happy\nArt: This was the first manga I ever read as a child so I have a soft spot for the art. It's not exactly beautiful but still appealing to the eyes. Many of the girls/younger characters are quite cute, and I think some of the males are quite handsome. The author broke her hand in the middle of the series so the art changed sorta drastically after that, but it was very easy to get used to. I personally preferred the older style as there were a few characters that looked too similar after the change and I feel some looked better before, but I know it's not Takaya's fault. Some people think it was better after the change, which I can understand as they matured in style and age throughout the series, but I guess my nostalgic self likes the older style. The colored pictures in the collector's edition books are quite lovely. \nCharacter: There is a plethora of characters in this series, mostly Sohmas, since they align with the animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Even though there are many characters to learn I didn't find it very difficult to learn the names and personalities. Most of the characters in this series have very distinctive personalities, making it quite fun when they interact. Most (if not all) of the characters have been through extreme hardship. Even the ones who seem cruel still make you feel sympathetic for them. I can honestly say that many of these characters make me want to be a better person. Not to spoil anything, but at a certain point in school new characters are introduced, and I somewhat struggled to figure out their names' and stories. I only wish they would have stepped further into the backgrounds of some characters, but the series can't go on forever. The character development is pretty great for most of the characters.\nI spent a majority of this series crying tears of sadness and joy. This series will send you on an emotional roller coaster while telling an interesting story. I can honestly say it's a spectacular manga series and I will probably reread it again and again. I have to give it a 10/10.\n(This is my first review, so I hope it's okay!)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="             \n    Some might say this manga is unrealistic, but it's not supposed to be realistic, it's suppose to give you hope. Most characters in this anime have been rejected, and hurt in every way (physical, emotional, spiritual), but they all some how find a haven in each other's hearts and words.  \n\nI must apologize for giving this a nine, instead of a ten. Everything in this was perfect, except for the fact that it slowed down ALOT towards the end, and felt like nothing but characters screaming at each other about how they can become a better person, and how they wish they were each\n          \n        other and so on...\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="            \n    I'm writing from the perspective of a person who normally watches/reads all of the things with action - vampires, bounty hunters, ninjas. A lot of fighting and no mushy feelings. That's what I typically like. And I thought I'd read Fruits Basket because I thought the anime was really sweet, in that kind, sensitive yet still a little funny way. A cool break.\nThe immediate faults that came to mind were that sometimes the speech bubbles got confusing, not knowing who was saying what and in what order, but it's not enough to really distract anyone, at least I wouldn't think. Also, in the beginning, it\n          \n        appeared to have the same faults as the anime as well. Tohru - the main protagonist - was far to air-headed to truly be cared about, someone who somehow solves everyone's problems yet can't stop crying or being a klutz. Really a Mary Sue character. To stop an abuser with her words? Highly...unlikely.\nHowever, the manga, as I should have known, dug even deeper. The main girl is no longer a Mary Sue, at least not in the later chapters. You see why she gets involved with the cursed boys the most and how she's not doing it to simply be \"nice\" to them, but because of other feelings as well. You see her and so many other members of the cast evolve over their high school years. You see people letting go of what they were dependent on to grow into true adults. You see backgrounds that previously weren't established which brought a whole new light to their dimensions.\nThe one issue I won't forget is when you see the backstory for \"Hana\". Exiled as a sort of witch, given power she can barely control. In a way, it kind of reminded me of Marvel's X-Men. Out of all the heart-warming Fruits Basket volumes, that one chapter is the only one that literally brought me to tears. \nThe artwork and bubble-placement was so confusing for me reading this, but the overall story was outstanding. I'm sorry the anime only got so far in the storyline because there was a lot more for them to deliver. The mere depth of each character is amazing and I'm sure anyone would enjoy this.       \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="               \n    I almost can't write this review because somehow it feels like I'm evaluating something so familiar it defies the boundaries of language. Because that's what Fruit's Basket is to me: home. \nThis is the one manga that i can not only bring myself to but actually CRAVE to re-readto again and again without getting bored. the the story is so multi-faceted and complex that upon every re-reading i draw from it a deeper, richer appreciation, discover new things i never noticed before, or a combination of the two. \nThe reason for this is because there is just so, so, so much going on at the\n          \n        same time in the manga. at first, i'll admit, this was slightly daunting, and i found myself having to really concentrate in the later volumes as the plot became more intense and emotionally charged. but that's the wonder and delight of fruit's basket. character development is not purely concentrated on the main protagonist as it is in many shoujo mangas, but is fully extended for each and every supporting character. although, it may be more accurate to say that there are no supporting roles in fruits basket. every character is a main component or focus of the story, and it is this that makes it stand out amongst a sea of unrealistic, mediocre, badly developed shoujo mangas. this is the success of fruits basket, and why it will remain as popular for years to come.\nnever have i cried with such visceral emotion at the tragedy and unrelenting hope of the characters (such as momiji and kyo- i quite literally bawled my eyes out), and never have i almost pulled my hair out in such frustration at the indecipherable actions of some (*ahem* akito).  the dynamics between the characters, and the genuine bond of friendship between them is so realistic and rich that the characters, the storyline and the manga itself takes on a life of its own, almost outside of the mangaka's interference. \nthis is the sign of a truly great work of art and masterful storytelling- when the story ceases to be just a story, and becomes a mirror of everyday life that explores and challenges the joys and pain of the human condition. for me anyway, it will invariably always be a part of my own development as a person, and i know i will be picking up the volumes countless more times as i grow.  \n        "},

When I saw the manga of Fruits basket I was excited. \nstory.\nFirst of all the first 8 volumes of the manga are the anime are they exactly the same. the writters add some completed story and a final.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    This is the first manga that I think is worthy enough for me to leave a review. Although I like most romance manga, I am pretty strict when it comes to whether the title contains high quality content or not. Fruits Basket is the most beautiful and inspirational manga I have ever read. Even though it is a shoujo manga targeted at young girls, the deep content makes it readable for everyone.  The manga starts off slowly and innocently but as it goes on it becomes deeper with dark themes of psychological and physical abuse, abandonment, and the real darkness that goes with the\n          \n        curse that at first seems not so bad. It shows you that the flaws and wrongdoings of humans, although inexcusable, are not without a reason, purpose, or cause and that everyone deserves another chance. Torhu is a character that I think everyone will come to like and even aspire to be even though she is a fictional character. With detail, the background of the suffering each character has gone through is told and how they overcame the darkness surrounding them. I don't think there will ever be a manga written as beautifully as this one. If you are looking for a manga that contains solid romance, serious drama, and something that will make you want to change as a person, Fruits Basket is for you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="              \n    Story: I also found this manga in my high school library, and my friends highly suggested it. They were right. It had to be one of the best mangas I ever read as well. So what's the story? Well, with her parents both dead, though she was much closer to her mother, Tohru lives alone in a tent in the wilderness as she continues going to school like a normal teenager. She remembers how her mother used to tell her stories about the Chinese zodiac and the cat that was supposed to be in it, but the rat didn't tell him about the feast and\n          \n        the race the king held. Little did she know that the story was actually true. She comes across a house in the middle of the forest that is owned by three men: Shigure, Yuki, and Kyo, who share the last name, Sohma, even though they are not related to each other whatsoever. The reason for this is because there is a curse placed on them. Whenever a human hugs each of them, they will turn into an animal in which the year they were born from the Chinese Zodiac, with the exception of Kyo, who transforms into the mysterious cat. Shigure is the dog, and Yuki is the rat, which is why Kyo hates him so much. Tohru finds out there are more than just they who belong in this \"family,\" and the longer she stays with them, the more she finds out their dark secret. They say this is a romance shoujo manga, but I wouldn't really consider it. Yeah, the main character is the girl, but that doesn't make this shoujo really, so there is sort of false advertisement. 10/10\nArt: The art style is very old because this series was created in 1998. As the story progresses though, the styles does get more modern. This used to turn me off a little, but I just learned how to deal with it. Hell, I couldn't even read through Bleach I was so turned off. Still, the age of the art doesn't really stop me from reading it. It's just the way it is. The art still gives the characters personality, and the story is still told from this. 8/10\nCharacters: Because there is each member of the zodiac in here, plus Tohru's parents and friends, there are so many characters in here, there are more than I can even count. However, let me tell you about the ones who are going to be the most important in the story. Tohru, of course, is believed to be the one who could help break the spell of the Sohma family. What she has to do is to befriend all of the members and get them to trust her, even the head of the family, who is not so easy to please. Yuki and Kyo are the key players in Tohru's life because they were in it before she even knew about it. Yuki is an admired person at school, but Tohru and the rest of the Sohma family are considered to be his real friends. He finds it very hard because he was mostly isolated (you'll understand why in the manga). Kyo is very nasty because of the cat's past, but you can easily tell that he loves Tohru more than anything. Kyo also has a very terrifying power as the cat and has an alternate form that Tohru is not afraid of. He also knew Tohru's mother, but that will be explained once you get into the material. Okay, this guy is not that important but my favorite character is Momiji. He's half German, half Japanese, and his zodiac is the rabbit. Momiji is so full of energy and he's adorable as Honey in Ouran. Actually, even though I can't list every character here, each one has his or her own personality, and that is what makes each character interesting. There are no copies or anything. It's pretty cool once you think about it. 10/10\nEnjoyment: I was so into it that I just took out every single book from the library on the same day. I read this much faster than Gentlemen's Alliance or Kitchen Princess. And I was very upset when I got to the 23rd volume. It was just so good. I can't wait to watch the anime. Was it funny? Yes. Did it give me what I wanted? Yes. 10/10\nOverall: You need to read this and watch if you haven't already! The score is a rounded 10 out of 10.\n        "},

I've read the whole thing at least 7 times and still enjoy the whole thing. All of the characters are great, with purpose and goals and dreams of their own, stuck by a curse that limits their basic human interaction. If the last few chapters of this manga don't make you overjoyed then i don't really know what will, having character you've seen go through some of the most difficult events in their life only to break out of their pain and\n          \n        find happiness is the best thing ever.\nLet me tell you something about Fruits Basket, this manga takes a family and puts a curse on them that makes them transform into animals of the Zodiac every time they touch a person of the opposite sex, which sounds really funny until you realize most of these people just want to live normal lives, and cant. \nEven the person who plays God is truly a sad person that just wants to be happy but cant because of this age old curse that wasn't intended to be a curse.\nSeeing all these characters work through their problems and overcome their curse is heartwarming and the backstory on the curse that started all of this is my favorite thing in all manga, now i want to go read it again.\nAnd as a side note: never, EVER watch the anime adaptation, it is terrible and stops at the worst point for no reason and gives no satisfying ending to anything\n        "},

The story line is way more than this girl meeting this cursed family. I really didn't expect it to get so deep. Like I said, when you first start it, you think it's simply cute. But man, it starts to get intense. The plot thickes and there are lots\n          \n        of shocking twists. \nThere's a lot of character building, too. You can clearly see the reasons the characters act the way they do, and then what makes them change and mature.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="          \n    This manga is what you'd call a mixed bag.  Those of you who have read it know what a mean.  There are many different issues, themes and such all mixed into one and it makes for a truly wonderful combination.\nThis series has few flaws, and small ones at that.\nAll the characters were good, more or less, exept for maybe Kakeru, Yuki's \"evil friend\".  I think the series would have been better if he wasn't stuck in there.  I think he was an eyesore and a very bad example of the kind of friend somebody should have.  \nThe head of the\n          \n        Sohma family, Akito, was more likeable as the series goes on to almost every extent, but for a while when I was closer to the end, Akito wasn't too appealing to me.  I think this may have been caused by a bit of a shock revealed in Volume 17.\nThe art of this manga is pretty good, although like pretty much any manga, there were parts where it could have been better and would have been more appealing to look at.  \nI laughed quite a bit at different parts of the series, from beginning to end.  There is plenty of comedy, and good comedy at that.  It never gets into the really gritty comedy you sometimes see on modern-day American TV shows and the like, and for that I am greatful.  Clean humour is the best humour.\nAs the characters begin to tell us more of their story and their pasts are revealed, it feels more and more like a veil has been pushed away from your face and you can see clearly.  Pieces of the puzzle that were there at the beginning of the series lock into place with the new things to put everything together.\nI'm sure it's impossible for anybody not to go through this series without shedding a few tears.  I cried at different parts, but the one that got me the most were the last 2 or 3 pages of the last chapter.  It got me.  The ending was so beautiful and happy, I couldn't help it.  I felt my self thinkg \"Oh my god.  Oh my god.\"  It was a surprise, yet great.  \nHowever, a few stones were left unturned at the end, but maybe that's what the writer wanted.  Afterall, this was ultimatly the story of Tohru, not the other characters.\nOverall, I think anybody who hasn't yet touched this series should give it a go.  I can almost guarantee you will like it.  The chapters seem to flow by and you really get to know the characters.  At the end, it feels like letting go of old friends.\n        "},

Fruits Basket is like a rollercoaster that you can't get off of. Having first watched the anime, I didn't have high expectations for the manga, since the story left quite a few plotholes. But then, as I read the manga, I discovered that the anime had to be some kind of OVA. I mean, the anime was a total rip off of this beautiful manga, in my opinion. THe diversity of the story was so\n          \n        incredible that I could NOT stop reading. At a first glance, once you get to about volume 7 or so, you start to think that this manga has absolutly nothing sad and it's just a fun, sunny, happy ending story where nothing bad ever happens. Boy, was I WRONG. Most of these characters' pasts are so devestating and heart breaking that I cried for hours. And I usually don't cry. Period. Near the end, the story got so involved, and so dramatic that I thought my eyes would fall out or my brain would explode or both. ANd with Fruits Basket, the art was so simple and kind of just a step up from stick figures; nowhere near the beauty of Vampire Knight's art. But that's not the point. The simple art becomes appreciated and then you start to realize how much a simple art is needed to tell such a diverse story. If it had beautiful art, such as Vampire Knight, then your brain probably really would explode and you would find yourself thinking that it was too good to be true. \n\nI think I had whiplash from this series. Soo many times was I slapped in the face with a plot twist that I didn't see coming in a million years. This was beautiful. To this day, my favorite manga series of them all.\n        "},

Comedy, romance, and magic, everything is placed in one good, refreshing manga. But I can't lie.. it really is\n          \n        a bit rushed. I really hoped for a good ending which I had but then I really want to know about what happened to the other characters.. anyway, just read it and you'll understand what i mean.\nART (8)- In the first few chapters the drawings are a bit cute, detailed and it had a few pencil strokes that really give off a true manga feeling then after a few volumes.. all that art changed. I think because the author had a problem with her hand or something but anyhow I didn't really mind, in the end I concentrated on the story, the comedic acts of the characters and lastly the emotional parts in the manga.\nCHARACTER (10) - Yes, A PERFECT 10! Each of the characters had a sort of funny side as well as their dramatic side. It goes to show that not all characters are perfect, they have problems that will affect their life, their emotions and how they could deal with other people just like us.\nENJOYMENT (10) - It really did gave me a piece of entertainment. Something that made me addicted. The laughs, sorrows, learning I shall never forget each of them after reading this manga. It tells you that even if you fall you could still learn how to get back up and when you meet other people they will be the ones who will help you.You'll never know if you never try.\nOVERALL (9)- Yes not every shoujo manga is perfect. SO what if this is an old manga.. I never cared. I only care that this manga really changed who I am and what I can become. It showed me that even if you are a typical simple girl you change the world if you just believe and if you just don't hesitate in showing what you feel. Sometimes it's okay to let it all out because that way... THEY WILL KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.\nBut then this manga.. really needs more chapters... WHY?! WHY IS IT SO......\nNo I'll be a spoiler..\nOkay... I've managed to calm myself a bit from saying something very stupid by being a stupid spoiler... so here it goes FRUITS BASKET.. a must read manga! \nI HOPE YOU READ IT! :)\n"},

What stood out to me when I picked up these books, though, was the beautiful art style. Each drawing is breathtaking and really shows the emotions of the characters well. \nEach page is packed with dialogue too. It takes me about 45 minutes to get through one volume, about the same time it takes me to read a chapter in a novel.

I can remember every character and their story. Maybe it's because they all have a different story to tell, most of them are very sad. \nThis manga is very emotional, and very sad. After I finished this, I bawled my eyes out. When I read it a second time, it was a lot easier but it still made me sad. It has it's funny moments (some are down right hilarious) but the pain that each character goes through really hits close to my heart.\nFruits Basket is a must read. Outstanding art, outstanding story, characters, and overall? A masterpiece.  \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="           \n    Story [7/10]: I really enjoyed Fruits Basket, but I felt that their were too many side stories going on at the same time. All the relationships, Yuki's student council stuff, problems with Akito, it was all too much and I was a little overwhelmed at times at how much was going on at once. \nArt [9/10]: Everything was really well drawn and beautifully detailed. My only complaint is that in the later chapters, I felt like Tohru didn't really look like Tohru anymore. I got her and Machi confused all the time if it wasn't said who it was right away. Maybe this was due\n          \n        to the author's hand injury, but it was just something I noticed. \nCharacters [10/10]: The characters are so wonderful! I can't say I hate anyone. I love that they're just normal people (well, except for the fact that they turn into zodiac animals...), and there are no bad guys trying to take over the world. I love how human everyone is. All of the characters' reactions to everything that went on throughout the story seemed realistic and relatable. My favorite part of this manga, easily. \nEnjoyment [9/10]: It took me a while to get used to the manga-style (it was my first manga!), but once I did I flew through it! I usually like a lot of romance, but I felt like Furuba does it wonderfully so there doesn't need to be people kissing every chapter. I wish I would've read it from a paper volume rather than online the first time around, though!\nOverall [9/10]: A really wonderful manga. I really recommend this one to anyone who has a lot of time on their hands because it's pretty long. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="              \n    --Five Spoiler-Free Reasons Why You Should Read the \"Fruits Basket\" Series-- \n1. Characters. \nThe characters are really wonderful. There is a large cast of characters in this series, and yet Takaya gives each of them (not exaggerating here) a great amount of depth. Readers will become personally invested with all of the characters in this series. \n2. Story. \nAlthough the publisher puts this series in the \"romantic comedy\" genre, it really doesn't fit neatly into any specific category. I was quite reluctant to read this series because the label said romantic comedy, and well, I'm not very fond of romantic comedies, to say the least\n          \n        (I much prefer some dark, gritty action and violence :]). Takaya herself describes the series as a sort of \"domestic drama\", which is a pretty good, though not all-encompassing way to put it. This story has moments that are hilarious, touching, heartbreaking, and uplifting. It'll go from being really funny in one chapter to really dark in the next. It's a story that was written for the sake of being a story (if that makes any sense), without worrying about fitting it into any particular genre/category. \n3. Complete, focused series. \nThis series is short (for a manga series, that is), only 23 books long. Everything that happens in the books is important by way of characterization, character development, and plot. This is not an ongoing series, in which the author keeps writing books as long as they keep selling. With how popular this series was/is, Takaya could've dragged the series out a lot more if she had wanted to (much respect to her for not doing that though). \n4. Better than the anime. \nIf you liked the anime, you'll love these books (but watch out; if you read it, it might lessen your enjoyment of the anime). I liked the anime, but the manga really is much better in my opinion. The characters are all a lot deeper in the books (as usual :P). I think that Tohru in particular comes across as a bit \"preachy\" in the anime (though not at all in the manga). The story is also incomplete in the anime, since it only goes through the first eight books or so. \n~4a. Side note about scanlations. \nI wouldn't recommend it. When I first became interested in the series, I tried finding some good fanscans online, but the only ones I could find were riddled with confusing and inaccurate translations. If you want to read this series, but money is an issue, then I'd look for used copies of the books. Keep an eye on Amazon and Ebay for some good deals on used copies (that's how I got my set). \n5. The hype is there for a reason. \nI was hesitant to try out this series because of all the hype around it. But hey, in this case, it's there for a reason. You should give it a try if you're at all interested.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    Fruits Basket is one of the manga that you can read over and over again and realize new things with each reading while never getting tired of it. It is by far my favorite manga. It has the unique ability to make a reader feel achingly sad and yet unbelievably happy at the same time. \nStory: The story centers around the juunishi, or members of the Chinese zodiac, and a high school aged girl, Tohru, when she happens to stumble into their lives. The juunishi live a dark cursed life that they hide behind fake smiles and laughter. Over the course of the 23 books,\n          \n        the author shows you Tohru's effect on them and how they come to love her and open up to her and others. The books build on each other, always keeping the reader strongly engaged and picking up the pace of the action with each volume. The story is dark and sinister and surrounded by death and yet manages to leak happy light that becomes the reader’s focus with only a bit of darkness on the periphery so that while you read the happy story you are all too aware of the darkness lurking in the background. The interconnectedness of the back stories for each well developed character enhance the feeling of a web of shared mystery within a well developed universe. \nCharacters: This is the best part of this manga. Each of them is unique and so well developed that the reader loves them with all of their challenges and sometimes even unattractive characteristics. \nthe quiet and selfish rat who wants more and whom people admire\nthe cat who is quick to anger yet people are drawn to him\nthe ever indifferent, carefree and scheming dog\nthe loveable happy hyperactive bunny who is deeper then he seems\nthe bi-polar cow who is calm and understanding one moment and insane the next\nthe calm, collected, and much nicer than he seems dragon\nthe loud boar with too many emotions to handle\nthe over dramatic snake who enjoys talking\nthe brooding horse who has a bit of a one track mind but cares deeply\nthe ridiculously annoying monkey\nthe shy and adorable Tiger\nthe obnoxious sheep with an overdeveloped ego\nthe reserved and kind rooster\nEach of the character's individual stories grow and develop with the over all story too.  THeir own stories take on a life of their own and blend together with the main story line.  The best part is, they all tie up their stories. \nI was especially drawn to the way the characters interacted together. The juunishi have a strange sort of relationship. They have known each other their whole lives yet hardly ever saw each other before the manga begins. They share a mysterious and compelling bond. The way they act together made me want that kind of relationship with friends. The kind of relationship where you can just walk in unannounced to a friend’s house or go to a summer home together. They are comfortable with each other in a way that doesn't seem possible without the mystery they share. No matter how glamorous or fascinating each of the juunishi is, they all depend on Tohru in their own way. They all have something she can give them by just being herself. \nArt: I've always been impressed with manga artists because of how much art adds to the story. Now not only are you getting the words like in a novel, but you see the expressions on the faces of the characters. You see their body movement and their styles. Imagination is spectacular, and I love reading and picturing the characters of novels. But I can't help but be jealous of the skills and talents successful manga artists (like in Fruits Basket) have. You get something extra from seeing the sad smile, or the irritation, or the ecstasy on the characters’ faces. I especially love the clothing in Fruits Basket. Momiji's clothes in particular can always make me smile and wish I had clothes like that. The clothes, and hair, and eyes of all the characters really help to finalize their personality. Along with Momiji, Haru and Rin have great clothes that give them character. \nThe other thing Takaya Natsuki does really well is develop the characters over time. It took 7 years to finish the series, and her style changed a bit, but it fit because of the characters growing up through high school. You can actually see the characters getting taller and their faces filling out as time passes in the story.\nEnjoyment: I LOVE this manga. It will never get old. It can always make me happy. \nOverall: Fruits Basket makes me incredibly depressed and overwhelmingly happy at the same time. It always manages to cheer me up, even just thinking about it, and it also is one of the most depressing stories I've ever read. But don't get the wrong impression about the story and think that you should only read it if you like depressing stories. That's not true at all... perhaps the best way I can describe it is to say that it makes you aware of how bad things could be, and that is what is depressing. It makes you aware of a whole other life and way of living and then shows you that even that can be okay. I love this story because it really brings out the \"other side of the rainbow\" idea. It is spectacular at cheering up. \nFruits Basket is a very special manga that makes you really think about your life, your family, your friends, your future, your happiness. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="             \n    Let me tell you something about Fruits Basket.\nYou learn a LOT from this manga.\nI am SO glad I decided to read this manga. I don't think I have loved a manga so much before. The amount of tears I've shed for this manga is unreal but I have no regrets whatsoever because it was SO WORTH IT. I would gladly shed a whole ocean for it if it were possible. \nI am in pain. But it is a good pain.\nI'm just saying that the moment I thought \"Which manga should I write a review for?\" I instantly thought of Fruits Basket. \nHow do you know\n          \n        if you'll enjoy it??\nIf you're an angst enthusiast (like me), sign up now. \nYou'll also enjoy it if you like slow developing types of love. \nIt's not the type of romance that gives you butterflies, but the type of love that warms your whole being up. The one that makes you say \"I want to fall in love with someone, slowly. And when I realise it, it's already too late.\"\nThis manga is, and forever will be my favorite manga. The way Honda Tohru spreads love and kindness in the manga really affected me and made me want to try being a better person. The art might not be very good, but it is a manga that had made me laugh, felt warm inside, and made me flood my room with my tears (from joy and sadness). It is a manga that made me feel all three at once.\nThe character development is amazing as well. You can see the character's behaviours changing. \nI hope that you'll read it and understand that sometimes what cannot be said and expressed on a review must be felt.\n\nStory\nIn my opinion, is pretty original. Before furuba I've never come across a manga even touching the topic of the zodiac signs. And, most of the time, trying something new isn't good. However, it worked out for this manga.\nThe starting is good, got me hooked immediately. The in-between is pretty consistent, it doesn't suddenly go downhill unlike some manga which starts off really well but ends really badly.\nThe ending is one of the endings which I cried out of HAPPINESS. I rarely do that. The only other manga which I cried out happiness of was \"Hana to Akuma\". (I recommend it!!! It's really good!) \nArt\nThe art isn't EXTREMELY well done. You don't get the slim ankles and normal well-defined bodies like in the \"normal\" mangas, but the story does make up for it. \nHowever, you get used to it after a while and it somehow becomes appealing. \nCharacter\nMy favorite part of a review where I can diss and curse characters!!!! \nEvery character is drawn exactly how they will act. Like, you see Tohru and you just KNOW she's going to be a pure cinnamon roll. And you see Kyo and you just KNOW he's the wounded type. I guess this kind of overlaps with the art category but I felt like it's more appropriate to be in character.\nAnd when you see Akihiko you know he's the type you will beg not to approach the other characters.\nOther than the way they're portrayed, the way they have their goods and bads even out the entire story and accumulates to how the manga became a masterpiece in the end. It all connects and slowly builds up to become a masterpiece. Get what I mean?\nEnjoyment\nBinge read it!! Then regretted it later on because there's no more. \nOverall\nAmazing, amazing, amazing. I know it's one of my earlier mangas that I've read, but I know that none in the future can ever beat this one.\nI hope this review helps you!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="            \n    Well, look at me, breaking my own rules... I stated in my little profile blurb that I didn't think I could ever rate something using the highest OR lowest rating. And while I'm sure I could find some flaws in this series if I went looking for them, I am entirely satisfied with the manga for Fruits Basket. \nCan it be a little cheesy? Of course. I love this series, but not even I will deny that. But I'm not gonna lie... I'm a sucker for the types of stories (like this one) where there are more than enough sad backstories to go around. But\n          \n        that's one of the things I love most about this series: I can't think of a single character who was overlooked. Even Tohru's 'normal' friends and Yuki's fellow student council members have their place in this story. And they don't seem overshadowed by the magic element. \nIt certainly helps that I've always had a fascination with fables and folk tales and things like the Chinese Zodiac. But it was really the characters-- not the curse plot-- that shined here. And it's a bonus that I support every single canon pairing. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="           \n    Fruits Basket is a truly wonderful story, it makes it's rather outlandish premise believable and interesting, the romantic story is very sweet but doesn't dip into sappy territory and the characters are quite unique and distinct.\nThe thing that stands out the most is the characters. They have somewhat cliché exteriors, but there are quite complex personalities and motivations lurking underneath that get revealed as the manga goes along, especially the leads. I was particularly impressed with Tohru, I never thought that your average anime/manga ditz could be so interesting. The main plot is also very interesting, with themes of love, loss and redemption. It's very\n          \n        sweet, and I really liked the ending.\nThere is a very large cast, 3 main leads and at least 15 supporting and assorted minor characters (that's off the top of my head, there's probably more). Natsuki Takaya does a marvellous job of giving every character a decent amount of time, each with a backstory and secondary plot that gets resolved.....I can't think of one that didn't get resolved in a manner I did not like. There were occasions that the story did make the happy to sad transition rather quickly that it was a little jarring, but on the whole the jokes and serious stuff are quite well balanced out. A couple of the plot devices did feel a little contrived, but they didn't look out of place.\nBut having such a large cast means that it can be difficult to follow what's happening to or with who, and it isn't helped by the fact that some of the character designs are very similar. There were quite a few occasions where I had to do a double take (like 'how the hell does Kimi know Rin?....Oh, wait, that's Kagura). But on the whole, I did like the art. Natsuki Takaya gets better as the series goes along, and she does a good job of changing her characters as they grow older.\nI think I would reccomend Fruits Basket to just about anybody. I think it has something to offer to everyone, not just a romance story.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    Fruits Basket is a wonderful manga that can and will appeal to many types of readers.\nI have finally finished all 23 volumes and can safely say its one of the best stories I have encountered.\nThe story starts with more comedy and semi romantic tones but the reader soon discovers that there is more to each character than meets the eye. I specially like the transision from comedy to more serious matters because it was smooth and didnt feel forced. I also believe that at one point in your life you can relate to a problem or situatuon the characters encounter and its a refreshing feeling\n          \n        to find 3dimensional characters that deal with the situation to the best of their capabilities.\nThe art is very much the style of Takaya sensei but if I may say it feels more polished. The expressions are well delivered and suck you in and it doesnt need the over cuteness you might find in a shoujo manga.\nSettings are also well drawn and certain moments between the characters are absolutely endearing\nThe characters go through transitions throughout the manga whether they grow or have longer hair, there is always something to notice. But its not only the physical that changes but also the psychological. Nothing is really what it seems in Fruits Basket. There is always a reason for things and its amazing how you go changing your own opinions on the characters as the story goes.\nOverall I think that whoever who reads this manga will enjoy it and will be left with a warm fuzzy feeling. \nBe it that you relate to the characters or the situations, its a well told story that will surely leave a mark on you.\n---Repeat the good, the bad, do it all and pile on the years-----\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="              \n    Before I say anything, Fruit Basket is truly an amazing manga. You may think the story sounds all happy but as you read, you realize it isn't like that at all. It's actually a serious manga (with some comedy to top it off and lots of romance). The characters, all of them, had this sort of past and suffered from it. They struggled and made mistakes but in the end, they were all able to have their own happy ending. You grow to be attached to characters after all that passed.The only characters that you do grow to hate are their parents (xD). Don't be\n          \n        fooled by their appearances, even the most happy one can have a really sad past. For example, Tooru is so much more than she looks. Even she has a past that dwells in her heart.  The art, I must admit, I thought it looked really old style at first but it was cute. But as the series went on, it became so beautiful. And the story is so much more than from it looks. Everything was so simple then turns into a complex situation. Everything was changing. The atmosphere wasn't as cheerful as before, characters were changing, secrets are revealed and more characters are crying. I guarantee Fruit Basket will have you all over the place. It has comedy, romance, it's a bit supernatural due to their situation and drama. Everything you could want. Trust me. It's good.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="          \n    I'm going to be honest when my friend recommended this anime to me, I watched it completed it and was completely bored out of my mind.\nIt wasn't until later when I started reading the manga to a little girl that I started getting interested in the actual story plot. What's great about reading the manga over watching the anime is that the story plot moves faster.\nNot only that but the manga is actually completed compared to the anime.I personally found the anime missed some of the best parts that can only be read in the manga. There is more romance, and drama in the manga\n          \n        and you get to meet the complete set of zodiac animals while the anime is missing some. \nStill when you compare this manga to other shoujo manga I won't lie to you it is still more slow paced. But if you are the type of person who enjoys making a connection with characters and likes a dramatic amazing finish, I would say to put up with the slow start. Because by the time you finish the manga you're going to wish there was more to read. \n\nThe only serious complaint I have with this manga has to do with the ending, which I don't want to spoil for you. But I will tell you that it only deals with one out of like the billions of different characters, so you don't have to worry much. \nEnjoy it! Read it rather than watch it, is what I say. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="             \n    Okay, so I will start off with saying that this was my first manga ever. I've reread it several times since then, but it still has a certain nostalgia attached to it that I will try to bypass in this review. Feel free to take my scores with a grain of salt.\nStory (10): Tohru Honda is an orphan and a typically hard-working shojo manga heroine who finds herself living with the Sohma family (for reasons I won't get into here, it's not that important anyways). She gradually discovers that the Sohma family has a secret: a curse. 13 family members, the 'Juunishi', have been cursed\n          \n        with a particular sign from the zodiac, and when hugged by a person of the opposite sex, they turn into that animal. Put that together with the fact that Tohru is living in a house with two attractive boys her age, you expect a cute love triangle and a cast of adorable supporting characters, right? Wrong. Takaya almost uses this expectation to her advantage, as the characters who begin so one-sided and simplistic suddenly reveal depth through their backstory or their actions (there is, however, a love triangle). The 'curse' is aptly named. Best of all, once you re-read it, you realize that Takaya has been hinting at the ending and certain plot twists throughout the series, long before she reveals them (through use of reoccurring symbols and dialogue). Even after several re-reads, this story is still excellently done.\nArt (9): Takaya DEFINITELY improves throughout her journey (comparing the first book to the last book is shocking). There will be a few awkwardly drawn joints, and the characters are rather out-of-proportion in the first few books, but it is manga, so it doesn't detract from the storyline. One of my absolute favorite things Takaya uses is space: her panels are impeccable, and there are more than few instances where I have paused just because the panels have been so striking (mild spoilers: when Kyo thinks (about Akito and Tohru) \"Is he using her?\" comes to mind). Overall, her work is very very well done. \nCharacters (10): This is what makes this series so lovable. Every character, even those you don't think are interesting (see above) become slowly 3-dimensional. You will love them, cry about them, hate them (I don't know if I've ever hated a character more than a certain character in Furuba), and gradually think of them as a family, albeit an extremely disfunctional one. They are so well written, and they're what make this series so worthwhile. If you read this series for anything, read it for the characters. If storyline is a 10, this should be a 12.\nEnjoyment (10): Even after reading so many manga and watching so much anime over the years, this is still in my top three. I honestly believe that I changed to become more like Tohru after reading this (I read it at a fairly impressionable age), and I still love paging through it. It should also be mentioned that, while giving the reader a wonderful storyline and great life lessons, Fruits Basket is funny - surprisingly so. I've been reading Fruits Basket in public places and had people turn to look at me because I was laughing aloud.\nOverall (9.5; I rounded down for my official score): The only reason this isn't a ten is because I'm sure that I've been influenced greatly by my nostalgia and love of the series. That being said, I truly believe this series is one of the best I've ever read. I wholeheartedly encourage you to read it, and buy it if you can (it is out of print now). I hope you enjoy it!\n        "},

Tohru is innocent and a do-gooder, and while at first that's annoying, she does grow up quite a bit throughout the story and her personality becomes very endearing. And due to the necessity of a full Zodiac, there's a massive cast of incredible characters. Each one has a backstory, a distinct personalities,\n          \n        and there are some relationships and characters that are incredibly unexpected but marvelous.\nThe plot moves along slowly but surely, but it's mainly driven by the characters themselves more than a \"story\" on its own. But that's what makes it so wonderful. It's seamlessly realistic even with the magic animal thing thrown in. You'll love this manga from start to finish, and you would be heartbroken when it's all over - except for how fantastic the ending is.\nThe art is exceptional, but a little shaky at the beginning. Takaya Natsuki really gets into her stride mid-manga, and that's when it's just marvelous. One great thing she does is age the characters throughout the multiple-year timeframe of the series. Because it takes place over a few years, there's so much room for character growth, and Takaya Natsuki takes advantage of it all.\nA really, really amazing manga. Read it. Now. You won't regret it!\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="              \n    Fruits Basket's is defiantly one of those rare shoujo mangas that appear once in a while.\n Well thought out; not wasting time on scenarios that don't develop the plot or characters; and a satisfying journey from start to end.\nStory: 10\n You only really realise near the end that everything in Fruits Basket was planned from the start, and including a lot of foreshadowing in the beginning. I find this rare in a shoujo, as I find that the managka's appear to be making it up as they go along.\n I started reading this manga at a young age, and found it to represent a journey\n          \n        through youth for both the characters and myself. Life lessons that get you through every day, and lessons for the incredibly hard times.\n I'll admit that I cry like a baby when something like a tragedy happens, but I never expected for me to shed tears over only words alone. That's how brilliant the dialog is.\nArt: 8\n Well, this was my first manga ever, so admittedly the art seemed amazing back then. However, it's not that great at all. The beginning especially but it does improve dramatically.\n However the strength of the art lies in what it conveys without words. Emotions and events can be summarised by just a page of drawings. Words would lose meaning there; it's perfect as it is.\n Although the characters can be hard to tell apart like clones, and limbs seem to be slim and unrealistic, it has great strength in other aspects.\nCharacter: 10\n Another strength of Fruits Basket. They have their interesting quirks in the beginning, which gel well together for good humour. And while I find quirks the best aspect in characters - especially in large casts - what makes them fantastic is that they grow and mature. This makes them seem human. Nothing is black and white, and Fruits Basket shows the grey sides of people better than most shoujos I've ever read.\nEnjoyment: 10\n It's long. 23 volumes long. But it grips you to keep reading. It's not one of those shoujos that continues on forever with random plots and characters. Everything is meaningful, and no chapter is wasted. I have an incredibly short attention span and I finished it, which defiantly counts for something.\nOverall: 10\n Perfect for those who have lost faith in originality in shoujo.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="               \n    I loved almost everything about Fruits Basket, or Furuba. The plot was really exciting with a bunch of interesting side stories and a lot of background information for each character. I love Natsuki Takaya's drawing style and each character is unique but some share similar characteristics. There are a lot of main characters and I've never seen a manga (or anime) series that was based on the zodiac. \nAlthough sometimes hearing about each of the characters' painful history can be kind of disturbing, it's still makes the characters seem more real and alive. I love how each character has a little symbol that represents them\n          \n        and the series proves to be full of unexpected surprises. \nOverall, this is probably my favorite manga series ever and I will hopefully be able to finish it soon.\n-kemmec\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="            \n    I loved this story for a few reasons.\nI loved watching/reading the books drawing grow to become so much prettier. It just amazed me how much the drawings enhanced. Also, I loved how the author often went sooo deep into emotions, this always made the story seem so much more reaqlistic, although its importantly fantasy.\nHowever, I didnt like a couple of things. I felt that the last volume was created for nothing, it was pointless, and they way it ended was kind of disappointing. The characters should have had a more happy ending, for example, like the bunny character, Momiji, I think he shouldve had a\n          \n        better ending. If he couldnt get Tohru, then he shouldve at least got his family back. I think his was the most sad story. I think the author should just make a squel about him, that would be amazing, and lovely. \nBut all in all, the book was great!\nI enjoyed reading every volume (except the last) ^^\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="             \n    I first began to read Fruits Basket when I was but a tender adolescent. Just a few of the volumes had been released then but I had bought every one of them until the 12th one. After that point, I was slowly outgrowing the world of mangas and completely forgot the series before the following volume was ever published.\nI’m 23 now, a year fresh from graduating university, and I had recently returned home to visit my family. My mother had informed me that she had packed up all my old things in boxes and as I was sifting through them, I found my Fruits Basket\n          \n        collection. Nostalgia overwhelmed me and I then decided to reread, and to finally finish, the series. \nThis is not a lie. I still, as I have back then, love the story that Fruits Basket holds. There are definitely some flaws but overall, the way the author weaved this story is captivating. I have not read many Shojuo mangas so I don’t have much to compare with, but I can now understand why this was once one of the top selling mangas back in its day. \nHowever I do want to create this review with a more critical, but still APPRAISING, eye.\nThe Story: 10/10\nThe story, at face value, sounds very cliché. Kind of like this: \"Girl, who recently loses parent decides to live with a few men in a house, but little does she know that they have a big secret and when she finds out, it’s gonna be a whole whirlwind of an adventure! Stay tuned!\" Sure there’s that clever and interesting back story of the Chinese Zodiac and its curse but I remember raising my eyebrow as I read the plot. However, it didn’t turn out that way. The story is simply written beautifully and you’ll quickly find yourself being pulled into it. At its core, it is about forgiveness, growing up, acceptance, and most importantly, that true happiness is found when you love and have that same love returned. Yes, as an older person reading it now, I did find it somewhat annoying that every single person had a tragic story behind them (like a Telenovela honestly), but the way Takaya entwines everything with comedy and lightheartedness makes it bearable and you’ll find yourself bawling at times as the story unfolds.\nThe romance in this manga is also one that is written with as much care and thought; It does not rush through it nor does Takaya just throw the main characters at each other and nor is it predictable. The beginning Yuki x Tohru x Kyo love triangle was first introduced but that completely changes to something more deeper and stronger. Such as with Kyo and Tohru (god bless them), to put it plainly, their love for each other just makes sense. It isn’t like other stories where the author shoves two characters together and force them to make love and have the audience root for them as they fornicate, their love grows timidly and cautiously AND ITS JUST. SO. DAMN. BEAUTIFUL! (Onions everywhere!!!)\nThe Characters: 10/10\nThere are many characters in this manga and you will have your favorites (KYO!!), and your dislikes (Rin), and your don’t-really-care’s (student council people, meh), but that’s the power of this manga. There is a variety of characters with different personalities that play out with each other. I would like to defend our heroine Tohru Honda. Many people hold a deep love-hate relationship with her and I know that my younger-self never really approved of her as being the main character (omg it was Twilight all over again). I thought she was too plain, too boring, too flat, too gentle, too nice of a character to have THAT much effect on everyone she meets. This is of course coming from a raging little girl who thought herself akin to a strong, independent female. Still now, I do not prefer bubbly main characters in novels or mangas, but in Tohru, I find solace. I finally see her value in the story, as that girl, who in herself, is very flawed and needs as much gentleness and kindness and love as all the other characters she befriends. You will find yourself loving her, I promise. \nFor the rest of the characters, they are all very much fleshed out and written about carefully. The persons that they are when they are introduced are definitely not the persons they become at the end of the manga. This is definitely evident on the two main male characters, Yuki and Kyo, but also with our antagonist Akito. I truly did appreciate how each character, even the side ones, had their own personality, yet I also believe that Takaya did not intend this for the purpose of just having a slew of characters to add interest to the story, but instead each one had an effect or addition to the entire story line.\nThe Art: 8/10\nI forgive Takaya for the art simply because the story trumps all the flaws and because her art matures as the manga progressed. However, I was not a fan of the art in the beginning of the series. There is such a thing as too-big-anime-eyes. I also did not like that some characters looked too similar, sometimes I only had to depend on the coloring of their hair to tell some of them apart. I also know that she notes several times that she adores drawing pretty girls, but that hurt her in her design of some of the male characters in the manga. Not that they were bad, I just wish she added more details and finishing touches in her designs when it came to the boys (biceps and abs galore). However her shading and expressions were some of the best I have seen. You can truly feel the emotions, either bad or good or funny, with some of the shading and expressions she put on her characters. \nThe Ending: 10/10\nSatisfaction. Pure satisfaction is all I can say. Read the manga and find out but I guarantee you that you will finish it with a smile on your face.\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="            \n    I first read Fruits Basket when I was in middle school and so nostalgia is in full-force in my judgement of this series.  So fair warning.\nLanguage I read it in: English/Japanese \nStory/Characters:\nThis is a story of abuse and how people deal with and recover from abuse so that they can live, disguised as a whimsical fantasy rom-com.   The tone of the series does shift from a more light-hearted series to a much more serious series towards the end, but the balance of humor and drama is steady throughout and you are really given the time to explore and fall in love with\n          \n        the characters.\nFruits Basket has A LOT of characters, but you are given a chance to learn about each character and most are given a full character arc.  This CAN mean going a whole volume without an appearance by the protagonist but the cast is strong enough that this is never an issue.\nArt:\nThe art improves and stabilizes over the course of the series which was nice to see.  It's not exceptional, but serves it's purpose and never distracts in a negative way so I found it acceptable.\nWarnings:\nThere is a LOT of child abuse in this series.  I think it's done tactfully and treats the subject seriously but if just the thought of it is bad I wouldn't read it.\nAt least one on-screen death, and talk of suicide.  Some stabbing and other violence of that sort towards the end.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="              \n    For people who enjoy shoujo, Fruits Basket is a must-read.  I've been told that for years, but every time I tried to get through it, I had a very difficult time.  I would get through the first few chapters, feel like it was too juvenile and predictable, and tuck it away to try again later.  I must have started it 10 different times.  Finally, I managed to power through the clumsy beginning and get to the heart of what I discovered was one of the most moving stories I've ever read.  The mangaka did a huge bait-and-switch with this series.\n          \n         Either that or she had some traumatic life event halfway through and channeled her pain into her work.  Either way, it's brilliant.  \n>Story-----------------10\nIn the beginning, Fruits Basket gives the impression that you'll go through 130+ chapters just giggling at the heroine's clumsiness and awwing at the the touching moments between her and her apparent love interests.  All of the characters have difficult pasts, but they hide their pain well, even from the audience.  However, as time goes on and their bonds strengthen, you start to get a glimpse of just how deeply their childhood scars affect them.  Despite the supernatural element, this really is a slice of life more than anything else.  \n>Art---------------------10\nClean style without a lot of unnecessary details, which I appreciate.  The characters all had unique designs and were easily recognizable.  I wasn't a huge fan of how angular their faces got as they got older, but that's not something I'd bump off points for.\n>Characters-----------9\nAll of the characters were extremely well developed and had intriguing backstories that interwove with each other.  When you're talking about over a dozen characters, that's really impressive.  The story doesn't solely focus on the heroine or the \"love triangle\", but instead takes a lot of care in making sure everyone gets their chance in the spotlight so that we can understand and relate to them, both as individuals and in relation to the other characters.  It's really a huge accomplishment.\nThe reason I'm rating it a 9 instead of a 10, though, is because I'm picky about my heroines, and Tooru falls a little short for me.  Her main purpose throughout the story is really to help all the other characters find courage through her kindness and generosity.  It's a little cliched, and I feel like she didn't develop as much as she could have because she was constantly existing for other people.  We get a small glimpse into her \"true\" self near the end, and it was very touching, but it just wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been.  \n>Enjoyment-----------10\nI really love this series, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes shoujo or slice of life.  I'll probably be re-reading it at some point once it's not so fresh in my mind because all the twists and turns ended up leaving me a little dizzy, and I feel like I could definitely get something new out of it the next time. \n        "},

It's completely and totally worth it. The story, the art, the characters; everything is beautiful. Fruits Basket really managed to capture a wide range of ideas, emotions, and different themes. \nTakaya does a fantastic job of switching from mood to mood throughout and even manages to capture the growing characters with grace. Fruits Basket is, undeniably, an incredible work of art, and I would recommend it to anyone who asked. \nAnd, yes, the manga is every bit as good, if not better, than the\n          \n        anime. \nConclusion: Worth it!\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="            \n    Fruits Basket is just one of those series that has something for everyone; its kinda like every genre combined (though i do emphasize the kinda). It's funny, it's sad, it's happy, it's got morals, it's got romance. As well as a series i recommend reading, it's also a series i recommend rereading. Oh and though it may suggest stuff (i don't think i need to explain what i mean by that) it's an appropriate manga series for pretty much any age. So if your looking for a good manga i would definitely check out Fruits Basket.\n"},
