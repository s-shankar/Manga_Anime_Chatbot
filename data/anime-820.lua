While Reinhard climbs the ranks of the Empire with the aid of his childhood friend, Siegfried Kircheis, he must fight not only the war, but also the remnants of the crumbling Goldenbaum Dynasty in order to free his sister from the Kaiser and unify humanity under one genuine ruler. Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution. As ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1723, ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This series is overrated on this site. That is to say, with 110 episodes, your vote only counts after you've seen 22 episodes, almost a full season, and those who don't like this show probably won't wait for 22 episodes to decide. \nWhich is a shame, as it's only after about 20 episodes that this series progresses from something that is slow, somewhat overly bombastic, and hinting at more to come to show itself to be one of the most intelligent pieces of anime that's been made to date.\nWhen I say 'intelligent', I don't mean it to be cunning, surprising the viewer with unsuspected plot\n          \n        lines or new angles to view something. Nor does it delve deeply into some obscure theory of science or arts, bombarding the viewer with ideas he couldn't have come up with himself. In fact, there's absolutely nothing in this series that is wholly unexpected or very deep. What it has, though, is a sense of scale that's unsurpassed in any anime - or, for that matter, any television show - I've seen.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes centers around - you guessed it - a bunch of people who, according to populace at large that inhabits the fictional future this series plays in, are of heroic proportions. That is to say, heroic in a very classical sense, being possibly a negative thing as well as a positive. \nThe series is set in a future wherein the universe known to man is divided into two camps, the aristocratic and absolutist Galactic Empire, and the democratic Free Planets' Alliance, who have been embroiled in a war for some time, seemingly\nbeing evenly matched. This balance is shattered when a military genius with a far-reaching ambition rises on the Imperial side, prompting the Alliance to, somewhat grudgingly, give ever greater backing to the most capable officer on their own side. Both men surround themselves with able staff, who become legends in their own right.\nIt sounds like your average hero of freedom-versus-tyrant story, but it turns out to be anything but. First of all, the heroes do have a sense of their own importance, but also the sense to question whether they are all that special, or whether the circumstances of their times have just brought them to a spotlight which people equal to them could never have aimed at. More importantly, the main question on which the whole series hinges remains an open one. This question is the age-old one of which is better, autocracy or democracy, the problem being that a good autocracy is usually better than a good democracy, but a bad autocracy being worse than a bad democracy. Within the happenings of the show, it becomes apparent that, militarily speaking, at least, a good autocracy has an edge over democracy in terms of speed and decisiveness, and this shows in how the series progresses. \nA large part of the series is devoted to showing the war and its subsequent smaller-scale rumblings. The war is fully shown from the side of the commanding officers - one of only a very few shows to do so - and does show an appropriate sense of scale. With battles involving thousands of battleships and millions of men, simple depictions of large-scale tactics take the place of views of the battlefield itself, and a considerable part of the show is, laudable, devoted to discussions on logistics and military intelligence. \nA larger part still, though, is devoted to discussions on politics, all within the greater autocracy versus democracy question. Again, these thoughts never go very deep, but what strikes one is that so very many possible variables are brought up. Almost any motive of rulers or the general populace that might affect a political decision is included at some point in the show, making me at least think to myself: 'They even thought of th&aacute;t one.' The show does tend, here and there, to lean toward the old 'good soldier, bad politician' clich&eacute;, but, overall, it really lacks a clear villain, instead showing each possible side (apart, perhaps, from religious fanatics) from every possible angle. Moreover, all this is shown within a future universe that is highly consistent over the full 110 episodes, even if differences between the warring sides tend to be somewhat exaggerated: in many cases whole societies seem to act a bit too much according to a somewhat radical ideology, only to make their following actions be true to form.\nThis being true to form applies also to most of the actions that, at first glance, seem to be overly dramatical, in the first place many of the actions of the dozen or so main protagonists. However, when thinking about the how and why of their actions, it usually becomes clear that they cannot have but acted as they did, according to cultural mores and individual character. A case in point would be the reliance of many Imperial officers on the character of some military commander to predict his battlefield tactics. This would seem lunacy, until it is remembered that the Imperial commanders are a tight-knit group, mostly of noble birth, and known to each other: each commander would know the peculiarities of all others, which become all the more predictable as the importance of gaining personal glory and honour in battle are taken into the equation. \nThis reliance on known characteristics of all personalities is also possible because the characters don't evolve all that much. Now, I've never understood why 'character progression' in general seems to mean having characters make a full volte-face, and I am, in fact, happy with a series that shows all characters as being fully grown, and fixed in their ways. Each has a specific role to play, and a mind-set that might be predictable, but is, again, true to form. This doesn't make the character shallow. Far from it: their characteristics mean that each takes a single position to a fitting extreme, making for interesting differences between the characters, and accompanying differences in outlook. \nThat said, it is indeed true that the characters may be somewhat flat, and quite a few seem to be included only to show a different point of view toward a specific situation or theory, but it is exactly this relative flatness that makes it possible for them to discuss so many situations.\nAs for the art, it is old and outdated, but that can't be held against the show. It is a shame that, mainly in the first season, the series is at times simply bad: persons walk in an awkward way, scenes are recycled, and even relative positions of facial structures change from frame to frame. There's no excuse for that. Technically, though, the art definitely gets better during the course of the show.\nIn fact, the show being old might be a boon. The creators have opted to make the drawing style relatively realistic, which fits the series splendidly. One has only to look at the manga to see how different it could have been: the style of the manga doesn't fit the show at all. \nReal points have to go to the design. Again, nothing is really innovative, from the spaceships to the almost 19th century looking setting to the uniforms of the soldiers. It is, however, solid, and consistent, and really brings the world to life. \nThe music is outstanding. It mainly consists of generally well-known classical compositions, which, granted, have been often used before, but never have they been used to such splendid effect: especially the use of pieces during battle sequences, fitting the individual scenes to the music, is a joy to watch.\nAs a whole, Legend of the Galactic Heroes never tries to be overly deep, and, though it tends to be somewhat bombastic, never loses itself to any glorification. It is slow and quite meticulous, focusing on a lot of details, and consists for the largest part of dialogue, not action. The story progresses slowly, and only after about a season's worth of episodes the real story starts to evolve. \nAnd this show never, ever tries to evoke an emotional response. The whole series is based on having the viewer have an intellectual understanding of what happens, not an emotional one. There are, thus, no cheap tricks to elicit emotional response, nothing overly dramatic (barring a few strokes of bombast), and no characteristics that make a main protagonist or villain.\nI can only applaud this, considering it a feat to produce such a good series without relying on drama. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, in this sense, the absolute antithesis of my other personal favourite, Le Portrait de Petit Cossette, appealing to the rational side of the viewer, even when the protagonists act with all their vaunted 'foppery and whim'. \n        "},

Lucas's franchise should be renamed to something else.\nIf any work of entertainment in our history deserves the title of 'Star Wars' then it is this anime, and not George Lucas's franchise. This is more star wars than Star Wars ever was, is, or will be. This is star wars. Epic wars among the stars, grand vision with something to say, something to show, all the while consistent narratively, thematically and audially, never pandering to a clamouring fan base, this is 110 episodes of pure sci-fi operatic drama of the highest quality. This is star wars.\nPreferably experienced after watching the prequel movie\n          \n        My Conquest Is The Sea Of Stars, the story of the LotGH OVA pits two systems of living against each other. Two charismatic men. Delving through politics, military, religion, philosophy and media, it is a detailed anime that rarely ever takes short cuts. This means that we see everything play out and are never expected to just fill in large gaps with our imagination. We don’t just see ships blowing each other up, we see the tacticians inside them planning their moves, we don’t just see armies invading planets; we see them deal with the aftermath of restructuring society. There are no short cuts in LotGH, only one long and very entertaining path.\nLotGH is like the anime equivalent of Michael Mann's Heat when it comes to the two protagonists of Reinhard Lohenngram and Yang Wen-li. They are not in each other’s faces with conflict; they are at a distance yet always on each other's minds. Human civilisation as their chess board. They are not protagonist and antagonist. They are figureheads who are almost comrades in their strong resolves to end a terrible war. They are like magnets drawing fate towards them by their personalities alone; then they back it all up with action and propel humanity into a new century.\nYang Wen-li. The great irony of Yang is that he is the historian-wannabe who is destined to make history himself. The anime speaker for Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller's voices. Those two great literary giants of scathing wit and nonchalance. One of Yang's best quotes is the following: \"People may need societies, but they don’t necessarily need 'nations'” He is beyond patriotism or nationalism. He is a conscientious, self-deprecating, charming and laid back man with the humility to feel intense burden and guilt at his actions, even though he tries to take the path of least violence, he is part of a war machine and is directly responsible for millions of deaths. This fact is not lost on the man, and it makes him that much more of anime's greatest characters.\nReinhard Lohenngram, the more romantic fairytale character, with flowing blonde hair, unparalleled achievement, aided by his unwavering childhood friend to rise through the military ranks of the empire with the sole purpose to rescue his sister from the clutches of the emperor, with the additional task of reforming and uniting the entire galaxy as a peripheral duty. Reinhard is not only the most powerful man in the universe, but he's also probably the loneliest. He's a pretty tragic figure that goes through more conflict than Yang, considering the autocratic environment he has to wade through, trying to hold onto his soul as the leader of such a system of living is what’s fascinating about his character.\nThere are dozens of memorable characters all fully fleshed out, even though they're supporting members, the fact that this is 110 episodes long means they all get a chance to shine in the spotlight and develop just as well as the two main figureheads. Many names will be etched in your mind after you've finished the tale, names such as Kircheis, Reuenthal, Oberstein, Mittermeyer, Poplan, Bucock, Schenkopp.\nLotGH might get flak for having the appearance of being a talky and dry anime but that could not be further from the truth. Because of such excellent characterisation, the emotion and drama of this saga is beyond anything in other anime. When characters pass away the sense of loss is palpable, in the same vein of how character deaths in live action cinema affects the viewer, such is the ambition of LotGH in reaching for greatness beyond the anime medium.\n\"Humans don’t fight for principles or philosophy. They fight for the person who embodies their principles and philosophy. They don’t fight for revolutions, they fight for the revolutionary.\"\nPeople fight for Reinhard and Yang. They are pyramids, and underneath them are a large cast of characters that are fascinating, fully developed and run the gamut of good to bad to walking the thin line between. One could argue that the empire has the most interesting group of characters, they get slightly more scenes, they have more skill and cunning, but then the republic is more relevant to the majority of viewers watching. They're more relatable because of the environment they're in which reflects modern day westernised society very well, warts and all.\nLotGH's epicness lies in its relation to reality, in that we can actually believe various situations portrayed in the story can happen; that a group of men and women can band together to fight for equality no matter what the odds.\nLotGH investigates and ponders the virtues and shortcomings of these two systems of living with so much depth, so much impartially, it’s a joy. You're not meant to root for one system because the show doesn’t paint with broad strokes. Whether you prefer one side or the other, both will be populated by characters you like, so not only are you split on an ideological level but also at a basic entertainment level. In fact you're not really meant to root for any side, you're an observer to history being made and repeated. Life is cycles.\nWhen characters talk in LotGH, they talk to each other and not the viewer. For the most part, this isn’t a show stained by one of the main staples of the anime medium, that number one device used by lazy writers to convey information to the viewer: walking talking expositions. This is an anime that is prime material for such characters, who may as well directly stare at the 'camera' and waffle on about what they're doing for the sole purpose of cluing us in. Not so in LotGH, as characters only address each other with information that is relevant to them, not us.\nWe figure out what's going on through character actions, not asinine summaries from them. If they bring up something that they already know amongst themselves, then they discuss it in a relatively coherent fashion and not typically clichéd manner. In short the viewer is never treated like a child, we have to actually concentrate when watching this story because the characters aren’t going to wait up for us or spell everything out with easy words.\nCharacters will admittedly often sum up their situations in LotGH, so we can get our bearings, but it’s done naturally as you'd expect for people in a war situation demanding situation reports, it’s never shoe-horned in. Characters reflect upon experiences a lot, about what they've done, what they're doing and what they will do in the future, so a lot of information is conveyed but the most important fact is that they're talking to each other and not the viewer. You will rarely ever question the intelligence of characters, you will rarely exclaim \"you're so stupid!\" because most of the characters featured in the story are highly intelligent and are already two steps ahead of you. There is no greater viewing experience than watching intelligent people battling each other with everything they've got. \nAnother important aspect regarding exposition is that this show has a narrator who is the replacement for expositional characters. The narrator transitions us from one setting to another very concisely and is an integral part of the anime. If it weren’t for this grandfatherly voice we'd be bombarded by the terrible expositional conversations anime is famed for, but thankfully we're spared that fate.\nAlthough there is a small irony in the fact that in the last season, comprised of 24 episodes, when the animation is at its best, these tropes of anime that have been disparaged in this review begin to surface. With expositional dialogue and unrestrained character body behaviour beginning to rear its unwanted head. Though it’s not enough to detract, it’s still noticeable considering all of the quality and restraint shown previously. Maybe it’s yet another example of how limitations such as low budget can make creativity flourish through determination, whereas abundancy, such as improved animation in the latter half of this OVA, encourages complacency.\nSo LotGH is not perfect. The animation and art are dated, the plot riddled with small holes that would make an obsessive nitpicker sweat. Some scenarios are diluted or presented in a very simple and convenient fashion that betray the ambition and scope of the series. Religion is painted with a broad stroke and not explored much. Some military tactics and operations are unrealistically achieved with very little complications when so much thought was put into them beforehand.\nLotGH simply makes up for all that with pure passion, overriding aesthetics with storytelling and plot holes with historical research. The concept behind the art is solid, the ideas of what the animation attempts to show you are inspired. The plot holes do not negate the story, they can be forgiven for two reasons, the first is that the show is already so full of research and detail that when the viewer spots a periphery hole its almost glaring, and secondly because at the end of the day this is an anime for teens and needs to sacrifice some procedural details for the sake of entertainment given to you at a decent pace.\nNot every little detail needs to be presented to you, because this is entertainment, not a documentary. Except when every detail actually is covered and it is a documentary, but more about that later.\nIf we have to choose between sacrificing plot details/art quality or character details, I would like to think most of us would choose to preserve character. Characters drive the story. An entertaining story with flat characters is not going anywhere. We need to emphasise and connect with depictions of human beings to be fully entertained. LotGH's intelligent characters populate it with so much personality and resolve, so much consistency, there are no clichéd twists and turns from out of nowhere, there are no characters dying and magically coming back to life.\nThere is a real emotional current running throughout the main characters’ arcs, a strong bond of friendship, love and camaraderie that is tested to the limits, and it results in very powerful episodes thanks to dozens of episodes worth of character development.\nAs much as the imperfections mentioned earlier in the review are apparent in the show, they are mostly in the earlier half, but at some point, after the first season comprising of 26 episodes, the wrinkles are smoothed out and the occasional moustache-twirling bad guy or belief-stretching plot-point are erased, until that last season where the wrinkles begin to appear again, leaving us mostly with a viewing experience packed with quality storytelling, tension, intrigue and sustained drama. You will rarely ever question the intelligence of characters, groan at their actions; blink in disbelief at their motives. LotGH stands out from the crowd for its pitch-perfect characterisation and consistent narrative.\nRegarding the art and animation, if you have a problem with sparse architecture, rooms with a handful of chairs and windows, cityscapes with generic skyscrapers and not much else of note; crowd scenes that look like something a high school kid produced with pocket-money budget, then you might have a problem with LotGH. You'd have a problem period, because these flaws are due to budgetary constraints not ineptitude on the art department's behalf. If that irritates you then you're not a reasonable person. You will be placated to know that the art and animation increase slightly over the course of the 9 year production.\nA quirk of the budgetary restraints to the animation results in a restrained 'performance' by the characters which is much welcomed. Another undesired trope of the anime medium is blatant facial reactions to various types of news, and some of them are naturally still used in this anime, but for the most part the characters in LotGH don’t overreact as much as other typical anime shows. When a character gives a damning speech for example, his face is static which serves to make him look even more menacing than if the animators went overboard with their tools and made his eyes bulge, irises smaller and veins pop out his head.\nYou just have to accept you're not going to see pioneering animation and that when a bunch of soldiers go to battle in a spaceship early in the series, there's a reason it looks like five people brawling in a nondescript metallic tube. This is not to say the entire OVA is like this however, as there are still many instances of bold imagery, thousands of ships in symmetry looking like stars is a regular motif, and the space fortresses in particular have a brilliant design with reflective liquid-metal surfaces.\nThe ship designs; save for Reinhard's and a few other empire ships; aren’t cool-looking. They're not sleek pointy colourful mecha; they're ugly blocky rectangles with many holes that fire lasers into your face. The design is pretty blatant: war isn’t the only thing ugly, the tools employed are also. Millions and millions of humans die in skirmishes, let alone giant battles. The cost is so high it’s hard to imagine, but the OVA does a good job of reminding you with visceral scenes of terror and misery.\nSpace battles consist of pre-20th century naval-inspired conflicts, with large fleets manoeuvring into strategic spots and moving in for the kill. Attacks are planned carefully and carried out methodically, with the occasional WW2 aerial-inspired dogfights with smaller jets taking off the cruisers. It’s totally unlike nearly every other space-set anime.\nThis war anime not once glorifies or makes the idea of war 'cool' at all. For all the talk of the Gundam franchise putting a more serious face on war in the medium of animation, it still had a kid piloting a mecha day in day out with funky soundtrack accompanying the action scenes. Not to discredit Gundam at all, as its always laid a huge burden on its kid protagonists, but in LotGH there is no subtle or overt undercurrent to the action, it is what it is: millions of people dying over and over again, mostly to the impartially beautiful and tragic classical score that the viewer can take one way or the other. That is to say, beautiful or tragic.\nChopin, Mozart, Dvorak, Wagner, Mahler, Bach, Bruckner, Brahms, LotGH rarely uses the same piece twice, which is why the LotGH soundtrack box set is massive. 23 CDs total, a behemoth of classical music, an amazing gateway for newbies to the genre, or a greatest hits for veterans. The OVA's soundtrack is timeless, much like its story. There are re-used themes and motifs, but every episode will feature a few compositions not used already. The classical nature of the music heightens the story to epic proportions, the premise is monumental and so should its soundtrack be also.\nAs for the voice acting, featuring such luminaries as Norio Wakamoto, Kaneto Shiozawa, and Toshio Furukawa, it is a classic cast, accompanied by a classic soundtrack. The OVA excels in audio, even if the visuals don’t.\nThere is so much depth that the OVA even has a character watch a documentary about the history of humanity. We observe with him a typical documentary format programme, complete with host, his academic credits displayed beside his name; documentary clips and interviews to supplant his monologue of humanity's actions since the latter half of the 21st century.\nRather than be a gimmick, it’s actually a validation of many of the show's quirks, stylistic choices and script decisions made. It provides more context to the story, shedding light on the backdrop of the saga, and the fact that we don’t even see this, the first of a few documentary-based episodes, until well over 30 episodes into the OVA is a testament to the fact that the writers of the OVA respect us, the viewer.\nThe documentary's content is so full of depth, imagination and epic scope it’s practically an anime in its own right. Indicative of LotGH, that there are so many story arcs or episodes that other anime would stretch into 25 episode series, but they're merely window-dressing in this OVA. Not only is the documentary episode one of the best of the OVA for its rich depiction of a future history, but because of how it changes the dynamic of the entire show, bombarding us with new facts and revelations of how these two systems of living came to be. As such, it is placed where it is with very good reason.\nLotGH isn’t all serious politicking and battling, it’s carried by humour all throughout. A type of humour seriously lacking in most anime; that is to say a type of humour that doesn’t rely on slapstick, the breaking of physics, and lurid sex as a topic. The characters in LotGH are cynicists and realists; their humour is a defiant protest at their situation, the futility of war and all it entails. LotGH's humour is largely through dialogue, not sight gags. Vonnegut, Kafka, Heller, these novelists voices are heard in the mouths of many characters, from main protagonists to random fighter pilots, these men are all fed up of dying for no good reason and blow off steam with witty wordplay.\nThe entire anime is an in-depth exploration of two systems, approached from every direction imaginable, every context; every situation; the ramifications of military, politics, religion and media, of dynasty, lineage and class. It doesn’t lean heavily on one side or the other; both have their pros and cons when looked at objectively. What’s worse, the story ponders: a corrupt democracy or a reformed autocracy? There is of course an idealistic current running through the more relatable characters, those who dream of a universe with peace and equality, of ridding society of corruption and terror. How to go about it of course is up for debate, usually with fleets and bombs.\nLotGH is a 6 year saga charting the 3 thousand year battle of humanity with itself, repeating history's mistakes and endeavours. When a character mentions something that happened six years ago, you actually remember the recalled event, because that’s how long the story is. You feel immersed in it, an invisible comrade; a third wheel standing to the side and reminiscing along with the characters. It’s inexplicable but the OVA gets better the more you watch. Every twenty or so episodes the quality rises and the storytelling becomes even more addictive.\nThere isn’t a single bad episode in the whole 110 episode run. Not only that, but you never know what to expect either, unlike the vast majority of other anime which have a clear narrative of beats: protagonist starts on A, must get to B, must end up at C. With LotGH the plot is so rich, the world so vast, the characters so many, you can never predict what people are going to do next, where they'll end up or what will happen. LotGH's depth is unparalleled.\nThe saga goes through year after year and you feel the weight with each season, you watch the characters grow together or drift apart, you see setups one episode then pay-offs dozens of episodes later, you see friendships, rivalries, enemies, comrades, battles, love, marriage, birth and death, you see it all. Nothing is left out, absolutely nothing. Other series are just as long, other series have better animation, but no other series is as far-reaching in depth and consistently intelligent and accomplished.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is a legend of the anime medium. The greatest anime production in its history.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=599,  ["text"]="                          \n    This is easily the most overrated anime of all time. When I first came to MAL, I didn&#039;t hear much about it. About August 2008 I started seeing it being recommended by people in the Recommendation forum.  I didn&#039;t pay attention to it. Fast forward to 2009, March to be exact, and I&#039;m seeing it being recommended left and right, and being hailed as the greatest anime of all time. Many people even went as far to say that if you didn&#039;t like LOGH, you had no taste in anime. So I started to think that I may want to watch it. I went\n          \n        to it&#039;s page and found that it was ranked in the top 5.\nThat&#039;s when I initially started watching it. April, 2009.\nNow, I watched the first 7 episodes and thought to myself 'Well, it&#039;s starting off a little slow, maybe it will pick up.' You see, by the first episode, I was already bored. I put it on my On Hold list. \nThen, September 2009, I decided I would give it another chance, I thought that maybe I just wasn&#039;t in the right frame of mind back in April, and that I really had made a mistake by putting it on hold. It turns out it was a mistake to put it on hold, I should have put it where it belonged - in dropped.\nYou see, it never got any less boring. In fact, it got even more and more tedious, until it at episode 20, it began to be a chore to watch it. I would actually DREAD my anime watching time, because I had to watch LOGH, the &#039;great anime of all time&#039;. If I could give it a 0 for enjoyment, I would. Hell, this sounds corny, but I would give it a -10, if I could. Alas, I cannot. So I give it a 1. This is about the most boring anime ever. \nShouldn&#039;t anime be enjoyable? If an anime isn&#039;t enjoyable, hasn&#039;t it failed? In my opinion, yes, Anime should be enjoyable. In my opinion, LOGH isn&#039;t. I know there are people who share this opinion, but are just to afraid to voice it, due to the people who actaully have the patience to finish the horrid show being vicious when disagreed with about the show, like rapid, foaming at the mouth Twilight fangirls.\nStory - 6/10\nAlmost directly plagiarized from Star Wars. I&#039;m surprised George Lucas hasn&#039;t sued them. Imagine Star Wars, only with no light sabers, no plasma guns, and no awesomeness. Oh! And it&#039;s run by aristocrats from France. Alright, now you have Legend of the Galactic Heroes. If you haven&#039;t seen Star Wars, just imagine Star Trek, only more boring. If you haven&#039;t seen either of those, I&#039;m not sure why you&#039;re even reading my review.\nArt - 7/10\nNothing to write home about. Very average. Almost everything I watched was a Laserdisc rip though, so you can kind of see how it might not look too nice. I mean the art really is truly average 90&#039;s art, which I happen to be a fan of. But that&#039;s it. Nothing special. I will add though that the command deck for the Empire is quite detailed. \nSound - 4/10\nSubpar - not even worth getting into. Very little background noise, just voices, and  many annoying ones at that.\nCharacter - 4/10\nYou know lots of people rant and rave about how human the characters in this series are. The trouble is, they aren&#039;t. Every character - stock. It&#039;s like the author of the original book (ahaha, yes I do know that much!) just got a list of all the stock characters of all time and just decided 'Whoop! I guess I&#039;ll use these!'\nYeah, so all in all, LOGH isn&#039;t worth your time, or hard drive space since the only way to watch it is to download. Most people who will read this review will probably be outraged. Hey - if this review has angered you, feel free to leave me a comment about it. But atleast be civil. Remember that everybody&#039;s opionion is different, and just because I don&#039;t agree that LOGH is the best anime ever doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m stupid, dumb, or have bad taste. It just means I didn&#039;t like LOGH.\nAnd that, my friends, marks the end of my review."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=155,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It is so rare to find any type of lengthy series that span over 100 episodes without declining in quality over its duration due to various factors such as the abundance of inconsistencies in the story, or rehashing the same narrative structural wise, which is pretty common in long running series. Other limiting factors are the available funds for its execution, or its own popularity, which can induce authors to change the course of the story. However, there is one title that managed to evade said issues, being an adaptation of a series of novels by Yoshiki Tanaka, with a lengthy production of 110 OVA\n          \n        episodes released over the span of nine full years, from the period 1988 to 1997.\nI am talking of course of \"Legend of the Galactic Heroes\" or in its japanese title, \"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu\", which is by far one of the best series I have watched so far, from all different mediums. It is a magnificent  military space opera anime with drama and sci-fi, enriched with military warfare, intricate political strive, marvelous characters and fantastic dialogue. It is a tale that ultimately proposes a vision society often pondered about, and that is the validity of democracy and autocracy. Many people may have assumed that this anime is purely narrative driven, being its main focus dialogue, which is partially true, yet it has so much more to offer; naturally, it has its flaws as well, which I will try to depict below in addition to its strengths.\n~Story~\nThe story of Legend of the Galactic Heroes focuses on the 6 year period in which the two main political factions of the galaxy clash, the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, with Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wenli as the most important figures respectively. However, this interstellar war has been waging for over 150 years, with casualties over the millions, marked by the crumbling Goldenbaum dynasty which rules the Empire, and the dysfunctional democratic state of the Alliance. Both Yang and Reinhard, have a reason for being engrossed in military affairs: one to finance his university education, while the other to save his sister from the Emperor. Both being the geniuses they are, they clash with each other in accordance to the pursuit of their goals. As they gain fame and deal with their superiors, people, scheming, political and military warfare, those are the aspects that will dominate these men's life.\nThe premise may seem simple as first, which may appear as a struggle of good, democracy, against evil, autocracy; however, this  is absolutely not the case. The anime portrays magnificently both sides, the first at its worst, while the other at its best respectively through the numerous advantages and flaws of both political ideologies. For example, democracy being a huge impediment for drastic changes, as opposed to autocracy. This makes it for the viewer impossible to root for a specific system, as in addition each side has its own charming/interesting characters. Furthermore, it leaves audiences pondering which is actually favourable, besides making the story unpredictable and exciting.\nAs mentioned earlier, the story expands greatly on both ideologies with intricate political disputes that are well presented as it is realistically displayed to the viewer, with different things such as Nationalism, exploitation of the weak, oppression, you name it. Then there is another faction in the story, and that is \"Terraism\", which represents religious belief. This party was of significant importance in the anime, yet its motives and background was weak and never really expanded on; besides, its enormous influence would have many viewers raise their eyebrows whether this should be believable or not. Another lacking aspect was the fact that it didn't expand on the advantages of a religion, rather only focusing on the worst of it. Being an atheist myself, I still find this a lacking aspect. It should be mentioned that there is at times an external narrator to explain the situations to the viewer, including future events, which in the eyes of some may be a hindrance.\nThe vast amount of episodes may deem viewers to think that the pacing is way too slow for its own good, yet this is not the case; contrary, in my humble opinion, its pacing is flawlessly done, befitting of the narrative. Detailed, rational and straight to the point dialogues are present, which are necessary for character exploration, as well as leaving viewers absorbed in it. Some audiences suggests that the first grand arc is slow, yet I tend to disagree with this; from the very first few episodes, it foreshadows on the big events that are to come, instantly leaving anyone interested, be it the story or the characters itself. In addition, LotGH does a fantastic job in world building, by exploring the characters and explaining the history of how human race developed since leaving Earth, as well as political events relatable to real historical data. However, speaking of the world, or in this case the universe, its map layout is oversimplified to a 2 dimensional plane, which is naturally not the case in space. Besides, the lone planet of Phezzan is supposedly of great economic influence, yet how or why it is, was never fully explored in the anime.\nNaturally, it is not all politics: war is waged to achieve afore-mentioned stances and goals. The various battles that take place throughout its duration are no simple \"asspulls\": these are all well-coordinated through the cunning of the different commanders of each fleet, and their tactical strategies and knowledge. However, it must be mentioned that said strategies are simplified in order for audiences to easily grasp and understand said tactics, which can be lacking in the eyes of some, in addition to display to viewers that not everyone in high positions are smart. These battles are in addition of big scale: people die in the ten's of thousands, if not millions, easily discerning the damage and scale of each confrontation. Neither it is a one-sided war: through intrigue, political corruption, conspiracies and civil wars, the outcomes of battles are often unpredictable generating a lot of tension for the viewer, in addition to appreciate the cunning of different individuals.\nThere is a downside with the show though, even when it shows the ugly sides of warfare, it is slightly romanticized version, with subjects such as glory and honor, which not always blend in well realistically speaking - this doesn't mean that the fights are tensionless. Hand-to-hand battles are present as well, and these are done with battle axes most of the time, which is strange considering the advanced technology available. Another thing to point out would be the different strategies used: the majority is based on true historical recordings of medieval times, yet there is the problem that these are meant for ground battles, not three-dimensional warfare. Finally, some may indicate that the knowledge of the different commanders of each faction have too much influence in the battles, while at times acting a bit too convenient for plot progression, yet this was a small drawback.\nLotGH is not all death and mayhem, it also has its share of slice of life moments, as well as humor to relieve the tension of the situation at times. These are well done, explored though the characters personalities and conceptions of each situation. For example, taken from a conversation in the anime: Soldier: \"Your left leg has been crushed\" Commander: \"Your reports has always been effective vice-admiral\" - through the personalities of the characters, such situations and dialogues are easily either humerous or inspiring for the audience.\n~Characters~\nThe cast of characters in Legend of the Galactic Heroes is huge to say least: each has a role to play, and are of importance, being evenly distributed between the different factions in the anime. Most of the character development is rather small, which may be a drawback for some, yet it could be said that it is crucial, as their beliefs are not easily bended to accommodate sudden plot changes, which adds to the intrigue and credibility of the story. Another strong point of the series is the fact that these are not your typical heroes, they're aware of their actions and the consequences, constantly thinking whether their actions are right or not, pondering if it is justifiable with their beliefs, and with society. Furthermore, these need support soldiers to be able to operate and execute their ideas.\nThere is also the fact that the every single character is susceptible to death, and when it happens, it would hit any viewer as a train as audiences experienced and got to know the character from the beginning to the end. A positive aspect is that these are not over-glorified deaths as is frequent in other mediums: these death's are often simple and befitting of the atmosphere it was trying to portray at the time. Other thing to note is that although the presence of woman is scarce, and seem to take a back role when it comes to warfare, it never sexualizes them in any way; in fact, these are very capable and independent.\nMoving on to the different characters, from the Alliance, there is Yang Wenli, who is the likable type of character, intelligent and very cunning: in fact, his genius is one of the best among the last centuries of history. In addition, he is a pacifist which is strongly engrained in his beliefs of democracy, which he firmly stands on. He could be seen as a perfect character military wise, which may be deemed by some as unrealistic, yet is clumsy in daily situations. Then there are others such as Julian Minci, who is in care of Yang, Frederica Greenhill or Attenbourgh; who will forget the likes of Walter von Schennkoppf or Bucock?\nOn the Galactic Empire side there are arguable more characters of interest. First you have Reinhard von Lohengramm, a strong-willed, naturally talented person. Viewers could describe him as the perfect alpha male, yet as will be apparent, Reinhard has its own weaknesses. There is certain character development presented, being affected by the various situations and character interactions. His motives may seem rather weak, yet is at the same time not overly dramatic, as is seen on his background stories. Kircheis is of sum importance as well, as he is the closest friend to Reinhard, and serves as counselor against some of his friends actions.\nThen there is Oskar van Reuenthal, which at first isn't that interesting, yet as story progresses, audiences observe and learn his character, a strong-willed individual with moral, composed and wise, while at the same time stubborn. What makes him so interesting is the fact that he struggles to find his meaning in life, and on how his childhood was. In fact, he could be described as a ticking time bomb, were it not for the fact of the soothing presence of his friend Wolfgang Mittermeyer, renown for his boldness in warfare, yet kind. Other outstanding character is Paul von Oberstein, an emotionless mysterious man, who firmly believes in the better good, yet with all motives based on reason, which he is often criticised for.\nThe supporting cast play an important role as well, as without them, the main characters wouldn't be as well presented or fleshed out. The representation of human disputes for glory or status is likewise well relayed to the viewer, as it is a very accurate representation of human behaviour. It also introduces Maquiavellism for the justification of fights, another thing to ponder for the protagonist. Other good point of the anime is that there is racial diversity. A small drawback would be the fact that there are no alien races, only humans, which might seem odd considering a vast amount of space is already explored without encountering any other types of life forms.\n~Animation~\nThe animation quality of Legend of the Galactic Heroes is rather lackluster, even considering it began airing in 1988: background characters were badly drawn, motions being very basic, not always fluid as desired and the likes. Nevertheless, it must be said that the quality certainly improved over the course of the story, which is rare in the medium. The character's design is something to behold as well: these are as realistically as possible designed, which enhanced the overall serious atmosphere it was trying to portray; furthermore, facial expressions are not exaggerated either, having the various personalities of said characters come over magnificently.\nThe animation of the different battles fulfilled its purpose, yet the motions were basic as well, and sometimes rehashed. Nonetheless, the design of the various battle ships and military tools made up for it: these are not fleshy mecha robots, but blunt quadratic structures, best suited for space warfare. In addition, there is also a lot of explosions and gore, accurately representing what war really is: ugly and cruel. Other element to remark is the use of simplified schemes on computer panels on the movement of the enemies, in order to make the viewer quickly understand the situation of the battlefield.\n~Sound~\nThe soundtrack used in Legend of the Galactic Heroes may not have been of original material, yet the compositions used were magnificent, and never overused. Artist such as Beethoven, Wagner, Chopin, Brahms or Mahler are on the order of the day, wonderfully transmitting the atmosphere and emotions it is trying to relay to the audience. The opening and ending songs don't fall short either, yet with compositions such as \"Hikari no Hashi wo koete\" by Kei Ogura encapsulates truly what LotGH really is: a glorious space opera. The sound effects of the battleships themselves may have been simplified to laser beam sounds, besides of  the issue with sound effects in space: though entertaining, it isn't realistic.\nWhere it truly shines as well are its huge cast of voice actors: with over 300 of them, each for all the different characters present in the anime: this is truly dedication to a series. The voice actor performed their role masterfully, carefully conveying the different emotions presented, as well as the different personalities each character had. People like Wakamoto Norio as Oskar von Reuenthal, Kaneto Shiozawa, Toshio Furkawa, you name it.\n~Enjoyment~\nHaving dived in expecting a slow start, I was pleasantly surprised: the story gripped me form the very first moment with its clever dialogues, to build further up into even better story and execution of it. Legend of the Galactic Heroes falls nothing short of a masterpiece, with a fantastic narrative, complex and intricate story, a huge cast of very memorable and fantastic characters, in addition to a glorious OST, befitting of the anime. Naturally it has its flaws, such as exploration on the motives of some factions, or some oversimplified characters, yet I believe these are minor, and of all the things it executes well, it easily overshadows these. LotGH may have easily inclined me to try out other space operas.\nSo do I recommend Legend of the Galactic Heroes? Yes, I wholeheartedly do to anyone. Surely the mere length and outdated animation of the series may put some viewers off, yet they will find themselves pleasantly rewarded. Don't expect any fancy overpowered characters or the likes, rather a well crafted story of the universe and battles amongst the stars. This is what could be considered the true Star Wars, a true epic. \nThank you for reading.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=220,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an epic tale of the rise to power of two men born at the right time on opposite sides, leading to a clash of brilliant spectacle that could only be executed with care in as an animated original.\nAnimation- 9/10\nThough Legend of Galactic Heroes is 20 years old the visual quality and care is quite priceless. As a viewer who is reluctant to watch series over 40 episodes or over 10 years old, I was taken aback by the engaging art ranging from Ancient Rome, to Victorian England, to Blade Runner-esque  futuristic set-pieces and costuming. Both factions, The Free\n          \n        Planets' Alliance and the Galactic Empire, had its own distinctive look, engaging the eye in nearly every direction. Add to these looks,  the numerous space battles waging between the two factions and you have a piece of art that is timeless.\nSound - 10/10\nLegend of Galactic Heroes boasts over 100 individual voice actors with, I believe only one person, doubling up. This show is a veritable 'who's who' of the time's voice talent, and many of these talents  are still working today. The quality of performance from this cast is overwhelmingly great. The actors take to both comedy and drama with a meticulous sense of intelligence, and there are few, if any times I found an actor to have either over or under-played a scene. Musically, this anime uses very well-placed classical music as the aural backdrop for the series, and perhaps the only flaw musically are the opening themes, rife with pitchy, technically abominable singing, but because it is so little of the sound content, then I can personally overlook it.\nCharacters - 10/10\nIn this show you would be hard-pressed to find a character that does not serve a definite purpose. There is a large cast of characters ranging from princes and generals to whores and religious fanatics.  Each character plays his part in the machine of this show, all believably true to their actions. The only flaw with the characters I suppose is names. While the show is good on giving viewers subtitles to serve as a reminder, because these are German names and those of nobility (which also includes titles) there is a double edged sword that both breeds authenticity and becomes mnemonically troublesome.\nStory - 9/10\nLoGH is a magnificent space opera that delves into philosophy and politics with an unmatched ease. It is clear where shows like Death Note, Code Geass and creators such as Clamp get their influence from when watching this show. While the writing suffers a bit in the final 15-20 episodes, the slack is picked up by the extraordinary momentum the writers and voice cast from the previous 90 episodes created. Even with those flaws, there are no instances of stagnation in the narrative. The show is always distinctively going somewhere, elegantly leading the viewer with excellently written narration to help with suspense. LoGH also manages to integrate fictional technology into the story with out it overwhelming  the viewer, or being an excuse for trite deus ex machina. \nEnjoyment - 10/10\nFor someone who is very picky about show length and characters, I was truly stunned by the way this show was tightly managed as a narrative. The pace is a very consistent and mild to help go back and forth between raising questions and finding resolution. LoGH was a highly satisfying experience, and its a shame it was never brought to English so that it could find a bigger audience. I think it's the type of show that Adult Swim, or G4 (when it was TechTV with Anime Unleashed) would have eagerly consumed at the beginning of their respective launches.\nOverall- 10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=209,  ["text"]="                          \n    An overhyped, overrated, inflated-by-details anime of Mary-Sue dialogues and bland battles. When somebody says \"the show doesn't get good until 20+ episodes in,\" you know there's something wrong. As you can already tell, nothing good can come from me writing this review. Legend of The Galactic Heroes is beloved on this site. A great deal of people call it a classic, and here I am writing about it being only \"average.\" I have not finished the series; I can't, and this review is intended to tell you why I can't, but also why others like me, who bought into the hype, shouldn't waste their time.\nThe\n          \n        story of Legend of the Galactic Heroes follow the protracted war between the The Galactic Empire and Free Planets Alliance with a stunning degree of depth. You will know why the war started, who started it, why they started it, and why it mattered. What you might wonder is: why does it matter to you? This is where the main problem with LoGH arises, and the first problem with the story. This is a series of details, not entertainment, not development, not provoking ideas, but details. This is where LoGH gets its staggering 110 non-filler episodes. It is a slow, crawling assault of information, completely useless to the viewer. If you enjoy fictional history, this will not be a problem for you. You'll even be treated to several episodes of literal fake history lessons, in a documentary-style format, with interviews from fake historians and everything. Having fun, yet? \nThe second problem is actually with its characters. They fall into only two categories: Mary Sues and trying too hard. The main characters, Yang Wenli and Reinhard Lohengramm, can twist probability and reason in such ways that would make the characters in Gurren Lagann blush; they can do no wrong. Yang Wenli is outgunned to some astronomical degree like 1 to 100 most of the time and he wins because of \"superior strategy\" or \"morale\" which is never actually depicted, but more on that later. Julian, Yang's boy servant, can also do no wrong. He'll commandeer warships with little or no effort, and the writers never try to disguise this; when a character dies in LoGH, it isn't because their personality or choices brought them to error, but because Reinhard and Yang want them to die, or it's allegorical enough.\nThis is where trying too hard comes into play. Look no further than the character Poplan, where you'll notice it first. He's horny, and he will appear in no scene without reminding you he likes women. That's his only trait. Oberstein will go through every scene looking suspicious only to have absolutely no payoff through the entire series. But, an even greater insult to this cast is Fredrica Greenhill. She blatantly admits she's useless aside from making sandwiches and tea. We get it, these are one-note characters. Besides the Mary Sues, you cannot care about the cast, making over half the characters uninteresting; most of them just serve as vehicles for the three main characters to spout more of their ideals, anyway.\nBesides, how does \"morale\" make a difference to Yang? Does morale make lasers stronger or weaker? These are space ships; morale has no bearing on the functioning on mechanical things. Morale barely has an effect on weapons in our time, much less in the future. Yes, everything you heard about the tactics in LoGH is a joke. They use simplistic, planetary ideas like \"circle around behind them\" or \"don't tell them about our main fleet,\" and apparently, that's very impressive to a lot of people. You won't need to worry about this, though, because action is sparse in LoGH. Yes, our Mary Sues prefer to drink, eat, stare out windows, and philosophize for most of their screen time away. You ever wondered how Yang feels about democracy? You're gonna know. You're gonna know over and over again.\nThe third issue with the story is that it's entirely implausible. There's only two ways for the enemies to cross into each other's territories, and they never really explain why other than \"we'll die.\" Wars are lost and the remnant survivors are still seemingly able to combat the enemy for the sake of plot. Also, in the future, wars are waged with axes and armor, lasers are less lethal than bullets, and everybody lives like it's the 1900's. LoGH exists in some strange mindset of the future where we got into space (somehow), developed some very limited mass-communication, and all personal military technology stayed in the Middle Ages. The show Star Trek did it better in the 1960s, and even changed the world we live in with its ideas (like the wireless communicator AKA cell-phone). What is LoGH's excuse? It doesn't have one, it's just not creative enough. One would think, given the absurd amount of historical and political babble, that this show would've given equal care to imagine life in outer space, but it doesn't. \nWhile the creativity and story of LoGH is sickeningly weak, the art doesn't fair much better. Classic and orchestral music scores carry the scenes well, but can't save them from looking bland. The characters are barely animated, even compared to other anime of this era. True, there's some shocking scenes of gore randomly spread about, but the action mostly come down to short bursts of lasers, explosions, and blood effects. It lumbers monotonously, but it does it to a classy sound-track.\nSo, apparently, the only attraction of this show is the dialogues between the Mary Sues. Indeed, they touch on a lot of philosophical and political subjects that are more relevant now than they were when the show was made, but this raises the question: why aren't you just reading about politics? The ridiculous scenario of this story's conflict, and the sheer \"eminence\" of its main characters makes it impossible to take seriously, yet it commands you to, and that's its ultimate downfall; All of LoGH's flaws could work if the show took itself less seriously, but it's direly serious, and so are its flaws.\nLet's sum up. The main attraction for Legend of The Galactic Heroes is the ability for one to say \"I watched something from the 1980's that nobody's heard about or cares about.\" Then, one can say \"It was mature and intelligent, despite the fact I learned nothing.\" This show is a waste of time as entertainment, an example of what not to do with a show about the future, space, philosophy, politics, and the human condition. It lacks feasibility, it lacks imagination, and it lacks catharsis. There's a reason only MAL and hipsters care about LoGH, and everyone else knows Star Trek and Star Wars. Those had vision and creativity that inspired scientists and the generations to come. LoGH has 110 episodes nobody watched, flat characters nobody would recognize or identify with, and a literal universe of wasted potential. \n\n\n\n"},

These past events encompass the overall thoughts, beliefs, ideas, and conceptions of all those who lived throughout it.  When a war between two different states and political ideologies breaks out with both states claiming to be fighting on the side of righteousness, which side is truly the right one?  This is the overarching theme of of the epic 110 episode OVA space opera, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Adapted from the science fiction novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka and directed\n          \n        by famed Ishiguro Noboru (SDF Macross), LotGH is a brilliantly orchestrated OVA that is carried out through its overall grandeur presentation of political and historical ideas, magnificently choreographed battles, and through an impressively well thought out storyline and characters that leaves you begging for more.\nLotGH is a space opera that takes place in the distant future. It shows the continuous struggle between believers in the democratic republic political system of the Free Planets Alliance and those who follow the rule and will of the Galactic Empire’s autocratic government.  For hundreds of years, these two states have been battling it out through continuous, stalemated conflict in the depths of space. With both political factions becoming stagnant over the years, as corruption has seeped into both, the ambitions of one up-and-coming young admiral of the Galactic Empire, Reinhard von Musel, seeks to rid the Empire of the corruption and unite the galaxy under his own rule. On the other side of the spectrum and galaxy, admiral Yang Wenli observes the corruption that is strangling his country but hopes that through the will of the people and through time, the corruption will be rooted out. As time progresses, these two will become rivals and show one another that they are not only equals on the battlefield, but in intellect and charisma as well.\nLotGH has one of the greatest stories ever written in not just anime, but of any media of all time. The scope of the story is so vast and dynamic that it instantly sucks the viewer into the frenzy that is galactic politics and warfare. The fact that this is the longest OVA ever to come out may deter some due to its great size but do not be turned off. To achieve such brilliant storytelling, the series makes great use of every episode and fleshes out every possible detail leaving out the chance of ever having a plot hole. \nThe story relies on giving the viewer not just one view point of the events carrying on within the story but a look through all the characters in the story.  From Reinhard and his friends and allies to Yang and his allies, each character shares their thoughts on the conflict going on within each respective camp and their own personal philosophies.  Because of this, the story gives us no protagonist or antagonist, but only human beings interacting and coping with the social, political and military changes within their society. It is interesting to see how each character reacts to the maelstrom of changes within the Empire and the Alliance. You will see that through the growing political and military strife certain characters try to use such instances to gain power and further their reputation or turn a blind eye to it for it does not suit the interests. Because of this, the viewer will see a flow within the events that make absolute coherent sense.  This creates the overall theme that future events will occur as a result of the actions and will of others. It is also interesting to see the different philosophies the characters hold.  Because the show is neutral regarding almost every matter, you will never see another show give such valid, strong, and well sounded arguments on why an autocracy is a better form of government than a democracy, especially when the former is under benevolent leadership and the other rotting from corruption.  It is this gray area that the viewer can decided and see where their morals and philosophies lie and see if one argument can sway them to the other viewpoint or at least get them to think more critically on their own viewpoints.  \nIt is because of such care and detail given to the story on such issues that the viewer is able to find at least a handful of characters they can relate to and even admire. For some, the overall humbleness, laziness and intelligence of Yang greatly contrast the constantly battle hungry, charismatic, power seeking Reinhard. But even though the two characters contrast so greatly in personality, you do see that they are also greatly similar and admired by friends and soldiers alike.  But the story does not just focus on these two main characters as the show an amazingly large cast of supporting characters that are given a lot of depth and personality that makes them differ from others. From the Alliane’s tough and ready Rosenritter leader General Schenkopp, the goofy personalities of pilot Oliver Poplan and admiral Dusty Attenboroguh to the protégé of Yang in Julian Minci, each character within the Alliance is distinct in some shape or form. This also applies to the men and women of the Empire as the best friends of admirals Oskar von Reunthal and Wolfgang Mittermeyer contrast greatly and serves as a great dichotomy on how opposites can attract.  You also have the third parties of De Villiers of the Earth Church trying to stop both Reinhard and Yang from succeeding in their goals and Adrian Rubinsky of the autonomous Phezzan trying to play the Alliance and the Empire for his own personal gain and quest for power. What adds to this depth of the characters is the brilliant voice acting done for the show.  With a show of this size, low of a budget and number of characters, you would think that voices would be recycled for some. You would be wrong. Only one person voices two characters in this entire series, one. The rest has their own individual seiyuu that adds a great deal of life and personality to the character that could not be possible if the voices were in fact recycled. Seiyuus such as Goro Naya, Kei Tomiyama, Ryo Horiwaka and Norio Wakamoto give their respective characters such great personality that adds to the already dynamic traits of the characters within the series.\nIf it is anything that LotGH lacks, it’s in the artwork and animation department.  Because the show started out in 1988 and ended its run in 1997, you will see a marked improvement in this category but the animation and art still seems to be not as detailed and beautiful to the eye as other contemporary animes.  But does this mean the show is ugly looking? Not at all. The character bodies look very realistic in portion and design instead of the over exaggerated anime style and the detail in the background and objects such as the space ships is impressive but the animation is still suffers from stiffness at times and not as fluid as it could be. But as said before, this does greatly improve from season to season as more time and effort gets spent into making the show look stunningly impressive.  However, these small hiccups and blemishes in the artwork and animation can be contributed to the small budget that the OVA had during its run and thus when looking at, one may want to keep this in mind as the show was not being produced by a company like Kyoto Animation.\nWhat is truly remarkable is the score for this show.  LotGH utilizes a vast array of classical composers and their compositions such as Mahler, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahmas and Wagner.  This gives the show a timeless, ageless feel that classical music often lends itself to.  These compositions are always fitting to the situation and never come as underwhelming or overly pompous and melodramatic.  The music isn’t just a means to an end but really does contribute to the overall atmosphere and adds another dimension of character to the show. The opening and closing songs for LotGH are amazingly well crafted and fits the mood of each season as they are almost hints to what you may see in that season. The particular stand out is the 3rd opening song of “Sea of Stars”. It may be one of the greatest opening songs for it’s sheer power and ability to move the viewer emotionally.\nOverall, LotGH is a magnificent show that does not fail to impress in any shape or form. With its multidimensional characters, impressive story and themes that cover history, politics, social issues, and philosophy, the OVA is a remarkable showing of human intelligence and creativity that requires thought and judgment from the viewer.  Many shows are called epic and seen as brilliant though they have glaring flaws that make them not even close to that criteria, but LotGH is truly one of those series that goes above and beyond the call of epic works and is truly a milestone in anime history.

This is pretty much all talk and an unoriginal generic war story. Basically it follows two homos and a guy who drinks tea on death star. These three are your typical “fight against the man because they are corrupted” characters. Of course everyone is corrupted because apparently humanity always ruins itself in the future. Humanity is split apart so our heroes must re-unite the universe, lame. If this was like 50 episodes I would probably rate this 7 and consider recommending to people.\nThis anime pretty much consists of dialogue\n          \n        that people claim to be complex and deep but is actually boring and made up of re-used history quotes.\nI am going to pull a LoGH right now,\n“One cannot taste bitter until one has tasted sweet.” -Confucius\n“I can ride my bike with no handlebars, no handlebars” –The Flobots\n“For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool” –Isiah 8\n“They ask me why I do it? Cause I’m the fkin man” -Belly\nI guarantee you a bunch of LoGH fans just saluted me with tea in the air and pinkie’s up.\nThere are like 100 characters and 90% of them die with incredible stupidity. All the bad guys are pretty much lame and underdeveloped. They die a dog’s death and never even put up a good fight. All I saw was victory after victory with no conflict. The only interesting battles are when some blonde woman battles a dorky looking blue haired guy.\nThe art and animation is pretty lame, movements are stiff and pretty much everyone is ugly.\nThe sound is the best part of this anime. It uses a lot of classical music which really fits sophisticated intellectuals like me. I really hate everyone’s voices though because they all sound emotionless throughout the entire 110 episodes.\n\nA lot of people like comparing this to Code Geass and I don’t know why because Code Geass is a million times better. All the fanboys think that Reinhard is better but if Lelouch was there then he would should who is boss.\nFirstly, if some girly looking 18 year old guy can break onto Reinhard’s flagship with an axe then Lelouch, an 18 year old with the power of kings and a Gawain mecha with inbuilt hadron cannons could easily rip apart Reinhard’s flagship. But Reinhard would be extremely useful if under Lelouch’s command so he wouldn’t kill Reinhard. \nSince Reinhard is so GAR he would just sit there in his chair waiting to be influenced by the power of geass. He wouldn’t use any headgear to block his eyes because of his gar pride. Then Lelouch would not only be Emperor of Britannia but also Kaiser of the Galactic Empire, and he would rule the entire universe. \nDammmmmmnnnnn a bunch of LoGH fanboys are crying right now and I’m just sitting here sipping on Yang’s tea.\nIf you want to be bored out of your mind and live in stale air for 110 episodes then go ahead and watch LoGH. By the time you finish you will probably have pale skin from the lack of sunlight. The ending is really crappy too, I was crying manly tears because I wasted so much time on this lame anime. "},

Constant spiels of exposition about various topics, a constant show of myopia in regards to its setting and subject matter, all the while consistently failing to act on the countless possibilities presented to us, this is 110 episodes of pure, unadulterated wasted potential in the most inexcusable ways possible.\nIn case you\n          \n        couldn't tell, I don't \"like\" Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This isn't to say that I don't think that it's an admirable programme, because there certainly is a lot to be admired about it. In terms of the sheer scope of the work, it's arguably the most ambitious anime ever made but at the same time, there are many things about LOGH that just rub me the wrong way. I cannot in good conscience call this show the best anime ever made, nor can I say that I would recommend it to anyone. My initial review of LOGH posted in September of 2014 was written from the perspective of someone who was expecting something grand and came out of the first season extremely underwhelmed. However, that review was poorly written and never levied any proper criticism toward the programme as a whole. Given how it's been a little over a year since then and how I've actually completed the show, I feel it's high time to tear into this programme and actually try explaining why I personally can't get on with it.\nI suppose Legend of the Galactic Heroes manages to oust Star Wars in one way: the sheer depth and detail in regards to the protracted war going on between the Free Planets' Alliance and the Galactic Empire (no, not THAT empire). You're given information as to how the Empire was formed, why the Alliance formed, why the war happened, and all kinds of stuff like that. Of course, this is where LOGH's first biggest problem arises: it suffers from a rather nasty case of exposition overload to the point where we literally get treated to multiple episodes formatted as documentaries on fictional history with interviews from fictional historians. On the one hand, I suppose this is much better than having the first 4-5 episodes being nothing but scrolling text across a background of stars but on the other hand, I can't help but feel like they could've cut back somewhere along the way.\nI would make a Star Wars comparison here because the original trilogy lacked such exposition, but I feel as if it's justified somewhat in LOGH's case because it was obviously wasn't trying to be an entertaining science fiction OVA series. In reality, LOGH presents itself as a political commentary on the human condition with a science fiction backdrop to it all. The true conflict at LOGH's core is the constant debate between whether or not democracy or autocracy is the superior form of governance and how each one affects the common man at the end of it all. When viewing this programme from THAT angle, the exposition overload makes much more sense because it gives us the proper context necessary to understand why these factions operate the way they do and prevents the entire conflict from devolving into a black-and-white battle between the forces of good and evil. Of course, this is where LOGH begins to lose me.\nYou see, LOGH manages to do a great job depicting the problems with representative democracy at large, especially in regards to how politicians become alienated from the people they're supposed to represent due to things like corruption, arrogance, and self-preservation among other such things. However, the programme itself has a HUGE bias toward autocracy. Don't get me wrong: the makers of this programme brought up some VERY good points about autocracy (i.e. the selfish nobility, a weak ruler/tyrant fucking up the nation, etc). However, there comes a point in the show where it basically tells you that an autocracy with a level-headed and just ruler is the best form of government. I don't know what the fuck Beatnik was on when he made his review of LOGH: My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, but this show actually DOES what Gundam does by painting out one side to be superior than the other and he should be arrested for false advertisement.\nThe whole conflict between the Free Planets' Alliance and the Galactic Empire basically had me rooting for the empire the entire time for a LOT of reasons. For starters, the empire had the more compelling of the two commanders. Reinhardt is no saint, but he's definitely the superior commander throughout the entire show. For starters, he actually has a compelling reason to even be in the military in the first place (cough cough Yang cough cough). I mean, wouldn't YOU try to do something if your own sister was the concubine of an elderly emperor? On top of that, the dynamic that exists between Reinhardt and his childhood friend Kircheis is also something that manages to keep me entertained. Whether it's Reinhardt and Kircheis snarking away at the stupidity that goes on around them or Kircheis bringing Reinhardt back to reality once he starts getting arrogant/reckless, there's always something there to really keep your eyes glued to the screen.\nYou know, now that I think about it... the first season of LOGH (in regards to Reinhardt and Kircheis's story, mind you) reminds me quite a bit of the Golden Age Arc from Berserk. In both, we have two men and their respective teams gaining notoriety from their military accomplishments whilst trying to evoke change within a failing monarchy and stick it to the nobles who feel threatened by the presence of \"filthy commoners.\" Of course, Reinhardt and Kircheis never end up in an Eclipse of any kind so I'm quite thankful for that. Also, the show after the first season then follows Reinhardt's own struggles now that he's in a position of power along with the many interactions he has with the FPA. Now I know why I'm rooting for the empire: it's because Reinhardt himself is actually the most human character in the entire show! He's infinitely more human than Yang is, that's for sure.\nI don't understand how ANYONE could possibly like Yang, but I found him to be the bane of my existence whilst watching the show. Yang Wenli is essentially the Kirito of the entire programme: he's unsympathetic, he goes about the entire programme with an irksome \"I really don't want to be here but these idiots would die without me\" attitude, and he wins virtually any encounter he's in, or at the very least manages to get a draw if Reinhardt or one of his trusted commanders enters the fray. On top of that, anyone who defies Yang or Julian (his ward/servant) is cursed to die or get humiliated, regardless of whatever reason they may have. The ONLY time I've ever gotten any joy whenever Yang was in the frame was during the episode where Yang got court-martialed and ended up roasting EVERYONE on the committee. At least then, Yang was expressing actual feelings that he had instead of just being a passive-aggressive douchebag like he always is. It actually got to a point where I was actually HAPPY when Episode 82 rolled around and he ended up playing less and less of a prominent role in the show because quite honestly, I fucking hated him THAT much. Now if only this show did the opposite with Kircheis because let's be honest with ourselves: LOGH is always better when Kircheis is here.\nThe rest of the cast in LOGH is fair enough to say the least. Some characters like Annerose, Julian, and Frederica are rather endearing and certainly help lighten up the otherwise tense atmosphere of the programme whilst other characters like Poplan and virtually ALL of the imperial nobles/alliance politicians evoked such visceral annoyance in me to the point where I kept begging for them to die a merciless and/or utterly humilating death (you know, like ____ does!). My favourite characters by far would have to be Kircheis and Oberstein. Kircheis serves as a wonderful foil to Reinhardt whilst still showing us that he's more than just the dude who wants to nail Annerose. On that note, Oberstein's ruthless efficiency immediately caught my attention and I couldn't help but cheer on any sort of plan he came up with, regardless of whether or not it went against Reinhardt's wishes. Also, his fake eye vaguely reminds me of Alastor Moody from Harry Potter so that was another point in his favour.\nOf course, I'm losing the point of this review right now so let's go back to talking about why I can't get on with the show. We've already talked about why it loses me in regards to how it handles its political babble, but let's now talk about the blatant flaws in writing that the overzealous fans of this show just disregard because it apparently does everything else right. Now, I'm guilty of using this excuse a lot to justify flaws in the programmes I like and people have told me time and again that it's a shitty defense. You know what? I agree with that logic. So please explain to me why the countless people who've given this show 10/10 reviews and called it a masterpiece failed to address these blatantly glaring holes in the motherfucking writing?! Don't know what I mean? Well let's go over all the ways that the writers prove to us that they don't care about holes in their story.\nFor starters, let's talk about the inconsistent population figures. Now we learn that in the year 2050 AD, Earth gets torn asunder by a cataclysmic nuclear war that reduces the population from 20 billion (which is about 10.4 billion too much of the UN's projected population growth figures, mind you[1]) to 1 billion. Now the bulk of the refugees ended up colonising planets once Earth became a nuclear wasteland leaving only about 5 million people behind. Now, 200 years later, the population of Earth literally increased 1,000-fold! How the fuck could that happen when the population of the Earth at that point in time was more or less identical to the population of Europe during the Dark Ages, ESPECIALLY when the planet was reduced to a fucking nuclear wasteland?!\nOn top of that, 400,000 people who left the Empire to start their own democracy managed to increase their population exponentially to 400 million by the time of the first Alliance/Empire fight! Did ANYONE from the fucking writing team even consult a population expert or something before coming up with the figures used for these shows? It might seem like a really small detail, but shit like this leaves HUGE holes in the story when you actually try applying real-world data on population growth to a work like this.\nOh, and let's not forget how fucking STUPID the melee battles are. The spaceship stuff is fair enough... until you look at the battle tactics (but we'll get onto that in a second). However, the melee stuff always has to take place in full body armour with fucking metal weapons like swords, axes, and stuff! What the fuck is this?! Is this Artland/Kitty Films' way of proving to people that they're not ripping off Star Wars because light sabres are trademarked by George Lucas? That shit doesn't look cool or badass whatsoever: it looks fucking impractical, ESPECIALLY in a distant future timeline where humanity colonised countless planets.\nGoing back to how the starship battles were done, it's honestly a mixed bag for me. I like how they looked but practically speaking, they made no sense whatsoever! This show uses two-dimensional war tactics that would've been feasible during the times of Genghis Khan... in space, where everything exists in three dimensions. Say what you will about Star Wars, but at least the fucking starship battles existed in three dimensions as opposed to the two! How the FUCK can I cheer on any battle that goes on when the vast majority of the strategy relies heavily on pretending like you're the ancient Spartans fending off the Persian invasion?\nOn that note, let's talk about how this show likes to tout about strategy. Now every commander in this show is apparently a bloody genius because they manage to exploit the enemy's weaknesses during every encounter and then leave them scattering about like roaches... or so this programme's defenders like to say. In reality, every single battle relies on one side being a complete and total dumbass when it would be grossly impractical to do so and then having the other side take full advantage of their idiocy. How the fuck is that \"superior strategy\" when they're just taking advantage of their enemies acting like a bunch of idiots? Also, this show likes to say that morale is the most important aspect of battle or some rubbish like that but I beg to differ. Morale doesn't help your lasers fire better, it doesn't smite the enemy quicker. Morale is important, but nowhere near as important as having GOOD battle tactics in a three-dimensional plane that DON'T rely heavily on exploiting your opponent's impractical idiocy.\nThe justification for this horseshit is even stupider than the battles themselves are upon retrospect. Apparently, only a small portion of the vastness that is outer space is actually usable which means that a lot of the battles have to take place in similar areas over and over again. Whoever came up with the concept of \"usable space\" needs to get kicked square in the knackers and then given a lobotomy performed with a rusty butcher knife. If that ain't the laziest horseshit ever devised to justify sheer impracticality, I seriously don't know what is. There is NO way you can convince me, or anyone else for that matter that in the VAST openness of space, only a small portion of it would actually be usable for shit like battles and transportation and whatnot.\nOn top of everything else, what REALLY gets my goat with this programme that also never ceases to make me laugh raucously is THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANY FORM OF ALIENS!!!! I mean, who the FUCK dropped the ball on that one? Do you sincerely expect ANY rational person on this planet to believe that in the hundreds of years that mankind spent colonising the stars, they never even encountered so much as a single alien? No Twi'leks, no Pau'ans, no Togrutas, no Wookies, Gungans, no Hive, no Vex, no Eliksni, no cosmic space worms that act as the direct emissaries of the Darkness, no giant space sphere that acts as a harbinger of doom, NONE of that stuff even exist in this fucking universe. Aliens don't even get mentioned ONCE throughout the entire programme.\nWhen you look at how the planets are in terms of setup. Nearly each planet we see is analagous to Earth, and they all have stuff that exist only on Earth in the real world... you know, like trees, fruit, vegetables, bread, cars, metal, guns, horses, water, all that good shit. So please, explain to me how a bunch of refugees from a war-torn planet even managed to find planets that were remotely habitable and then turn them into nigh-duplicates of pre-cataclysm Earth. Did they just take all this stuff to barren worlds and then used some kind of voodoo magic to make the planets they visited like Earth? Or did they just happen across Earth lookalikes that conveniently had all this shit? It literally makes no sense whatsoever and despite the depth and detail given to us about the conflict between the Empire and the Alliance, we BARELY get any information about shit like this and that just has to be the most infuriating thing about it all.\nNow, some of you out there will probably be scoffing and then asking why any of this shit is important. Well, I'll tell you why: because if this show is trying so hard to be a commentary on the human condition, I would at least expect it to get crucial details right that would actually make the setting much more plausible and thus, easier for the analytical mind to take seriously. This is a show where there are fictional historians giving us fucking documentaries to watch. I'm pretty sure that I'm well within my rights to expect that it actually gets stuff like this right! This wasn't an incredibly entertaining show to watch, and my suspension of disbelief didn't exist for 65% of the show's run. If it actually got the details like the ones I pointed out right, MAYBE it would've been a much more immersive programme to watch and I could actually reciprocate the praise this show gets instead of being a contrary twat who has to hate everything that's highly rated because the praise surrounding it is complete and total horseshit. But I digress, because now it's time to talk about the superficial stuff.\nIn terms of artwork, the entire programme is quite the visual delectation. Also, this is just a minor bit of praise I have but whatever: I absolutely ADORE the fact that everyone's eyes aren't the size of their foreheads and actually look like human eyes. It just adds to the atmosphere of the show and while it doesn't get the important shit right, at least I can say that it doesn't look like fucking Code Geass with their noodle people that have huge eyes and tits that defy the laws of physics. On top of that, all the backdrops are beautifully designed and the general aesthetic for the Empire (at least in regards to the nobility) is pretty damn nice to say the least. I mean, I WOULD question why nobles in the year 3000-something-or-other would dress like they're medieval England royalty but hey, at least it's posh so it fits.\nAnimation starts off rather choppy and inconsistent but that's to be expected because it's an OVA from the late 80s. This was also a year or two before Akira was released and anime was still stuck in the ultra-violent OVA phase of its existence, so I suppose that also adds into why the animation isn't the greatest. However, it does gradually get better. Also, let's not forget that this is an OVA series that was released over the course of 10 years. The budget obviously gets better utilised as animation technology improves and there's a noticeable increase in quality in the animation over time. If I really had to say, I would say that LOGH at its peak resembles Evangelion at its best. With all of that in mind, let's also be grateful that Kircheis and Annerose were never in the same hospital room.\nIf there's one area that I really had to praise LOGH on the most though, it would have to be the audio. The OST is bloody amazing to the point where it almost manages to put John Williams and his compositions to shame. On another note, the voice acting was phenomenal. I seldom comment on Japanese voice-acting because I don't understand the languages enough to truly gauge their performances but this had to be the one anime where the performances managed to throw me for a loop. This was a project where countless A-list voice actors and actresses gathered together to lend their talent, and my GOD does it shine through. If you've watched any amount of anime in Japanese, some of the voicework should ring a bell. I didn't even expect Vegeta's voice actor to even be in this series, let alone Kappei Yamaguchi but hey, it's a lovely surprise for those of us who furiously masturbate to the creed of sub-only.\nNow, all things considered... I would say that I enjoyed LOGH to a certain degree. The programme itself can get REALLY entertaining when it reminds us of GAA Berserk and shows Reinhardt and Yang sticking it to their superiors. However, this entire show is just SO fucking tedious to watch. It takes 26 episodes to just set up the groundwork and it isn't until Episode 60 when the programme really starts taking off and actually becomes an entertaining show to watch (whenever Yang isn't in the frame that is) for more than 51% of an episode. As a commentary on the human condition, LOGH would've been an amazing show to watch if it weren't so blatantly biased toward an autocracy run by a level-headed ruler (seriously Beatnik: what the FUCK were you on when you wrote your LOGH reviews?). As a work of science fiction, it's far too tedious to even be considered entertaining by casual standards. Say what you will about stuff like Star Wars and Star Trek, but at least they influenced generations of people and led to the development of innovations that we currently make use of to this day and age (i.e. HUDs, cell phones, bionic hands, etc). LOGH did nothing of the sort and by the end of it all, this show is nothing more than Portal if you were to lack ANY surface to put the portals onto. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a fat guy on the internet talking shit about animu.\nAnyway, that's all for now. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n***\nSIEG KAISER REINHARDT!!!\nDo note that even though I gave LOGH a 5/10 on my review of it, it's not indicative of what I actually think the show deserves. Holistically, it feels just about right at a 7/10 but I don't like it enough to give it a 7. I was so tempted to just give it a 5/10 on my list again, but I need to break up the monotony.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=85,   ["text"]="                          \n    Overview:\nIt finally happened. I'm finally going to review what is probably the most beloved anime on all of MAL. An anime so sacred that even trolls on 4chan don't dare to insult it and sully its glorious name! I'm sure everyone reading this review is already quite aware how amazing this anime is, so I am going to talk about WHY it's so good, why you should watch it, and even discuss some minor imperfections (gasp). I'm finally on Summer break from medical school, so I can afford to write a long review! I picked the right series for this!\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is\n          \n        so grand scale and epic in terms of plot complexity and number of characters, that I feel it would overwhelm the reader if I actually tried during this review to summarize everything that happens in the plot and describe all the characters. This review would be at least 20 Microsoft Word pages long! Instead, I shall divide the review into strong points and minor imperfections.\nWARNING! SPOILERS!!!!\nWhy is LOTGH so good?\n1. The characters. It has an absolutely massive cast of characters that captures a wide range of personality types, morality, and world outlooks. I could write ALL DAY talking about the different characters, so instead I am just going to talk about the main 2 characters. The main character is the ambitious Reinhardt von Lohengramm, who wishes to overthrow the corrupt monarchy and conquer the galaxy to create a new age of prosperity with him leading it. Reinhardt seems to take personality traits and characteristics from several historical figures including Fredrick the Great, Julius Caesar, and Alexander the Great. For example, like Julius Caesar he sees a less than satisfactory government and believes that he is the man that can lead his nation to greatness, even if it means overturning the old order. Also like Julius Caesar, he dies immediately after establishing his empire and doesn't live to enjoy the fruit of his labor. This would also be true of Japan's Oda Nobunaga, who ended the Warring States period and unified Japan, only to get betrayed by one of his generals and forced to commit suicide. Reinhardt actually dies of natural causes unlike those 2, but the result is the same. Like Fredrick the Great, Reinhardt is absolutely brilliant, yet highly introverted and emotionally distant. Also like Fredrick, he is only truly close to one trusted male assistant, leading many to question his heterosexuality. Interestingly, Reinhardt shares this latter trait with Alexander as well. Reinhardt will sometimes resort to ruthless tactics to accomplish his goals, but he has a strong moral conscience  and suffers whenever he does. This internal conflict gives depth to Reinhardt's character and makes him easily the most interesting character to watch. Note that I used the word interesting and not necessarily most likeable. \nThe most likeable character for most viewers is actually the series deuteragonist, named Yang Wenli.  Although Yang is extremely likeable and I too love Yang, he is simply too perfect and lacks human flaws that the audience can identify with. He doesn't resemble any historical generals because no one that nice was ever a successful general. The only person Yang resembles is the tank commander from the video game Valkyria Chronicles. Like Valkyria's Welkin Gunther, Yang is a highly quirky, loveable goofball that also happens to be the world's greatest tactician, but despite his godlike gift for military tactics, he doesn't want to be in the military and wishes to be a teacher, but feels obligated to continue protecting the lives of his men once he starts serving. Perhaps Yang's closest link to several historical generals is his unabashed alcoholism and propensity to get sauced. However, Yang is known for never just throwing men at the obstacle, always having highly intricate strategies, and almost always winning the kill ratio. None of these things could EVER be said of fellow drunken general Ulysses S. Grant, an absolute butcher whose block headed tactics made Georgy Zhukov look like Yang Wenli by comparison. Grant's idea of an intricate plan was telling his men to charge the enemy until the enemy ran out of bullets. Ultimately, Yang is simply too perfect for his own good, which effects his character depth and overall development. I still love him though!\n2. The Politics and Themes. If you thought Game of Thrones had a complex tapestry of politics, then you haven't seen LOTGH. Not only is the sheer number of subplots that the show manages to perfectly tie together impressive, but the show deals with real world problems of governance. Like the epic novel \"War and Peace\" used war to examine philosophical problems, and arguments ranging from agricultural reform to the \"Great Man\" theory of history, LOTGH uses war to examine the question of whether corrupt democracy is truly better than a well led monarchy. Instead of just spoon feeding the audience the answer that democracy is better and monarchy sucks like Victor Hugo spent about 400 pages doing in his epic novel \"Les Misrables\", LOTGH actually examines the benefits and flaws of both systems and allows the viewer to make their own decision. Holy Shit! LOTGH arguably tackled a topic better than Hugo, one of the greatest novelists of all time. I'm not saying LOTGH is a better work of art obviously since Hugo wins the prose contest by...quite a bit. I'm saying that in terms of debating a key topic, LOTGH really did a better job and for that deserves some serious credit! In terms of literature, LOTGH reminds me quite a bit of Asimov's Foundation series, mixed with Star Wars so it isn't quite so boring and without the absolute obsession with math. Although as an author, Asimov probably has Tanaka beat by about 50 IQ points with a jaw dropping confirmed 175 vs. probably around 125 for Tanaka. However...I actually like LOTGH more than Foundation as a work of art! I'm serious! I'm not saying it is objectively better since valid arguments could be made in favor of Foundation , but I AM saying that I personally liked it a LOT more!\n3. The Music. If you love classical music than THIS is your anime. Fuck Shigatsu! This has a HUGE selection of great composers and classical works including Mahler, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Schubert, and of course Wagner in keeping with the extreme length of this series. All music is performed by top rated orchestras, so it sounds fantastic! Although Bebop or Rurouni Kenshin probably have the best ORIGINAL soundtracks, LOTGH probably has the best non-original and best overall soundtrack in all of anime!\n\nNow is the part of the review that may anger some people. If you are such a raging LOTGH fanboy that any criticism makes you angry, you may wish to stop reading here.\n\nWhy might people NOT like LOTGH?\n1. The plot. Didn't I just get done explaining how awesome the plot was? Yes I did, but that doesn't mean it is perfect. It still does do some things that might annoy picky viewers, as I will explain. The entire series involves massive space battles and intricate battlefield tactics that the author Tanaka learned from reading military history. The problem is that he uses REAL battlefield tactics like semi-circle formation, phalanx, the oblique echelon formation used at the Battle of Leuctra in Ancient Greece. So what is the problem with this? Those tactics were designed for fighting on a 2 dimensional plane where your opponents can move side to side and back and forward, but NOT up and down...like if you were FIGHTING IN OUTER SPACE! The 2 BRILLIANT tacticians Yang Weng Li and Fuhrer Reinhardt play 3-D chess using exclusively 2-D strategies. Another problem is that LOTGH makes the HIGHLY unlikely assumption that space warfare will closely resemble land warfare in the 1700s where winning is determined by raw infantry numbers and field position. Each army has about 50,000 mini-star destroyers, which basically replace individual soldiers. The battles are then based off classical battles that Tanaka read about. Space warfare in my opinion would much more likely resemble naval warfare, where navies are ranked by \"tonnage\" NOT total numbers. A fleet of 11 Nimitz class Aircraft carriers would annihilate an armada of 50,000 speed boats. Naval wars are won and lost not by numbers, but rather by a smaller number of big, important boats. The Empire is revealed to have a giant fortress ripoff of the Death Star that was able to devastate the entire Alliance fleet on 5 occasions with its Death beam. Yet despite the existence of this technology, the empire makes 1 immobile Death Star and 50,000 Star Destroyers. If they had used the same resources to make about 20 mobile Death Stars, they would have slaughtered the Alliance with ease. I guess Tanaka never played Masters of Orion 2? \nLOTGH also puts WAY too much emphasis on brilliant generals being the factor that wins and loses wars using the \"Great Man\" theory of history that no historian has taken seriously since Napoleon lost 200 years ago. Wars are won and lost by logistics, which speaking of logistics brings me to another problem: The logistics, world building, and timeline of this series! Firstly, I will defend Tanaka by saying that some authors like Dostoevsky care a LOT more about their themes, messages, and characters, than they do about the plot element. This would actually describe the majority of esteemed classical authors, so Tanaka is in good company by not caring as much about the plot. However, that doesn't actually excuse the author from being completely sloppy with the plot and creating plotholes and continuity errors out the ass! \nTanaka doesn't give a FUCK about the plot, and I will absolutely prove it to you! If you look at the timeline, you will notice that in 150 years a group of 400,000 refugees were able to increase their population to 400 million by the time of the first encounter between the Alliance and Empire. This was BEFORE, immigration from the Empire bolstered the Alliance population. An isolated population was able to increase by 1,000 times in 8 generations. Also keep in mind that this was without MASSIVE cloning, because the Alliance citizens are very diverse and clearly they aren't all clones produced on a conveyor belt like the Clone Troopers in Star Wars. Maybe they were mass produced test tube babies with lots of egg and semen samples to make a diverse crop with artificial insemination? It never states this, so I think it is more likely that Tanaka simply wasn't thinking about the logistics of his timeline. This becomes more likely when you consider the following fuck up. We learn that Earth had a population of 20 billion before a nuclear war reduced it to 1 billion around 2050 AD. The vast majority of the remaining 1 billion people leave Earth and colonize space, leaving just a few million people on highly irradiated and inhospitable Earth. Yet 200 years later, the colonies fight a war with Earth and slaughter 5 billion people by nuking Earth from orbit. Why the FUCK were 5 billion people living on a post nuclear war Earth when we had colonized dozens of planets by that time? Unless the 5 million or so stragglers fucked their brains out and increased 1,000 times in 200 years, which once again is impossible (Nigeria tried HARD and only managed 17X growth in 200 years), or a shitload of people migrated back to a nuclear wasteland out of sheer idiocy. It gets worse. We hear again and again how Earth was rendered completely uninhabitable after the 2nd nuking, yet at the end of the series...there are motherfuckers shown living on Earth again less than a thousand years later! The series went on so long that Tanaka just completely forgot what he wrote! These are the kind of mistakes and highly questionable logistics that plague the timeline. This is a plot that is best examined from a distance, because the closer you look, the more you notice shit like this.\n2. the art. Since this is an older series, the art and animation is fairly dated. This didn't bother me, but it might bother some viewers. \n3. The pacing. This series is LOOONG! I mean like Longcat long. It is also extremely slow at times and requires a large amount of patience. LOTGH fans will tell people, \"don't worry, it starts getting good around episode 60!\". The sad thing is that they aren't entirely joking. Not every anime watcher will want to watch a series where the first 26 episodes are basically just an introduction.\n4. The sorrow. Do you have a favorite character? He's going to die. I fucking guarantee it. EVERY loveable character dies in this fucking series, and they don't die happy old men.\n\nOverall:\nAs much as I bash MAL's ratings and question the dogma of anime forums like reddit and /a/ on 4chan , I will admit that with Legend of the Galactic Heroes...people actually got it right. This REALLY is a great anime that deserves all the praise it gets! Is it a perfect anime with zero flaws? No. I think I just demonstrated a few reasons why some people might not think so. However, I personally really like this series overall and give it a very well deserved 9/10.\n        "},

It showcases two of the most dynamic characters in fictional history with Yang and Reinhard, and its pacing exists as a subliminal crescendo, all up to the final episode… possibly the greatest episode of all. As so many have said before me, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the pinnacle of entertainment as we know it.\nNOTE: I will attempt to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. To those who want to discuss the show in more depth, feel free to PM me! \nAt its beginning, LotGH appears to be a classic good versus evil epic. The revered, yet unassuming historian Yang Wenli is everything you want a main protagonist to be: likable, reserved and highly intelligent. Meanwhile Reinhard von Lohengramm, the “Blonde Brat” as he’s referred to by his adversaries, is a military minded genius who will stop at nothing to become the greatest leader in all the galaxy. However, these stereotypes are easily debunked as more of the character’s backstories and motives are explored, launching the series into a tangled web of empathy and thoughts of making “Team Yang” or “Team Reinhard” shirts to wear while debating with your fellow weeaboo friends about who’s better. Yoshiki Tanaka’s crafting of these characters was on par with some of the greatest authors of our time. And for Studio Artland to actually adapt the novels as well as they did, speaks volumes for the anime industry of the 80’s and 90’s as a whole. \nThe worldbuilding in LotGH is magnificent. There are some other anime that have attempted to tackle politics in a fictional setting (Planetes, Code Geass), but the way they’re handled here is as effortless as you could get. Rather than take 5 minutes to internal monologue about why things are the way they are (like in more present day anime), LotGH SHOWS you what makes the world tick through character interactions and atmospheric scenery. It’s really a shame how dumbed down anime has become over the years, when studios feel the need to pander to the lowest common denominator. You truly feel like a fly on the wall, seemingly dropped into the middle of this 150 year space war between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Association. The dialogue is often loquacious, but purposeful, and the script contains some of the greatest quotes I’ve ever encountered in books, movies or any artistic media. \nIt is true that certain parts of LotGH can seem dry or slow. In a time when anime viewers are endlessly barraged with a slew of exaggerated action scenes and fanservice, our attention span has greatly diminished into that of a goldfish, myself included. This is a necessary evil given the approach to its subject matter. Countless similar series have handled massive battles and politics with a sense of urgency or raucous melodrama. LotGH takes a more realistic approach to the conduct of war, and I had some serious respect for that. With a genre that can be so mindless, the production staff and writers actually went the extra mile to make character’s actions believable and intriguing. However, it’s only natural with an anime of this size that there are some less interesting moments. Monster has some boring episodes, Hunter X Hunter has some too. That’s not to say any of it is “filler” by standard definition… just less action or weighty scenarios than other episodes. Despite this potential opinion, the pacing remains flawless for such a robust series. Over the entire course of its 110 episode run, I couldn’t think of a single “bad” segment. Even if I didn’t understand the episode or character interaction at the time, nothing in LotGH is without meaning.  \nWith an enormous and diverse cast rivaling the acclaimed Game of Thrones, there is someone for any personality type to grow attached to. Yang, Reinhard, Kircheis, Reuenthal, Oberstein, Dusty, Julian, Schonkopf, Mittermeyer will become household names. Each have their own passions, desires, morals and motives, crafting a remarkable synergy amongst them. And similarly to the aforementioned series, no one is safe in LotGH. Many manly tears were shed over the course of the series, a tribute to the mastery of character development exhibited by the writers and Tanaka himself. It has been said that this is actually the largest cast of characters in anime history, but even with that said I never seemed to get confused of which character was which as I have in other smaller series (Joker Game etc). So many of the characters receive development that it's hard to say which of them were actually “main” characters. They all seemed to play an integral part to the over arcing story. Not since Monster have I grown so attached to side characters (bless you Wolfgang Grimmer!) that I often ached for more of their screentime.\nAs mentioned in the worldbuilding paragraph, the atmosphere and themes are basically tangible entities. Everything feels so authentic that it’s hard to believe the entire galaxy was conceived by mere pen and paper. Aside from the major players in the galactic space conquest (Empire/FPA), there are few rogue or radical organizations around to further stir the pot. Evangelical religion is covered through the existence of the Terraist church, and the Dominion of Fezzan exists as a relatively neutral region facilitating trade between the two main foes. Pseudo-terrorism is present through the display of the Patriotic Knight Corp’s power and there also exists a royal lineage in which Reinhard plans to disrupt. With the sheer number of players and moving parts in LotGH’s setting, it made predicting the next plot twist nearly impossible. Freedom, peace, corruption, loyalty, betrayal and justice all come to a head in the series at some point, leaving a pondering point at the end of almost any episode’s conclusion.\nSomething I also learned from watching this is how much more involved I become in an anime when the majority of the cast is older. Over the years we've grown accustomed to 14 or 15-year-olds doing fantastic things: solving world issues, competing at the highest level in combat and having the intellect of a worldly Sage. While all of this only seeks to pander to the target audience, I feel that having older characters adds credibility to the plot the other anime just can't bolster. Furthering this opinion is the realization that even strategic masterminds like Reinhard and Yang can make mistakes. The length of LotGH gives the writers the freedom to fully explore both the successes and failures of the two protagonists. In doing so, the viewers uncover an even larger piece of their characterization, another strength of the series. \nAnother piece of the anime that some may find offputting is the dated artstyle. Considering it’s almost 30 years old now, I can cut the flak and give it the benefit of the doubt. Honestly, I have a much bigger problem with modern anime that have sloppy animation because it’s what many studios pride themselves on nowadays. LotGH is not meant to be laden with captivating animation, it’s meant to engage its viewers on a more mental level. I personally see this as a strength of sorts, since it becomes a less distracting portion of the anime. I can concentrate more on the situations and motives behind the characters, and less about the accuracy of a certain explosion. At the end of the day, we all like to be entertained, and LotGH is certainly not “badly” animated. It’s just showing its age in 2017. Some of you may even grow attached to the artstyle due to the more realistic character models. \nThe soundtrack is exceptional. Though certainly not for everyone, the classical backdrop accompanied the space opera well. After all, there’s nothing better than watching an enormous battleship go down in flames to the tune of a little Bach. That’s some magical stuff. Due to the unoriginal score, it allowed the tracks to be evenly used and distributed throughout the episodes, creating a score that rarely ever duplicates itself. I recently downloaded the OST in order to help me study for school, since there’s rarely any vocals… and I’ve heard classical music helps you retain information better :D The OP’s and ED’s all emphasized the ebb and flow of the series, though I’ll admit I often skipped them because I was so focused on the anime itself. Over 300 seiyuu’s took part in the 110 episode epic, and the quality is readily apparent. Ryo Horikawa’s role of Reinhard is second only to his portrayal of Vegeta, and the veteran Norio Wakamoto (Cell, Nichijou’s narrator) did an excellent job voicing Reuenthal. \nSo if you haven’t figured it out by now, I absolutely loved LotGH. With an outstanding cast, a meticulous script and some of the best thematic exploration you’ll ever see in entertainment, there aren’t many anime that could fill its shoes. I highly recommend (as it was to me) that you watch two of the three prequels (My Conquest is the Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War) before digesting this behemoth. They expound upon Yang and Reinhard’s backstories more, and offer a better interpretation of their rise to fame in the galaxy war. The third prequel, Golden Wings wasn’t produced by Artland and Madhouse, and thus should be avoided at all costs. There’s also a few other spin-offs to enjoy after finishing the main series in which I will watch after my current memory of the series begins to lapse.\nThe biggest problem of the entire series? Easy, when it’s over. As well executed as the ending is in LotGH, it’s a tough act to follow. There are few anime I’ve heard no one complain about, and this is certainly one of them. Those who actually give it the chance it deserves will leave as a withered heap of their previous self. The series had such an impact on me that I considering quitting anime altogether after I finished it. I thought, there can’t be anything better than that eh? (until I remembered I haven’t seen FMA yet…) I would seriously recommend LotGH to anyone. Tell your anime friends, your parents, your mailman and even your grandparents about it. Take the time and watch it, but please don’t watch it until you have 100+ anime under your belt. I say this both to put things in the industry in perspective, and to help you appreciate its greatness more. If the first meal you ate was filet mignon, and it was the only one left on the planet, there wouldn’t be a passion for eating good food anymore.  For now, I’ll attempt to march on and allow LotGH to serve as a constant reminder of how great this medium can be, and how much more that can still be done. Anime is a special thing that we tend to take for granted from time to time, which is really a shame. Maybe if more series with the quality and depth of this ever come around again, the mainstream media will begin to take anime seriously.\nAfter all, Legend of the Galactic Heroes proves there’s got to be more to anime than cat ears, J-Pop and waifu pillows… amirite?\nThanks to everyone who voted in the poll to watch this and thanks to all for reading!  \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    For a while, some of the people who I usually talk to on MAL have come to claim that I am some kind of contrarian, due to my refusal to shout unconditional praise for some works considered to be “classics” in the same fashion a few circles do. I don’t feel that is true, though, when taking into account my general stance (just look at my other reviews!), it just so happens that I have a very particular way of judging any given work, hipster glasses off. For that same reason, when I began watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes, or Ginga Eyiuu Densetsu, I\n          \n        tried to free myself from any external preconception, so that by the end only my own judgment would be as fair a result as possible, coming only from my own perspective and no one else’s. Currently, the anime sits at 8th place among the highest scored titles on MAL, with an average score of 9,10, so you might imagine that analyzing it is kind of a big deal. It also has a somewhat small but quite dedicated audience that takes it in very high regard, besides being a generally respected work. This is the point where the petulant me raises his voice among the crowd to say “Well, I have some disagreements to make here!”\nJust for fun, I’m going to call this one GED, because fuck me if I had to write any of the acronyms the series has whenever I need to refer to it!\nStory and Characters\nOh boy, this one is a beast! As you might imagine, properly tackling a show like GED is not necessarily an easy task if you plan on doing it in depth. Based on a series of novels by Yoshiki Tanaka, this OVA series has a total run time of 110 episodes, the storyline is divided into two main fronts, a fair share of it is dedicated to politics and it’s fucking packed with dialogue! For the sake of my sanity (I still have it, don’t worry!), this will be another review where I’ll tackle the different aspects of the series separately, in order to voice praises and criticisms in an easily digestible way. By the way: due to its scope and the themes the series tackles, both positives and negatives are heightened in the big picture, so if it seems that I’m being overly harsh to poor GED, keep in mind that there are equally strong positives to help mitigate the issues I’m about to discuss, and people have talked to death about such positives, so allow me to be somewhat picky this time.\nThe best way to begin this will be to address who are the main forces at play in the story, so let’s get to them. Two major forces are at war in the universe of GED: the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire, represented by Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengram, respectively, the two characters to receive major focus from the narrative. The two develop a rivalry between themselves and the presence of one in the battlefield is bound to call for the other. Starting with the Alliance, Yang Wenli is the tosser who hates coffee. I’m sorry, there’s more to his character, but I still can’t forgive him for that posh attitude. Yang is laid-back, somewhat lazy, quite introspective and has a strong devotion to the concept of democracy. This last trait is highly emphasized by the show, although it tends to get quite overbearing at some points, making his character come off as very preachy. In these instances it seems like he is more of a mouth-piece of the concept itself, besides spouting general observations about history. Humm, I wonder if this is what people who hate Urobuchi mean when they criticize his characters.\nClose to Yang is Julian Minci, a teenager who lives under Yang’s tutelage after losing his parents, who shows to be highly curious and with far more active and responsible demeanor than Yang. Julian is mostly relegated to secondary role, but around episode 82, when the rivalry between Yang and Reinhard is resolved, he becomes the focus on the Alliance’s side. Episode 83, by the way, has a particularly great character moment between Julian and Frederica Greenhill, Yang’s wife, who decides to take political responsibilities after spending most of her screen-time being just an add-on to the plot. For the most part, it seems that his arc is going to be that of becoming just a doppelganger of Yang (seriously, he begins to speak and monologue just like Yang, at some points), up until near the end of the series, when he takes action to be an agent of change in the manner Yang is not capable of. Also close to Yang is Schenkopp, captain of the Knights of the Rose, an elite group of soldiers feared in combat. Having been born in the Empire, but exiled from there still in his childhood, Schenkopp works as the practical balance to Yang’s over-analytical personality and often offers him questions in regard to the validity of his believes.\nOn the Empire side there is Reinhard, a young, authoritative and slightly idealistic but still down to earth rising military prodigy (on the anime’s standards, that is!) who decides to make a name during the war in order to garner power and influence so he can one day save his sister, who was taken as a concubine by the emperor, as well as overthrow the current ruling force of the Galactic Empire and reform the rules of the galaxy. It’s visible that some of the influence held by Reinhard at the beginning comes from the preference the emperor has for his sister, but that is also supported by his talent and effectiveness in combat. Reinhard hates the nobles and the current ruling dynasty, the Goldenbaum, and his desire to be the next regent puts a target on his back, as he gains the contempt from the nobles. The emperor could not care less, funny enough, the guy just wants to enjoy life and wait for death. The closest friend of Reinhard is Siegfried Kircheis (I’m starting to get a slight bias against Germanic names!), a man who has been in love with Reinhard’s sister, Annerose, and vows to help him conquer the galaxy. Kircheis is extremely loyal to his friend and serves as his moral compass at the start of the series. His influence decreases as the series goes on, though, and that brings the most visible changes in Reinhard’s character, making him more ambitious and prideful. In case you are wondering, this is a positive.\nNext in the line of influence is Oberstein. He is cunning, stoic, an absolutely deceiving bastard full of dubious intent who constantly challenges the viewer into pondering what his real intentions are. In other words, Oberstein is amazing, the best character in the show, every moment he’s on screen is a better moment and if you disagree you are just flat out wrong. I’m not biased. Due to his methods of getting results, he is compared to a medicine that creates strong adverse effects and garners a great amount of distrust and hatred from other officials. Bunch of ungrateful fucks! His character offers a great contrast to that of Reinhard. While Reinhard is good natured at heart and charismatic, he is still ambitious for glory and cherishes the pride of battle, which are heroic traits on the surface, but still result in the deaths of millions. Oberstein, in the other hands, is not afraid of being hated, seen as the bad guy and of using methods that are considered cowardly or dishonorable, but still minimize damage and the loss of lives.\nFrom Reinhard’s admirals, the most notable ones are Mittenmeyer and Reuental, two close friends who share their leader’s disdain for the nobility. While Mittenmeyer is optimistic, strongly tied to family and somewhat naïve with politics, Reuental is dreary, cynical and ambitious, which makes some of their interactions almost comedic in the way that Reuental reads into other characters in a manner Mittenmeyer is oblivious of. The remaining officials under Reinhard’s command are very straight-forward and simplistic characters, but they have just the necessary amount of depth for the position they occupy within the narrative, which is not detrimental to the series. Let’s be honest, folks, would it really be important to have Bittenfeld or Lennenkamp be fleshed out any more? On the side of the Alliance, though, I’ll not forgive Poplan, that guy needed a major overhaul in writing. He appears frequently enough to be a relevant character, yet 90% of his dialogue is of the same breed: remind the audience he’s a womanizer, crack a joke about him being a womanizer and occasionally take a cheap jab at Attenborough. This is not quirky, this is one-dimensional!\nThe biggest drawback for GED in the character department is the antagonists. While the bulk of the conflict revolves around Yang and Reinhard’s rivalry, a sizeable portion of conflict also comes from specific antagonistic forces acting against each one specifically, or against both at once, like Rubinsky and the Cult of Terra. The problem with such antagonists, though, is that, except for Rubinsky, they are poorly written, one-dimensional, severely deficient on the brain-department and meet their end in anticlimactic fashion. Now, you may ask why I’m being critical of the antagonists being lackluster while cutting some slack for Reinhard’s officials, so let me clarify: conflict is what moves a narrative; therefore if the agents who bring forth that conflict are subpar it damages the work as a result, as it implies that not enough thought was put into that aspect of the story.\nThe biggest offenders, when it comes to characterization at least, are the corrupt politicians from the Alliance who decide to go against Yang. Most of them are not even characters themselves, just plot devices that appear in the narrative in order to bring trouble upon Yang, having absolutely no logical reason to do so. They have nothing to gain from throwing the guy under the bus, ESPECIALLY once the war has ended, and no justifiable reason to go against the one who was their biggest asset during the war. For all intents and purposes, they are shooting themselves in the foot out of pure irrational spite. The ones who get some semblance of characterization are shown to be pathetically easy to manipulate buffoons with no vision of the danger they willingly throw themselves into because of unfounded fears. On this side of the galaxy there is also the Order of the Patriotic Knights, who are big offenders of logic. This order is a known terrorist group, under the control of Truniht, the Alliance’s major asshole, and yet they are somehow seen making public speeches and attack dissident voices in broad daylight, at the exact moment it would bring more attention and raise suspicions about their connections to Truniht (just see episode 03).\nAgainst Reinhard there are the nobles from the empire, who see on him a threat to their position, this one at least being a grounded and logical fear, as Reinhard genuinely wants to reform the empire and bring an end to the nobles’ abuses. These nobles, however, are fundamentally one-dimensional characters. Think about the very stereotypical picture of an entitled douchebag noble you’ve seen plenty of times in fiction and you’ll get exactly what these characters are. They show absolute disdain for the lower classes, see themselves as having some sort of inherent superiority, similar to kings who saw themselves as chosen by God in centuries past, are easily prone to act recklessly and blatantly stupid when their pride is hurt and, when cornered, become absolute cowards. No wonder they are the first ones to go down.\nActing against both sides you have Rubinsky and the Cult of Terra. Rubinsky is the feudal lord of Phezzan, an independent planet whose economy is heavily based on trading between the Alliance and the Empire. He happens to be the antagonist with the better characterization, being treacherous, ambitious, karma-savvy, but still highly self-aware and with a hint of spite on his tongue. Sadly, Rubinsky is not immune to stupidity, as his major plan during the mid-section of the story suffers from a major flaw that the audience can see coming from 10 miles away. Seriously Rubinsky, did you really not expect Reinhard to come rudely knocking on your door so he could get to your neighbor of the other side? Ultimately, though, the major issue with Rubinsky is that he becomes simply a plot device by the end. He appears when needed during the second half to instigate some conflict, which will turn out mostly ineffectual by the end, and when that role is exhausted he is simply discarded by the narrative.\nThat same fate is shared by the Cult of Terra, the agents of several plot-relevant events throughout the series. In essence, the cult is a religious group who sees Earth as a sacred land and holds the restoration of its power and relevance as their ultimate goal, an objective they are willing to use terrorism to fulfill. While the main goal and core belief of the group is clear, the nature of the Cult of Terra as a religion is fundamentally left unexplored. Here is something that bugged me as I watched the series: why do people even join this cult? Earth, by this point, is a completely irrelevant planet, populated by just a few million people and with very little natural and technological resources, so making it the center of humanity again would be unfeasible. This even raises some inconsistences as to how did the Cult have enough money to finance the rise of Phezzan as an independent state. Aside from that, the ideas that could make the cult attractive to people around the galaxy are never explored, its fundaments never brought up. The entire religion serves as nothing more than a generic antagonist, complete with an unfaithful douchebag leader and servants willing to blindly sacrifice themselves with no prospect of victory, so it’s easy to conclude that the religious aspect was implemented simply because it was the easiest to insert without raising as many questions as some other brand of villain would. Religions act based on faith, so who cares if it doesn’t make sense within the story anyway?\nFor the sake of comparison, look at the religion of Vodarac in Eureka Seven, or the Church of Yaldabaoth from Arslan Senki, another of Tanaka’s works (I don’t even care if you think it isn’t a good series, the parallel is valid!). In Eureka Seven, it’s explained about the meaning of the concept of Vodarac, its connection to the Coralian and what it means to its believers, as well as the effect of it in the narrative and the way it ties to the faith itself. In the case of the Church of Yaldabaoth, being the world of Arslan Senki one with rudimentary science, it’s logical that people would attach themselves to a religion that seeks to explain the universe, especially one that is the official faith of its nation and holds executing “infidels” as common practice. In both series the reasoning for people to join the faith is clearly defined and doesn’t raise contradictions in regards to their role within the story. Taking Earth out of the equation, the Cult of Terra could easily be turned into a terrorist group with political motivation and their role in the series would have been essentially the same. Throughout the series, the Cult continuously loses power, until it decides to do a desperate attack and is finally ended in anti-climactic fashion.\nSpeaking of political motivations, let’s talk about something where the series excels at. A very commendable trait of GED’s depiction of politics is that it doesn’t depict only the game of power, but it also includes the human factor within it. Paying some attention to modern and old politics will show that personal beliefs, morally influenced ideologies and the desire to be an agent of good play a role in governments almost as big as the standard game of interests and intrigues. Not to say that the series leaves aside that aspect either, you can easily see that at play within the nobles of the Empire and even more within the Alliance, where corrupt politicians abuse power in order to manipulate media and keep their levels of influence. If you’ve read various analyses of the series, you might have heard a few times (or many, as I have!) the main question it brings up: what is better, a corrupt democracy or a just autocracy? While the characters on the Alliance side, or at least the good ones, are very devote to the principal of democracy, as it’s in their belief that a govern that still has to bow to the people’s will is fairer, the show itself seems to have a slight bias towards autocracy, perceptible in the way it treats Reinhard’s actions and the effect of his government.\nAnother trait that is commonly highly praised by the fans of GED is its battles, both in the epic scale present in them, as well as the strategies in display. Sadly, this is another aspect I’ll have to criticize. There are issues in the depiction of battle tactics, in the presentation and in the writing itself. Let’s start with the strategies. I suppose video-games don’t exist in this distant future, since even though these battles take place in space, where they would have freedom to position and maneuver fleets in all directions, nobody takes advantage of the z-axis. The vast majority of space battles take place in a strict two-dimensional plane, and you can count in one hand the amount of instances someone remembered they could move up or down with their massive spaceships. This leads to the most glaring problem: the vast majority of the tactics used are predictable and simplistic. What can eventually break the monotony is the introduction of futuristic elements, like Zeffir particles, but for the most part such strategies involve just fleet positioning that Hannibal would consider just part of a beginners guide: multiple times it’s visible when some fleet (usually lead by Attenborough) is retreating to lure the enemy into their plan, or when one fleet is about to be surrounded by the enemy, the biggest offenders in this case being Bittenfeld and Fahrenheit in episode 79. There’s another aspect to this issue, but this one I’d like to discuss when talking about the presentation.\nEventually, this creates a disconnect between what is shown on screen to what the show keeps telling us in regards to Yang and Reinhard’s supposed strategic brilliance. For my money, I’d bet on Bucock being the one that truly displays to be an strategic mastermind, as even though he only leads two battles, both of them are masterfully conducted. In both instances, Bucock makes excellent use of the scenario surrounding the troops, predicts enemy movement, leads them into successful traps and manages to hold off vastly bigger armies. For all accounts, he only loses because the plot demands so. GED actually makes a strong case for the value of experience against natural talent, if you look at it that way, as Merkatz also shows to be a much more cunning military leader than his young counterparts.\nWhen it comes to issues with the writing, it’s visible on how the usual antagonistic forces that get in the way of the main heroes are defeated by their own incompetence, to a point that can sometimes become contradictory to what their characters are supposed to be. When faced by Yang or Reinhard, it’s not uncommon for admirals and generals to commit grossly amateurish mistakes that the audience itself can see through. Here is an example: one of the first battles in the series, designed to “prove” Reinhard’s genius, is one where his fleet is outnumbered AT LEAST 3 to 1 by the Alliance’s army. Sounds impressive, doesn’t it? Now here is a question; if you are close to engaging the enemy in combat and your troops have vast numerical superiority over theirs, how do you proceed: position your army in a manner that allows you to quickly surround and dispatch the enemy forces, minimizing damage taken and preventing them from escaping, or you separate your soldiers in troops small enough to be inferior to your enemy and position them in a way they can easily be picked apart and destroyed? Because this last one was the method chosen by the Alliance’s fleet. By all accounts, Reinhard took the advantage not because of any brilliant strategy, but because of his enemy’s crushing idiocy. I say that these are issues with the writing because, these characters being experienced commanders, such rookie mistakes should be out of the equation if the idea is to highlight the efficiency of the main cast or make the antagonist seem like even slightly competent characters.\nThe last issue I’d like to discuss in this section is the role of the narrator within the work. Now, the existence of a narrator in a work like this is not an issue; when you have a large universe with organization far different from what your audience is accustomed, it’s natural to include narration to ease your audience in, so that the elements of the story don’t come out as jarring. The problem with the narrator in GED, and this is possibly the most pervasive issue, is how overbearing it is. This obnoxious prick constantly chimes in the most varied and inappropriate situations to give away stuff that could be easily inserted within dialogue or individual thoughts without compromising the narrative, when he’s not giving away bafflingly pointless details. He blatantly spouts what the characters are feeling and thinking at certain moments, he narrates actions and emotions the exact moment after we saw the characters act it on screen, adding nothing to the scene (“Not being able to defeat Yang, Bittenfeld got extremely irritated” thanks, but I noticed that on my own!), he even feels the need to tell how many spoons of soup Reinhard ate! His is also one of the voices you’ll hear the most during battles, as they frequently opt to have days take place within an episode with only the narration explaining the events. This problem has a lot to do with the source material the anime was based on, the novels: that overbearing style of narration and the way certain events of the story are paced within the narrative are very characteristic of how a novel is written. The issue here is that GED was not translated from one media to the other in any smooth fashion, even as an anime, it retains a style of narration that is not fit for this media specifically. Since anime is an audiovisual media, it benefits more from having the scene and the characters themselves show what is going on, not having it spelled out for the viewer.\nPresentation\nLet’s be honest, folks: taking into consideration the amount of whisky, wine and beer consumed by these characters, I’d say half of the main to secondary cast should recognize they have some sort of drinking problem! I can’t be the only one who sees that!\nOk, going back to the space battles, let’s talk about that last issue I mentioned. As you watch the series, you’ll most likely notice these battles are presented in two manners: the first one, obviously, are those where we get an overview of the combat, with the massive spaceships firing at the enemy and hundreds being blown up in both sides; the other one is the fleet movement being displayed in the monitors and commented. The first point of contention here is the way the action displays how these battles evolve: the sequences of lasers getting fired are not enough to convey the flow of the battle, so most of the information about the combat is relayed by the characters in command, making the action itself lackluster. These sequences lack the flare that traditional action sequences have and it took me a while to understand why, but I would, controversially, say that the scope is the source of the issue. The numbers are all so high, counting on dozens of thousands of ships and millions of soldiers, that the series has difficulty properly framing that within the combats and simply displaying random ships being blow up doesn’t cut it, it’s not enough for the viewer to understand how those particular vessels being destroyed is in anyway meaningful to the big picture, when so many of them are shown in every battle and rarely anyone important is in them. Also, just looking at enormous ships far apart from each other be destroyed doesn’t pack the same variety and creativity seen in traditional action sequences the media can provide, like gunfights, swordfights or the tried-and-true mecha-battles, so the combats in GED don’t take long to seem somewhat “samey”.\nLet me get a bit light with the bashing, though, I can feel the target on my back itching. If you wanna know about the animation: it’s pretty good, son. It’s distinct, not featuring the most common visual tropes associated with anime, characters have varied designs, making it easily to distinguish them immediately and the series generally packs a unique visual identity, setting it apart within the media. Sometimes you can see a few shoddy frames, but the work generally has very stable animation quality. One aspect that might be divisive when it comes to the visual presentation is the Imperial’s infatuation with 1800s style fashion, architecture, furniture and pretty much everything else. Seriously, they even use gold coins to bribe a guy at one point! Whether you find this particular visual identity goofy, thematic relevant, stylistically clever or just plain unnecessarily is up to you, but it does raises some questions in regards to world consistency and logic. It took me 42 episodes to see the first security camera on the streets of an imperial city, for once, while none seemed to be present at the Emperor’s residence. When in focus is on the military aspect, though, there’s care put into making the pomp of each rank translate into their appearance, with uniforms distinct to common soldiers, generals, admirals and so forth.\nYou probably want me to talk about the soundtrack, which is composed of classical pieces, but here is the problem: I barely notice them! Perhaps that is because I was so focused on the dialogue and plot that I happen to miss them, but I generally could not remember the pieces that played throughout the series. Same can’t be said about the voice acting though, which is packed with classical voices from anime, like Shiozawa Kaneto (Rei, from Hokuto no Ken), Inoue Kazuhiko (Cyborg 009, Kakashi, etc), Horikawa Ryo (Vegeta) and Sakakibara yoshiko (the Puppet Master, from Ghost in the Shell), pulling their A-game here.\nPersonal Ramblings\nIt’s clear to many that, while critically acclaimed, GED is also somewhat of a niche product, so let’s do that exercise I like to bring up and try to understand why it garners such reputation. For once, the audience who composes fans of the series seems to be composed mostly by people who are drawn to older works, so having started in the late 80s certainly gives it that old-school appeal. The series also has a distinctive aesthetic that is a clear departure from the standard anime-look, even for the time it began serialization. That aesthetic possibly helped sediment it as a work of clearly serious tone, appealing for those who looked for something of more mature look within the media. Adding to that, the characters are mostly adults, certainly appealing for anime-fans who are somewhat tired of the overreliance on teenage/kid characters that we see throughout the media. Lastly, the theme of politics is one that is not seen so often even in other media, and seeing it being tackled gives an intelligent vibe to shows that are able to handle it properly. Also helps that the entire work is design to have a very classy feel to it.\nThis might not be the most accurate assessment to make, but I believe most people tend to look at anime only focusing on the big picture: the most surprising twists, the main actions protagonists partake, the big events in the plot. Looking solely at the big picture, Legend of the Galactic Heroes sure is an impressive work: whole solar systems are involved in the conflicts, battles feature impressive large numbers, it has long spamming plans taking place, deals with an universal concept and its main characters are noticeably treated as larger-than-life people (none of them up to Samus level, but hey, they do their best!). However, I think that when you look at it with your mind on the details is that the nuances, real qualities and flaws become a lot more noticeable, and when it comes to Legend of the Galactic Heroes, its qualities are surely strong and worth comenting, but its flaws are also quite persistent for it to be among what I consider to be the very best in anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=86,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Are you tired of Good Republic vs Evil Empire? Are you tired of archaic honor and pointless martyrdom? Are you tired of war dramas with runaway nationalism and selfless sacrifice to secure the government's next election victory?\nWell, look no further because Legend of the Galactic Heroes is tired of those tropes too. This is a show that takes political philosophy seriously and debates about it in a pretty analytical and argumentative way and at great length. Which is superior: a corrupt democracy or a virtuous autocracy? What good is having an election if the majority tramples on the rights of the minority? Does the legitimacy\n          \n        of government hinge on the method of election or achieved results? What are nations and does mankind even need them? Is there any point in following tradition for the sake of itself? Many of these ideas reflect those of real-world philosophers. Russell, Hume, Habermas, Wolff, you name it. \n\nThe setting of the story is the war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance, which has been going on for 150 years. The military encounters are colossal in size, with thousands of ships and millions of soldiers on each side. It is a space opera, alright. At first glance, the premise sounds black-and-white, but as the series advances, democracy will truly get challenged by autocracy.\nAnd I wasn't exaggerating the \"at great length\" bit. Adapted from a series of full-fledged novels, this show is 110 episodes long with no real filler in between. It simply has that much story to tell. This doesn't mean every episode is great; there are some bad ones here and there. Especially some of the early season 1 episodes on the Empire side felt redundant, but I can understand that they wanted to establish the initial state of the Empire. And some of the last season feels drawn out for wrapping things up, but for the most part the narrative holds together pretty well. The philosophical and political themes have also been integrated into the ongoing narrative and the related historical examinations.\nTo match the length, the cast is like a phonebook, and I mean that in a good sense. There are hundreds of named characters, ranging from military commanders to low-ranking servicemen and from top politicians to common citizens. And here's the thing: a large number of them are legit characters, not one-shot nobodies. Even a rudimentary understanding of the plot requires knowing most of them. \nStill, two characters can be identified as the protagonists of the story. Reinhard von Lohengramm is an Imperial military officer who is determined to take control of the Empire and reform it. He thinks that the most competent should rule. Usurpation of power is superior to inheriting it; the former takes effort and demonstrates skill, while the latter requires neither. His development presents us with the problem: you can have all the power in the world, but if you have to sacrifice everything to get it, is it worth anything in the end?\nOn the Alliance side we have Yang Wenli, the personification of philosophical anarchism. A man who wanted to become a historian but reluctantly became a soldier, he despises war but ironically is very efficient at it. He is a combat pragmatist and isn't afraid to use tricks that go against traditional military honor. He has a thoroughly established political philosophy, and he can talk about it for hours if he feels like it.\nBut this is not a two-man show. The rest of the cast are more than capable of developing as their own characters. Even a low-ranking soldier or a common civilian can throw in a good line at any moment.\n\n\"If it were a third rate TV anime, a dead protagonist can come back to life at the producers' convenience. But the world we live in is not such a convenient place.\" \n	‒ Legend of the Galactic Heroes\nThat is some serious self-awareness. Here deaths are plentiful and final. Plot armor has been thinned to the point where anyone is fair game: even the main characters. And given the large cast, the show likes to capitalize on this. Many of the deaths involve falling in battle, but there are also terrorist strikes, illnesses, and the fan favorite: old age. Just like in real life. Some characters have actually died long before the events of the show and are the stuff of documentaries. \nAnd no, they don't come back through magic or anything like that. Here death is not cheap, and therefore it is also more meaningful. Even someone as jaded and cynical as myself was actually moved by some of the deaths.\nThere is also a genuine sense that the events are driven by the individual desires of the characters. They intertwine to produce a narrative that is unpredictable while maintaining a measure of realism. No, obviously I'm not referring to the starships and such, but their societies are pretty realistic. Things like politics and economics actually make a difference here. It's essentially life. This is not a show; this is a world. People are born, live, and die, with their own dreams and grudges. Nations are built and crumble to dust. Events turn into history, to be told in documentaries. And I mean that literally; the show has entire episodes for these in-universe documentaries. \nHere, simply winning a war does not equal true victory. Simply overthrowing a government does not fix the problems of the country or ensure that your rule is secure. You have to take care of all the governance and administration that follows. How will you divide responsibility between the military and civilian leadership? How will you use the media to influence public opinion? How will you cope with terrorists reluctant to engage you in open warfare? How to fight against corruption? How much of the national budget can you sustainably reserve for the military? Despite the scifi setting, the lessons learned here could very easily be applied to our own world. \n\nMirroring the scale of the show itself, the soundtrack consists of 23 CDs of classical music. No objections to that, other than the fact that the overwhelming quantity makes it hard to remember when each song was played. The opening and ending songs vary in quality. Most are pretty mediocre to be honest, but the season 3 opening is more inspiring. The voice acting is very good, which is made twice as impressive by the sheer size of the voice acting cast.\nThe visual quality is lacking at first, as expected of an older anime, but it gradually improves. At least the visuals are used pretty decently. The characters look natural for the most part, and they did not cut corners in drawing large fleets.\n\nI already mentioned a few problems, but if I have to give a bit more criticism, here are some points.\n- For starters, episode previews can contain heavy spoilers, some of which have grown infamous. The narrator himself is guilty of spoilers sometimes. (Yes, there is a narrator in this show, by the way.)\n- We also have the usual problems in the area of realism in space operas, such as the lack of automation, old-fashioned technology in general, and some strange aspects of space travel. Why is it that you can only navigate at warp speed in specific corridors? Only because the author couldn't think of a better way to create a choke point. \n- And why would spaceships engage in traditional naval battles with strict and tight battle formations, often as if it was in 2D? It would make more sense to spread around and optimize positions more flexibly. It's possible that there are technobabble reasons for it, but the show was never very clear about it. Actually, never mind, these tactics wouldn't work for naval battles or even modern ground battles. Maybe some old-fashioned infantry showdowns, just maybe. You should probably watch this show more for the politics and philosophy than legit combat tactics. That being said, the battles were more enjoyable than in many anime where a handful of superpowered characters or mecha duke it out with no tactics worth mentioning.\n- This is related to the previous point, but some people point out that Yang and Reinhard (and perhaps some others) are too perfect and infallible in battle. They aren't entirely wrong. Everyone else in the universe is not exactly portrayed as useless, but it would be good for realism if the protagonists lost more often. The in-universe reason is that many of their opponents in battle are... well, idiots who rely on honor over planning. Either that or the difference in material is so great there's nothing to do. But that's no excuse; it's up to the author to set up better scenarios. Still, there are far worse examples of this in anime or fiction in general, so they aren't even the most overhyped tacticians around.\nThere was a line in the show: \"There are more than a few historic examples of geniuses being beaten by ordinary people.\" Too bad it doesn't turn into reality often enough.\n- For the most part the protagonists prefer to use diplomacy to avoid pointless battles, but there are exceptions, mostly out of personal pride. And as much as the show dislikes military values, there are still some points where the protagonists resort to military rituals for vacuous sentimental reasons. It's still far less annoying than in most war dramas though.\n- The show contains English and German with glaring misspelling or unnatural choice of words, which can be annoying. Not unheard of in anime, but it deserves a mention.\n- If you look hard enough, the show contains some dubious statements. Here's an example: in the first documentary episode, one of the interviewed historians asserts that the fall of religions leads to shortsighted egoism and widespread violence. This is realistically speaking complete nonsense, but I got the impression the narrative was on this guy's side.\n- Speaking of religion... Terraism, a religion that worships the Earth, gets the short straw in characterization and unfortunately ends up somewhat generic compared to its role in the story, though it isn't horrible by any means. \n- The Imperials also have their Nordic-inspired religion. It is mostly portrayed in a positive light but not taken terribly seriously while not being fully metaphorical either. What's up with that? Maybe the show should analyze religion more at a general level.\n- There is any number of smaller questions:\nWhy are most of the ships' cannons at the front? You could point them in any direction, right?\nHow did the exiles from the Empire populate the Alliance so fast?\nHow does Bittenfeld avoid getting sacked?\n\nDoes this rant of criticism warrant giving the show a lower score? Well, it isn't a ridiculous idea, but I can't think of anything better at the moment, so if I'm giving the 10 to something, it's this one.\nJust remember, \"Politics always takes vengeance on those who belittle it.\"\n        "},

It is not only one of the greatest anime series of all time, IMHO, but also one of the greatest science fiction series of all time. For both anime fans and science fiction fans it is a must see. \nWith the general praise for the show out of the way, a word of warning to potential viewers.

At 110 episodes (*plus* the\n          \n        side stories if you wish to get into those) it is something that you have to be prepared to devote the time toward, and those who are will reap considerable benefits. \nThis is not your typical anime, don't expect it to be action packed. But, rather instead, what you can look forward to is a space opera and political machinations that unfold over the series, with a enormous cast of characters, a surprisingly large number of which are well developed for a cast of that size. \nThe animation is good for its time; it is a bit dated stylistically, but it works for the series.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=76,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I'm an avid science fiction reader and have chewed through a fair amount of books in my day.  Within minutes of beginning this show you can see how derivative it is from a series of books.\nThe story is long (obviously) and intensely philosophical.  There are jokes but they're either without humor or simply not funny, so if you're looking for something light look elsewhere.  As far as character development goes there's a huge ever-developing list of people to keep track of and this is where it gets a little tricky.  Since\n          \n        it is so obviously taken straight from a book, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is no more than a collection of conversations.  Even the action sequences (which are still extremely intense) are portrayed through dialog rather than karate.  Since we have such a huge sample of each character's thoughts and ideas it's very easy to become attached to them while being exposed to different ideologies and political viewpoints.\nWhile it is an extremely stimulating piece of futuristic fiction it is also quite entertaining.  However, it's less the type of entertainment you'd get from Stallone blowing stuff up and more the type you'd get from Anthony Hopkins delivering a monologue.  Sure, both are great but you might not be thrilled by Hopkins as much as by the concrete shattering antics of Stallone.\nIn any case, if you're looking for something that is fairly slow paced but can keep your interest and give you something to think about go for Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=75,   ["text"]="                          \n    Legend of the galactic heroes (LotgH short) is a space opera with a big galactic war as its main theme, where 2 nations are facing each other, The republic side, a democratic nation and the imperial side, which is more of a monarchy. It focuses around the story of 2 young strategists who grew up in opposite nations, each being apparently a prodigy and each fighting for their nation to win.\nThe problem I have with this anime is that; on the one hand it seemed to focus on making its war story as realistic as possible, like a documentary in a way which makes it\n          \n        less exciting to watch and on the other hand, it is not an accurate representation of a war, which is the reason I couldn’t really take it any seriously.\nI dropped this anime after watching 70 episodes since it takes forever to finish (ok for some people 110 episodes might not be so much) and I couldn’t endure this show any longer. I thought a break would help… Well it made me even less interested in going into it again. \n-Story and characters\nSo what do I mean when I say they focused on making this war story as realistic as possible? Well the show spends a lot of time introducing new side characters, who are either military officials or politicians. A warstory can basically be presented through the eyes of the soldiers on the battle field, through the eyes of the civilians going through food shortages and suffering at home or through the military officials and politicians making the decisions. LotgH surely is the latter. The show doesn’t really establish any emotional connection with any of these characters. They are mostly standing around and talking about this war or something that is connected to it, kind of like a war documentary. \nLet’s start by looking at the imperial side: Every character there seems like a typical military officer, an empty shell just there to make orders. Even one of the two main characters, Reinhard doesn’t really stick  out of the crowd too much, except that his outfit is a bit fancier. The show later tries to make him more relatable with him having inner monologues, which was a nice effort but sadly a bit too late. They have a few characters who feel like they have some sort of plan and will get interesting at some point but that also happens too slowly.  \nThen we have the republic side. Here we have 2 character who somewhat stick out of the majority, Yung Wenli, the idealistic young strategist and Julian the kid who follows him around. Now my personal problem with Wenli, which also affects Julian is his never ending speeches about democracy. I heard that people like this show because they think it is “gray” in its depiction. So it isn’t “good vs evil” like many other shows but rather 2 sides which both have their reasons. But Wenli is a contradiction to that. You have an obvious attempt of the author to favor the republic side in a moral manner since the show never brings up arguments for the imperial side. It only tells you how awesome democracy is. This is basically the personality of Wenli, he loves democracy and hates to kill people, which doesn’t prevent him from becoming a commander in war ordering the death of millions. But according to him the death of all the people is always the wars fault, not his, not anyone else of the commanders, but always war. The lack of self-awareness this guy has is astonishing. There are even cases where he orders to destroy millions of ships, possibly carrying billions of people with a recently captured super canon, because their commander didn’t want to retread. Firing a warning shot or only destroying a quarter of their fleet didn’t even occur to him, he just killed them all, without really thinking about all the option he got. Yeah… it’s all wars fault. \nI think Wenli as a character is pretty shallow as well, yeah he gives his speeches but there isn’t really anything more to his character. He seems to lack any relatable emotion as well. He is in his constant Wenli phase, which is a combination of mild happiness, mild concern and mild sadness.\nThe show covers a lot of side details and backstories of characters, but for a reason unknown to me they never mentioned how and where the 2 main characters, Wenli from the republic and Reinhard from the imperials, became such good strategist. That was another reason why I couldn’t relate to them, because I didn't know them. Reinhard had a little bit of a backstory, but that only revolved around his relationship with his sister and I don’t really see his motivation he gets from that throughout the show.\nNow let’s talk about why I think the war in this anime wasn’t really well done. First of all the battle are very dry. The battle scenes focused rather on showing you the back and forth of the command of each side, giving orders and then you see some ships shooting at other ships, some ships explode and one side wins. The show constantly praises the main character for being such good strategist, but the audience can’t really experience that by its own. We don’t really have an idea how the battle is set up, what the numbers and the position of the ships are and all the other factors that play key role in the outcome of a battle. It would have been nice if they presented it more like a real documentary, or a game of chess. You get to know the set up and maybe get time to think for yourself how you would win a battle and then see how the geniuses of history made it. Of course are the writers of the show no genius strategic, I don’t expect them to be, but if you have some sort of interest in actual battles you can include some tactics here and there that reminds one of history. But little is seen in this anime. You don’t SEE any kind of great tactics in this ainime, you just see some people shouting some commands, ships explode and then you are told how great of a strategist this one guy is. That’s why the characters don’t feel like geniuses to me. They never show that they are smart in solving a problem. Well there are a few cases where you see some strategy. Such as the time when wenli used asteroids to deceive his enemies, which in my opinion is a very stupid thing to do. The thing is that Wenli puts half his fleet in an asteroid field so that the enemies think it’s the whole fleet, because they only track the numbers of objects with their radio devices. But why does the sensor only track the numbers? There is no such thing as air pollution in space so getting the information that there are 50% asteroids in his fleet can be gotten by looking through a binocular, basically. This is a common example of using a thing that maybe works on earth in the past, but which would completely fail in the future in space. You could say that they used some sort of invisibility (which was never said in the anime) but then again, how can he track down their numbers. \nAnd what would putting your fleet inside an asteroid fleet accomplish? \n1. Your ships getting randomly hit by asteroids (unless you can control them ALL, which the show didn’t manage to show how)\n2. By asteroids getting blown up next to you and shattered they would also disable your vision or curtain points of your ship may be hit by asteroids parts.\nI think this tactic gives more disadvantages than advantages. Anyways, they used the asteroids to quickly hide behind them when they are being fired at by LASER guns, it’s not like these shots travel with light speed or something. \n I think that the writers are way more inspired by medieval war, with horse formations and these sorts of things than recent wars, which in my opinion would give a better idea of how war would be fought in space in the future. They also use battle axes and crossbows some times and carry their orders out with good old white paper. It just shows that the script is not well thought through.\nAnd to be honest I think the battles are not really creative as well. In real war you have lots of different tools and weapons that can give you tactical advantages. Artillery, tanks, airplanes, ships, submarines, mines, spies and a whole lot of other things. In LotgH they basically ALL use the same ships, since it is never said that either side has better ships, which all use the same kind of laser to shoot at each other. There are a few rare anomalies but the show is 110 episodes long, so those don’t justify the laziness. They could have used different ship types, which would have made the battles more interesting, some kind of blockades of supply lines or so many other things. They used a black hole once In their battles which I found to be a nice idea but that’s basically it. There was even one scene where they could have used this giant defense canon I previously mentioned, but instead retreaded from it, because they thought that the enemies can’t use it in their attacks anyways (one of the many great plans of Wenli). They maybe can’t use the canon but they surely can use the planet as a defense line themselves and as a station to operate from and to get reinforcement themselves. This, for example is one of many moments when I questioned the capability of the strategists in this show.\nI also find this anime to be highly unrealistic. In the already mentioned occupation of this defense canon, apparently not a single one of the republic side dies, which they made a big deal about, well I would too if something so improbable would happen. Such a thing is so far attached from reality that I highly doubt the writers ever opened a history book. I mean even when Nazi Germany marched through Belgium to get to france, a couple of soldiers died, that’s just normal in a war. Or the fact that without the main characters either side would be pretty much screwed. War is not decided by one smart guy who is just better than everyone else, it’s a combined effort where many very smart people put their minds together. This idea that one guy is such a good strategist and everyone else is just a pleb that stands no chance is such a typical anime trope. And people kinda make this anime out to be more than just a typical anime.   \nVisuals-\nThe show looks great. It got nice detailed drawings of futuristic ships which were surely great for their time. Ofc they could have made better, but it’s a 110 episode long ova afterall. You will get used to the characterdesign, which looks nice as well. Animation isn’t that great. The show most of the time consist of limited animated standing scenes with flappingmouths. \nSoundtrack-\nLotgH mainly uses calm orchestra music with many long notes. I didn’t like the soundtrack that much. I found the battle music to be out of place which made the battles less exiting. They could have used more fitting classical music for the battles. It may be overused but something like “Ride of the Valkyries” from Richard Wagner would fit into these scenes.\nOverall\nI gave this anime such a low score since I couldn’t finish it.(and for the record: I was watching with twice the normal speed after episode 20, so I tried my best) A show which can’t keep my interests, even though I try to watch through it fails the most and deserves the lowest score possible. There are surely some nice aspects around the show, and maybe you will find some of those so interesting that you will like this anime, but for me they weren’t enough to endure this one. Overall I can just repeat myself: This show was boring for focusing so hard on the characters and their relations in this war but failing to make this war engaging or the characters relatable and interesting. That’s the main problem and when you think about it, it shreds apart everything this show is about. \n"},

People on this site rate this anime so immensely high, that one would eventually come to wonder what that ridiculous score is based on, and give the whole thing a try. Are these people merely the retainers of old, classic shows that have been made in a style that has long since come to an end? I sincerely believe that it’s more than that.\nTo make one thing very clear, this anime was made before\n          \n        I was born, so if I am biased in any way, it would be towards modern anime, whose style is more of my cup of tea. Still, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu was fascinating, in a way that no modern anime is. Beware though, I have rated this show high from a very objective perspective, my personal enjoyment factor was not as high as my overall rating and if you’re a fan of modern animation, you might have a hard time getting used to or enjoy the series. You may not be suited to sit through the meticulously fleshed out dialogues, as well as philosophical, ethical and political discussions presented here, that is alright. What I think though is, even if you don’t like it, you can’t deny this works greatness.\n\nStory: 10/10\nHistory is a thing long in the past for us but something that was very present to people of the corresponding era, something that moved their hearts and lives, changed the direction in which humanity developed in a way that we may not be able to comprehend today. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is like that, it’s like witnessing history happening live. The anime does nothing out of the ordinary, no supernatural occurrences or absurd plottwists to keep the viewer hooked; instead it progresses slowly into a more or less foreseeable direction, still managing to show some surprising developments, that are all still in the viewer’s theoretically calculable range of anticipation. That said, it should also be mentioned that things only just start picking up pace past episode 30 or so, so you might need to bring some patience. Everything about the plot and world of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is so painstakingly accurate in its construction, that I have yet to find some logical fault within any of the presented material. Think people bear those incredibly German names because they thought it was fun? There’s a reason for that. Think they use battle axes in close combat because they thought it was cool? There’s a reason for that too. I have never before seen an anime that was so well planned and executed, with a pacing that matches its progression as well as it does. Sometimes it’s slow and conversations drag on for a very long time but that is also a characteristic of the time it was made in, people didn’t mind not having things explode in each and every episode.\n\nArt: 10/10\nNow, get this. This anime, made in 1988, displays better visuals then some modern anime. Don’t believe me? I didn’t believe it myself at first either. What we have here is an OVA of 110 episodes, with 24-30 episodes released at once in four periods over the course of ten years. What does that mean now? It means time, a lot of time. Enough to, with the limited possibilities of that time, polish the animations to a degree that can rival works of the current era. Expressive facials and movements, detailed surroundings as well as fluent animations are characteristic for this anime. The art style may come over as a bit westernized but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSound: 10/10\nActually, I don’t know how to rate the OST at all. It includes many classical, orchestrated pieces, some of which are well known, now is that really bad or really good for a 1988’s anime? I’ll just go ahead and rate in favor of the anime, partly because the style of music fits the widely royal and dignified atmosphere, which is especially apparent in episodes involving the Galactic Empire. The seiyuu however are definitely top notch, even more than that, I daresay they are legendary. Some of them even have active and important voice acting roles in modern animation, such as Vegeta (Dragonball Z/ GT/ Kai), Kotomine Kirei (Fate Series), Tohsaka Tokiomi (Fate/ Zero), Hatake Kakashi (Naruto), Jiraiya (Naruto) or Matsudaira Katakuriko (Gintama), and these are only the ones I recognized. Even back then their performance was admirable and deserves a lot of respect.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nThose are people, characters like real people with relatable emotions and developments, and all of them are unique individuals. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu has a main cast of such epic proportions, that even random passersby on the street are blessed with distinct facial features of their own. While, at least from a certain point of the series on, it is clear who the protagonists are, other people around them have names, stories, thoughts and commit to actions of their own. Those people, even if they are only meant to appear but once on screen, have a real impact on the direction in which history goes. Characters exist in a broader historic context, a span of time that far exceeds the timeline depicted in the anime itself, no one person is without fault, immortal or inviolable and everyone and everything leaves the impression, that it must come to an end someday. None of the progressions are rushed or forced and always stay in realistic bounds, a character only ever shows extreme behavior if the situation demands it, or if he is likely to do so because of his personality traits. \n\nEnjoyment: 8/10\nThis is difficult, mostly due to the fact that I believe that watching this anime while being skilled in understanding the Japanese language would reap different results. It sometimes gets mentally exhausting, reading through the subtitles of each and every dialogue and a great battle might come as a breath of fresh air in this partially stale environment. Nevertheless, there is also a great deal of suspense, action and even romance to be found in Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, if one listens or reads as attentive as I have been doing it, one might crack a smile or even laugh at a few scenes, although it’s not meant to be a comedy anime in general. This anime has everything, every single thing out there, it just may demand a bit of endurance from its viewer to reveal this large spectrum of entertainment.\n\nResult: 10/10\nThis might be… the best anime; maybe. I’m not being an elitist here; I just think that Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is so well done as a whole, that it would deserve that title. A single man should not be so audacious as to crown a Kaiser of Anime though. I rated this show a ten, I did it because I think no other rating would be appropriate. Even by taking into account that my Enjoyment wasn’t quite that high because I am just not used to anime this old, I can reach no other conclusion.\nThat said, even bearing this disadvantage, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu has fascinated me on a completely different level than many other anime and it might just fascinate you in the same way.\nI for one salute before one of the greatest animated works ever created."},

It is an endless void for which ambition can take can spread its roots. If only we could reach there. There have been many epic space operas about young men with grand ambitions of power. However, none of them could ever quite match up to the proportions and magnitude of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Legends of the Galactic Heroes is an anime so ambitious, so expansive that this review won’t be able to cover everything. However, I will try to be as concise about my views as possible.\nThe\n          \n        story has a lot of sub-plot lines but at its core, centers around the exploits of two men. One is Reinhard Von Lohengram, a young, passionate soldier on the side of Empire, an autocratic nation. He attempts to mold destiny and the universe itself, in order to achieve his dream of becoming the ruler of the universe.  And Yang Wenli, a nonchalant, genius strategist on the side of the Alliance, a democratic nation. By fate, these two face off against each other in battle, and their destinies become forever intertwined. \nThe scope of the show is quite remarkable, as it meticulously chronicles Reinhard’s rise to power. From his humble beginnings as a mere commoner, to him as an aspiring general, to him becoming the emperor. The show brings the viewer along, and we can see him at different stages of life and how he changes or more accurately, how he stays the same. The same with Wenli, who over the course of the show, we get to learn more about his personal history, his backstory, his motivations and, of course, his political beliefs. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an ideological/plot driven show of incomparable scale. There is not an anime that I have seen that I can accurately compare to it. There are so many sub-plots interlaced throughout the show that you will need to devote a lot of attention and patience in order to grasp what is going on. It is easy to get lost if you are not dedicating 100% attention to it. \nThe show has spurts of heavy expository dialog which, depending or your likes or dislikes may be very boring. But they serve as a way to paint the world and give it color. The history of nations is given extensive focus to the point where they feel almost real. In the form of documentaries, or exposition by Yang, we learn about the expansive history of the Empire and the Alliance. The world-building is arguably the show's strongest point. The attention to detail in the world building is uncanny. Every aspect, every nook, and cranny is explained and expanded upon throughout the show. Never before in anime, has there been such a wonderfully crafted world, no, Universe. It is truly marvelous to behold.\nThe show has a lot of political-philosophical conversations. The conversations provide insight into the way ruling structures like Democracy, and autocracy work and the flaws both. Rarely does the dialog come off as proselytizing. Characters have interesting back and forths on what is the best way to run a government and what they would do if placed in a position of power. The dialogue is insightful but it borders on excessiveness.\nRather show through actions and events, Legends would much rather spoonfeed you every little idea that a character has. If not from the very characters themselves, then the narrator who also spoils plot points. The show comes off as condescending because it assumes the viewer lacks the capacity to understand the beliefs and motivations of the characters without them having to regurgitate it every few episodes. The show does very little to stimulate the viewer intellectually, not that it is a major flaw, but it does hinder my enjoyment of the show. In a show that deals with politics and philosophy, you would expect moments where you would reflect on what is done or said. But no, the show will gladly explain everything to you.\nAnother problem with the show is its direction. When I say direction, I mean how certain events are presented. Legends gives a highly romanticized depiction of war to the point where you can no longer suspend your disbelief. For example, there was an instance where, during a battle where a soldier took off his helmet and began to saw how the enemies were not human and, in the middle of a sentence, was stabbed in the eye and killed. You are probably thinking I am just being nitpicky, but you would be wrong. There are so many moments like this that it is not just a minor issue; it becomes an issue. Another instance where romanticization hampers the enjoyment of the show is during the space battles. There is no feeling of animosity between either the empire or the alliance. All the characters are portrayed as a “chivalrous soldier,” who rarely gets angry or expresses any contempt for the other side. During battles, generals will often compliment the other side, ignoring the fact that the other side just killed a large portion of their fleet. It is unbelievable. It just comes off as inappropriate once again, takes you out of the immersion. There are moments where characters who defect, are given positions of high standing right off the bat. You are left there, mouth agape at how unrealistic it all is. Now, I am not asking that the show maintains hyper-realism, but there should be a degree of internal consistency. As I said earlier, these moments of disbelief are so glaringly apparent, it is impossible not to notice them and brush them to the side.\nAnother large part of the show has to do with space battles. The show prides itself on tactics and not relying on firepower to win. However, once again there are issues with its presentation. Battles usually come down to this, one side being very smart, and the other side being unrealistically stupid. What is more noticeable is the fact that the people who are losing, are usually people of high military standing. These are generals and admirals, handpicked by the Kaiser so you would think that the battles would have some tension. However, you would be wrong. Battles are completely devoid of tension because, after a few episodes, you can predict who will win. If Yang is in the battle, Yang will win without breaking a sweat. If Reinhard is in the battle, he will win. It becomes repetitive after a while. There are also issues with battles between infantry. Often, soldiers will be seen using battle axes, and others will be using laser rifles. The soldiers with the laser rifles will coincidentally miss, causing them to be killed. You would think in such a futuristic society that soldiers would use less archaic weapons. \nNow onto the characters. The plot revolves around Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengram. Both characters are well-defined throughout the show, each of them have a strong identity and political belief. You will rarely see characters as well characterized as those two. However, it is fair to say that these characters are literally perfect. They have no “real,” flaws to speak of. The show tries to make seem like Yang’s lackadaisical attitude and passive demeanor would affect him negatively in the long run. Sadly for the viewer, that moment never comes. The same situation applies to Reinhard as well. The show makes it glaringly obvious that he heavily relies on other people to accomplish his goals. But he is never placed in a circumstance that solely relies upon his decision. Both characters are never placed in any kind of dilemma where they are forced to make hard decisions. These “flaws,” never impede on their decision making. The right answer is always given to them. Anything they do rarely backfires. If by some miracle, something doesn’t go the opposite way, the repercussions are minor and do not affect them, nor the rest of the universe. These characters almost never make mistakes and it gets really irksome watching them, major success after major success.  \nLegends also sports a very expansive supporting cast. The downside is, most of the characters rarely amount to anything. A lot of the supporting characters only exist to make Reinhard and Wenli look better than they already are. Supporting characters will do things that defy logic just so Reinhard or Wenli can defeat them. And when they are not losing to Reinhard or Wenli, they are talking about them. The show makes it seem like the majority of the characters do not have any kind of social life and would rather talk about their superiors instead of themselves. If only most people were that humble.  However, a small portion of the characters become autonomous towards the end of the show.  But this is too late, as this happens a good 90 episodes into the show. It takes time for the viewer to develop an attachment to the characters. The majority of the show, we are made to just care about Reinhard and Wenli and everyone else lies on the backburner.\nLegends of the Galactic Heroes is a show as vast as the ocean, but as shallow as puddle. When I say “shallow,” I am referring to the cast not the ideas presented. The world the writers created is truly wonderful but its inhabitants needed the same attention to detail. Despite all my critiques, Legends of the Galactic Heroes is a very well written show but it just misses greatness. The flaws are not egregious enough to ruin the show, but noticeable enough to where it harms your enjoyment. \n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=46,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I do not use the term \"the greatest anime ever made\" lightly. There are very few anime that, under scrutiny, could be considered a reasonable candidate for a title such as this. And, true enough, the only titles that stand in competition to Legend of the Galactic Heroes (henceforth LotGH) are able to do so simply because they have nothing in common with it - if it weren't for the fact that they were fighting a different battle altogether, they would lose.\nOf course, it would be very easy to give LotGH hollow praise, given its status as \"lofty elitist anime that pretentious people use to\n          \n        impress people on the internet\". As such, those contrarian in nature have begun to put it under scrutiny. And for good reason: LotGH is definitely not perfect, as tempting as it might be to pretend otherwise. First and foremost, the series has a beginning that is at best slow, and at worst, drawn-out, tedious, and with awkward execution. It takes 15 episodes for the plot to take a turn for the interesting, and even then, it takes longer still for it to truly become great, slowly climbing an uphill curve of quality.\nSo thank whichever nonexistent deity you pray to that LotGH is 110 episodes. In a shorter series, that would have been fatal. As poor as the beginning was, it wasn't a waste of time. LotGH has one of the largest casts of characters in all of anime, and takes its time setting up all the characters and plot threads it needs to.\nIt's especially important that the cast was properly set up, because if I had to name a single defining feature that made LotGH as good as it is, it's the cast. The two most central characters to the plot are Reinhard von Musel, and Yang Wenli, each on opposing sides of the war. The two are well-balanced opposites; where Reinhard is driven in his motive to free his sister from being a concubine of military aristocrats (among later goals which gradually develop), but often forced to questions the methods and choices he takes to achieve his ends. Yang, however, is in the military out of pure financial obligation, and despite his vocal support of democracy, he is often less than invested in the war, taking a more passive and cynical view.\nYang is the closest thing we have to a protagonist proper in LotGH, and from a storytelling perspective, he's a masterstroke. A common (yet misguided) criticism of LotGH is that Yang is there to force the author's opinion on us heavy-handedly, as an author-insert. While it is mostly likely true that Yang states many of the writer's views, this isn't an inherently bad thing unto itself. These views are blended seamlessly into Yang's own characterization; as a history scholar first and foremost, well-versed in the history of war and politics, Yang would be expected to have strong opinions on the subject. His interests and beliefs play out organically over a backdrop of a crumbling democracy.\nTo use Yang as a voice for the writer's own beliefs would only present a problem if it did not play organically into the story, and if Yang and the Free Planets Alliance were presumed to be, by default, representative of all things good. Not only is this not the case, but Yang himself is the first to establish it - Yang views things in as broad a perspective as he can, and does not believe himself a hero as a result - in the purest, most objective terms, devoid of context, he is nothing more than a mass murderer. Regardless of intent, as a military leader, he is responsible for the deaths of millions (also, he's an alcoholic, so, there's that). \nThis sense of broad perspective is echoed throughout the series. Characters from long-forgotten subplots re-emerge in ways that force you to rethink the events as you know them. Many characters that were presumed to be one-dimensional are shown to have more going on than the plot would suggest, lives beyond what service they have to the plot. The soldier's grizzly deaths aboard destroyed ships, always seen onscreen, are suddenly shown in all their graphic detail. The peak of this would be in one of the most intelligent examples of world-building and exposition I've witnessed in anime, wherein the history of the series' war is told through a documentary one of the protagonists chose to watch.\nIt's this perspective of objectivity that makes LotGH's writing shine. For a show as wordy as it is, it isn't all that didactic. The core conflict develops into that of a perfect autocracy versus a corrupt democracy, as while Yang may make a case for democracy, it's by no means stated by the plot that his beliefs are correct.\nThe supporting cast stands out just as much as the two protagonists, making the tremendous death count of the series all the more affecting. And the dialogue is strong to boot, making the interactions between them both believable and entertaining - several of the best \"bromances\" in anime are showcased here. Oskar von Reuenthal, one of Reinhard's best commanders, stands out as an exceptionally well-developed character, whose tremendous personal flaws are the driving focus of his character arc.\nBut perhaps the most surprising thing about LotGH, and something that is not said often enough, is that it is hilarious. Bar none, it has the best comic relief in any normally serious anime, never breaking tone or character in the process.\nBesides the aforementioned flaws in its early episodes, LotGH's only major downfall is its low production values, especially in the earlier episodes, resulting in some rather poor animation and artwork. The shows visual design, however, does a good job of compensating for that, both in the military uniforms, the setting, and in particular, making every character in its immense cast look distinct (and impressively, sound distinct). Public domain classical music is also used to save budget, but luckily, it matches the show's design perfectly.\n\nFinal Words: LotGH is a heavy investment in time, but with a payoff unlike any other.\nStory/Plot: 10/10\nCharacters: 10/10\nAnimation/Art: 3/10\nMusic: 8/10\nActing: 10/10\nOverall: 10/10\nFor Fans Of: Monster, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn\n        "},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=54,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is a somewhat odd series, in anime terms. It began as a series of novels in the 80s, got adapted into a manga and, over the course of the late 80s to late 90s, it was turned into a 110 episode OVA. The odd part being that it was released as an OVA. For those of you who don't know, an OVA is a direct to video/ DVD release rather than one that runs on a televised network. Usually OVAs are pretty short, running somewhere from an episode to maybe a dozen. A hundred and ten episodes is virtually unheard of from\n          \n        an OVA. Why was it an OVA? I have no idea. It's possible that its content was deemed unbroadcastable at the time but I really don't know. Let's take a look at this insanely long OVA. \nThe basic story is that two forces, the Imperial Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, have been at war for centuries and the plot follows their conflict and struggles with a focus on the politics and stratagems. So, how competent is the execution? The short answer is it's not but allow me to extrapolate. The first issue is that the strategies used in this shouldn't work. They're really basic and rely on the other side being incompetent. The first strategy you see is “get all our ships together and hope that their fleets are far enough apart that we can take each one out individually before they can meet up.” It only works because the enemy is stupid enough to disperse their units far enough that it can work. There's another strategy that basically comes down to putting on enemy uniforms and using one of their ships. So, these guys have been at war for centuries and no one has ever tried disguising themselves before? For that matter, they don't keep track of their lost ships or have any kind of code words to identify their own soldiers? The future is dumb. That leads to another issue, since the strategies are pretty much all ones that shouldn't work you can usually tell which ones will or won't based entirely on whether it was one of the main characters who came up with it rather than based on any merit in the strategy itself. If either side had a single person who had read and understood Sun Tzu's Art of War this would be over in five episodes. \nThe political “intrigue” also falls pretty flat. Its big downfall is the narrator. Yes, this series has a narrator. The narrator likes to tell you what the impact of any political discussion is going to be and even spoils death scenes. Just to make sure they leave as little impact as possible. Even putting the narrator aside, a lot of the political points they make are either stupid or get contradicted by the series. To give an example of the first, they have a criticism of the Alliance's leaders that “they aren't going out and fighting” and the series acts like it's a brilliant and poignant point, but it's not. Any war effort needs people to take care of getting resources, oversee distribution and hundreds of other administrative details that you couldn't do while also fighting. Furthermore, you don't want your leaders going into the fray because of the potential for social disarray if a bunch of those leaders were to just get killed all at once. Do they really think that social chaos would be good for the war effort? The future is dumb. This series also advocates the idea that war leads to societal advancement and society stagnates under peace. That's another particularly stupid one. Society doesn't stagnate in times of peace. It advances technologically and socially. Quality of life goes up and social problems are gradually taken care of. Frankly, the societies presented in this series could use some social justice advancements given that their gender roles have regressed back to roughly the 1950s. The future is stupid. Moving onto a contradiction, towards the end when it looks like peace is coming one of the characters discusses how “if only they'd been able to just talk so many lives could have been spared” which is fair enough but not even five minutes later he says that he's going to return to being a soldier and fighting. Yes, if only your sides could just talk, you know, rather than planning for the conflict to resume. Why is the future so stupid? Even putting the major issues with the politics aside, it's just dull. The scenes drag on far longer than they need to, especially since the narrator has already told you how it's going to turn out in most cases. \nThe characters in this are pretty flat. Most of them are defined by a couple basic traits or an archetype. Like the guy who doesn't talk or the aggressive guy. Even with over a hundred episodes to work with, none of them ever get around to becoming fleshed out or developed in any substantial way. The female characters have it even worse since they get to be defined by their relationships to the men around them, usually their love interests. If the characters were compelling the series could have at least had some emotional investment but they aren't. They're boring.\nThe art in this is really badly done. The characters tend to have these flat, emotionless expressions or look dully surprised. I remember one death scene in particular where one of the characters was looking at a dying loved one and their facial expression was what you'd expect from someone who had been staring at a computer screen too long and was tired, not the expression of someone losing a loved one. The action scenes are really bad too. The space combat scenes can be summed up as “phallic ships fire at each other. Some get destroyed. Cut to one of the major characters standing in their bridge and either giving orders or reacting while looking strangely emotionless.” After a while they all start to look the same and kind of blend together. The land-based battles are even worse, somehow. You get a lot of scenes where soldiers are firing shots at people who are charging with melee weapons and somehow miss every single shot. Cobra soldiers are better marksmen than these clowns. Making one side incompetent because you want the soldiers on the other to survive doesn't make the surviving squad look bad-ass. It just makes the action sequence look lazy. Characters will also go cross-eyed for no reason and a lot of the movements just end up looking stilted and unnatural. The art is also a problem when it comes to death scenes. There are quite a few that are supposed to be dramatic but end up being done in such an over the top way that they end up being humorous instead. Like Toga Guy's. (That isn't a spoiler. He dies very shortly after showing up and it's obvious from the moment he appears that he won't survive.) \nThe voice acting is the best part of the series. It's not the best, but the actors do a good job of emoting and delivering their lines. If the art actually gave the characters expressions that matched the dialogue it would be far more effective, but at least the actors were putting an effort into it, even if they were the only ones involved in the OVA who were. The music is pretty mediocre. It's not bad, but it's not good either. \nThe ho-yay factor is a 2/10. There are some scenes where Kircheis and Reinhard look like they're more than friends. There's also a scene about the Empire's history that involves a gay Kaiser, but that's the extent of the homo-eroticism. There really isn't much. \nThat's Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. It's actually pretty painful. Sure, you get the occasional scene that's over the top in a funny way, but most of the time it's just slow and boring. Any potential for dramatic tension is lost thanks to the narrator, the strategies are idiotic. The politics are asinine. The characters are flat and the art is really bad. My final rating for this is a 2/10. I would not recommend slogging through this one. Well, that's the last review of March. The request queue going into April is: Shinsekai Yori, One Outs, Doki Doki Precure, Sword Art Online and Shingeki No Kyojin. Next week I'll look at none of the above and check out Muteki Kanban Musume instead because I really need a laugh. I'll get back to the queue after that.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=49,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    The epic inspiration given by stars has long been romanticized into oblivion. So much has been said that it feels pointless to go on about how mysterious and elusive they seem. Going in, it’s normal to expect just that of an old space opera like Legend of the Galactic Heroes; instead, what it presents is what it truly means to reach out and take the universe. \nThere are glorious battles where massive fleets collide, maneuvering each other into the firing range of gargantuan lasers. From that perspective it feels as if the only people fighting are the Admirals. One layer deeper, we find the staff\n          \n        officers and technicians executing the brilliant protagonists’ commands. Even deeper, we see the results of those orders: brutal death, epitomized by the bisected remains of young soldiers and planets bombarded into lifelessness. These very individual horrors are never once forgotten, despite the story’s scope, and this only becomes more clear as the scale of the conflict grows.\nIf there is a fault to the warring, it’s that the designated loser is often treated as a scapegoat to show off the winner’s skill. Well-established characters face off against newly introduced or clearly incompetent admirals. These newbies are always intimidated by feint ambushes, always pursue into real ambushes, have a limited understanding of their opponent’s personality, and most notably refuse sensible advise from subordinates. These things are extremely common, making up at least half of all encounters. This is not to say the mistakes are inherently bad writing, since a notable political theme is that talented individuals are held back and ignored in corrupted governments. It’s just annoying for Admirals to hear or see something obvious, and then disregard so they can be easily defeated.\nLuckily not much time is spent on idiots, as they tend to die fast. Everyone we follow is good at something, and at the top of both skill and prominence lies Reinhard von Lohengramm. Reinhard is a conqueror who wants to seize the galaxy. He’s restrained only by Siegfried Kircheis, his compassionate retainer. What makes Reinhard so interesting is how he wrestles with conflicting desires. His original motivations stemmed from injustice done upon specific people, but in his quest for power he’s forced to do very similar things. Even when he gains the power to do things differently, the warrior in him yearns for more chaos, as if he is a hero not suited for peace. Reinhard is someone who’s motivated by corruption, and who sacrifices for the greater good, yet would destroy galactic stability to satisfy personal desire.\nOpposing Reinhard is Yang Wen-Li, an equally complex but much less flashy democratic soldier. Yang has no interest in domination, and for a long time refuses to do more than the minimum required to survive. His unwilling ascension through the ranks, as well as popular acclaim, push on more responsibility. As a supporter of democracy, Yang can only accept. He’s a very likable guy. This is because all his actions, even orders that kill millions, are reached through very clear logic. More important is that his logic is far from cold: Yang is acutely aware of how history perceives things, and at the same time aware of all the consequences his decisions have. His genius lets him see everything that will happen, and everything he can do to change it, yet he’s still unable to stifle unwillingness and regret. \nThe series has a massive amount of people in it, enough that everyone has helpful little nameplates. Surprisingly, character design is both diverse enough to give them all a distinct look, but realistic enough that it no one feels out of place. That said the art is not remarkable in any other way. Colors are simple and predictable, wardrobes are limited, and battles are visually unimpressive. The animation, too, is only at an acceptable level. As the seasons go on though, there is a noticeable improvement (almost a ten-year production gap, from beginning to end).\nAnother welcomed surprise is the voice-acting. Ryo Horikawa made me believe Reinhard had the charisma to dominate the human race, and Norio Wakamoto made Reuenthal into a man’s man. Again the cast is very large, so naturally the voice cast is of an equally epic proportion. If the series is reanimated, which it absolutely deserves to be, the voice cast should be preserved as much as possible. \nThe music should be preserved as well. It is ancient, more-so than the anime medium, and like the series itself the soundtrack is a product of much education, understanding and effort. Each song is a classic part of a beloved symphony/sonata/concerto. Matching the emotion of the plot note for note, the music deepened my appreciation for the classical genre. Before, Mozart’s symphonies numbered legions, even a single one sometimes hard to sit through; however, once I heard the first movement of the 25th set to the sight of epic battle, they all became more approachable. Of course the music can be stuffy, slow-paced, and so concerned with sophistication that it fails to convey a clear emotion. Anyone who thinks those criticisms apply to the classical genre as a whole will probably not enjoy LoGH’s soundtrack.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is a massive show, one that takes time revealing greatness. I have a lot of misgivings about the plot, especially during the final season, but that doesn’t stop it from being a incredibly interesting. As a political or war drama, though not as a conspiracy story, its realism and moral sophistication are unmatched. The central story is one of the best ever told.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=45,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (a.k.a. Legend of the Galactic Heroes, or LotGH for short) is a series with a quite notorious reputation on this site. The high ratings aside, it is generally spoken of by its fans as the single best anime ever made, whereas most people who haven't watched it seemingly look at it like some sort of joke which they either look down on or just ignore altogether. Therefore for any newcomer who tries to be a bit more open-minded, it's very difficult to get a proper sense of how good the anime actually is and whether or not it's actually worthwhile investing themselves\n          \n        enough to watch all 110 episodes of it, especially considering its age. It took me quite a long time before I could personally muster up the dedication to go through with it myself, but after having done so a few months ago I was pleased to discover that LotGH is in fact an excellent anime, albeit perhaps not quite as perfect as certain people make it out to be.\n\nPros & Cons:\n+ Incredibly epic scale, spanning a significant portion of the entire galaxy and a death count in the millions\n+ Extremely well-written main characters with tons of depth and fantastic development\n+ Intriguing story both on the small and large scales respectively\n+ There is no good or evil in this show; the two warring sides are given equal attention and depth, and it's up to every individual viewer to decide which ideals are the more righteous ones. The lack of a single protagonist also makes the show a lot less predictable\n+ Not much plot armor, expect the unexpected\n+ Its peaks are some of the highest ever; when LotGH is at its best it's truly magnificent\n+ Originality\n- The show is over 20 years old; while this is not a bad thing in and of itself, the animation quality is still undoubtedly very outdated and a lot of aspects of the anime look quite poor, some more than others\n- For some unknown reason, the anime's own narrator consistently spoils plot details and events before they actually occur in the story. It's a very strange problem but it's definitely there and it can really get on your nerves\n- Somewhat slow start, somewhat dragged-out ending\n\nLotGH takes place in the distant future where humanity has conquered the distant stars and has now colonized countless star systems throughout the Milky Way. The people are not fully united under one banner however, but are rather split in two with the majority being part of the autocratic Galactic Empire, and the rest belonging to the democratic Free Planets Alliance. These two factions have been locked in military conflict for decades, both claiming to be fighting for the good of mankind since both sides believe that their ideology is the correct one.\nWhich one is the correct one then? Well that's up to each and every viewer to decide as the anime is almost entirely unbiased in this war, and both sides are given equal amounts of time, attention and depth from their own points of view. Introducing our two protagonists: Yang Wenli from the Alliance, and Reinhard von Lohengramm from the Empire. At the start of the series, both of them are young, up-and-coming commanders of their respective factions, and they're both quickly shown to be strategic masterminds, both politically and in military combat. They both respect each other immensely right from their first encounter, and they constantly try to get inside each other's head as the story progresses, attempting to always be one step ahead of the other one.\nThroughout the story, there are countless large-scale fleet battles taking place between the two sides, and the anime presents a huge amount of military tactics and strategizing to showcase them. It oftentimes uses a tactical map display showing the entire battlefield, what ships are where, what they are doing, where they are going etcetera. As a consequence, whenever Yang and Reinhard are in command of two opposing fleets locked in combat, the battle really ends up becoming one big chess game between the two of them where they keep trying to predict each other's moves and preemptively counteract them. It really feels like legitimate battles that are always interesting to watch, and since they bring with them literally millions of deaths along the way, they never lose their sense of importance and tension. This is also further emphasized by the anime for the most part neglecting plot armor which gives the conflict a sense of realism and unpredictability.\nLotGH is definitely not just about military combat however. It has a ton of depth and focus on national politics and other events taking place within the two respective factions. There is a lot of corruption amongst higher-ups, back stabbings and other unpleasantries which keep you on your toes as a viewer, as well as make the entire world actually feel living and breathing. Everything happens for a reason and everything comes with consequences. Romance also has its place in the series even if it's nothing more than a sub-genre.\nIt's also worth mentioning that even though LotGH takes place in the distant future in the space era, there's a surprising lack of technical development in this story (so much that I honestly question how humanity was able to conquer the stars in the first place). There are no mechas, robotics, gravitational or time-based scientific aspects in this show to speak of or anything along those lines. Neither are there any aliens or supernatural elements. It is purely classical, large-scale galactic warfare with seemingly old-school spaceships with everything taken into account, and planetary infrastructure looking more or less the same as it does today. The show is very simplistic in this sense, but instead expands immensely on the select aspects which it actually does focus on.\nAlthough it's all put under the same entry here on MAL, in reality LotGH is divided into four seasons, spanning episodes 1-26, 27-54, 55-86 and 87-110 respectively, and they are not entirely even in terms of actual quality. The first season serves mostly as an introduction to the universe, presenting all of the (initial) main characters, the overall setting of the story and mostly tries to give you a view of what everyone is fighting for and why. While it does that job well, it is rather slow-paced and doesn't really showcase much of what the show actually has to offer. It takes about 20 or so episodes before the anime actually gets going, and it isn't until the end of the first season that LotGH really gets into its element.\nAfter that the series rapidly starts getting awesome, and it keeps being awesome for a long time. I'm not going to say much about it to avoid spoilers but I just want to get the message across that seasons 2 and 3 of this anime are for sure some of the best content I've ever seen in anime. The series is truly epic at this point and absolutely flourishes with greatness. The fourth and final season is a bit of a step down again however, as most of the excitement dies down after the climax of season 3 and as a result the series resumes the tempo it had in its opening instead. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can't help but feel that the fourth season didn't need to be as long as it was; it just needlessly drags out the very predictable ending and makes you lose a lot of your hype before the show eventually ends.\nAs a side note, there are also a number of movies and backstory OVAs to LotGH which I can all label as good, but not *as* good, the only exception being Ougon no Tsubasa (a.k.a. Golden Wings) which sucks horribly, avoid that one like the plague. As far as all the others go however, watch them if you feel inspired to, but it's not necessary either. The two prequel movies Waga Yuku wa Hoshi no Taikai (a.k.a. My Conquest is the Sea of Stars) followed by Arata Naru Tatakai no Overture (a.k.a. Overture to a New War) might be recommended to be watched *before* you start the main series however. They serve as a pretty good introduction to the setting.\nThe character cast of the show is absolutely huge. It might very well be the biggest one I have ever seen in anime. In addition to the main characters, there are their respective friends and associates, probably hundreds of other admirals and fleet commanders, politicians and other higher-ups back on the homeworld and many others. And this goes for *both* factions at the same time. Plus there's also a neutral mini-faction called Phezzan located in-between the two warring sides which has its own fair share of characters to memorize. Overall, it can go way over your head trying to keep track of all the names, especially considering the fact that a lot of the names in the show are somewhat impractical for memorization to begin with.\nThat aside, the actual character development for the ones in the center of attention is just fantastic. The story of LotGH spans many years of time and there are a lot of drastic events occurring throughout it, both for the sake of the overarching story and for the characters involved in it. Yang starts out as the instantly likable good guy who does everything right and wants the best for everyone, and he keeps building on that image more and more as the series progresses. He's kind of the hero of the people that everyone loves and adores, whereas the politicians fear him and consider him a nuisance more than anything else. Reinhard on the other hand is initially seen as the bratty blonde kid who only got his admiral position because of his sister's relationship with the Emperor, but who doesn't actually have any worthwhile qualities of his own to speak of. This is immediately disproven however as Reinhard turns out to be a strategic mastermind, albeit somewhat cold and condescending in nature. As time goes on, he's faced with greater and greater perils both from the inside and the outside, and his experiences drastically affect his character as a whole. He's definitely the one that changes and develops the most over the course of the story, and is probably the best written character of the show as well.\nThe animation quality of LotGH is perhaps its biggest breaking factor however. As it is, the show aired between 1988 and 1997 so unavoidably the visuals are extremely outdated by today's standards, and thus compared to literally any recent anime it looks very poor. Sadly this will turn off a lot of people right away, and be the sole reason they avoid watching this show altogether. I consider this quite unfortunate but at the same time I can't really blame them either because if you're not used to it then watching this anime can feel extremely awkward. Even taking its age into account there are some elements of it that just look straight-up bad, for example the lasers shot from the ships and guns look like silly blue glow sticks or something that can totally ruin the supposedly serious mood that the story is trying to have at the time. Getting used to the low animation quality can and will be a problem for many people, but I still recommend you to give it some time at least because you're really missing out on an otherwise great show if you skip out on watching LotGH solely because of its age.\nThe soundtrack is mostly consisting of classical music in order to complement the space opera that the show undoubtedly is. It fits perfectly for the setting at hand, especially for all the fleet battles and other grand events taking place in the story. It's not exactly original, but as the saying goes; \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\". In that sense, the music of LotGH does its job as well you could ever ask of it.\nLast but not least I cannot in good conscience write this review without mentioning the single biggest problem of the entire show (no it's actually not the animation quality). And that is the narrator himself. LotGH is a very complex show and thus it's very logical that it also has a solid narrator that helps explain many political aspects, military strategies, mind games etcetera. So far, so good. Now if only that was the only thing he did.\nCase in point: the narrator of LotGH is the biggest spoiler magnet you'll ever see. He's like that guy on the forums that just has to let everyone know that he's read the source material of an anime beforehand, and thus needs to tell everyone what's going to happen a few episodes down the road, before said episodes are aired. Because that's literally what the narrator does; he *tells you* what is going to happen before it does a lot of the time. Like in the middle of an episode he'll let key plot details slip, ones that aren't going to be officially revealed yet for several more episodes. There are countless plot twists and developments in this show that come entirely unsurprising when they're revealed, not because they were predictable but because you were already informed of them by the show itself before they even happened. I have never seen anything like this in any other anime ever and I can't for the life of me wrap my head around what on earth they were thinking when they wrote the script for the narration of this show. It's so incredibly stupid and meaningless. Therefore it is highly recommended that you *skip all previews* at the end of every episode, because they *also* spoil what the next episode is going to be about. As soon as you reach the ending credits of an episode, just turn the damn thing off right away and start the next one instead; pretend the next-episode-preview doesn't exist because it's a literal death trap watching it. Unfortunately you can't do much about the spoilers that are presented in the middle of an episode however seeing as they're handed out when you least expect them, but at least by doing it this way you can somewhat diminish the collateral damage.\nThat being said, as a whole LotGH is still an absolutely magnificent show. It is a true space opera that has the largest scale I have ever seen in anime and one of the most epic stories out there. The characters are original, incredibly well written and just plain intriguing to follow. The flaws of the show are few but noticeable, but despite that it still remains one of the most memorable anime you'll ever see. If there ever was an anime-equivalent to the original Star Wars trilogy, then this is the closest you'll ever get. It is definitely not a show for everyone, something time has most certainly proven, but if you are one of the lucky people who can appreciate the series for what it is, then it's undoubtedly a must-watch anime that you should take from your PTW and put in your Watching list sooner rather than later. It is an experience not quite like any other.\nSeason 1 – 8/10\nSeason 2 – 10/10\nSeason 3 – 10/10\nSeason 4 – 8/10\nOverall – 9/10\n        "},

Then search no further, cause this anime alone is sufficient to satisfy your hunger. \n\nStory : 9/10 \"Great\"\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes (LOGH for short) is a space opera taking place on a small amount of planets in our Milky Way Galaxy, with a greater and noble main purpose : To teach you about the political and war schemes of men. In this Galaxy, there are\n          \n        three separate sides : The autocratic Galactic Empire, the democratic Free Planets Alliance and the politically neutral planet and product trading center, Phezzan.  The plot is mainly centered around the political and war games between the first two, but also around the political importance of Phezzan in forming the shape of this great war. The plot thickens when Reinhard von Lohengramm, a military genius from the side of the Galactic Empire who constantly rises in the military ranks and begins to change the autocratic government from it's foundations, clashes with another military genius from the side of Free Planets Alliance, Yang Wenli, who wants democracy to prevail as the best out of the existing government types and, ultimately, to end this futile war. Empires rise and fall and democracies turn into military-driven governments as the series progress and our characters shape their opinions on human ideals and mature in the most logical way possible out of the results of this endless and brutal war.\n\nArt :  7 / 10 \"Good\" \nThe art of LOGH could be seen as it's most vulnerable side. It has many still scenes, many sloppily re-drawn scenes and maintains a mediocre facial consistency till the end. However, the art is improved through the years and could be recognized as something unique, artsy and very fitting to the mood and themes of the series.\n\nSound :  9 / 10 \"Great\"\nThe works of the big classical composers such as Brahms, Strauss and Tchaikovsky are worldwide known as masterpieces. Thus, I will not further analyze the importance they hold, not only in the classical music section, but to the whole world of music. However, when used properly, they instantly turn a show into a majestic one, with LOGH being the most obvious and well-refined example.\n\nCharacters :  8.6 / 10 \"Great\"\nThere are lot of characters who have significant value in forming the elaborate plot of LOGH and all are three-dimensional, but two of them shine the most: Reinhard and Yang. Reinhard Von Lohengramm is a poor noble from the Galactic Empire side who, along with his best friend Siegfried Kircheis, want to overpower the Kaiser (emperor) , rescue his sister from Kaiser's hands and then unify and rule the whole known universe. An interesting character full of ambition, born to be a wise and thoughtful leader and showing the utmost respect to his citizens, soldiers and subordinates. Yang Wenli is a stoic, sarcastic and witty character, a rising star in the military section of Free Planets Alliance, who, along with his son Julian, wants to contribute the most into ending this endless war between Galactic Empire and Free Planets Alliance and give an end to the unlimited numbers of dead soldiers. Also an interesting character, who is more interested in history lessons than going into battle, and feels the weight of the dead soldiers keep growing on his shoulders, as a respectful and wise military commander should do. The other members of the cast are, if not equally, rather interesting because of their contribution to the plot, their three-dimensional and believable aspects and their redeeming qualities.\n\nVerdict :   8.8 / 10  \"Great\"\nThere is no other show like it. It have some cons, but they are completely surpassed by it's magnitude of feelings and emotions, giving maybe the most powerful anti-war message of our recent times, and most meaningful political analysis on the schemes of men.\n\nA review ends, an amazing experience begins."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    \"Legend of the Galactic heroes is the best anime title ever. Nahh that's bullshit! it looks so last decade.\"  This is for real people, I was like this months before I started watching this and just a few days ago after seeing the last episode. I can proudly say that those claims were actually true. Lotgh as abbreviated by fans is definitely one of the best space opera that I stumbled upon. Now let's move into the review\nSpanning over a hundred episodes. LOTGH is as slow but refined as ever. Masterpieces cannot be created in a whim take our legendary composers for example, they\n          \n        create wonderful masterpieces but takes a lifetime. In LOTGH the plot buildup is slow but each episode is never uninteresting. It feeds you with a bit of the character's pasts, their goals, philosophy and loyalty to their affiliation. The stage is then set for the most wonderful and most dramatic battles that we will ever see in anime history.\nStory: 10/10\nLOTGH is your typical good versus evil warfare but the show is all about what kind of government you believe in. Would you like to follow an emperor or be a democrat instead? Here we have Reinhard von Lohengramm who aims to exact vengeance on the aristocrats of the Goldenbaum Empire and take over the world. We also have Yang Wen-li, a commodore and a pacifist who is driven into the world of these two warring factions, the Goldenbaum empire and Free Planets Alliance.  I strongly believe that this title is a slice of life of a vast future. Judging from what happens to the characters later on, it is definitely delivered in a well refined realism. LOTGH can get as real as it gets.\nIn LOTGH, it's not about good versus evil actually, it's between good versus another good and in what they believe in.\nThe pacing is slow but builds up the most wonderful stage ever, think of this anime as 95% talking and leave that 5% for the space battles and action. \n\nAnimation: 9/10\nThe animation is fluid even though outdated, the animation improves as a season ends. But let me warn you though, some parts of this anime is not for the weakened heart.   I hope you're used to seeing things like beheading, intestines popping out and of course blood, violence and gore. The character design is one of the things I liked most in this anime, it's full of realism. Each and every character is different from another therefore you can actually tell characters apart even from afar.\n\nSound : 10/10\nIf you loved these orchestral pieces, Ninth Symphony E minor  from the New World first movement (Dvorak) and Symphony No. 7 in A major by Beethoven (yes nodame cantabile fans). Then you've come to the right place! Heck, this anime even surpasses the lineup of nodame cantabile by tenfolds. The seiyuu's also has done a great job on conveying the feelings of their characters and the most notable to that is Ryo Horikawa's role as Reinhard. His voice in this character can be sometimes sweet and calming when talking to his assistant Mariendorf and as mad as ever when he's in turn for war. This is also the last title that you can hear the voices of two great seiyuus before their passing; Kei Tomiyama as Yang Wen-li and Shiozawa, Kaneto as Oberstein.\n\nEnjoyment: 8/10\nIf you're used to shounen titles like Naruto =( and bleach which is almost never without action then this title is not recommended for you. If however you're interested in watching something related to war and politics and would like to sip a cup of tea while taking your leisure of watching the best anime plot buildup ever LOTGH is definitely a \"time-well-spent\".\n\nOverall Score : 9\nI bet you have noticed that in some anime sites, LOTGH is scored high or if not, the best. Why is this title one of the best? Why is it that this OVA contains 110 episodes? At first I didn't know either I was lost but now that I finished it, I'm satisfied because I found out why this one is the best. Why is this the best you ask? Well that's for you to find out.\n        "},

What LOGH is, is a tale of human history, an observation of the philosophies and personalities that change it. Using the framing device of an interstellar war, this anime delves into the concepts that create society, never afraid to question and defend every bit and piece of it. A very historical masterpiece if i do say so my self.\n\nThe cast of LOGH are people of ideas, and it is these ideas which bring these characters to light in almost unimaginable ways. Granted, not all characterization is significantly profound. Luckily most characters teeter on the side of heavy character development\n          \n        and analysis, leaving very little time wasted. This is not to say that characters like Eisenach are less important. What matters is that just about every main and supporting character has a valid reason to exist.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is still a space opera. And oh does it deliver. And like any good space opera should, LOGH merely uses space battles as one of many tools to create its rich universe. If this anime was only exciting during deep space skirmishes and the occasional axe fight, this would be a pretty boring series. As fun as these moments are to watch, it is the anticipation of what will happen next that makes LOGH so compelling. What’s important is not so much what will happen, but more why and how it will happen. At a point, it is not so hard to predict the upcoming plot twist. However, knowing where all the pieces are set, keeps one alert for the inevitable, giving rise to an unrelenting sense of urgency, which doesn’t just linger around and appear when necessary. With every scene, the momentum is maintained and you are left with a very sophisticated mature adult oriented show that stuns the masses as its complexity. If you ever seen Death, or GITs, both of those shows use the same sophisticated elements as LOGH. In any case you should check it out, if its not your type or if its till intellectually advanced for you, then i would watch code geass.\nThe production team didn’t just stop at already exceptional quality early on. As time goes by, the animation vastly improves even though its an old show. The cast becomes more relatable. The impact of each and every story element only gets stronger. And the themes become more and more relevant, all cumulating into perhaps the greatest antiwar message in all of anime. \n        "},

I myself was reluctant for many years to commit to 110 episodes mostly because I was turned off by the dated artstyle. The screencaps don't give this series\n          \n        any justice. The animation although 20 years old is beautiful and flawless for its time. The space fights presented in the anime are both believable and timeless pieces of art. Even frequent drawn out discussions between characters are dynamic with hair fluttering and characters expressing themselves in different ways, not like in modern anime by only mouth flapping.\n\nSound - 8/10\nVoice actors did a really good job for this one. although 90% of the anime contains character discussions and more often than not we can hear narrator explaining what is going on it is always a quality performance and you can hear the heart that have been put in their work. Every character voice is distinct and fits perfectly for their personality and character design. Musically, this anime brings nothing new. Most of the music that can be heard in the anime are old classical pieces. The openings and endings contains mostly of soft singing more often than not in English and is nothing amazing but it fits perfectly the show premise. The sound effects like space explosions or laser-blaster gunshots are both believable and perfectly timed and give the show more realistic feel.  \nCharacters - 10/10\nThis show has enormous cast of characters. Every character has well defined personality and ambitions. The story features diverse cast from corrupted nobles through religious fanatics and space pilots with limitless libido to lazy admirals and proud and dedicated army individuals. Each character has its own individuality presented not only by his voice and character design but also by his name and title witch on the empires side are German names or names that remind the viewer of nobility and on the republic side where names have more of a common ring to them.  \nStory - 10/10\nIt is an epic story that deserves to be put on the same pedestal(or even higher one) with famous western space odysseys like Star Wars or Star Trek. The story tries to be believable and explains every little detail it never brings in supernatural element into the mix. It is obvious that author's based their work on events from history and viewer can notice some similarities or tactics used in both WWI and WWII. The story is never stagnant and always leads to something. Watching this I found myself more often than not fully captivated by the episode.  \nEnjoyment - 10/10\nFor 110 episodes long show  IMHO it sure is worth the time. I was captivated by both the story and characters. The characters are likeable and easy to relate with and the story is amazing, it will make you mad, it will make you laugh and it will make you cry, just give it a chance.  \nOverall- 10/10 \nThe show starts kinda slow but give it 5 episodes and you will be hooked.  If you enjoyed anime like Monster or Death Note or even Code Geass give it a go, its amazing. \n        "},

Specially if you are used to new stuff with a lots of mindless action, little to no plot, emo characters that go super by screaming, and crappy sitcom harem series. The type of series i used to like... almost 8 years ago. That's why like someone said in a thread it should be laveled as +18... actually i would lavel it as +21 (minimum). An age in which i consider you have watched enough of the other type of series to realize their are all the same over and over again.\nIf you\n          \n        are at that point in your anime watching experience, either you'll start to search for quality over mindless entertainment or you loved space operas from the begining (for example liking stuff like Crest of Stars and 12 Kingdom as a teen). But if you aren't over 21 years old or you don't like anime with intrincated plot and politics, please don't watch it until a few years. You will only bore yourself to death and won't get to the interesting part of the history, and as a consecuence insult a masterpieace based on nothing... since you didn't finish it :).\nOn the other hand, people who has watched LoGH, has also watched the series you looooooooove (i know i have) and still prefer the first one. So who has more right to speak? The one that has actually watched everything or the one that has only seen the tip of the iceberg? LoGH is for oldfags and space opera fans mostly. Of course there will always be an exeption to the rule, but they are few.\nLoGH fanatism and repude reminds me a lot of LOST. Because you have to watch all of it and from the beginning to truly understand and love it, like most people who have actually done that do. But me only having watched one or two random episodes (to try and see what are people so obssessed with), cannot like LOST and i don't want to watch all of it from the beginning because it seems too long. So in understand it's not LOST fault, but my own because i'm a lazy motherfucker.\nSorry about the random ramblims and bad english (english is not my first lenguage). Overall I'll give it an 6 in art because most people are not into old style and forget this is an old series (though i actually like the art) and enjoyment 9 only because at first is hard to get into. All the rest 10, but it actually deserved an 11. Too bad it's only an anime, it should be a normal series.\n        "},

What is really important is strategy and tactics. You\n          \n        will get full explanations about the formations of battleships, traps to lure the enemy and the many mind games played by the different characters. \nOutside of battle, politics play a very big role. This series will give you a good chance to think a little bit about the advantages and disadvantages of democracy and autocracy, and probably learn a little bit (or a lot) of both.\nTactics vs strategy is a very big theme here. How can tactics affect the whole strategy, and how can a great tactics be worthless if you don't manage to win the strategy battle.\nWatching LOGH is a little bit like watching a history documental (of course, a fictional one). There are many characters, and a lot of them play a big role some time or another during the series.\nA great story needs great characters, and LOGH definitely delivers. Through the story you will get to love many characters, and probably hate others. Character development is also a very huge part of this series.\nLOGH really likes to depict the horrors of war, so death is, of course, a very big theme, and there are a few strong images that might not be good for the faint of heart, but will help making the story much more meaningful.\nLOGH is full of dialogue and requires a lot of attention from the viewer because every detail can be important... and that's exactly what makes this series special.\nAgain, animation is not perfect, and if you are good with details, you will most likely spot a few mistakes here and there, but none of those mistakes should really be a problem in you overall experience.\nFinally, you can't talk about LOGH and not mention its music, which besides the openings, endings, and hymns from both sides of the battle, everything is classical music. Mahler, Beethoven, Tchaikovski, Mozart and a lot more, with everything very well applied to their corresponding scenes.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is really a unique journey in the anime world an beyond (its not fair to limit it only to anime). A very unique, long story that you will most likely not forget."},

Review #50: Legend of the Galactic Heroes\nIn March 12, 2012, I posted my first anime review which was Cowboy Bebop. it was a Sci-fi smash hit set in space. Back in 1999, I saw the Star Wars Trilogy and I am very fond of that Space Opera series, especially the Original Trilogy. I am now into Star Trek and I like how creative and imaginitive it is as well as it being thought-provoking and intellectually engaging. Up until now, I have posted 49 reviews so far (excluding the supplemental reviews I did in the past) up to this\n          \n        point. I have now reached the milestone of 50. Well... This is it! This is the big one... Let’s go where no one has gone before and set out to Space, the final frontier... with LEGEND OF THE GALACTIC HEROES!\nFor decades, the Galactic Empire has been involved in an interstellar war with the Free Planets Alliance, a conflict that involves thousands of spaceships and millions of soldiers on both sides. Two new commanders enter the conflict with great hopes: Imperial Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm and the FPA's Yang Wen-li. As they deal with superiors and subordinates, maneuver through complicated political arrangements, plot strategies, and win battles, each will be tested, and ultimately, changed, by the reality of war. All the events that will take place in space, the galaxy and the universe will appear on the pages of history.\n\nTo be technical, like My Conquest is the Sea of Stars (the Introductory movie), this movie is made by three studios, Kitty Films, Artland, and Magic Bus. The animation in the movie looks nice and all, I can’t really say the exact same thing for the Main Series of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I can explain in a reasonable way. The budget isn’t high at first and the quality is at it’s lowest in the first season, but it still looks nice from time to time. It does not take a while to adjust to because this was made in 1988 and ended in 1997... So expect it to look old-fashioned while you’re watching it. When I mentioned that Season 1 has the lowest quality in animation, I am not lying too much about that. This should not turn you away from watching it...because it’s an old anime, there’s not much room to get yourself adjusted to it in time, what you’ll need to get adjusted to is the heavy amount of dialogue and it’s settings. This first season devotes most of its screentime to establish the settings, the story, and its characters for this long epic that is to be witnessed by the viewer. If you can sit through 20 episodes or so, it will start picking up. It will take awhile to get there. Season 2 starts to improve in time, and this is where the story starts rolling on its own pace. Season 3 is where the show starts to look pretty good and become far more interesting.. However, when you start getting into Season 4, that’s when the animation shines. The animation improves over time and this was a good thing back then. Honestly, the animation is good on its own. If there is something I must point out that I commend the creative staff of this anime for making terrific character designs for this anime. The character designs in this show look fantastic.\nI can assure you 100% on one thing. The soundtrack is Epic in this show. It makes great uses of classical music from Beethoven, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Chopin, Ravel, Mussorgsky, you name it! It does make the show elegant in its own way. If you think it was cool to hear Ode to Joy in Neon Genesis Evangelion or if it was cool to hear some classical music in some other anime. Legend of the Galactic Heroes entire soundtrack is EPIC CLASSICAL MUSIC! I like listening to classical music from time to time and it’s nice to hear some in this show. The music is used terrifically in this show. I almost forgot to mention that the only musical pieces that aren’t from classical pieces, it’s the opening and closing themes. They really set the mood for all the seasons.\n\nAs far as voice acting goes, bear with me because this will take a while for me to bring up the performances in this show. Let it be known that there is no English Dub to this anime. Like the rest of the franchise, it was never licensed in America. This is an obvious reason why no English Dub exists. With that out of the way, I’ll bring up the performances that do stand out. Ryo Horikawa and the late Kei Tomiyama are fantastic as Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wenli. Keiko Han is great as Annerose (Reinhard’s Sister). and Masashi Hironaka is great as Siegfried Kircheis. There are a lot of standout performances in this show. The late Kaneto Shiozawa was terrific as Oberstein, Nozomu Sasaki is also terrific as Julian. Even Norio Wakamoto is in this show and he is fantastic as Reuenthal. Other noteworthy seiyus for this show are Kazuhiko Inoue, Kotono Mitsuishi, Masako Katsuki, Sho Hayami, Toshio Furikawa, Yoshio Sakakibara, Chikao Ohtsuka, Akio Ohtsuka, Aya Hisakawa, Ryotaro Okiayu, and Unsho Ishizuka. Let’s not forget, Yusaka Yara is the narrator of the show and he deserves to be mentioned. There are some currently well-known seiyus in this show which should be a nice treat if you watch enough anime Subtitled that is. When I reviewed My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, I wasn’t joking that there are a shit ton of characters in this show. Well, there are a shit ton of casting roles in this show and I said what I deemed necessary to bring up. Look up the entire cast at your own leisure because explaining all the other well-known cast members would just drag this review much longer and I got other things to go over with this show.\nOut of all the things about this anime, the story will be the hardest thing for me to talk about concerning Legend of the Galactic Heroes. I can assure you that watching 110 episodes of this anime was no easy task. This is because this anime is heavy with political and military intrigue. Not to mention there’s more than 100 characters in this show that are tied into character threads with the more important characters. This show somehow made the cast prove their worth in the long run. Or did it? Well, let’s get over the main leads... Reinhard is a political idealist and a military genius and he sets his ambitions to conquer the universe to end the corruption of the universe. His sister Annerose was sold by their father and Annerose was to serve as a consort to the Emperor - Kaiser Friedrich IV. By Reinhard's side is his best friend Siegfried Kircheis and Kircheis vows to follow Reinhard until he accomplishes his goal. However, Reinhard is not the only military genius floating around in space. Yang Wen-li is also a military genius. However, he harbors no great ambitions. Reinhard is affiliated with the Galactic Empire and Yang Wen-li is affiliated with the Free Planet’s Alliance. These two commanders are terrific and they are great opposites that compliment eachother while they are part of a massive conflict in space. The main focus of the show is mainly about Democracy Vs. Autocracy. It is about one form of government against another. Now that I explained this, it should be made very clear that this anime is not a roller coaster ride. It is like reading a long novel. In fact, Legend of the Galactic Heroes was originally a novel series written by Yoshiki Tanaka. There are three things this anime comes with...It is very political, If you think the political moments will slow the story down while you watch this series, keep in mind that it serves the story. it is also has Military intrigue because there is a great amount of detail on strategy. This is also a very intellectual anime. This plays a huge part with our two main leads as well as the many characters connected to them. Every single episode of this show requires the viewers’ attention. This is the hardest aspect of the show for some to sit through. It is very intellectual with its political settings, military intrigue, and the characters’ thoughts, ideals, and political opinions. It also does not hold anything back when something horrific happens. The theme of war is present throughout the series and that comes to no surprise, really, and it tells this story effectively when it can. The portrayal of Humanity is displayed pretty well in this show and there are a lot of characters that are likeable. Reinhard is interesting as the show progresses further and further, for those familiar with historical events. I heard that Reinhard shares many traits with Napoleon Bonaparte, which it’s fair to say that Yoshiki Tanaka probably has a love for history. One of my favorite characters in this anime is Yang Wen-li, I just love his personality. He’s a very smart tactician who doesn’t want a damn medal for his accomplishments. He just wants to live his life in a simple way, I really like this guy. Mittermeyer and Reuenthal are also great in this show.. Characters like Oberstein, Schenkoph, Frederica, and Poplan are also pretty memorable. Julian is also a great. I can honestly tell you that this show was able to contain an elaborate setting and story with well-developed characters, a soundtrack of classical music, and avoiding any fanservice and many clichés ALL IN 110 EPISODES! This anime is very different than meets the eye. This anime is considered to be unrivaled by some, which now brings me to some issues I have with this anime...\n The animation isn’t all that great at first. it seemed to have a lower budget to begin with on this show. This anime makes up for this because the animation improves over time. I have seen many shows where they either stay consistent from start to finish, or the animation quality in the show diminishes over time. There are few animes I have seen where animation improves over time or stays consistent. I am glad that the animation in this show improved over time.\nHowever... after the show’s completion, it was released on DVD in Japan. not only was it released on DVD, it came with new animation cels in certain moments. These “Re-visions” either made certain scenes look better or they were made to fix errors. A common complaint would be understandable that it can be distracting to see old animation cels and new animation cels being shown back to back. If you end up watching the Remastered Version. You will be dealing with this on Seasons 1 and 2. It seems Star Wars isn't the only Space Opera series with these kind of problems. Now to think of it, Why do I keep thinking of a Star Destroyer whenever I see Reinhard's Flagship \"The Brunhild\"?\nI wonder if Star Wars had some influence over this anime\nMaybe I am overthinking this. Anyway, The Remastered Version might not sit well with all viewers of this show... It’s a take it or leave it thing I guess.\nOne other minor nitpick is that the notable characters that are part of the Terraist Cult are like stock bad guys, that and maybe it would be nice to see a positive side to religion being portrayed instead of just showing the negative extremist side.\nHowever, my last minor nitpick are the scenes where the characters are talking to eachother like in a normal-life situation. I will excuse this completely because it gives the show a sense of realism. This aspect may not sit well with everyone. I was patient to sit through those kind of moments in the show even though this anime is riddled with dialogue.\nIf I had any problems with this show, it would be pointed at the Narrator at some parts of the show. I personally have no issue with a narrator explaining events that took place off-screen inbetween certain moments. What I did not like about the Narrator of this show is that he strongly hints an upcoming event at times. This was done lightly before Episode 26, and there was even a moment where the narrator strongly hinted an event that would happen on Episode 82. You know what; This is technically a spoiler, but the hell with it! That Narrator’s job is to explain things like events that take place inbetween scenes or recap previous episodes or events. His other job is to not TO SPOIL A F***ING PLOT TWIST! This anime is supposed to be intellectual, and this is not a smart move by the creative staff. Episode 82 should have left an impact to not only just the characters, but the viewers as well. The events in this episode had little impact for me thanks to the narrator! But you wanna know something? the narrator is there to give this anime the feel as if it is being told from a history book. That is exactly the intention in Legend of the Galactic Heroes when it comes to narration. All I can say is that you need to get used to it. Still, there is no excuse for having a narrator spoiling something before it happens.\n\nNow it all comes down to this... I am NOT going to blindly give this anime a 10. Why? Because even though Legend of the Galactic Heroes is mostly terrific, the animation had a few hiccups, and some characters are bounced around in certain episodes, making it harder to follow or care for these characters. However, they are used extremely well. Thank God for the name subtitles or I would be confused as hell. Seriously, those subtitles come in handy. However,  I find the narrator's hinting future events a bit questionable. What really does work is the portrayal of politics and war and this is one of the best Anti-war messages portrayed in anime and even other fictional mediums.\nHowever, when I review an anime, I do not fall for public opinion just because of what the majority claims something to be. I also don't buy into the hype that quickly either. Legend of the Galactic Heroes on the other hand is a very underappreciated anime, but deep down inside despite my nitpicking, I don’t have much to hate about this series. This show is actually very good. I can’t lie about that. I commend the creative staff for putting a massive amount of effort in making a show of this scope. The late Noboru Ishiguro deserved to rest in peace knowing he made the what is arguably the greatest Space Opera anime ever made, as well as making the longest OVA series ever made.\nThis is an epic space opera and this is a show for anyone that likes Science Fiction. This is science fiction taken seriously even though this is an anime that deals with politics, military intrigue, war, and humanity in space.\nI strongly believe that everyone has their own opinions and should form their own opinions. When it comes to Anime, I believe everyone has an equal say concerning a specific anime regardless of differences in opinion. In the end, I can’t say that Legend of the Galactic Heroes is required viewing, But I can say that Legend of the Galactic Heroes is for those with acquired taste.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is unlicensed, as well as Yoshiki Tanaka’s novel series of the same name. A movie prequel with the subtitle “Golden Wings” is also unlicensed, another movie called “Overture to a New War” is also unlicensed, a prequel series called “Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden”, which consists of 2 seasons is also unlicensed. The entire franchise is unlicensed; your only way to experience this series is by watching it online. When this series does get licensed someday (which might not happen), pick this show up if you like it.\nWith all that said, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an astounding piece of work. It exceeds with its scope in the story and it has an epic use of classical music. This anime may not have been perfect in animation. This is later excused as this series progresses.   With its elaborate political settings, smart military intrigue, social commentary, and intellectual level as well as character development... Legend of the Galactic Heroes is worthy to be called an Anime Masterpiece in its own right. It is also considered one of the Greatest Animes of all time. Regardless of personal opinion from others. I highly recommend this anime to anyone that is into Science Fiction and Space Operas.\n\nI give Legend of the Galactic Heroes a 9.5 out of 10. It is EXCELLENT!\n\nFeel free to leave a comment.\n\nCritic’s Log - Postscript: Well... with this review wrapped up. I have now posted 50 reviews. It might not sound like much, but this is a milestone I was looking forward to. I know that I intend to continue as long as I can. If you have been sticking around on my reviews. I want to thank you. If you went through this entire review, I thank you for your patience and I apologize for making it long-winding, I hope you can fully understand. I want to thank all the friends I have made inside the anime community. (no matter the amount), and I want to thank a good friend of mine (which I will not name by request) for getting me back into anime after I had a brief disinterest and I also thank her for recommending me some shows which turned out to be fun.\nI want to give everyone one last message while I wrap-up... This message is to all but at the same time, This message is to you...\n\nLive Long...and Prosper.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Its hard for me to decide the score for this anime because I read the translated novels quite some years ago, when I was young and don't know much. ( Btw, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is adapted from novels written in the 80s possibly with political propaganda.) At that time, I thought it was the greatest thing ever written.  I worshiped everything the author(Yoshiki Tanaka) says about politics/war and memorized quotes.\nWhen I watched this anime, which follows the novels closely, I was older and I start noticing the flaws.  Conclusion?  It is not the greatest thing ever written: there are plenty\n          \n        of novels/movies exploring politics/war in deeper levels; and plenty of novels/animes with more realized characters.  But LOGH is still a masterpiece!  Here is why.\nStory: 10\nLOGH has everything.  Excellent plot that keeps you on your toes, Yoshiki Tanaka style irony, memorable quotes, philosophical questions (e.g. Is democracy better an autocracy?).  The battles, although shown as rectangles/triangles on a computer screen, are much more interesting than stupid mecca fights because it is all about strategy.\nArt & Sound ：7\n7 is not bad for an anime made so long ago.\nCharacter ： 9\nAlthough they are not terribly realistic, they are very interesting and memorable.  You get the contrast between the two protagonists.  You have Reinhard Lohenngram who is handsome, perfect manners, highest grade at military school and perfect in every way.  Then you have Yang Wei-li, who is average looking, famous for his 2 second speeches, failed every subject except for history and strategic planning.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="                          \n    This series is overrated.\nFor the most part, anime is a very difficult genre to critique because you can basically judge it in two perspectives: how it fairs within the context of the anime genre (or subgenre) and how it compares with the whole concept of a story, whether it's animated or not. For some titles, say Bacano, you accept the anime-ism, since it does certain things that's innovative and original in the anime format, and it works. Take it out of the anime style and anime tropes and the anime mannerisms, some things may not work the same. Other titles doesn't rely on anime-ism, ie,\n          \n        Seirei no Moribito, Prince Mononoke, etc, strive for mass appeal. \nSo what does all this have to do with Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu? Well, people watch anime primarily for two reasons, 1) you like anime as a medium and it tells stories in ways that no other formats can, and 2) you watch anime because they are often times self-gratifying melodramatic fantasies for you to escape. There's nothing wrong with this, but Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu just happens to be the type of series that seems like a sophisticated premise on the outside, but the actual meat and bones of the story is a self-gratifying melodramatic fantasy. This makes people who normally watch anime as a means of escape to both enjoy the cheesiness, and yet at the same time feel like they're watching something 'sophisticated' on a superficial level, classical music included.\nAt the core, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is an idealization of the ultimate nerd genius (the author), with a foster son serving as a Mary Sue in Julian to carry on is legacy, essential becoming a 'legend'. Reinhard acts as the sympathetic antagonist in order offset the author's idealized version of himself. There's nothing wrong with that; many anime titles are built on this formula and I've enjoyed them; I like to escape too. But to rate this as masterpiece is a fluke, because if it weren't the spaceship battles, and classical music, and the length of the series, it would be at best mediocre.\nAnd let's talk about the battles. The majority of the tactics and strategies used were basic combat 101 maneuvers, some of which you can find in history books (surprise surprise). But ok, if you didn't know anything about large-scale Roman battles, then it must have been exciting for you. However, because the main characters are supposed to be geniuses, these tactical moves fall short of what the battles are truly capable of.\nFor a 110-long series filled with spaceship battles, it gives us shockingly very little detail on how the ships function in space. Do the cannons have a certain effective range? If so, how does that work in the vacuum of space, where there's no resistance and no loss of kinetic energy? In reality, the ships can fire at any range and with deadly accuracy, but the battles show the ships moving around traditional formations to 'get in range.' Why? They could have made it so that the cannons fire energy blast and that at a certain distance they gradually lose some of their strength, which could explain why some hits don't do as much damage as others, or that the battles carry on for days and days, firing as if though they never run out of ammo. Maybe this was in the books, who knows.\nIf you want an example of creating a convincing framework for a fight, look for a series like Initial D or Claymore, in which they clearly explain the mechanics and rules of their powers and vehicles. Operating within that framework gives audience the sense that the writer is not using plot armor. Even non-action titles like Death Note does a splendid job of creating the right framework for the main characters to fight in. Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu does not do this. Adding the fact that everyone except for the main characters are incompetent, it undermines any sort of 'strategy' they're employing.\nHaving said all that, this series have its good moments, but it really isn't the masterpiece that people make it out to be. If you want strategic fights, there are other series that does it better and took less episodes to accomplish. If you want spaceship battles with lots of boom, look for Yamato. The only thing that makes Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu stand out is its monstrous length, which isn't enough to rate it so high.\n"},

No I don’t mean the colloquial epic. But epic in its literal sense. Many people complain that the first season is boring (first 22 ep’s) but that is not the case. The first season sets the base for the entire series and leaves no room for any misses.\n“In every age, in every place the deeds of men remain the same!” \nThe story in not anything new, in fact it is the story of the history of humans, of every war and every ambition. But\n          \n        no other anime has represented this story with such eloquence . LOGH does not feed us pseudo-science or complex principles of string theory but tells us about simple things which we are all too familiar with, war and politics. Where the show lacks in adrenaline rush it makes up for it in intellectual stimulation. The English subtitles are amazing with correct and beautiful English. I suggest you watch the anime with an internet connection and a dictionary. I myself had to research some concepts before understating a simple statement but that is a bad reflection on me not the series.\nWhat at first might appear to be a simple story between good and evil takes a different turn and makes us question our own ideals and morals. The principles of democracy and autocracy are represented exquisitely. On one side we have the imperial empire which is under the control of aristocrats who fill their pockets by sending common people to their deaths (until a commoner who like a fairy tale prince works is way up to becoming the emperor of the entire imperial empire and reforms the nation ending the tyranny of the noble aristocrats.) On the other hand we have a democratic empire which has been rotted to the core because of the laziness of the citizens in electing good politicians.\n The series provides a good reflection of Orwellian philosophy i.e. mass media manipulating the opinions of common people and secret police arresting the thought-criminals. I loved the contrast between the protagonists on the opposite side of the spectrum. Kaiser, Reinhard von Lohengramm who gains the power but losses his only friend and sister. Although he has the entire universe around his finger, he is a tragic figure being the loneliest person. Yang Wenli, a genius tactician on the other hand does not want power, he wants to be a historian but fate has other plans for him. To protect his ideals for democracy he gains power though not voluntarily. He has friends while the Kaiser has subjects. He shares honest laughs with his friends while Rienhard is given loyalty, respect but not companionship. There are many other remarkable characters one example is that of Paul von Oberstein who makes Machiavellian decisions for the emperor and takes the thankless job of directing all the hatred upon himself which might have been directed on his Kaiser and could has planted seeds of revenge against the Lohengramm dynasty.  \n\nThough some might say that the characters are one-dimensional, I don’t agree. Everyone is a product of their past environment so the predictable behavior is realistic not plastic. Music is a strong suit of this series. You can lose yourself in the serenity of every track of every season. The paroxysm you get from the accompanying soundtracks makes up for the lack of testosterone gushes. The animation is not good but that cannot be held against the show since it ran from 1988-2000. (The animation does improve as the series progresses.) The brilliant story-line with sagacious characters makes the anime vivacious. \nThough I gave this anime a masterpiece rating there are tiny flaws should also be addressed. The religion (or cult) is shown in villainous light without setting a proper foundation for it. The love chapter between Julian and Karin is somewhat rushed and immature. But there petite errors should not prevent anyone from viewing this anime. The astounding depiction of colossal level of military affairs a feat. Although I sound like a critic, let me get off my high horse and just say that it was a privilege to come across this anime. \n"},

It is an pretty old 110 episodes long anime released as an OVA, and is probably the longest OVA ever released. The fact that it was released like this, and not aired regularly had a lot of influence on the fact that is wasn't really popular, and was never a mainstream show. But the fan base that it has accumulated over the years despite never being licensed for translation outside of Japan(subtitles that exist are all fan created)\n          \n        gives me the right to call it a real classic.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is based on a series of science fiction novels by author Yoshiki Tanaka. The anime ran from 1988 to 2000 and spans for 110 episodes and was developed by Artland. The story is set in a fictional future where a long lasting war is going on between the Free Planet Alliance and the Galactic Empire. In the middle of the conflict we find the ambitious genius Reinhard who has a deep hate for the ruling dynasty but continues to serve its army and rise in ranks. On the other side in the Free Planet Alliance we follow Yang Wen-li a young commander who is brilliant in his own right but believes in democracy and lacks the political ambition of Reinhard. As the story progresses they both find themselves playing opposing roles in a chess game between the Empire and Alliance in which they eventually rise to be \"kings\".\nThe animation is the only real minus to the show if you are a fan of state of the art effects. Its is an old show so the look of it is old as well, personally i didn't have a problem with it as i have grown up watching similar art style but somebody might.\nThe main plus of the show and what makes it a classic are its story and characters. One word is enough to describe the whole trip you will make from episode 1 to 110 and that is EPIC. Large scale space battles with no deus ex machina in them, but plain tactics. Future technology like space warping that is implemented in a way that you don't even notice and sometimes forget that it doesn't exist in real life. Political and court intrigues and a hidden philosophical tone give the show a deeper meaning which will appeal to the a part of the audience that isn't there just for the battles. There is a bit of love in it as well, and a motive on growing up and parenting too. \nCharacter development is done in such a brilliant manner, which is rarely seen in an anime. You will get to see more characters with a believable and developed back story than in any other show. For sure some of them will remind you of people you know or even yourself, and you will slowly grow attached to them. At the very start you will pick your side but will probably change it a few times till the show ends, and that is what makes it so good. The conflict is not one sided and there is no real antagonist nor protagonist, all the characters are in tones and none are just black or white.\nThe music is composed mostly of classical pieces, or pieces composed to sound like it and they go well with the whole setting in which the author imagined the future world. When there are court scenes you will here Wagner like songs and waltz dances. While the Alliance part has some a bit modern melodies.\nOverall the show leaves you wanting more, and you will need some time to get used to that you will not see more of your favorite commanders, and I must say that if you don't like sad moments in anime this is not for you, because people will die in it, and bad thing will happen, as the main message of the show is that history moves on and that however great we are we will eventually be just pages in some history book(at best). The anime coming out today owe a lot to LOGH as the 2 main characters have been an inspiration for a lot of today's mains. \nI can recommend this show as a must watch for sci-fi, political intrigue and military tactics lowers as well as to anyone else wanting something truly EPIC. Don't watch it if you can't give it all your attention as it needs it and it is a pity to not watch it if you can't give it your fullest.\n        "},

So don't go around imagining advanced mecha like gundams or anything lol. The plot is very nice, I think it was based on a novel so thats probably why it is a bit more satisfying than most other anime's out there.

Unfortunately for me this anime was merely a fantastic anime that redefined \"epic\" and brought in unheard-of depth and complexity to anime. It is a show that should eventually be watched by anyone who considers themselves a true fan of anime, a classic to be put on the shelves besides Gundam and Evangelion. That isn't to say it's a masterpiece (IMO), but it is a classic. \nSo, what's this all about? It's historically regressive, seems like a German parable, or an abstract WW2 based\n          \n        fantasy. It ultimately didn't say anything revolutionary, and seemed a bit overly-sympathetic towards monarchy and the cult-of-personality. But this sympathy would be something expected from, let's say, an unbiased history series. One example of it being an abstract history fantasy is in the animation. The battles are presented in 2D! It's about the left flank and the right flank. There is no up flank or down flank. No strategy took advantage of the third dimension! Another example is the Germanisms (for example the use of German language when addressing each other, like \"seig kaiser\"), which are so bald for me to consider the “history” aspect of show to be the main point. This isn't supposed to be a work of speculative fiction, it is supposed to be a work of history disguised by spaceships and laser beams. This series has several strong points. It is the most complex, yet coherent, series I've ever seen. It presents several subjects worth thinking about, and runs through the debate of democracy vs. monarchy, which many viewers are only familiar with one side of (the winners write the history books!) The music was grand, and, ... German. German classical music. I swear this show was written by history nerds. Just like Julian and Yang. Coincidence? I think not!\nSo here we have some WW2 era futurized fantasy between monarchy and democracy, written unbiased and with full attention to details, set against the very best music ever written (Brahms, Beethoven, etc.) The characters, how about them? Well, let's say flat but complex. They do not really grow as characters, which of course allows other characters to accurately judge their intentions and tendencies, and plan their activities accordingly. In other words, the flatness of the characters is almost necessary to make this show more complex. I still have to dock a couple points there, I can't accept dropping character development merely for the sake of plot development. They are good characters regardless. How about the art? Well, quite frankly it's rather poor. Some of it can be excused by age, but the point is that at this point we're looking for excuses. All these reviewers giving the art an 8/10 are plain delusional. At least it fit's the mood of the show. As for my enjoyment, it was at times tainted by the pure sluggishness of the show. I think this would have been better as an 80 episode series, to be honest. \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n    After hearing about this epic and giving it a shot, I have to write that I was disappointed. I didn't find a lot of realistic depth or subtlety in the behavior and interactions of the characters. In the interactions of the characters, I didn't find the exemplary social intelligence that graces so much of the anime that fascinates me. I didn't get the moments that develop the characters in a subtle or moving way. Really, I must say that the characters and script were, well, all too simple.\nSecondary to the lack of depth in the characters and script would be the unconvincing battles. The fleets\n          \n        are led by supposed geniuses, but what the show's creators pass off as brilliant strategems amount to nothing noteworthy, to my mind.\nBut this anime is widely admired, so what do I know?

Ladies and Gentlemen this is the holy grail or war and politics, the magnum opus of space opera a masterpiece to utterly eclipse all masterpieces. \nI didn't know what to think going into it but the series doesn't pull any punches and the plot kicks off straight away, and boy does it suck you in. It took me 7 days to watch 110 episodes. \nThe animation is dated, but then that's where it gets its charm,\n          \n        the soundtrack is serene and flows perfectly with each scene, the characters are all REAL - they have motives, personalities, ideals, dreams and fears it's difficult not to feel for them, nobody is perfect! \nI suppose there is only one criticism that one can make - and it doesn't really qualify as a criticism but as a big fan of Gundam Wing and the 08th MS Team, I always longed for more focus on the individuals doing the fighting instead of  simply on their commanders. This longing was satisfied later on but the individual dogfights (when they finally began) turned out to be pretty poor and could have been executed better. This I will stress is not a valid criticism as the series isn't about individuals fighting it is about fleet commanders.\nAnyway if this hasn't convinced you to watch it, I'm not sure what will. Please excuse me while I go and watch all the Movies and prequels! \n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=21,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Legend Of The Galactic heroes is NOT an anime for everyone. It is a highly dialogue driven and is highly intellectual, deep and thought-provoking and unlike most of the space operas it does not any highly advanced artificial intelligence through which the main protagonist can do something over the top and marvelous and also it does not have any Intelligent extraterrestrial life forms other than human beings, which are a few reasons which makes legend of the galactic heroes really stand out from rest of the animes. Even after more than 20 years there hasn’t been a show which could mimic the likes of Legend\n          \n        of the galactic heroes and is the epitome of amazing and intellectual story telling the likes of which will never be surpassed by any anime or a movie. Also Shouen and die-hard action fans will be gravely disappointed as there are no attractive CG or highly exaggerated explosions or some high-tech mecha destroying everything in its path with the use of eye catchy laser beams, missiles, etc... So if you are interested in space operas and are interested in politics or military strategics, please give legend of the galactic heroes a try and when you do, there will be many emotional, engrossing moments awaiting you.\n\nAnimation: The animation for the first season is highly  outdated, bland and flushed out (like the physique of the face and the lip moments during dialogues were very unattractive and badly drawn) but what more can you except from a series which is more than two decades old and made with a rather low budget than most of the longer shows around that time and the source material was  unpopular and it barely got any recognition, but the animation really improves as the series progresses to the third season and the animations become more clean and is more consistent than it was at the first two seasons and also the facial and lip moments become much better and fluid. But the space battle for the first two seasons are done in a very simplistic manner in which large rectangular ships, which all looked the same except for the admirals battle ship and spartanians and valkyres , which exchanged laser beams in a battlefield filled with a lot of explosions and each ship gets destroyed by just a single fire of the enemy missiles or laser beams, but what made the battles exciting were not the amount of explosions, but the level of excitement you experience during the war is mainly due to the very interesting and engrossing military strategies and tactics used by the main characters during the time of crisis to avoid getting defeated and how they used the environment to take an advantage over the opposition or how they turned an extremely disadvantageous situation into their advantage by using their experience or tactics. Also the animation of the battles improve significantly during the third season and by then you would have be able to recognize each of the high admirals ship. But the animation of the battles is still outdated but it never ceased to impress me with it the amazing military tactics and is very enjoyable and what makes the battles all the more exciting are the amazing classical sound tracks used during the battles. The thing that impressed me the most is none of the huge list of the characters in legend of the galactic heroes looked the same, they all had their own distinct facial and physical features and were extremely realistically drawn compared to most of the other animes and they never exaggerated any of the expressions of the characters and how they look and at times had a lot of gore and violent scenes. Also there weren’t too many recycled animations and the backgrounds were for the most of the time nicely drawn and sometimes breath-taking and the attention to detail improved a lot as the series progressed. Overall the animation was effective in creating the right mood to watch the series.\nScore-7/10               \n\nCharacters: Legend of the galactic heroes had a very long list of diverse and memorable characters that has their own distinct features, personalities and most of them had their own reasons, believes on which side they preferred to associate with. Each of the more than hundred characters in the series have their own unique voice actor and each of the voice actors have done a really fabulous job, except a few characters whose voice is too deep, which isn’t much of a concern when you consider how well the other voice actors done. Since the series is considerably long, it had enough time to genuinely develop its long list of characters in a truly tremendous manner and each of the characters feelings, thoughts, losses and expressions are expressed in such a way that it will always keep you engrossed and get attached to the characters so much that you will start to understand the sentiments of characters. All of the characters in this series act natural and in accordance to the type of situation they are entangled in and when they die they stay dead unlike the most of the shouen mainstream animes. The two main characters Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm are the most memorable of the lot, but there a lot of other characters who were equally memorable and succeeded in catching my attention like Oscar Von Ruental, Wolfgang Mittermeyer and Paul Von Oberstein from the galactic empire and Julian Minci, Dusty Attenborough and oliver poplan. But one thing that really bothered me was the lack of any influential female leads and even though there were a few, they for most of the time forgettable compared to the two main male leads, but they had a lot of effect on the lives of the two main characters. The whole legend of the galactic heroes universe is ruled by the male majority which is the only unrealistic situation compared to the real world. Overall LotGH has one of the best main protagonists ever made and has a huge list of memorable supporting cast.\nScore-10/10\n\nStory: Legend of the galactic heroes is and will forever be one of the greatest space opera ever told by man. I’ve never seen any other anime or movie with such a deep insight into political drama. Throughout the 110 episodes there isn’t single filler or a boring episode, which is a great accomplishment considering how the ongoing long shows are ruined by boring and irrelevant filler arcs . The pacing and progression of the story is slow, seamless and solid and most of the minor flaws are forgettable and the level of intensity never lets up even for a single second and relies very heavily on philosophy. The LotGH universe is very rich, detailed and explained from every possible direction and there are even full episodes dedicated   just to the history of the rise and fall of the nations and it only uses space battles to make the universe more rich and detailed. What makes LotGH so compelling is the expectation of what will happen next (avoid watching the preview of the next episode as there will be intense spoilers in them) and some times I was so curious as to what will happen next that I lost track of the number of episodes I watched that day. Even though you might predict most of the plot twists that come along in the course of the show, but when they do arrive you will be literally blown away and what makes them even more interesting is not about what will happen, but when, why and how they will happen. After the end of the first season the influence of each of the story element will get stronger and stronger and by the time one reaches the third season they will be totally immersed into the show and that’s when it truly starts to shine. This is only one of the few animes which shows the negative side of war by showing the viewers how it affects the mindset of citizens who were engulfed into it, depletion of the crucial military resources and manpower and the intense sorrow caused the loss of a loved one. \nScore-10/10\n\nSound and enjoyment: LotGH has one of the largest collections of outstanding classical German sound tracks and it really succeeds in creating the right mood to watch the series and makes it all the more enjoyable and it was a real treat to hear the amazing sound tracks during the space battles and it once again succeeds in creating a tense atmosphere. All the opening and ending songs were soothing and mild, which really suited the show.This is as good as any show could ever get and the level of enjoyment that one experiences in unparalleled. \nScore- 10/10  \n\nOverall-10/10"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    ''The legend ends, and history begins...''\nWould it be possible for an anime series to be extremely coherent, with a broad range of relevant characters, without getting contradictory in its more advanced stage and maintain its quality for over than 100 episodes? Most anime series disagree...but not Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Being the huge anime it is, this 110 episode OVA series could well have turned into a tremendous dissapointment if it had the bad handling for that. Being from a less known studio and to have been released for over than 9 years would also help LotGH be an example for that. Fortunately for\n          \n        anime it wasn't.\nStory - 9\nFrom its start, the story depicts a small portion of the long fought war between two huge intergalactic superpowers: the democratic republic of the Free Planets Alliance and the monarchic Galactic Empire; while the small planet of Phezzan, an economic superpower, notes the disputes of those two. \nA premise like this could easily get broken by simply being biased towards one of the side, leaving one of them in the good side while the other is at the bad side, making the morality bar strictly black and white.However, during its run-time, there's never any evidence of there ever being a bias approach towards a specific side. Each of them are depicted as having their own virtues and flaws, advantages and disadvantages, and both show how this war impacts one another. Both suffer  important losses during the huge length of the series. \nBeing the multi-layered story it is, LotGH also presents how the economic power of Phezzan can affects both forces. The first quarter of the series is actually focusing not only on how the interactions between these foreign groups work, but also how their people act inside of each power. For example, while FPA claims to be a righteous democracy, it actually suffers from political corruption. Similarly to FPA, the Galactic Empire also holds its fare share of corrupt nobles, rising in power because of their connections and money. Whereas Phezzan, while trying to keep an image of a just economical power, its Leader shows clear desire to pull the strings behind the war for his financial advantage while, behind the shadows, worshiping the Terraism religion, consisting majorly of mindless lunatics who worship the now long gone planet Earth as the origin of all life, easily doing any task their religious leaders order them to, being it pragmatically violent or not.\nThere is an excellent equilibrium of virtues and flaws on each side for the morality bar to be as gray as possible. There is always some kind of foreshadowing before a happening that would otherwise feel convinient. Every action has a consequence, even if it had to be done for the well being of millions while taking the lives of thousands, not only the one who will have to react to it but also the one who suffered from it. Every action is taken seriously and there is always thinking about its consequences, unless the character doing it has backdrop excusing his possible bad handling. \nThere can be some arguing that LotGH, however, is unable to portray his seriousness in some of his aspects and ends up becoming pretentious. But here I am to excuse some of the frequently used arguments against LotGH:\n *“Why are people concerned about there being politicians supporting war and patriotism while they themselves won’t go to war, even though there has to be someone dealing with services while soldiers are away?”* Simple. People from every corner of the world, from every warfare period in recent years, have always given some blame to politicians for not participating in the fights they promote. They’re lacking reasoning of course, but it is clear that LotGH just used those moments to portray some realism in such situations.\n*“Medieval fights in space? Cheap excuse for copying Star Wars lightsaber action”* It is excused in series that while in combat there is a special type of gas-like substance, the Zephyr particles, which in contact to any type of heat, enters in instantaneous combustion. As a solution, in order to take over another battleship or space where the substance is applied, they use traditional battle equipment.\n*“Naval strategies in space?”* There is no up or down in space. They wouldn’t be able to fight properly while using 3D battle strategies without losing their sense of direction and actual positioning.\n*“There are few geniuses in this series! Most of the victories are achieved by outsmarting dumb people!”* Firstly, there aren’t only military geniuses fighting in wars. Secondly, this goes to show that there are dumb people in positions they don’t deserve, for the already said reasons. If you pay enough attention it becomes clear that, whenever real war geniuses are fighting, the decisions and strategies shown become far more complex and tend to follow a reasoning that will find an opening that the opposition won’t be waiting for.\n*“This looks like a documentary. I get it! War is bad!”* There are far more subtle messages than just saying that war is bad. Disregarding other themes, the series always tries to portray the reasoning behind it and is not always against it. Of course the show is clearly against war and every type of warfare is seen in a rather depressing than cool way but LotGH also showed other POV.\n*“One side started getting ahead in the war! The show it being biased!”* There were gradually and rationally appearing far more advantages in one side rather than the other. Of course that side had to start gaining terrain instead of the other. It is far more plausible to do that instead of keeping a forced balance.\nYou might be questioning yourself by now, that after so much arguing and defending the series as a Masterpiece, why doesn’t it get the perfect score? Well as any type of entertainment work in existence LotGH does have its problems. However small they may be, they truly affect the anime in a negative way. Most of the problems of the series stand out from its pacing and exposition. The major problem with these is that they clearly end up messing with each other and sometimes ruin the experience. It is really easy for an episode to become unamusing just because the first 3 minutes of it were completely infodumped by the narrator. Now I may have made it seem horrible but to be honest without this type of exposition, the series would be 3 times bigger and 1/3 would be complete set-up episodes ruining the experience in a much bigger level. For the runtime the episodes have, for being able to use as much as 3 for episodes of complete infodumping is a complete win, as some series tend to do the same...only 10 times worse. LotGH uses infodumps on usually actions that happened with little conflict and ended up being of little importance, relatively to what is going to happen in the entire episode, however, to keep it realistic, they had to happen. That's the only reason I can find to excuse the infodumps.\nCharacter - 10\nNot only is Legend of the Galactic Heroes humongous in plot, but also in the quantity of characters it presents. To such a quantity of characters, it could easily happen what happens to shows like DRRR!!, where most of the cast is almost completely disregarded of any characterization or relevance. LotGH on the other hand is able to present 50+ characters, all having relevance in the plot and having their fare share of characterization and chaacter development. And don't come at me saying that DRRR!! had less screentime for that, because all the characterization given for every early character in the series in done within the first 15 or so episodes without leaving plot progression left in the corner. As there are so many characters worth of mentioning in the series and as I might as well be writing a book about all of them right now, I will focus my attention to 3 of them who I think that deserve to be mentioned.\nYang Wen-li may as well be elected as world president. A clumsy guy who just wanted to study history as kid but because of economical problems ended up entering the army in order to have his studies paid. The poor guy would then be acknowledge as a military genius and levels up in rank quite fast. Not because he chose to however. He limited himself to use strategies he ended up studying as, unfortunately, most of human history is full of warfare. Finding himself in such an high position he at least tries to recommend his superiors plans that without fail will succeed even tho they don't listen to him.\nReinhard von Musel was a poor noblesmen son that at an early age had the light of his life, his sister Annerose von Musel, taken from him by the Kaiser. \nReinhard then vowed to, one day, seize the entire universe by his hands so that he won't ever be an impacable powerless lad again. Siegfried Kircheis is Reinhards best friend in the entire universe and promised Annerose that he would protect him no matter what happened. Kircheis could easily be mistaken as a shadow of Reinhard, his right-arm or even just his advisor who calls him up whenever his flaws make him choose the wrong path or act. He sometimes even feels overwhelmed by Reinhard. He really is, however, looked upon by Reinhard as a guardian who he himself tends to follow whenever he feels unease. Try picturing this level of characterization into 20 more characters and try to explain it all lol. Throughout this epic all these characters will learn with their eventual mistakes, mature or sometimes destroy themselves because of the events that take place in their endangered lives. \nNot so fortunately tho, all this characterization is mostly used on the most relevant characters, as early opponents to Reinhard and Yang tend to rather be the one-dimensional corrupt bastards that can be seen in your usual Sunday cartoon. But as these are so few characters in a range of over 50+ well executed characters, it can easily be overlooked. This also happens for Terraism lunatics, but as the creators were trying to pass a message through that, it is completely excused.\nArt & Animation - 8\nAlthough dated, for their time the art and animation of the series was pretty well executed and stand out from most anime as they actually tend to get better over time, unlike most anime out there. There are well drawn scenarios as well as memorable character figures. The only problem I can find was how they diddn't use any type of simbolism to distinguish rank between FPA soldiers, even though they sacrificed this for realism. The character designs were very well chosen as they had to transmit a sense of realism and not the usual exagerated anime tropes. Their hair color was within the spectre of realistic hair colors as well as their body porpotions.\nSound - 10\nThe soundtrack however can be said to be the most well chosen aspect within the presentation of the series. Ageless classical music being played during the course of the series, really merges with the whole aesthetic of the series and I can no further explain how much I loved it. The OPs were mostly decent but  the 3rd one \"Sea of Stars\" can be said to be one of the most enjoyable OPs evr done. Go watch to it. The golden trophy however goes for every ED this show had. They didnt create simple melancholic EDs. They created the most endearing pieces of audiovisual I have experienced in the ED category.\nOverall - (9.5) 10 \nLotGH does have problems, but they become meaningless near the excelent characters and plot that explores its military and political themes perfectly, while making outstanding parallels between military and politics, often depicted as some of humanity's most important moments.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=19,   ["text"]="                          \n    Story \nI'm no more odd to space musical show, so when I heard that Legend of the Galactic Heroes offered an epic war between a 'Galactic Empire' and a 'Free Planets Alliance', I went in expecting the sort of good dualism found in Star Wars and Star Trek. Without a doubt, the Alliance is uncovered to be degenerate and the Empire is experiencing changes, however and still, after all that I'd expected it wouldn't go any more remote than Babylon 5 - which assaulted degenerate majority rule government by method for praising big-hearted military fascism - or the pompous haughtiness of Firefly. \nYet further Galactic\n          \n        Heroes went. Each and every other time I was going to make a tricky comment about the ethical false reverence of one position or the repercussions of an alternate, it was defeated me - frequently through the ubiquitous storyteller. Surmise that the heroic good manners of foe commandants is just the complicity of mass killers? It's a thought specified in passing. In the event that the war is typically portrayed just as spaceships blasting to an established soundtrack, the revulsions are additionally demonstrated: once, an officer holds his guts as his boat copies. \nThe particular advantages and issues of a degenerate majority rule government or a kindhearted autocracy are dealt with in a shockingly impartial way - to the degree undue predisposition exists, it is with individuals as opposed to legislative issues. \nAs far as degree the account is stunning as it takes the destiny of these two country states directly through their battle to the completion. This improvement is never quick paced yet I can't review a solitary filler scene - it feels like the inflexible walk of recorded occasions, or, as the storyteller every now and again intones, 'an alternate page of galactic history is turned'. \nTorments are taken to substance out this universe. Entire scenes are dedicated to history lessons, which are more enlivening than that may sound. Honestly this is not a sensible universe even by the liberal gauges of space musical drama - letters are still manually written, everything about the Empire whiffs of nineteenth century chronological error, even the Alliance can appear obsolete. Despite the fact that not conceivable, this is unquestionably a captivating world to lose all sense of direction in. \nSpace fights are incessant, having a tendency to fall into the normal space musical show tropes of disregarding three measurements (unless they feel like it) and being dealt with as a maritime engagements, however inside those traditions I discovered them to be really intriguing review. \nThere are various activity scenes including men wielding tomahawks (clarified away as long-range weapons don't work for technobabble reasons), which can be pleasant for character associations - particularly Walter von Schenkopp being a gangsta - yet can likewise be undermined by the exceptionally concentrated on, showy way of the composition. These engagements could likewise be seen as to a degree senseless. Moreover the utilization of German will fail to impress anyone for anybody acquainted with the dialect. \nAll that considered, the high evaluating reflects my inclination that the qualities of the plot - which feels like an epic novel in the vein of Romance of the Three Kingdoms - surpasses its own shortcomings to wind up something superlatively paramount. \nSound \nA large portion of the music is European established, yet a great ear is demonstrated in applying given pieces. The melodies for the openings and endings for the most part fit this subject - the opening is perpetually an established piece sung by a lady (or ladies) in English, while the consummation - which utilizes a male artist - is generally traditional yet sporadically veers into light pop, constantly in Japanese. The English is useful for everything except the final one of the openings. With that opening rejected, these melodies are very listenable - regardless of the possibility that their comparability may make them smudge together. \nThe voice cast is strikingly sizeable, a hefty portion of whom would later go ahead to notoriety in other anime arrangement - and there are absolutely a few astounding exhibitions here. On the off chance that I were to single one out I'd pick Kei Tomiyama, whose remorseful Yang Wenli is thoughtful and agreeable. At the point when the part was recast for Golden Wings, it simply wasn't Yang to me any longer. \nCharacters \nSince a reliably positive audit is exhausting to peruse, permit me regardless the negative: Several characters are two-dimensional. There are more than a couple of unyieldingly persistent commanders on both sides, and the individuals from the Terraist religion are your stock manipulative shady religious request. Once more, however the political frameworks are taken care of in shades of dim, a high contrast difference is now and again utilized between people. \nFor each modest bunch of essentially drawn figures, be that as it may, there are a plenty of magnificent ones, and it is the characters alongside the plot that structure this current anime's most prominent qualities. \nMost outstanding are the two adversaries Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm, whose battle is a main impetus all through. Both are thoughtful yet not one or the other getaway feedback - Reinhard for his tyrannical points, Yang for depending so firmly on such an altogether dishonest government. To a degree they're blameworthy of the basic anime blemish of educated virtuoso - we're told instead of truly persuaded that they are uncommon authorities. Regardless, the procedures are sufficiently able - and the characters so elegantly composed as individuals - that I didn't generally mind. \nYang offers a significant part of the most strong analysis about war and legislative issues, frequently in a wryly amusing and dissuading toward oneself way. In spite of the fact that one may condemn his systems, Yang's identity and conversational reach feels more really like a virtuoso strategist than comparative characters in anime. \nIn the event that Reinhard is less fascinating, its simply because Yang sparkles so splendidly. Still, its anything but difficult to sympathize with his contempt of the nobility for making his sister the Emperor's sexual toy. His reliance on his closest companion and consistent shadow, the ever good Siegfried Kircheis, is pleasantly stood out from the need of his Machiavellian partner Paul von Oberstein. Eventually his character bend is ostensibly the most convincing. \nBeside those two there are numerous, numerous other fascinating and decently taken care of characters, extremely numerous to go into any kind of profundity here. Of these few posess expertly took care of character bends. Indeed a minor character may be given additional aspects - Heydrich Lang may be contemptible politically, yet he secretly gives to foundations and he's a decent father and spouse. Alternately, to come back to the Terraist religion afresh, we do see a generous old lady undertaking a journey to Earth. \nGenerally speaking \nIn the event that I needed to envision what the perfect anime for me would be, it'd likely be something much the same as this - an epic, abstract space musical drama saturated with ahead of schedule cutting edge European society with an overwhelming reliance on established music. On the off chance that that general concept doesn't make your heart skirt a thumped, vibe allowed to deduct a point or two from the score. In any case I discovered Galactic Heroes a refreshingly wise, captivating arrangement that ought be viewed as a fantastic of anime, as well as of the space musical"},

After watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes, the story-telling and characters in a lot of other anime pale. It was an experience that impacted an anime fan that was growing a little more than jaded. \nOne of the things viewers will notice is, you don't find yourself pulled in right away, but somewhere along the lines you find yourself feeling like you're witnessing a real history and enthralled in the lives of the people in the show. Eventually, you're so enthralled in the happenings of\n          \n        the program, you can hardly pull yourself away. \nAs the name implies, it's the story of \"heroes\". But heroism is a tricky thing. These people are heroes in that they risk and, even at times, sacrifice their lives for their beliefs, and in the service of their respective nations. You'll find few who are wholly good, though, or wholly evil. As the character Yang Wenli notes, \"There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.\"\nMake no mistake, this is a show with wars. The show is about the constant battles between two nations, a crumbling democracy and a top-heavy aristocracy. It doesn't take sides. It doesn't make one group noticably more noble than the other. There's rot on both sides and potential for greatness for either nation. A hundred episodes in, the battle lines have changed shape, but they're there. Battles can be brutal and fates unforgiving. Nobody comes out unscathed in this tale. \nThis show is a grand masterpiece of Japanese animation. It's an impressive blend of politics, philosophy, and tactics examination, set to classical music. The cast is a who's who of voice talent. The space battles can be a bit dull, but any dullness is offset by the charismatic characters that take part in them. Truly an epic space drama.

The anime adaptation of the novels by Artland ran from 1988 to 2000 as well as a manga based on the novels, with art by Katsumi Michihara. There have also been several video game adaptations with the\n          \n        most recent release in 2008 being a real time simulation game.\nThere are also two separate OVA mini-series that focus on the origins of the two main characters made in 1998 & 2000 respectively.\nNeither the novels, anime, nor manga have been released officially in the English language. The series is hardly repeated on Japanese television and therefore is quite hard to get a hold of. As of today fan subbed projects are the main resource for attaining any of these materials.\n\nStoryline\nThe story takes place in the distant future. It shows the continuous struggle between two very different superpowers. On one hand you have the believers in the democratic republic political system of the Free Planets Alliance and on the other those who follow the rule and will of the Galactic Empire’s autocratic government. For hundreds of years, these two states have been battling it out through continuous unending battles that have lasted many generations and with both political factions becoming stagnant over the years corruption has seeped into both sides of the war\nThe story focuses on two up and coming officers each being on the opposite side of the war effort. Reinhard von Musel is an intelligent young admiral of the Galactic Empire who seeks to rid the Empire of its internal corruption and unite the galaxy under his own rule. Then on the other side of the spectrum the also highly intelligent officer Yang Wenli observes the corruption that is strangling his own country but hopes that through the will of the people and through time, the corruption will be rooted out. \nAs the story develops the two officers soon end up as rivals and find themselves constantly pitted against each other in political and strategic warfare. \nWhat makes this story so compelling is the fact that both of these characters have seemingly good intentions. It’s quite obvious both characters are kind hearted and care about their respective homelands. Unfortunately the same can not be said for the many people around them.\nIt’s also worth mentioning there is a big element of cat and mouse in this series as the Galactic Empire is vastly greater in numbers than the free planets alliance, which always keeps tensions at a high. \nWhen you start watching this series you are thrown in the middle of the war which I personally found extremely difficult to digest and get accustomed to. Eventually you will get drops of backstory and exposition but this anime does not hold your hand, you have to watch a good number of episodes before you can really start to care about what’s going on….well that’s how it was for me…however once your invested in this story you are pretty much compelled to see how everything will play out and who will come out on top.\nThis storyline covers so many interesting aspects of life fused with various plot twist and interesting themes. These themes include philosophy, religion, loneliness, death, social engineering, loyalty, wealth / poverty, genocide, the balance of power and ultimately the affect one single person can have on a nation of people.\nA truly gripping tale that covers a lot of ground in its 110 episode run.\nBut as I said before the story can be hard to get into at first.\nAnimation\nWell this is the obvious low point for this series…the animation is very old, outdated and repetitive but I feel I can’t hold that too much against this title since it was made in the 80’s. \nCharacter models look pretty identical, even with female characters. Battle scenes are extremely overused / recycled..however during many hand to hand combat situations, the action gets pretty brutal with quite explicit detail when depicting gore which was surprising and strangely refreshing. \nAs you get further into the show there seems to be a minute sign of improvement with the animation but overall I predict many people will find the animation terrible and possibly unwatchable.\nIt’s actually comparable to the Fist of The North star TV series if you ask me, but it’s a damn shame this title will definitely be overlooked by many just due to it’s poor animation alone….a damn shame.\nSound\nWell the sound is very good but I can’t give credit to the producers for that one because nearly the entire soundtrack is made up from famous well known classical compositions.\nSaying that however….that type of music fits this show quite well..I mean it even feels like opera and classical music was made for space battle after watching this lol\nThis anime has also been noted to have over 100 voice actors in its 10 year run…damn that’s a lot of people\nOpenings and Endings sounded beautiful as well….no real complaints but sadly there is nothing really original in regards to sound production.\nCharacters\nMaann, this show has a lot of characters thrown at you….when I first started watching it I had a hard time understanding who I should be keeping track of since every time a character entered a scene there is usually a giant caption with their full name shown to you, which leads you to think “hey I better remember that guy since they took the time to show me his full name”. This however is not the case and may be yet another negative aspect against the shows storytelling technique.\nThroughout the series I would say there are about 20 characters that will take centre stage that you will eventually be keeping close attention to. Which is certainly a lot more than you may expect from your typical anime series but if you have watched shows like Star Trek and Stargate SG-1 you are probably accustomed to keeping track of a wide range of characters.\nAs this show takes place on various planets you are going to get a good range of diverse and flavoured characters. From peasants to princes, priests to whores, soldiers to scholars and so on and so on.\nThe characters are extremely well written and since this story is heavily dialogue driven, unless you are really into progressive characterization / character development I can guarantee you will most likely find this show boring. (lol oxymoron)\nYang Wenli & Reinhard von Musel are exceptionally well written characters. They are both very reflective and introspective. Conversations with either of these characters always contain depth and are often philosophical. Now I know that may sound boring to some out there but the fact is many of their conversations can easily be related to our lives today (yes us the viewers)….thats right. I constantly felt like I was learning more about how people think and feel based on how REAL and three dimensional these characters were portrayed throughout the series.\nSupporting characters have just as much depth and character development as the main characters …I mean the writing for the characters in this series just feels so damn relatable and realistic its crazy…..and actually quite an accomplishment.\nProbably the single most interesting thing about the characters is there seems to be no definitive bad guy or group. The supporting characters have seemingly logical reasons for what they do…it’s really up to you whether you think particular characters motivations are wrong or right. In most cases I had a lot of food for thought given to me by various characters\nSadly there are way too many characters here for me to go through so i guess I’ll have to gloss over everything and just say that the characters and storyline is what makes this show what it is…Period. \nEnjoyment\nIf I’m being completely honest I found this anime a chore to watch at first and that is because of the way the story is implemented. This in turn made it hard for me to enjoy it initially, but I must admit the unanimous rave reviews and acclaim for this show drove my curiosity over the edge and finally compelled me to find out what the hype with this series was really all about.\nBy the time I got to about the mid 20 episode mark the first major tragedy had occurred and after that I was finally hooked in.\nThis show reminds me of when I first watched robotech way back in the day…I remember wondering if I could truly enjoy something with such an outdated animation style. Then after I finished robotech I soon realised just like with music and movies nowdays external appearance has really become too much of a priority in creating great stories…specifically in recent anime.\nFrom that moment on I stopped putting so much weight on how well something was animated and focused more on the actual storytelling in anime….after watching this show and robotech many people have come to the same way of thinking\nIn a nutshell LOGH surpassed my expectations……I thoroughly enjoyed this series.\nValue / Final Thoughts\nThis series is an investment, when you look at it externally it looks like a bad investment….i mean its old….nobody really talks about it in the general anime community and it has never been considered for US distribution when other similar counterparts have been successfully licensed.\nFirstly I think in many ways this show is an acquired taste but it is just so well written and received by almost everyone I know to have seen it I have to also acknowledge its well deserved ratings.\nIt seems like everyone who gets through this show in its entirety comes up with the same ratings of 9’s and 10’s.\nNot to sound too pompous but I think a certain degree of patience and focus is needed to enjoy this anime. Personally it was worth every moment of my time\nNow that all the praise is outta the way I have a couple of reasons why this show is not in my Hall of Fame. Firstly it’s a bitch to get a hold of…meaning its almost a given you will be downloading the 25GB fansub most of the fans have had to watch, added to that you can’t get an English version to purchase…dub or sub..no pie for you!\n Secondly I feel the implementation of the story could have been streamlined a little better to draw you into the story faster but in saying that I kinda like the fact it’s hard to get into this series now that I have finished it. I feel rewarded for sticking with this series…like I am now a member of “those who have completed the legendary Galactic Heroes series” (yeah I know geeky as hell lol).\n Then thirdly although I understand the animation was done in the 80’s so the style will be outdated compared to today’s anime however I still feel that using carbon copying techniques is pretty lazy and takes away from the uniqueness of certain situations within the storyline which was not a typical trait seen in other 80’s anime.\nAlas there is no way I can echo my love for this show any more than I already have.\nI believe If this was re-animated and slightly re-written it would be hailed as one of Japans greatest animations to date…I also feel this way about rebooting the entire Ruroni Kenshin Story….but that is a review for another day\nPlanet Tyro Rating: First Class\nVisual Version: http://bit.ly/148zK6Y\nPlanettyro.com\n        "},

At first I underestimated it, I thought I would only watch 5 episodes and I already added that one of LotGH's very few flaws is in its uninteresting beginning with precarious animation, but today I really thank for continuing, which seemed\n          \n        to be a simple millions show of exploding space ships has turned into one of the most intelligent plot constructions I've ever seen in anime.\nEasily the image of LotGH today is deduced as the \"Best anime according to the elitists of the community\". And since being in the center of the Elite pack some already idolized without even having watched while others criticize it negatively for banal reasons, I do not think Galactic Heroes should be attended only by the mountain wise masters in anime but really LotGH is not for whole audience, its progression is slow, detailed and full of dialogues, this happens even in the action scenes. It can be dull for those who do not like this vibe but for the connoisseurs of this style are very well rewarded.\nThe main theme of Galactic Heroes is about the systems of government with its pros and cons mainly Autocracy and Democracy where the first is represented by the Monarchic Galactic Empire and the second by the Republican Alliance of Free Planets. It is interesting to note that Galactic Heroes was written in full swing of the Cold War and the contexts of two powers; military, political and technological aspects are reflected here. Among other topics we have religious fanaticism linked to terrorism emphasized by the Earth's cultists, a nobility that abuses its privileges while it leaves its military in ruins and corrupted Politicians that is made self-propagated through wars defeated even in the loss of millions of soldiers. There are other themes but I see no need to go into detail.\nThe narrative is unique and functional. Its history has a rather unusual style where it is told in a theatrical way, each episode one side of the war enters and the other leaves the scene of course due to the \"Legend\" factor in the title that makes the total sense but still with other details like the direct, detailed and even theoretical narration done by the narrator who seems to be reading a book, the narrator which has its identity revealed at the end of the anime. Characters with their own moral dilemmas and high integrity make me resemble medieval knights, these characteristics shows just how classic the series becomes and no matter how it seems to be a dated style, it does not become defective at all.\nThe great and iconic cast of LotGH is fascinating, the series features a high range of well-developed characters, even the most outspoken ones have a significant value in history creating suppressive and interesting twists. The best characters of this anime in my opinion are Oskar Von Reunthal and Julian Minci, where Oskar has a high development in history and stars in the most memorable moments of the series, while Julian who also has great development shines in the aspect of showing us the history of war through documentaries that he chooses to watch, an interesting way that unites the useful and the pleasant\nAlthough Reunthal and Julian are the best, Yang and Reinhard are the most important, it was definitely the two who enriched the plot, where both have high patents and fame in their respective sides, by having ideals in antithesis he becomes enemies of war. The two protagonists of the work are characters who think of a high perspective. Reinhard Von Musel is a military genius who rises in the Empire and sees himself as the one in charge of eliminating the alliance's army to impose the autocratic regime on the universe, he is the typical leader who follows the dilemma \"the ends justifies the means\" where there will be moments that he sacrifices something important to reach his goal. Yang Wen-Li \"the miracle\" is the alliance admiral totally loyal to democracy and ironically pacifist, being a military arts genius especially strategy. Yang shows us that people are more conducive to following the image of a leader than the ideal that he carries something very well addressed during the series, already a thought shared by both is the nickname hero no matter how \"Heroes\" in the title this term is something relative here and both Yang and Reinhard understand that after all they are both the biggest genocides of the universe but that even so they are called heroes by those who support their side.\nThe sensational action of the series is one of my favorite points mainly because of my enthusiasm for militarism, the battles are fantastic but the dated animation does not show all its potential. Although wars between space ships are engulfed in entertainment, none of them are ever so similar to Galactic Heroes. War is sometimes more psychological than physical, where the characters have their philosophies and their way of acting. Great strategies that always leaves everything more unpredictable is well shown here. The high insecurity that death can come to any character is something incredible that the series conveys possessing the most massive number of deaths from a show already shown, the battle of Vermillion that occurs in the middle of the work is one of the best battles I have watch ever I saw it in anime and I think it is the apex of the series.\nAs for the production in the animation part is its defect, the characters have robotic movements and the ships move with little fluidity, there are several gifs in moments of war and even jumps of frames, this is very noticeable in the first season but with the As the animation progresses from something bad to intermediate, something good to emphasize in the animation is the violence being quite explicit with almost no use of censorship, something rare in the animes currently. While the soundtrack is a spectacle is composed of classic songs some of the prolific and reverend master Mozart, the OST works with perfect synchrony in the characters and in the different types of scenes mainly the most epic compositions\nArriving here it is easy to deduce that I am also part of those who say that this is the \"best anime of all time\", LotGH is timeless covers topics that are still much discussed today, it is a show of pleasing Greeks and Trojans, a type a special anime that survives the time even after almost 30 years of its release and that with all its mastery continues to captivate the generations, it is not a deep, complex or perfect work but although it can be openly criticized, it is a work that has achieved the rare status of not needing \"lawyers to defend him\".\nAnimation: 5/10\nStory: 10/10\nSound: 10/10\nCharacter: 10/10\nEnjoyment; 10/10\nOverall; 10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    The description of a work of media as \"epic\" has become overused in recent years.  However, Legend of Galactic Heroes has earned this moniker every bit as much as \"War and Peace\" or \"The Illiad\".  Over the course of 110 episodes, this show follows the rise and fall of nations and the exploits of hundreds of notable characters.  For any fan of hard science-fiction, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, though the show's weaknesses limit its appeal outside of the genre.\nThe strongest aspect of Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the attachment developed with the enormous cast of\n          \n        characters.  The show primarily follows the deeds of Reinhard von Lohengramm of the Galactic Empire and Yang Wenli of the Alliance, but over the course of 110 episodes, the show thoroughly develops dozens of characters serving alongside the main characters.  Although many of these characters fit into archtypes common to the \"epic\" genre, the show nonetheless succeeds in establishing strong connections between the viewers and the characters.  Almost every character in this show is ultimately expendable, but when deaths occur, there is a real sense of loss as the viewers, alongside the cast, bid farewell to a character who has been developed for 30, 50, or even 100 episodes.\nThe main theme of Legend of the Galactic Heroes revolves around the question of whether an enlightened autocracy is superior to a corrupt democracy.  Though the show intentionally gives no answer to this complicated question, the matter is thoroughly explored and the advantages and disadvantages of each system are considered in a way which would make Alexis de Tocqueville proud.  There are numerous secondary themes, but running silently through the whole show is the conceptual tension between the insignifcance of the individual in the vast scope of history agasinst the impact that an exceptional person may make in the present day.  Though all human accomplishments are overturned in time, great men must strive to do their best for the current generation and their posterity.\nThe animation of the show is varied in its quality.  While some of the space combat scenes are particularly well animated, viewers will notice many cost cutting measures used throughout the series.  This is understandable, however, given the length of the series and the time period it was made in, just before the widespread use of digital animation.  Furthermore, even the lower quality scenes do not distract from the enjoyment of the show.\nThe music of the show consists entirely of classical music.  While using music in the public domain was likely also a cost cutting measure, it works well within the show.  The music adds the required pomp and gusto to the show and reinforces it scope and breadth.  The space battle scenes, in particular, are enhanced by the grand scores from composers such as Dvorak and Shostakovich.\nWhile the show is a grand experience befitting an epic, it does suffer from some notable flaws.  The source material for this show is a series of novels, and the writing of the show cannot escape the common fault of this type of source.  More often than not, the show resorts to informing the viewer by telling instead of showing.  The narrator is almost constantly talking, providing information about what is going on in other parts of the galaxy and giving occasional foreshadowing.  While this may acceptable in a book, it grows wearisome in a show, particularly after more than 100 episodes.  The main cause for this fault is that there is simply too much going on and too much information that is necessary for the plot to avoid this method.\nA second fault, is that the show is obsessively detail-oriented.  Entire episodes are devoted purely to administrative manners such as fleet and personnel reorganizations.  Those who desire to wholly invest their attention in the world of this show may find this to be a strength, but for the casual viewer, these portions of the show are intensely tedious and uninteresting.  \nFinally, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is, objectively, a fairly sexist show.  Almost all of the main characters are men, and the significant female characters (except one) only really contribute to the action of the show through advising the men occasionally.  Furthermore, after the women marry, their role is essentially limited to child-bearing and housewifery.  To be fair, this is probably a result of this show being informed by the lack of Japanese gender equality present in the 80's, but it can be distracting even to a modern male viewer, and may present a barrier to enjoyment for female viewers.\nDespite these flaws, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is one of only a handful of truly epic anime. It is a tremendous and fascinating experience for a connoisseur of hard science-fiction.  For casual anime viewers, it is a worthwhile part of anime history, although some fast-forwarding and historical context may be necessary.\n        "},

With a very large cast of characters; in-depth focus on political ideologies and military strategies; an extensive history on the Free Planets Alliance and Galactic Empire; and an epic-sized conflict between both opposing empires and other groups that emerge as the show progresses, the series sticks out as perhaps the best space opera anime I've had a chance of coming across. Being at 110 OAV episodes, LotGH makes for quite the\n          \n        commitment considering its intimidating length as many well-known anime titles are known for running at much shorter lengths. However, the series makes full use of its length in exploring the various situations that take place with both the Planet Alliance and Galactic Empire within its time period of five years, as well as exploring its many elements.\nThe series does enough fleshing out of its various characters that are introduced throughout the series, and the cast of the series is very extensive. It is extensive enough that each episode reintroduces the names of the characters for those who lose track of them. Whether prominent, supporting, minor or not even among the living, LotGH takes enough time at focusing on its characters where we get to know of their motives, personal beliefs, thoughts on a political/ military situation and/or their backgrounds. All these characters do get affected by the outcomes of political decisions and military battles which do effect their characters for either the better or tragically as they come to adapt to them in differing ways depending on how the events influenced their lives.\nThe series also does enough extensive focusing on prominent areas of the empires, factions and their personal ideologies. Like the characters, LotGH will reintroduce the names of prominent locations in the series within each episode to those who are unfamiliar or lose track of them. Prominent areas within the series serve as either historical landmarks, strategic locations for both empires or major facilities for authority figures and the military. There are also a few episodes in the series that devote focus at exploring the extensive history of the founding and organization of both empires and how humanity eventually colonized other planets.\nIt also offers up an unbiased look at the positives and negatives to many political ideologies prominent in both empires that a number of the show's prominent characters come to realize, in particular leading Free Planets Alliance character Yang Wenli whose study of past histories give him a thorough understanding of how the flaws of varying styles of government and ideology led to the downfall of past powerful empires and knowing full well the issues within both the Alliance and Empire. The series features aspects to political systems like democracy, autocracy and dictatorship that some powerful figures exploit for their personal gain at the cost of the human rights and decency of common citizens with oppression, abuse of power and concerns of future rulers having differing beliefs than their forefathers focused on, while also addressing the benefits of such systems when less corrupt figures are placed into power. The only shortcoming on the ideological focus I found was the show's skewed views of religion shown through the Terraism cult when it makes its presence known later in the series showing all the stereotypical negative aspects of religion.\nBattles within LotGH were very engaging as well as many of the leaders representing their differing factions are some of the best strategists I've seen in anime. The series explores different methods of strategies applied in the heat of battle that involve taking advantage of battle terrain, enemy resources, attrition and fleet numbers. The series also isn't afraid at showing the harsh realities war can create such as low morale for soldiers and the citizens, the shocking deaths of prominent characters and the destruction of major landmarks coming from enemy fire or acts of terrorism.\nLotGH is fairly outdated in its animation quality considering the series first started during the late 1980s. Earlier episodes of the series look rough in their details and color shading, though they get better as episodes within the series progress. The show is notable for featuring believable looking character designs as the \"big eyes\" facial design style isn't used and characters are shown to be anatomically correct in their details. Animation shortcuts are quite prominent in the series during battle scenes with still and reused frames, though this is forgivable as LotGH is more notable in its exploration of the strategical element to battles than the action side. The show's soundtrack mostly consists of classic orchestral pieces of music used to great effect in battle scenes while making use of mellow, tense tracks for other dramatic situations seen throughout LotGH.\nIf you have no problem with the show's long length, Legend of the Galactic Heroes offers up the most extensive focus on many of its elements within a series that I've come across with enough focus on its characters, ideologies, history and world. It is the perfect title for any fan of space opera titles to hop onto the bandwagon for. \n        "},

It shows almost all levels of war with very good details ,from Skirmish  to Great War. \nLegend of the Galactic Heroes is an epic tale of two brilliant generals(Reinhard Von Lohengramm and Yang Wenli,) of two different states and political ideologies. (monarchical Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance )\nThe story of LOGH is take place in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, approximately in the 35th century.For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.\nWithin the Galactic\n          \n        Empire, based on 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.\nIn the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because of his demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.\nAs a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: \"There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.\"\nBesides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters, from high nobility, admirals and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers, are interwoven into the story. \nThere is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire called the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) which trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which claims that humans should go back to Earth.\n"},

What a pleasure, what a privilege; what a profound and magnificent anime TV show.  I loved everything about this show, and this is why you may too.\n\nStory -\nEverything is covered.  We have a massive story and plot spanning 110 episodes, not including side stories.  But what makes it such a comprehensive and gargantuan story is the way in which there is so much content jam-packed into each episode.  Each episode is like a treat, like an individual chocolate that you can savour and enjoy.  I always felt satisfied after each\n          \n        individual episode and there was always enough food for thought.\nThe story itself is medium-to-slow paced.  It develops in numerous directions and shows the perspectives of myriad characters.  It's the way in which these intertwine and complete each other that leaves me with such an amazing sense of grandness from the plot.  Everything from the art, to the music, to the depth of the characters all compliment the story and make it the excellent finished product that it is.  \nI harboured no disappointment with regards to anything about the story.  '\n10/10.\n\nArt -\nIf you're bothered about how old it is then just think of old anime artwork as an acquired taste.  If you can learn to appreciate it for what it was at the time I am sure that you'll have no problems with it.  Some of scenes are done beautifully and the music perfectly compliments them.\nIt's still good.  10/10\n\nSound -\nI love the music in Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  The musical score is a beautiful array of classical music, all inserted so as to musically denote the scenes with a sense of art and the respective emotions the creators wanted you to feel at those times.  If you dislike classical music, again, think of it as an acquired taste.  It may just grow on you.  \nI have to give the music a 10/10 for it's beauty, appropriateness and technique.\n\nCharacters -\nThe characters in Legend of the Galactic Heroes are simply the greatest TV characters I have ever seen produced.  I can state that confidently.  Never before have I been so romanticised by a set of characters.  The depth and sheer humanity of them are second to none.  These characters are what I would call masterpieces.  You can sit there all day thinking about these characters and you could yet think more.  They are just so delicately complex and well done.  They acted consistently in accordance with the nature of their characters.  Real is the stand-out word I would use to describe them.  Real yet so profound.\n10/10\n\nEnjoyment -\nNeedless to say I wholeheartedly enjoyed this show.  I have not a single complaint.  \nA perfect 10/10.\n\nConclusion -\nDo yourself a favour and pick up this show.  Maybe it's just not your genre but if it is, and you can look past the things I mentioned, then I guarantee you the anime experience of a lifetime.\n        "},

I didn't have high expectations of this anime, but boy never have I been so wrong in my life. \nPlot: 10/10 \nBrilliantly portrayed. I am aware of many other space operas like Halo, Star Wars etc. but this sci fi series beats them all. The situation is shown from both the sides of the war, and thats the best part of it. There are no righteous ones in this anime nor their counterparts. This is a type of anime that makes you think .\nArt: 6/10 \nThis anime was made in 1988 and so the animation\n          \n        is very plain compared to recent anime. Movements and colors may seem faded but it gets better with every episode. The last two season have proper recent level type animation.\nCharacter Development: 10/10\nBrilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is after all a story about legends. These legends will surely leave a positive impact in your own character. \nSoundtrack: 10/10\nMelodious songs and sweet music are just the things you need for a space opera.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nFrom the start of Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu , you will wish it never ends.\n\nVerdict:\nWar, tragedy,romance,philosophy,principles,comedy you name it, This anime has it all. Watch this anime with an open mind. The principles of autocracy and democracy have both merits and demerits.

LOGH is slow paced no question about it but the attention to detail and the building of the characters creates a well built world with a very seldom seen use of politics and war. The enormous amount of plotting and politics that goes on in the story can be boring.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes is not an anime that attempts to grasp its audience's attention through flashy graphics, fancy editing or directing, clever dialogue, plot twists, or ridiculous plot premises. I'd argue that it doesn't really try to grab its audience attention at all. The sole purpose of the anime is to tell its compelling story and develop its characters. I will be discussing its two distinct appeals: its realism, and its diverse heavy themes. \nLotGH is huge in scale. It's the biggest fiction I've ever consumed. There's not really anything I know of that could be a comparison. LotGH dwarves even the likes\n          \n        of Game of Thrones when it comes to character roster. It spans an entire populated galaxy and two huge opposing governments. Can't talk a lot about the plot or characters due to heavy plot twists. If I say anything past what the synopsis says, I'll be spoiling it. \nWhat I can discuss about LotGH, is the impact that it had to my personal view on storytelling. It enlightened me on what realistic yet extraordinary stories consist of. I always thought that a realistic plot could have no coincidences, nothing extraordinary, nothing that depended on luck. If you think back on other shows that have interesting stories, you never really see events like that. For popular references, think about what makes Game of Thrones or Death Note good. The plot is solely driven by the characters and everything that happens in the show is the consequence of the actions of said characters. Nothing is left to chance, nothing is left unexplained. When the plot kills somebody, you know exactly why, how, and who killed them. No major character ever dies from an accident. When I put it like that, does it sound weird? How come no one that is important can die from an accident? Why can't Light just die in a car accident? In real life, people die in accidents all the time. People die from extremely unlucky circumstances all the time. Really important people. So how come it never happens in fiction? And I'm not just talking plot armor here like in DBZ where they literally bring people back to life because there's no show without the main characters, but it happens everywhere. LotGH turns that on its head. Extraordinary events occur. \nIn LotGH, you can expect freak assassinations, extremely unlikely encounters, diseases, coincidences, and other such things affect the plot in massive ways. You know how Hitler lost a World War because he attacked  Russia in the winter? Something similar happens in LotGH. You know how princess Diana died in a car accident? Something similar happens in LotGH. You know how Napoleon Bonaparte was able to successfully arrange a coup of the French government? You know how Abraham Lincoln was assassinated because his bodyguard was to incompetent to guard his door? Do you know how many kings, presidents, prime ministers, ect. have died to disease? All of these extraordinary things that happen to extraordinary people happen in LotGH. There's even a quote said by a character, \"Neither terrorism nor occultism have ever impacted history in any constructive way.\" Quick spoiler alert: he dies to terrorism. It's okay, you won't see it coming. \nThe other thing that really makes LotGH stand above everything else, is the realism and conviction of its themes. If you're familiar with my reviews, you'll note that it's probably the biggest thing I look for in an anime, or a work of fiction in general. I can bring this point together simply with quotes. Stand fast.\n\"What is the most cowardly and shameful thing in human conduct? It’s when people with power, and people who flatter them, hide in safe places and extol war, force patriotism and self-sacrifice upon others, and then send them to the battlefield to die.\"\n\"Even if you look at a mountain, if you only look at it from one direction, you can’t grasp the whole…Embodiments of evil don’t exist other than in television dramas…Maybe history will classify us not as good but as the evil camp…people aren’t strong enough to endure the recognition that they’re evil. Therefore, believing in their own righteousness, they fight to force their views on other people. \"\n\"Reinhard: Is democracy such a great thing? Didn’t the Galactic Republic give birth to Rudolf and his Galactic Empire? Wasn’t the one who delivered your beloved nation into my hands your own ruler, chosen by the free will of the people of the Alliance? Democratic rule is a body chosen by its citizens in free will which subsumes the power and spirit of self.\nYang: if you could pardon my rudeness, your excellency, your words are as if the value of fire should be denied, simply because arson exists.\nReinhard: Hmm, that may be true, but wouldn’t you say the same applies to dictatorship? You cannot deny the efficiency of government by a strong leadership simply because tyrants do exist.\"\nThat's probably enough quotes to get my point across. Not lacking in the themes department. \nConclusion: LotGH is a masterpiece with ambition above all others. It discusses politics and philosophy nonstop, always making you question your own ideas. And it won't ever give you answers, just more questions. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    I finally finished watching it.\nTo summarize it, it is an exceptional anime which has a huge overarching story that spans years, has large number of characters and excels at \"bigger picture\" episodes that outline fate of humanity, individual planets, nations, or large number of humans. It is definitely what I would call a \"classic\", but unfortunately it suffers from certain issues - mostly tropes utilized in its story. I think I would actually recommend watching it, if you have this amount of free time, but this recommendation is not a strong one. It is a classic, that is certain.\nStory: 7/10\nThis anime excels at depiction of\n          \n        large scale events. Meaning riots somewhere, consequences of some sort of conflict, or something happening when narrator starts talking and calmly says that huge number of people died (the anime has the largest bodycount, although large number of deaths happen off-screen). It also doesn't shy away from brutality and even displays gore on rare occasions - in the same indifferent manner. \nHowever... on a smaller scale and on personal character level, it suffers from certain issues. For example, technology level is very inconsistent. Few episodes in the beginning casually mentioned incredibly advanced technical devices, but they are almost never mentioned or utilized again. The technology level is a weird mix of early 20 century, faux-late 19th century, middle 20th century and spaceships thrown in for a good measure. With tech level and medical advances in mind... there are situations where people die, even though medical technologies available should be able to deal with their wound. It is even more annoying when everybody present just kinda silently agrees that the wounded person should die in this episode, so instead of rushing for a doctor, they stand nearby and listen for the wounding person talk while they're bleeding out.\nOn a personal level, the anime loves utilizing \"incompetent supervisor, competent but underappreciated subordinate\" a LOT. There are many situations where some sort of high-ranking officer does something stupid, his subordinate points out (the obvious) error, and rather than listening to it, the officer rages, and dismisses the subordinate, and something horrible happens afterwards.\nCharacters are also really prone to heroic suicides in the name of honor, to the point where it gets actually annoying. Then on occasion some things start happening in a VERY convenient way, meaning someone arrives just at the right moment, or someone dies due to an extremely convenient reason, etc. This happens more in last 80..110th episodes, and sorta breaks suspension of disbelief.\nBasically... I would say this anime has a LOT of ... melodramatic events. This is not the overdramatization you'd see in a shounen anime (where somebody freaks out over something concerning black and white morality), but rather it uses approaches similar to ... I don't know... light entertaining literature. Light trillers, romance novels... except that there's a lot of dead people here. \nSo, in the nicest way possible, I woudl say that this anime can be best described as a space soap opera... although, no this sounds too negative. Perhaps a more appropriate way would be to say it is very theatrical. In the 19th century and in times before that, before there were TVs and computers, actual operas served as some sort of entertainment source for the populace, and this anime reminds actual operas (rigoletto or karman, anyone?) and theatrical works in its structure. Basically, it does a good job producing an illusion of something huge, but if you dig a bit deeper, you might notice theater decorations.. \nHopefully, it makes sense....\nArt: 7/10: I like the art style, however  overall the anime looks like it could use a bigger budget. It uses many frames where someone sits and talks, or when several fleets are panning across the string, animated in 3 or 4 frames. It is not done to such obnoxious degree as it was done in, say, Claymore, but after 80 episodes you start to suspect that battle explosions and fleet footage is being heavily reused. Also at some point they start inserting flashbacks. Again, it is not done in an obnoxious manner. Long story short there are a lot of places where they tried to cut animation costs, but it was done so cleverly that it is hard to notice those places.\nFor 1980..1990 movie the visuals are solid, but there were works that had higher visual quality and more fluid animation. For example, I think that Magic M-66 was animated better than this title and was more detailed. But then again Magic M-66 was just one small ova.\nSound: 6/10:\nThe sound is good, however the anime utilizes a LOT of classic musical pieces (I believe I even heard pieces of works by Musorgsky there), and number of its own soundtracks is small. Several characters have a bit of a wooden voice acting, for example, certain \"Fraulein\" speaks in manner that almost always makes her sound a bit insincere. At least that's how it sounds to me. I think that few other characters had a similar issue. \nCharacters: 8/10:\nDespite slightly theatrical nature of the anime and frequent overdramatization events,on occasion there are moments where characters truly shine. Such moments are often counterbalanced by another over use of \"incompetent general\" trope, but there are plenty of those. Two of the main protagonists are incredibly believable on occasions, and were created with incredible attention to detail, so you might even feel awe on occasion. Of course, there are plenty of lesser characters that are not portrayed as well, and do not have a chance to display much of personality... but overall I would say that character portrayal mostly felt very real, and watching people acting (mostly) mature was a welcome change compared to modern anime that often focuses on teenagers.\nEnjoyment: 6/10:\nThe first half was amazing, and seeing \"One more page in galactic history\" sparked sense of excited anticipation after every episode... in the beginning of the show. However after episode 60 or 80, anime starts losing momentum, starts inserting more flashbacks, and quality appears to drop a bit. Those moments were incredibly dull. I would say that I found later episodes (90+) much less interesting than the beginning, and on some occasions I even felt full disconnect with the events in the anime - like \"what is the point of this conflict again?\". \nOverall: 7/10:\nWell, it is a classic. Some people will definitely see it as the best anime of all time, and this monumental work (it has been airing for 9 years, I believe?) deserves recognition and admiration. However, due to multiple issues in story telling, due to overuse of certain tropes and due to somewhat \"theatrical\" nature of it... I'm not sure if I'd say this is a must watch anime. I'd recommend to check out first few episodes and see if this is your thing or not."},

I watched it slowly and I think that helped me digest it a lot better than the shows that I've binge watched in the past. With this show being 110 episodes long, I didn't even want to contemplate binge watching it.\nI won't discuss the plot or really much else here, as other reviews have already done that. Instead, I'll leave you with my impressions now that I've finished it.\nWith the last episode done, I feel bittersweet; like I've had to say goodbye to real people. It is a fantastic\n          \n        show, but I wouldn't call it a feel-good experience. It leaves you contemplating about the competence of civilization, the effectiveness of our political systems, and the tragedy of war. It does leave you with a quiet optimism though, that mankind can go in the right direction, with effort and with sacrifice, but that sacrifice might mean a lot of loss and pain on the way there, some of it needless and some of justified.\nIts a mature and sobering show, and it deserves the praise I frequently see it given, which it what led me to watch it all to begin with.\nI don't think I'll ever forget this show. Its characters were so well written that I believe they've had a permanent effect on me.\nIf you're looking for a show that comments on the nature of humanity and society on a grand scale, then this is it. Don't be intimidated by its length; it's worth it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It's really sad knowing that with the anime industry in its current state we will never have a story as grand or fulfilling as the one presented in LOTGH for a long long time. LOTGH is something that most anime strive to be, but never can due to episode limits and simple lack of personnel working on them. \nThis show had an incredibly diverse cast of characters which it fleshed out beautifully. Honestly if I could give this show a 12 for character i would because 11 wouldn't even do it justice. When watching shows with similar amounts of characters like Game of Thrones it's\n          \n        easy to forget semi important characters simply because they weren't fleshed out enough. Often you enter episodes wondering \"who was this guy again?: One of the most incredible parts of this show is that it avoids that pitfall for the most part, completely exploring several side characters so that you're never wondering what happened to them or what kinds of people they were. Every loose end is tied up other than the ones that are better left untied.\nTo quote the show \"In every time, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same\". In the end it is a story of people and history. What people want, what drives them, why good people can do terrible things, how bad people can come to rule over perfectly intelligent good ones, and why sometimes lives have to be sacrificed for something greater despite acknowledging how fucked up it is. It's a very rare thing to feel true blue respect for a fictional character but this show managed to get me to feel it for several of them. \nIf you are willing to make the time investment I guarantee you will get more out of it for this show than any other I have ever seen."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I've seen plenty of anime in my time, action, romance, arthouse, psychological, sci-fi and many other genres. However, I have rarely had an anime reconfigure my barometer for the definition of a \"good\" show. You don't need to like anime to know what I mean either because everyone has a film or book that formed the basis they judge other media by and LoGH seems to be the final barometer for anime and how I rate/judge it. I better review it so you can see why.\n     Plot: This is a spoiler-free review for the sake of more people reading it and\n          \n        seeing the show. Three factions in a distant century are aiming for control in the Milky Way galaxy. The Free Planets Alliance (FPA), an independent set of planets based around one named Heinessen who strive for Democracy while rarely achieving it. Phezzan, a trader and merchant planet with a vested interest in profiting however they can. Finally, the Galactic Empire, an autocratic dictatorship ruled by a noble class and at war with the FPA. In the Galactic Empire a youth named Reinhard von Musel and Siegfried Kircheis have decided to get back Reinhard's sister and rule the planet in order to conquer the galaxy and bring ultimate peace. In the FPA another youth named Yang Wen-li and his ward Julian Minci are living together and Yang, despite aspiring to major in history, is now being used in the military due to his strategy and expertise in spite of the fact that senior officers despise him. A fourth faction exists and works with Phezzan for nefarious reasons I will not reveal. If it sounds like Game of Thrones in space you aren't too far off. For its complexity and twists alone it scores a 5/5 here and it manages to keep you guessing who to root for since the morality is ambiguous throughout.\n     Character Development: Every main and secondary character experiences genuine growth and is not the same person when the show began. Notice I say \"person\" and not character, this is because the characters are truly three dimensional when the series is over and could be considered people in their complexities. Saying much more would give away spoilers but I will say that romance and death are handled carefully throughout and neither feels forced or cliched. Naturally a 5/5.\n     Art: Starting in 1988 and at 110 eps+3 films and 52 eps of optional prequel side stories LoGH maintains a varying level of quality on its artwork. Season 1 has many issues but those are fixed as the series progresses. Anyone turned off by the hand-drawn cel work needs to give it a chance because it just gets better as it goes on. Keep in mind this show was released directly to home video over a nine year period and it improves drastically. I love hand-drawn animation and when shows improve it thats even better. Hours of hard work clearly went into it and so a 5/5 is what it deserves.\n     Sound/OST: King Records was a company producing this show and gave them full access to their licenses of classical music symphonies in Germany and England resulting in a breathtaking array of classical from every artist you can imagine. Mozart to Bach and the powerful Dvorak make the battle scenes and death scenes a moving experience. I know some people will knock it for not making its own music but then again, who still is upset at Kubrick for his brilliant decision to keep the classical tracks in 2001? I'm not and I think it was the right choice for LoGH and you guessed it a 5/5 here too. Worth mentioning a main theme for the two main sides was made for the show and sounds great too, also the OP and ED work fine.\n     Overall, The Legend of the Galactic Heroes has been many fans' number one anime for a myriad of reasons but mine consolidates to timelessness. I feel like it doesn't matter when I watch it again I'll love it all the same. I've shown parts of it to many others and the patient ones have been rewarded with a similar feeling of gratitude. The greatest crime in anime history is that it still lacks a US licensor for anything related to it, not even the novels its based on are translated into English. For fear of overstaying an already long welcome I'll wrap this up and say a final piece: Many will pass it by, but the few who watch it will be rewarded with an enriching experience that they can cherish for a lifetime. Oh, and of course its final score is a 10/10. Thank you for reading!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This critically acclaimed anime has stood the test of time well, ranking favourably against more popular, modern classics of the anime medium. It achieves this through its sheer sense of scope and the way it dismisses typical anime tropes in favour of a more intellectual and realistic presentation and tone to the show. However, nothing is for everyone as the brilliant execution of this anime is also the reason why a minority of the people who have watched this show find it utterly boring.\nStory: Two great galactic powers (and a few shady third parties) of vastly contrasting ideologies, governments, culture, technology and even demographic makeup\n          \n        occupy two sides of the galaxy. One is the corrupt democratic Free Planets Alliance and the other is the initially also corrupt but later, brilliantly efficient autocracy, the Galactic Empire. Both sides have tens of billions of people and are locked in a bitter, centuries long state of total war. Typical rebel alliance vs the big evil empire right? Not quite so. Both sides are explored in so much depth and in all aspects. Everything from internal coups, the motivations of the most important, history changing characters to the lowliest peasants, to each sides very own history, to the tinest of details such as starships needing tethers when landing atmospherically is covered. The world presented here; despite featuring gigantic fleets that would put many other sci fi series to shame is wholly believable; a must for any work of sci fi that wants to be taken seriously! Both sides have their flaws and virtues and from this arises ample opportunity for philosophical analysis of warfare, politics and humanity! Why do humans have to shed so much blood to attain peace? An fair autocracy may be better than a corrupt democracy; but which system is better in the long run?  It may all sound pretentious but this anime avoids those pitfalls time and time again due to its face value, semi documentary presentation, complete with narrator and subtitles! This could sound boring but just because this anime is dedicated to realism, doesn't mean that the anime itself is always serious. The very human characters are key to the more lighthearted, heartwarming or absolutely tragic moments within the show. Never does this anime sacrifice realism for hyperbole and there lies its great strength; an anime that is truer a statement of humanity than any other. An epic history; of the future! 11/10!\nArt: This anime uses a realistic artstyle; with a dash of grandeur applied. As an older anime, the art doesn't ever get too beautiful but some more epic events in the anime will still turn heads (liquid metal death star anyone?); often, the anime can be spectacular in its more subdued approach to battle scenes. Animation also cannot compare to newer titles but for such a long running older title, it is amazingly consistent; even improving over time. Unlike a lot of other old animes; action scenes are never skimped on; the best animation goes into these scenes (which consist of 100000 ships in each fleet firing off with blue lasers and salvos of nuclear missiles, APCs levelling the hideouts of religious terrorists or duels between heavily armoured soldiers with battleaxes; a cool shout out to Dune!) so there is a remarkably fewer amount of jump cuts, repeated animations or still frames. 10/10 I really enjoyed the realism; especially the cool AND practical starship and automobile designs! (and their immersive consistency no less)\nSound: This anime uses an all classical soundtrack with only a handful of ballads used rarely. It is easy to misuse classical music but LOGH does it perfectly, picking the most suitable and appropriate extracts to compliment all its scenes. 10/10\nCharacter: Character designs are very attractive in their realism (this is still the only anime where I explicitly find the men attractive!) and they are done in a way so that it is much easier to tell characters apart compared to many other animes. However, the sheer amount of characters mean that an average person would not remember more than 20% of them all. Despite the fact that the most minor characters only serve to advance the plot with minimal character development; their existence only cements the power of LOGH's inclusive scope. Even a supply ship officer who appears in just one episode will have his role in drastically changing the in universe history! The main characters (such as Yang Wenli; perhaps the greatest Chinese ancestry character in anime ever, Reinhard von Lohengramm; an archetype of a great conqueror etc)  themselves are developed very well and the viewer truly feels delight in accompanying them as they stick to their ambitions or convictions and change history or die trying! 11/10 You will shed a tear, no matter how apathetic you may be!\nEnjoyment: This anime isn't just one of the greatest animes of all time but also one of the greatest long running tv shows ever made. Its overwhelming strengths are the in depth nature of the universe that covers every detail, an epic story that is real as history itself, perfect pacing and progression of the plot through key events rife with political intrigue and battles costing millions of men and its strikingly accurate analysis of the human race. This show barely even has minor flaws! (the ratio of males to females is overwhelming; but the female characters are all strong, intelligent and independent!). However, something that I find an advantage in this anime: no slutty girls, no fanservice, no huge implausible mechas firing planet killing weapons at each other and no ridiculously drawn out power based fight scenes may be a flaw to other people!\nThis anime does feature nudity and gore but it is used in appropriate fashion (to show humanity's depravity and the futility of war). 17 year olds and up! But the themes in this anime wouldn't interest under 15s anyways.\nThis anime's length is fully justified and this humble review cannot do this anime's greatness justice. This anime is a must watch for fans of sci fi, history lovers, war epics and/or retro anime!\n"},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Another series pretty much overhyped by this site and everyone.\nLike 12 kingdoms it spends a bit too much time on politics at points. It cant decide whether it wants to be a strategy, tactics, military, political or character driven show. Pretty much the entire episodes up until a certain point are filler and are replaced by the movie. The rest seems to be a slow built up until the two sides coincide. And while this does occur, it seems to be less tactical and more \"who shoots first wins\".\nAll in all it was good but not great enough. I was expecting something about code geass/death\n          \n        note on the \"one upping\" scale and did not get much in that regard. I did enjoy the small sections of the spacemen using axes against soldiers which I found humorous. \nToo many star wars references. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n       Let us be honest here, Legend of Galactic Heroes is that mythical anime that you have seen get almost nothing but perfect scores, but you were always afraid to try.\n I grew up on shows that got your blood pumping and emotions rolling like Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Outlaw Star. This particular anime seemed to be the exact opposite of what I usually enjoy . I had heard that this \"Legend of Galactic Heroes\" had entirely too many episodes, that all of its characters were  pretentious windbags, it had a dearth of real action scenes, and\n          \n        all of its fans were elitist scumbags who would tell ridicule you from their ivory towers and tell you , you had no true taste for quality anime if you never tried or didn't enjoy their precious \"LoGH.\" Hell, in the first episode there is a wave of unfamiliar characters all with  hard to pronounce names scrolling across you screen serves to simply disorient and turn off many an anime fan before they could give the anime an earnest shot.  Well against all odds in the Fall of 2015 I undertook the task of watching this show, and I was honestly surprised to find an incredible story that was well worth the journey.\n  Legend of Galactic Heroes is essentially a Space Opera , a tale that primarily follows two young men from two opposing sides in a galactic war, the intelligent and brash young Reinhard von Lohengramm of the Galactic Empire and the more laid back, older philosophical genius Yang Wenli of the Free Planet Alliance . The Galactic Empire is rooted in tradition and is ruled by noble families , and the FPA is an open democracy that elects its officials.  The story of the anime spans some years of time in their universe, as these two individuals rise in the ranks of the military and political regimes of their respective societies. Although the story revolves around the war between the two states, the show is more about the various characters on both sides. Outside of a few climatic battles, the focus is not the action between sides , but primarily on how Yang and Reinhardt use their ideologies to try to change and better their respective societies, and showing the various events that occur on their journey to attain power and influence. However its by no means some cakewalk for Yang and Reinhard, as both characters lose things and people dear to them in the chaos of war. The first act of the series is incredibly riveting and mostly about familiarizing you with both sides and building up to the the main conflict, as you see both characters deal with the horrible corruption of their societies and slowly break away from their old lives and relationships.  The middle act is more about resolving the main war conflict and the final act is more about the what happens in the aftermath of the main conflict. I am overjoyed to say that the cliche anime trope of \"plot armor\" doesn't exist in this series, this is mainly about a war so naturally a good number of characters from both sides die, even some of the most prominent and well developed characters aren't safe just because they are important to the story. \n Despite them being the most important characters, this is not a show that is just about Yang, Reinhardt , and friends. There are a lot of episodes that go into fleshing out other characters, showing the lives of the general populace and how they are affected by war, and also giving backstory/history lessons to let you be more informed about the universe and setting of the anime. \n  This story is far from the morally simple heroes tales that you may have encountered before. Sure both Yang and Reinhard have the best of intentions, but they are far from perfect or flawless. Both have to make huge choices and both make some horrible mistakes that they have to deal with. Reinhard may be righteous and kind , but he's also prone to fits of irrational anger and tends to ruminate about endlessly about the past. Yang might always want to do the best for his fellow man but his incisiveness and unwillingness to be a leader undermine the best of his intentions. Similarly, neither the FPA nor the Empire are inherently good or evil. There are conniving politicians and power hungry noble families , but there are well intentioned people on both sides, and people caught between . In fact, the anime constantly tries to entice you to always think did Yang or Reinhard really make the right choice, is their philosophy truly right? Sometimes an ideal may seem great but is it really worth it to follow your beliefs so far that so many millions of people have to die as a result of you achieving them? Are you really willing to become a villain or a tyrant in the eyes of the people in order to achieve the ideal world? Do you have to sacrifice everything you love to achieve peace? Lots of these questions come up and are even debated among characters.\n      I believe Legend of Galactic Heroes' greatest strength is the fact that it has such a huge roster of characters, but a number of them get fleshed out very well and the show really makes you care about them and root for them. Many of Reinhard's generals and advisors are very interesting, all of them have their own very unique personalities and reasons for following Reinhard, with Mittenmeyer and Reunthal being two of the most interesting characters in the entire anime. So too are Yang's friends in the FPA, having more of a close knit family type of relationship . Whether they are just having a good time together or debating philosophical issues or matters of state, almost every conversation in Legend of Galactic Heroes is very interesting . In addition to the characters that are close to the main heroes, I also loved the the conniving villains, scheming politicians, opportunist businessmen, fanatic cultists, and other interesting characters that pop up in the anime all have their own stories and mini arcs. \n   There aren't any amazing love stories that particularly involve either Yang or Reinhard, but I found that there were some really great episodes that focused on various other characters that really tugged at the heart strings. But on the whole I think Legend of Galactic Heroes was more about showing the us the bonds and friendships of people from both sides. \n   I mentioned this is not a series that is focused on action, but there are a few very grand scale ship battles and even a number of hand to hand combat scenes. As silly as it may sound, there are also knife fights and sword/axe fights between men in space suits , even if the explanation for them isn't so strange. I personally really enjoyed these scenes, although the ship battles are much less about the lasers and explosions like a Star Wars, but its more about the chess game between enemy commanders of positioning ships and resources properly in order to win the battles. \n  The music of the series is mostly good, you won't get any hard rock or crazy stuff here, its mostly classical inspired themes like you would expect for an anime like \"Legend of Galactic Heroes.\" The openings and endings were all great emotional themes , with my favorite being the 2nd opening \"I am Waiting for You\" which is incredible in my opinion and almost perfectly captures the spirit of the anime. The faster paced openings usually show scenes involving the Galactic Empire and the Endings are usually more relaxing or slower songs that focus on the Free Planet Alliance. The animation is a little harder to evaluate, being that this anime was produced in the 80s and 90s and was made over such a huge swath of time. I personally didn't have any problems with it , but there really wasn't much the visually stood out to me either. \n    LoGH for all of its greatness, is not a perfect anime as some might claim. Probably its greatest weakness is how long winded and verbose it can be at some times, with characters debating amognst themselves for minutes or even an episode at a time can get pretty damn dry. And sometimes the plot could feel like it was moving at a snails pace, especially in the final act of the story where the main conflict turned out to be pretty underwhelming compared to the previous two acts. I will also say that there is a marked lack of important female characters in the show, the jokes of LoGH being a \"sausage fest\"  have some factual basis , especially on the Empire side it could get tiring with the constant testosterone filled board rooms and war consuls . \n  All in all, a great anime. One that admittedly requires a lot of patience and personally I found that it can not be marathoned as you are sometimes inundated with so much information you really have to wait a while for it to sink in before you move on with the story. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Disclaimer: I have not watched all of the episodes of Logh, however, I am well aware of anything that happens in these episodes and my limited understanding shows that none of those things significantly impact the quality of the story.\n      The Legend is a cult classic in the anime community and is held up by elitists and plebs alike to be one of the best anime series to have ever been released. Personally, I find it to be the best anime that I have currently watched, although, as is all else, that is up to debate. What I will say\n          \n        is that the Legend boasts a finely crafted, if not a bit unreasonable at times, narrative with a cast well beyond the size of any normal anime that does a surprisingly good job at making sure that all characters have some sort of characterization and are in some way useful to the plot.\nCharacters:\n    In terms of the main characters, the show boasts both Yang Wen-li and Reinhard von Lohengramm. Yang Wen-li is a simple man who doesn’t enjoy the thought of his actions and is only loyal to his paycheck and to the basic ideals of democracy. Wen-li received a decent amount of character development as he grew more accustomed to being the spotlight of the galaxy, and to truly fighting for the ideals that people like Heinessen preached and creating his own Democratic system in the form of the Iserlohn Republic. He is often defined as a little preachy on his monologues about the ideals of government, however, he is often described as a mentor figure to Julian who he spouts most of this too, and, when he is not trying to teach what he believes is correct to Julian, he is usually arguing against authoritarians such as the National Salvation Military Council and Reinhard, or to question his own actions as to if he should believe in a system that led to people like Job Trunighct to being in power. In that way, he is excused. Julian acts like an extension of Yang and genuinely feels as though he grows as a person into Yang’s successor.\n    Next on the chopping block is Reinhard and Kircheis. Reinhard is a man of lofty ambitions, and believes, occasionally wrongly, that he can achieve the same of that of Rudolf von Goldenbaum, the man who founded the Galactic Empire. Reinhard, however, is a bit emotionally unstable and acts out of bounds on multiple occasions, such as challenging his subordinates to rebel against him and allowing 2 million citizens of Westerland to be killed by Prince Braunschweig in order to accomplish his goals. This makes him feel more realistic than many other characters in anime that try to accomplish the same purpose as him. However, he always (yeah, certainly always) has his friend, Siegfried Kircheis, to consult on matters he really shouldn’t do. He is portrayed a little bit too much as a white knight, knowing what is right in every situation, however, his goodness is what eventually killed him at the hands of someone he really shouldn’t have died against. He felt compelled to help Reinhard as they both have a motivation against the nobles in the form of Countess Grunewald, and he really needed to be that way in order to provide for Reinhard, so, in that sense, there is a reason as to why he acts the way he does, even if it feels somewhat jarring while you are watching the show.\n    As previously mentioned, there is an extremely large cast of characters, so I must shorten this character section for the purposes of keeping this review from being one of the longest on this website. In that sense, I will only mention a few more characters, as well as putting general cast problems at the very end. There are also other good characters in this series. Some of my personal favorites being Oscar von Reuenthal, for his arc that inevitably ended in his betrayal and his personal friendship with Wolfgang Mittermeyer; Paul von Oberstein, for his scheming and albeit a little jarring attitude of agreeing to do acts that seem unjust for the purpose of completing his goals; and Admiral Bucock, for his steadfast belief in Democracy, even in the face of the Galactic Kaiser himself. There are other good examples that need mentioning, but, for the sake of brevity, I will try to leave them out for now. They do have some individual problems between them, but nothing that would hurt the overall quality of the shows.\n    Things that do hurt the overall quality, however, are those one-dimensional characters that creep up every once and again. The terraists are clearly the worst example of this, for being simply one-dimensional maniacs bent on destroying all those who believe that the Earth shouldn’t be the main focal point of the galaxy. There is an explanation for their fanatic behaviors, in that they are poisoned into becoming fanatics, however, it should not totally excuse that they are lazy villains in an otherwise fairly brilliantly crafter narrative. The others are the one-dimensional politicians, such as the councilors that suggested the invasion of the imperial territories simply for getting another term in power. This did have a purpose in the criticism of democracy, and is exaggerated for the purpose of getting off that theme of the show, but is jarring to the point of ridiculousness at points. The Imperial Nobles are not much better, as they believe they are allowed to do things to their subjects simply because they are their lords. Of course, one could argue that it was the centuries of pandering to the nobility that allowed them to be this way, however, this flaw is still worth mentioning regardless.\n    Overall, the characters are portrayed in a way that allows them to feel as though they are actual people. The plot allows you to care for these people after seeing their motivation and struggles over a decent amount of screentime. I have noticed some complaints that the show is too pro-empire in terms of character focus, but, considering that the empire only has a few more episodes dedicated to them than to the alliance, it really is not as big of a gap as some critics make it out to be.\nThe Story:\n    The Legend is a show that manages to be extremely in depth to the point where it actually feels as though there is a world beyond the events that we are shown on screen. There are several episodes that are focusing on smaller scale issues of nobles within the empire and of citizens of all sorts of worlds which give the impression of cultures that exist outside of the main cast, something most anime of large-scale struggle with. The Legend, however, is on a much larger scale than most of anime that would fall under that category. With hundreds of named characters spanning a series that contains 110 episodes, around 60 side stories episodes, and 3 movies, you can tell that the Legend fits into that long-running series category. However, unlike many other long-running series, the Legend does not degrade in quality significantly over its run. It keeps consistency in the quality of its characters and of its battle and storylines.\n    The first main point of the plot is the themes. LOGH has two major themes, War is hell and Democracy vs Autocracy. The first main theme is War is Hell. This is mainly shown not only through the battles, where tens of thousands to sometimes even millions die and where portrayals of the ‘true brutality of combat’ are shown, but also through the dialogue of people like Yang Wen-li and João Rebelo, who show the true horrors of war from not only a physical perspective, but also a political and societal perspective. The next major theme is the benefits and detractions of Autocracy and Democracy. For the most part, I would say they are portrayed fairly evenly. Some may argue that the empire was favored more than the alliance, but I would argue that the only reason that is, is because the majority of the time, the empire was either under the direct control or under the influence of Reinhard von Lohengramm, something Yang acknowledges during his personal conversation with Reinhard. However, that does not belittle Yang’s point of view, with him constantly bringing the argument of how a person such as Rudolf the Great can always rise to power with very little protection against him. Even though the author is somewhat using the characters as mouthpieces for philosophy, it is never as bad as a series such as Fate/Zero and is believable due to the character’s personalities and actions before said dialogues. Overall, the themes are portrayed extremely well.\n    For a small paragraph, I wish to bring up the point of the space battle in LOGH. Some criticize them for not fully utilizing the three dimensions of space. Firstly, there are a couple of scenes where they do use three dimensions. Secondly, there isn’t really any sci-fi that accomplishes this well, that doesn’t involve some kind of giant humanoid robot. Thirdly, the strategy and use of natural components in these battles at least makes up for this lack of use.\n    The Legend utilizes some of the most interesting and captivating storylines in anime. The Legend gives much time on its character, however, the story is not left entirely alone. The Legend portrays the events unfolding in the series as parts of history, with a narrator involved. Many people dislike the narrator because he “spoils” many of the major events in the series. The narrator allows the series to be portrayed as the title suggests, a ‘Legend’. He also gives us some insight of how future historians and people viewed the men and the events that occurred during the events of the story. He is also good for foreshadowing, as he always gives hints on to what occurs in the future without explicitly telling the audience. The audience is not completely devoid of knowledge of the past either, as it is portrayed to the audience in two episodes (cleverly as well, deciding against direct exposition and instead vouching for the characters themselves to learn of these events along with the audience).\n    Another bonus point to the Legend is its portrayal of events in the storyline. The Legend, especially in the first season, enjoys portraying both small incidents that do not affect the plot all that much and massive events that will change the events of the character forever. There are episodes that show how the politicians of the Free Planets Alliance come to their decisions, how the people who live in imperial territory reacted to the Free Planets Alliance invasion into imperial territory, how the nobles of the empire attempted to carry out plots against the Kaiser and other nobles (never truly losing the audience’s interest as they always involve the main characters in some capacity), as well as many other events that I will not name here. All of these happenings give rise in the audience to the idea that the Legend has a world that extends far beyond what the main characters are experiencing. This helps to upkeep the abnormally large scale that the Legend tries to have, and gives the audience more investment into the world and the story than what can be accomplished by much other anime series. \n\nArt/Animation:\n    The art style of the Legend is certainly dated, looking extremely reminiscent of its compatriots in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the realistic style of the Legend helps to overcome these flaws. Many of the characters in the show were designed to be handsome, however, unlike the characters designed today that fulfill the same purpose, the Legend never makes the character designs overly unrealistic to the point where you can not take them seriously, as is what happens to some of the series of today. It always makes the character designs believable, while maintaining the style that many producers use as to capture the attention of those who would otherwise not notice this product. There are several scenes that are not as detailed, not necessarily because of the laziness of the artists (although that does play a role), but because of the budget constraints that the production studios faced during the economic depression that occurred in Japan during the early 1990s. However, most of these mistakes were touched up in the DVD releases which is what an average person who has seen the show would have seen due to the show’s old age. The characters also never make unrealistic movements, which adds to the serious tone that the show possesses. Overall, nothing in the animation and art department degrade the plot in any serious way and can even boost the viewer’s experience in some instances.\nSound:\n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes’ soundtrack is comprised almost entirely of classical music. This allows the audience to take it more seriously, as any other form of music would not work quite as well for the background soundtrack, as it would make the series seem as though it is not taking itself seriously, which is something it surely is. The soundtrack is objectively quite beautiful, and not something that any viewer would normally attempt to stray away from. None of the songs are forgettable, and many would easily see themselves listening to this soundtrack outside of the series itself. None of the songs are necessarily misplaced either. The sound design is, for the most part, quite good and fits the series extremely well.\nConclusion:\n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a series that boasts both a highly realistic cast of characters and an immersing story that will never become overly lacking in quality as many series are. It is truly a classic that can be enjoyed by both elitists and casuals alike. This reputation has earned the series the moniker of “the anime for people who hate anime.” While it may have its flaws, they never overtake the series’ quality in any major way. The legend is truly a classic of anime that deserves much praise and respect. In the very least, that is one man’s humble opinion. I would recommend this anime series to anyone who watches anime that is not overly fixated on any single genre (of course, if they are fixated on space dramas, then that bypasses this point). Anyway, regardless of my opinions and the series itself, I want everyone who took time out of their day to read this to be in good health. I have been Kakorat859, this has been Kakorat’s review of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and I wish all of you to have a happy day. Be safe."},

I did not get my sleep yet. And yet, I am writing, I am writing because I must. To review this masterpiece is my goal. I will try - or I shall die in the attempt. \nA humble goal.\nThis anime is all, but humble.\nThe greatest anime there was, is and ever will be. This is undeniable. I used\n          \n        to think 'Code Geass' was the greatest, until I opened my eyes and saw the truth. Code Geass is pretentious it attempts to be Machiavellian,  but instead all it achieves is sensationalism and over the top lack of realism.  \nOn the other hand.... LotGH achieves EVERYTHING there is to achieve for an anime.  Aside from its writing, plot, art and thematic sound and characterization successes. LotGH as an anime reminds me of a book I've recently read 'The Prince' which really tells you of the Machiavellian nature of this show. Furthermore the constant references to Machiavelli really make me think that the writer is a true genius. \nIts flawless, well perhaps not entirely, for there is nothing that is flawless and can exist. \n[/rant] The writer's only major slip up are the battles themselves, they are not written perfectly as everything else. The tactics portrayed are not exactly 'good' 'feasible' or 'noteworthy' often when the victorious commander executes a tactic of sheer common sense and not doing anything stupid he is hailed as a genius for it. Other times when Yang Wenli utilises the semi-circle formation - he automatically wins; but whenever this formation is utilised by anyone but Yang Wenli it results in failure. Most of Yang Wenli's (and his successors in FPA) were sheer plot armour (sword?) tricks instead of legitimate victories. I love Yang as a character but every-time he keeps getting BS victories I hate him, he wins NOT because of the enemy's incompetence but because the plot allows him and his allies to withstand 50x more beating and 50x more superior enemies without collapsing or taking casualties. Many times we see an imperial fleet or other FPA fleets collapse and get annihilated in mere seconds when faced with certain tactics, but when those tactics are used against Yang  Wenli, he takes a beating from them for 1/2 an episode seeing his army be in a seemingly hopeless situation but then Yang Wenli tells them to do common sense things like 'oh we are surrounded?' 'lets break out focusing on a single point in the enemy formation' and boom they are free and suddenly they have a huge advantage because everyone forgot that they must've taken huge losses in their previous  formation.  They are suddenly fully replenished and can easily annihilate the enemy by using 'common sense tactics' which only work when Yang uses them. Others try sophisticated formations and tactics but Yang only uses the semi-circle and common sense to kill them. [\rant]\n- this is quite simply disappointing. \nYet despite this, this is still an anime worthy of the 10/10 score and the title of a masterpiece. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes is incredible. There is really no other word to describe it. Truly, an anime of such epic scope and proportion will never be made again, and really - it shouldn't be; for if anyone ever reattempted LOGH, they would surely fail to capture what I can't describe as anything less than a magnificent work of art. While I am certainly not someone who believes that 'old' anime are better than modern series, I can't help be feel as if what I have just finished watching less than a dozen minutes ago has profoundly changed my perception on what I now\n          \n        consider to be 'great' anime. But I'm going on and on without really reviewing, so let me break it down:\n~STORY~\nIf you are reading this review having not watched the series, I'm not going to spoil it for you, I wouldn't want to do you the disservice of preparing you to watch LOGH. It's a grand interstellar political drama, where those with power rise and fall. Eras will end, civilizations will crumble and all for what? Honour? Ambition? Greed? Perhaps for the strength of one's beliefs? For it is human nature that, even centuries into the future, remains unchanged.\nAnd really, this is how LOGH shines. While set far in the future, LOGHs does not lose its human element, its sense of realism. I've heard a few people say that the first dozen episodes are quite slow, but I was enamoured with them; because it takes the time to intricately set up a world - a grand and well put together stage for its actors to present themselves within. It brings you into this detailed place, helping you understand what its inhabitants value. It provides context to shape the future of the show's plentiful clashes of personalities and ideologies.\nThis is another success of LOGH, its display and very balanced discussion of the ideologies that shape the two primary sides of the galaxy - A democratic rule against an autocratic rule, which one is 'better'? As a westerner who has been taught the value of democracy my whole life, I of course lean towards the government by the people for the people. But a democracy can become corrupt, and an autocracy can have a just and fair ruler - so then, who is to say which one is truly superior? I'll let you watch and find out for yourself.\nAnother grand achievement of LOGH is its many space battles. While I did enjoy Code Geass, I did start to find it boring that the fights came down to 'who has the strongest single robot'. LOGH does not have this problem. The ships involved in the various battles are evenly matched, so it all comes down to strategy and tactics. \"The Art of War\" must have been read by a great multitude of the fleet commanders in the series, as they display stratagems that are obviously inspired.\nProgression is clear and logical, the various challenges that arise for both sides make sense, and are dealt with in a way that makes sense. And that is a good tell of a story: it makes sense. It is also very evenly paced (depending on your taste for the previously mentioned world building). I would say something about the ending, but I don't want to give anyone that hasn't watched it yet any sort of indication of what happens!\nThe final thing I'll say about the story is that it is deep, and I do not use that word lightly. And I don't mean the sloppily executed, poorly written \"deep\" - where the creators forcibly try and shove their views, their 'message' down your throat. No, it's just the very human nature of the anime, coupled with extensive cast that allows for so many different sorts of people to experience the same thing, and react to it differently - thus causing the viewer to think about how they react to it. No more is this obvious than how the anime deals with death. Those who fear it, those who accept it, those who try and run from it, and those who appear to actively pursue it. Death can come quickly without warning, or maybe it's given you obvious signs of ends approach. It does not differentiate between those of different class or belief, from those who 'deserve' it, or do not. Legend of the Galactic Heroes shows all sides, and that's how I'll end this enormous story section.\n~ART~\nThe quality greatly improves from the initial dozen episodes - though while watching I hardly noticed until I rechecked the first episode right after I had finished the last. It's style is definitely of its time, but I really love the older anime art styles. Just keep in mind that this anime was made when everything was hand-drawn, hand-coloured, hand-everythinged - so you'll see a few clever shortcuts they did in order to save time in animation, but it certainly didn't bother me. I can't fault an anime for being old, and this is one of the best looking 'old' anime I've watched in a long long while.\n~SOUND~\nThe soundtrack is fitting for an anime of this calibre. While I'm not sure whether it contained any original songs, LOGH contained a very wide variety of Baroque, Classical and romantic period music - all used very appropriately and to great effect.\n~CHARACTER~\nI love every single character in this anime. I mean, a few of them are absolute scumbags, but I love how they are written. Since the cast is so huge, I can't possibly hope to cover them all - but they are all wonderfully diverse, so wonderfully well written and developed. They all of varying degrees of honour, courage, ambition and... well, I can't say it much better than \"foppery and whim\" (you'll understand once you watch it). And you know what's the best? You see characters develop, while sticking to their core values. I also must say, I predicted various characters to do certain things, and they didn't - and other characters I expected to react in certain ways - but they reacted differently. It's not that the characters were erratic, but rather I had misread their intentions and character - which is refreshing! If you can predict a character, they don't have much character to begin with!\nBut there are two characters I must mention - two whom I cannot go without mentioning; and that is of course the two main characters: Reinhard and Yang Wenli. I love anime where characters are given other character to compare with for great results - and these two are my favourite. Reinhard of the imperial side, with much honour and ambition; and Yang of the Alliance who is honourable and has no ambition other than to get his pension when he retires. They are both so similar, yet so very very different. When they clash, my heart sings. They are both flawed, they both fall short, but they are both also so strong as to carry the hopes of nations on their backs. I will end this section from a speech that Yang Wenli gives early on, which perfectly sums up his character \"Because we can only drink good tea while we're living. Everybody, let's fight so we don't die.\n~ENJOYMENT~\nNo yeah of course I loved it, if you couldn't already tell. 10s all the way across the board.\n~OVERALL~\nWhile I'm tempted to say that this is my new favourite anime of all time, I'm not sure I can. Not because of any flaws (and mind you, there are some - just none that I can really mention without spoilers), but rather that I have nothing that can really compare to it on the same level. I love the writing of Monster, but can a thriller compare to a epic space drama? I love the characters in Ping pong, but can they compare to an anime with 99 extra episodes to work with? I love the ideas and execution of Fate/Zero, but can I really compare ufotable's enormous budgets to an anime made 17 years ago? All I can say it that Legend of the Galactic Heroes is brilliant, masterful, and unlike anything I've ever seen before. Please, go watch it; don't let it's age or high episode count deter you.\nNow I really have to think of what to watch next... maybe something that isn't good so I can lower my standards and acclimatize to the regular standard of anime again. Either way, Toodles~\n        "},

I have to respect LogH because naturally, it has a reason why it is top of it's game. Of course,  we have to see that the series is clearly OVERRATED and highly praised but it is for\n          \n        a good reason. Many adore it and many don't, Legend of the Galactic Heroes isn't your anime series with various cliches to hook any average anime watcher. However if this show can keep you hooked through the end then prepared for its epic gloriousness. \nTo start off this review,  Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a space soap opera, spanning 110 OVAs with a collection of side stories and 2 movies. The anime boast a very vast complexity of its world and characters which folds a very rich and deep narrative ever put onto an anime. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is also rich in dialogue,  which is cleverly written and relies heavily on the dialogue since it is the main highlight of the show itself. Granted, it can bevery tedious how the dialogue relies itself for exposition but the dialogue is so dense that you'll be stuck glued to the seat watching military officers talks of politics and the others for strategic battle formations. \nOur setting takes place around the 36th Century,  near the vastness of space and time. For 150 years,  two opposing factions,  The Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, face off in a grueling, intense, and violent battles of which will rule,  Dictatorship or Republican Democracy. Here we introduce our two main characters, Reinhard von Musel later Reinhard von Lohengramm,  an aristocrat brat notorious for his military genius as he rose through the ranks of at a very young age of 17. Yang Wenli,  a historian wanting normal life to teach history but with no money to pay for his college funds,  he joins the Free Planets Alliance to allow them to pay for his tuition. Branded as the natural military genius in military tactics, he was well renowned as the Hero of El Facil,  praised and sometimes feared by his comrades. \nOther than the main characters,  the side characters actually serves purpose in the main story as they are given in-depth characterization in which they hugely impacted the story. Characters like Julian,  Mittlemeyer,  Reuenthal, Fredrica, Anne Rose, Hildegard,  and numerous side characters matters in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. \nThe space battles in Legend of the Galactic Heroes aren't your typical over the top shounen,   but it stays in touch with the grounded realism of war and combat.  The space battle relies heavily on military strategies and tactics, much as real life military strategies. While it is slow and maybe tame at best,  the battles are still very intense thanks to the epic orchestral soundtracks and characters occupying which holds a very memorable piece of entertainment and also analytical aspect. Multiple lasers firing in sync,  battleships sunk into bits of chunks of metal, soldiers brutally murdered in horrific scenes of gore-splatters,  acts of suicidal attempts,  and many dramatic and intense battle scenes. Truly masterfully crafting in space battle action\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes' own narrative consist of politics, war, and even small talk of romance and comedy despite it is a very serious and grim anime. The morality within the main characters and side characters simplifies that there isn't truly the antagonist between the two opposing factions because both have their own unique ideals of what truly defines peace and tranquility. Yes, both sides are respectfully likable because you either root for them or bear a grudge. While there is corruption in both sides, they have never lost their pride to fulfill their ambitions. There is no bad side of them but surely they will be fear and grudges between the two opposing factions. Aside from the majority of politics and war, melodramatic moments strongly conveys the conflict in every character themselves. This goes to show that with heavy and clever dialogue and memorable characters benefits character development as well as plot. \nYes. This is the anime that holds a very deep connection with the characters and the world which you feel very sympathetic of who is the wiser. It is rhetorical but once you go as deep with the characters and story, you'll find answers that you may find relieving. \nAs such, why Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a masterpiece is what is right there when you watch it.  The vast complexity of world-building, characterization, narrative, dialogue,  and philosophical theme that takes itself deep in concepts of reality and morality. Legend of the Galactic Heroes is indeed a shining star in the universe,  sailing into the sea of stars and the skies of love. The deeds of men remain the same as conflict of two factions fighting for their beliefs.  \n"},

Hollywood brought us movies and series such as Star Wars, Star Trek and 2001. Kubrick and Lucas came up with great sci-fi stories and so did Yoshiki Tanaka who wrote the original novels on which this 110 episodes long OVA is based on.\nStory:|10| Tanaka sends us to space in the years around 3600 where we follow Yang Wen-Li and Reinhard von Lohengramm. Not only is the Story very well written but also executed so well that you have to keep in mind that this is just a fictional story and not a\n          \n        piece of history. It might sound stupid but Tanaka could have went to the future and brought this story with him as he came back.\nI couldn´t find even a the tiniest flaw in the plot or it´s execution.\nCharacters:|10| I don´t think that it´s a big spoiler if I tell you that someone dies in this series. It might shock you but thats a fact. Now what if I tell you that the characters are so well written that it feels like a person you knew in real life just passed away? I couldn´t believe it myself until I was able to experience this OVA. The characters are not only so well written that you can call them realistic but they also offer different opinions on subjects such as war politics and philosophy.\nArt:|9| This is the one point where I have to say that it´s not perfect. The way the OVA is drawn is perfectly fitting for the story it´s telling and the animations are also looking really great but there are some scenes where the characters faces are without any details. This may be because the budget was low at the time but I have to admit that I really don´t know the reason. I also don´t think that this makes the series worse, it´s just a thing I wanted to say.\nSound:|10| The soundtrack mainly consists of classical pieces. This may turn off some of people but it is the music that is the most fitting for the story. The sound effects are also well done and the voice actors did a very good job.\nEnjoyment:|10| I will admit that this is not a series for everyone. If you are looking for something like Star Wars in animated you maybe shouldn´t watch Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu because you wont find action scenes without tactical talk. The majority of episodes consists of the characters interacting and not fighting. Personally I loved the way the story was told but I am aware of the fact that there are many people out there who like shows that focus more on visual action and I don´t think that you will enjoy this show if you are one of them. For me the show even changed my view on politics and war.\nOverall:|10| I don´t think I will ever watch something that will be as good as Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu. This is my statement to end this review. Please keep in mind that whether you like or dislike a show is a personal opinion and based on your subjective view on things.\nThank you for reading!"},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes can be described in one word, scale. The scale in this anime is massive! It takes place across a universe in an epic battle between the Galactic Empire (dictatorship) and the Free Planet Alliance (democracy). This anime is a 110 episode OVA series taking place over 9 years (1988-1997). Think about it. If somebody wanted to keep up with this anime, they had to buy one VHS tape and then wait for the next one to come out periodically. It was made by Studio Artland (Megazone 23) and the director was Noboru Ishiguro (Megazone 23, Yamato, Macross). Needless to say,\n          \n        even the anime physically was on a large scale.\nSet within the Milky Way Galaxy around the 36 th century, a war has been happening between the Empire and the Alliance for over 150 years. The Empire is a dictatorship on one side of the galaxy in a monarchy type rule with Russian/German roots, while the Alliance is a “corrupt” democracy on the opposite side of the galaxy with more North America/Asian roots. Basically, imagine World War II in space, kind of.\nThe two main figures are Reinhard von Musel, military genius with aspirations to ruin the monarchy rule and unify the galaxy, and on the other end is Yang Wenli whom is a historian at heart but also a tactial genius. Where Reinhard is a tough hearted with high ambitions, Yang Wenli is the opposite who only wants to be a historian and enjoy afternoon naps. There is a crazy amount of side characters that come and go from Admirals in the military to high nobility to the common citizen. There is also a large amount political talk in between with a narrator primarily telling the progression of the story in a historical perspective.\nWhether or not the scale, way of telling the story or the problem with how long the anime is, may be disconcerting to some. LotGH is no doubt one of the grandest and most interesting anime ever made. Ranging from political insight, struggle between nations, city-state society on a galactic scale, all the way to religious terrorism, some might think it’s an over rated series. However, the length is its strength to tell the entire story, introduce characters and the universe they live in. This anime might as well be a fictional documentary. A must watch for a space opera fan.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Legend of Galactic Heroes (LoGH) is one of my favorite shows in any genre.  There can be a tendency for fans of certain anime to overly praise things that aren’t that great as some kind of “too deep for you to get it” masterpiece of writing, so I was a little wary heading in to this one.  It turns out that in this instance, the brigades singing a show’s praises are (for the most part) absolutely right.\nShows like this are a balm for anyone tired of the endless parade of cute girls doing cute thing shows; or tired of watching shows where the\n          \n        protagonist ends up being a lazy, whiny, good for nothing who just has things in life handed to him or her for no discernable reason.  This is a show about galactic history being made and unmade by great men and women and the difficult decisions that accompany all such struggles.  \nLoGH, when approached with the right mindset, is one of the best space operas that has been put on film.  While it’s not perfect (what is?), it is one of the best animated fiction stories that I’ve had the pleasure of sitting through.\nThere are some problems and challenges with the show, and these may end up making the show tough for some to watch, so I figure I’ll get these listed and out of the way.\n1.)	The artwork and animation are dated.  While I don’t think that this is a show that needs to rely on flashy visuals to tell its story, this is a 30-year-old anime and shows its age.\n2.)	This is a dialogue heavy anime.  There are a great many scenes where major characters sit around drinking, philosophizing, scheming, and occasionally bullshitting around.  LoGH tells its story to you through these conversations and doesn’t rely heavily on narrative recaps or other exposition.  Exposition is there at points, but this is a show that you have to pay attention to in order to understand what characters are thinking and doing.  With the average to subpar art, this isn’t going to be a flashy style over substance show.\n3.)	This show demands a lot from the viewer.  While I think that anyone can enjoy the show if they enjoy a space opera, the more historically educated the viewer is, the more they will get out of the discussions.  (Knowing a bit of Prussian history helps a LOT with understanding the Galactic Empire for example).  You aren’t going to be pandered to with nonstop flashy action sequences (see problem 2) so it’s a little tough to turn your mind off if that’s what you want to do.   \n4.)	At 110 episodes, this show is an investment of time.  While there are a lot of shows out there that go longer than this, those looking for something quick and light to watch aren’t going to find that here.  This series takes its time to build up the characters, factions, history, and battles.   I feel that this show is worth the investment, but some people aren’t going to like the fact that it’s going to take quite a few sessions to get through this one.\nThat out of the way, regardless of one’s preconceptions, if you have any serious interest in history, political philosophy, space opera fiction, music and its role in narrative, or heroic character studies, then you owe it to yourself to watch this show.  As I said, this show isn’t perfect, but it’s a tour de force that becomes greater than the sum of its parts the more you dive in, especially for those who are students of history.  There are other shows that can do certain of the themes I mentioned earlier in this paragraph better than the way that LoGH does, but it’s very rare to find a show so well rounded and constructed that it ends up doing all of these things at such a consistently high level.\nWithout spoiling anything major, at a broad stroke the series is about the political and military confrontation of an autocratic Galactic Empire and a democratic oriented Free Planetary Alliance group in the major arc.  There are other minor political/economic interests that have their own loyalties and diplomatic ties, specifically a nominally neutral trading alliance based between the two major factions, as well as a religious cult that operates behind the scenes and has its own agenda and goals.\nWhat makes the show as compelling to watch as it is has a lot to do with the fact that we’re watching case studies of great men who struggle against their factions decaying political institutions.  It feels like you are observing great history in the making, being along for the ride if you will, following interesting characters who very much become heroes in the classic sense of forging their own destiny and trying to remake their world and their place in the universe.  There’s a bit of Joseph Campbell in here, as well as Machiavelli and the other greats of history and politics to deal with as well, but it’s up to the viewer to discover the themes themselves. \nI think that the beauty of LoGH is that it doesn’t come right out and tell you that one faction or way of doing things is “the correct way”.  Much dialogue is spent debating the merits of democracy vs. autocracy and the major players in this historical drama each have their own opinions and are well versed enough to engage in the ramifications of each system and its strengths and weaknesses.  \nThere is also a distinct level of respect and decorum towards the other faction that harkens back to earlier times in our own history where opponents were treated with dignity and honor.  This ends up doing the viewer a great service by not reducing the different sides to an obvious paragon of all that is good and virtuous, and their cartoonish villainous counterpoint who manifests all that is wrong and evil and probably kicks puppies for fun.\nLoGH doesn’t seek to spoon feed you the answers or give you an obvious team to “root” for.  LoGH respects your intelligence and lets you watch and make your own decisions as there are good and bad folks on each side.  It also does this in a way that one doesn’t need to be versed in multiple languages to read the original works of the great philosophers and political thinkers to have an understanding of what’s going on either.  The show’s dialogue ends up being presented in a way that those who don’t care about reading up on history or politics can easily follow along perfectly well.  It can also be appreciated on a different level if one does understand more about politics and history as well.  Even having a good knowledge of classical music and how the pieces tie in to the mood and what’s going on screen, while unnecessary to enjoy the show, will open up another avenue of enjoyment that one could explore as well.  The show layers this complexity in a way that never reaches the heights of pretentiousness that some other pieces end up wallowing in.  There’s very little that’s shown that doesn’t end up building the narrative or fleshing out characters in a reasonable manner.\nWith regards to the great characters of this show, they are almost too many to list.  Yang Wen-li and Reinhard von Lohengramm are great faction leaders.  These are great men by deed and accomplishment, but also have realistic and somewhat tragic weaknesses that make them human and in many ways relatable.  They are also the two great military minds of their respective factions and watching their strategies unfold is great.  That’s not to say that these two steal the show all the time however.  There are other great characters that all have their own development and strengths and weaknesses to work through.  You’ll have favorites and those who are memorable as the show goes along.  The voice acting is great and emotional, and in a dialogue heavy show like this, that’s a blessing.  There are a ton of great voice actors in this, and they do a great job of making their characters and their personalities come to life.   \nLoGH doesn’t pander by having characters act in ways that are outside of their character (at least not very often) for plot convenience.  Characters who succeed one show by aggressively attacking may end up being hoisted by their own petard in a later episode by acting in a similar way.  Most of the characters follow their principles whether or not it actually leads them to the correct choice or not.  Watching the chess games between people trying to outguess each other’s strategies plays out well and you get the feel of watching a giant chess match between great military generals at times, even if on occasion, you do wonder about the success rate of certain characters.  It actually ends up making you think even more about what is and is not the right course of action to take in certain circumstances.  Some decisions that seem like admirable adherence to principles or really smart at the time actually come back to haunt later in the series as well, adding another layer of depth to the overarching philosophical questions that the show doesn’t spoon feed you the answers to. \nThere are other minor things that make the show great as well, such as the pacing and world building, which may seem slow at first, but actually works out really well by showing how the major players interact and what’s going on behind the scenes.  Occasional episodes will fill you in on the history of both factions, so you eventually become your own historian, and you are never wondering about the background details of the story.  You understand how you got here, and where things are going.  Coming from some other shows that simply exist as manga or light novel advertisements, where background information is sparse, sometimes nonsensical, or requires you to read novels, manga or wikis outside of the program to understand what’s really going on this is refreshing and makes you feel like you’re watching something where the author actually understood how to tell a complete story.\nThe soundtrack of classical works always ends up complementing what’s going on screen and captures the mood quite well.  You’ll hear soaring themes during battles and major moments, and you’ll hear great pastoral music when characters are off in the countryside.  Having a bit of knowledge of the great works isn’t necessary to enjoy the music, but students of music will smile at how well each piece of music’s theme goes along with its scene.   A full soundtrack for this show would be deep and broad, as there are generally 6-10 pieces over each of the 110 episodes.\nAs I said, there is no perfect animated series out there.  However, Legend of Galactic Heroes rightly deserves a spot in the upper echelons as a 10-rated masterpiece of an anime.  I can’t recommend it enough.  "},

I was just like many of you that may be reading this: just surfing this website, looking at the \"top anime\" that was listed, and then seeing this one anime called \"Legend of the Galactic Heroes\" that I never heard of in my life. What was strange was not only how unpopular the anime is compared to most of the shows that are highest ranked, but that many\n          \n        of the people who hated it didn't explain why they didn't like it for some reason. I decided I should see this for myself, despite not being a sci-fi fan.\nThings to note: First of all, the plot is extremely complex beyond your imagination. I'm an honor roll student in grade 12, and even I struggled a bit to get every single detail about the plot. Secondly, if you like history, military tactics, classical music or politics, than you will enjoy this show even though it looks more like your typical space opera at first glance. Lastly, the first season isn't as interesting as the two seasons that come after it (It's still good, but less worthy of a 9.13), so it's first impression isn't exactly the best.\nStory - 7: I'm going to admit that I had some doubts regarding the show's plot. The plot moves very slow since it focuses on so many perspectives and events happening all at once. Some people may like that, but I think most people on this site might not. I'm not going to reveal much, since there are character synopses on this site and what not.\nArt - 9: The show's art isn't pretty, both because it's old, and because it does not follow the usual style that is used in anime. I'm not going to consider the show's age in my critique of its art, since there are Laserdisc, DVD and Blu-Ray rips of this show with various differences in the art depending on which rips you decide to watch.I liked how spectacular some of the scenes looked , and I wanted to watch them again every now and then. I won't describe what they are since there are some minor spoilers associated with them. I feel that the anime having many characters with less anime-like facial features is probably a good choice, since it might give something more refreshing to the viewer who is probably getting tired of the more typical anime that's out there. More importantly, it looks a lot more serious, and fits in seamlessly with the tone of the show. Here are several screenshots of the Golden Wings OVA, which was made with the characters look more anime-like:\nhttp://bakashots.me/i1ake0rcDZA2vzYgugvd==\nhttp://bakashots.me/i0L6e0rcDZA-4oPK-fpa==\nhttp://bakashots.me/i0Mke0rcDZAWyo_sFCqa==\nSound - 10: After seeing the first episode I just had to look up the opening and ending theme again on YouTube, even though the comments might spoil me if I see them (My monitor is big, so I can see the top comments without scrolling down). Whoever thought of hiring the people to sing the openings and endings is a genius. You will very often hear classical music during the actual show, and you will rarely hear the same theme being played more than once. Many of the sound effects however, seem like they are found in your usual old anime or drama.\nCharacter - 10: Each character in the show has their own unique contribution to the storyline, with some characters being emphasized in some parts of the show more often than others. Some very minor characters may appear once or twice, and then you may never notice them again after that. Each of the characters all seem very interesting, and their personalities may engage you to watch the show even more. It's tough speaking about a specific character since the cast is huge, however throughout the course of the show there seems to be slightly more of an emphasis in the members of the Galactic Empire than there is in the members of the FPA. You'll come out knowing a bit more about Reinhard's life and past than you will with Yang's. \nEnjoyment - 9: This isn't the kind of anime you should watch after a long day of school or work since it is very cerebral in nature because of the plot. I sometimes felt like I should watch an episode more than once sometimes. You'll get a much more classical feeling when watching the show than a futuristic one. Even during many of the battles in space; the ships are not seen moving up and down very often, and it will later give you the feeling that this is really an old naval battle. There aren't that many action scenes in comparison to your average space opera, and there is much more talk with just yourself being there to piece together the situation in your mind. This can become very challenging for an activity that is supposed to be more relaxing.\nOverall - 8/10: I think the rating for this anime is a bit too high, so I'm giving it an 8 rather than a 9."},

Humanity is spread across the galaxy and is divided into two regions. One, being the Imperial Empire, following an Aristocratic rule and the other being Free Planets Alliance, following a Democracy. The story mostly surrounds two characters, Reinhard Von Lohengramma\n          \n        of Empire and Yang Wenli of Free Planets Alliance. The story, broadly, could be viewed as clash between ideologies rather than battle between the persons supporting them.\nAnimation: Though the anime was produced long back it was not a bad experience. It might take around six to seven episodes to get in tune with it. But since it is a long series animation gradually changes from starting till the ending. Characters are mostly reflected in their faces and art style.\nSound: Supported by classic music for opening and ending and in between, makes it nearly perfect for the series. Voice acting is also wonderfully done, each character has unique and most suitable voice acting.\nCharacter: The series has huge number of characters, each receiving may be perfectly suitable time slot. Aside from main characters side characters are also develop throughout the series recurring various times. Each character is given a unique talent and nonetheless are also given their flaws. The series by far exceeds any other anime in this sector.\n Enjoyment: Mostly dependent on the individual, since it might be boring for some due to its long conversations. Definitely enjoyable otherwise."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\nLegend of Galactic Heroes was a great show. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, but at the same time it has some issues that I personally could deal with, but at the same time can possibly see a lot of potential views turned away. The show is considerably long compared to your standard 24 episode animes, as it sits at 110 episodes, and is sometimes dragged out. Watching some of the episodes can be compared to watching to watching filler episodes of DBZ and such. Sometimes the show is slow and not a lot is going on, though to an extent they are entertaining to watch.\n          \n        Those select episodes always lead to major plot points which makes them essential to have. The best way I can explain this is to compare it to the old black and white war movie \"The Longest Day\". The movie itself is a masterpiece, but it starts off slow, leading up the impending invasion of Normandy by the Allied Forces, which of course leads to some massive cinematic battles. Overall, I feel that the show is the same way. It will have a few slow and dull episodes that add depth and character development, that lead up to major events. Again to reiterate, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, hence why I made the allusion to the \"The Longest Day\", but I felt the show was sometimes dragged out. Now, let's get to the review. \nStory: (8; Very Good)\nThe story is intriguing enough. There are quite a few twists, and the overall experience is solid. There is plenty of political intrigue, wars, and lore to keep the show going. That being said, there are a few plot holes, so to speak. There are a few certain events that happen and it left me wondering why, as they made no sense, but those are minute and are easily looked over. \nArt: (7; Good)\nThe art in this show is obviously dated, but that's not to say it is bad. All of the character look fine and are convincing enough. Some of the animations such as the close quarters battles and of characters running look a bit sluggish and unpleasant to look at, but these negatives can be countered by the direction in the art style. The armors that the characters use for close quarters and space combat look cool and menacing. The capital ships and fighters have an awesome style to them that makes them look realistic and awesome at the same time. Many of the flagships on the Imperial side were unique and slick compared to the ones on the FPA's side. Another note, as the number every major battle increases, so does the art style and animation. The first battle seemed a little lack luster, though it kept my interests, but as each battle progressed, so did the  quality of animations, weapons, fleet formations, ships, etc. The same goes for the close quarters segments. Overall, I liked the art and designs, hence I felt it was worth of a seven.\nSound: (7; Good)\nHonestly, I really don't have much to say about the sound. Every 30 episodes or so, they change the intro and outro. Although they all sounded very similar. I didn't hate them nor did I really enjoy them. They were just kind of there, and I skipped them after my first viewing of them. That's just my personal taste, so I won't consider that a negative. Also majority of the soundtrack consisted of classical/baroque music, which is fine, I didn't have any issues with it. None of the characters had annoying voices, so I suppose that's a positive. My only complaint is that I wish there was more sounds going on in some of the space battles and there were different tones for the laser fire. \nCharacters (10; Perfect)\nThere are a ton of characters. Each have their own devotions and personality. There are plenty of episodes that nothing much is going on, so their intention is for character development. I learned to care for some of the characters and felt accomplished for their victories and sad for their demises. Not one complaint when it comes to the characters, hence a perfect score. \nOverall (8; Very Good)\nOverall the show is great. It's definitely worth the watch. It may not be perfect, but the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. It's long, it's action packed, has great characters, stellar space battles, and an enjoyable story. \n*Note- in the review I did not mention anything about the sense of scale this show has. Space battles occur with ships being in the high thousands and the troops in the millions. This is a definitely a positive and I really didn't know where to add this.*\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    \"In every age, in every place, the deeds of man remain the same\"\nThis is LOGH's basic idea and what makes it a timeless epic. It is a show that very carefully explores various political an philosophical topics, while never trying to preach an absolute truth. It rather presents the audience a lot of different point of views which all make sense and are in a way justified. Pair this quality with a glorious story, fantastic characters and a magnificient score, and you get what may very well be the best anime ever. \nThe show is set in distant future in our milky way galaxy, where\n          \n        the universe is split into two political groups. The Free Planets Alliance which strongly resembles the US army during WW2, and on the other side an aristocratic german Empire with fancy royals. This contrast is interesting in itself, and while there are other players in the game, the main question of the show is whether democracy or monarchy is superior. As already stated, the final decision must be made by the viewer as the show does not take a clear position, which is fantastic. \nTo keep a neutral position the story is often told through a narrator who summerizes events like in a history class. This is important because the author created an unbelievably realistic scenario, and many, many events take place in this universe. LOGH cares a lot about world building and excels in it. The only minor flaw may be that you are disturbed that humanity hasn't evolved more in over a thousand years, but that does not hinder the drama in any way. \nOther than that, LOGH thankfully does not utilize \"Deus Ex Machina\" means in any plot twist, and does not fall into the trap of trying to be too surprising. Everything seems reasonable and while plottwists sometimes can be seen coming, it isn't so important what happens, but how it happens. This increases the worth of rewatching the series immensely and it will never get boring. \nTo connect the ideas of the show to the audience the show uses an incredibly big cast of characters. If I had to compare LOGH to a famous TV Series,it would be Game of Thrones. In comparison, LOGH doesn't feature any unneeded characters. Everyone contributes to the story, features an individual personality and believable reasons behind his philosophy. It is simply incredible how many amazing characters this show has. This ranges from main characters to side characters, and it was a pure joy to watch these personalities talk and interact. \nSince LOGH doesn't favour any side in this war, the war itself becomes even more dramatic. You can't root for anyone, you keep rooting for peace. And because characters do not have any plot armour, better prepare yourself for some manly tears...\nFrom the technical standpoint it's amazing how well this series has aged. Of course the movement of characters is not as crisp as in modern works, and various other limitations of the time like resolution or contrasts are noticeable. Especially the space battles seem a little lackluster in the first 20 episodes. \nHowever, as many times stated, the production team was eager to improve and it does! \nBut disregarding all that, the artstyle itself is really, really good. It perfectly underlines a serious war drama, and it always understands its own limitations. It doesn't go for flashy effects when it doesn't need to, it focuses more on characters and realistic looks. Characters are designed like actual humans (they have noses!), and even though they mostly wear the same uniforms, you can distinguish them pretty easily. It's remarkable how they managed to make each character recognizeable, something modern anime often fail. \nThe directing is superb, too. A lot of attention is paid to the body language of the characters and lots of details can be found, which give not only the characters but also the whole show more depth. \nThe soundtrack is outstanding, since it uses some of the most famous composers of all time like Mozart, Beethoven and others. Since Star Wars we know how well classical music goes with a space opera, that it provides a scale of epic- and timelessness, and LOGH makes use of this. And don't get me started about the intro and outtro songs, which are a trip to feeltopia (I'm talking to you, ending 3...). \nSomething a lot of people criticize is the slow pacing, which I can not agree at all with. You may need some episodes to dive into the world as it is very complex, and to get to know all the characters. But out of 110 episodes, there is no one which is unimportant. In every episodes something major happens - in fact, if another show would try to show all the events from LOGH, it would probably take over 200 episodes. LOGH is a masterpiece of directing and storytelling - sometimes an episode might look like a filler, just to take a u-turn and make the viewer realize why they showed this slice of life scene. I've never seen this executed this well ever before. Take notes, authors, this show is almost 30 years old and you haven't been able to do the same? \nLOGH rewards the intelligent viewer. It is plot driven and dialog heavy, but there was not a minute where I was bored. It is a true epic that doesn't need boobs or stupid comedy to shine. Though being a very serious war drama, even the humour makes you smirk from time to time and allows for a great comedic relief. \nAll in all it is clearly the best anime out there for me. It just outclasses everything else, and I seriously dare to say that anyone with a taste for intelligent entertainment will like this for sure. \n\"The legend end, and history begins...\""},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    ***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\nStarting on your Legend of the Galactic Heroes journey is not what you think it is going to be. You might have an idea of what it will entail but you don't. Nothing can prepare you for the amount of character development, the secret plots behind the scenes, and the absolute beauty of the strategic space battles.\nStory: 9.5/10 \nOut of the 110 episodes that encompasses the main OVA series, around 100 of them are so enthralling that I had to force myself to go to sleep. The way the show handles how the universe changes between the factions is simply\n          \n        astounding. You don't just root for one guy; there are likable and strong characters everywhere and the greatest part about it is that there is a very gray area with “who is the bad guy” early on in the show. You cannot help but root for all (well almost all) the sides. The two main characters (Yang and Reinhard) have qualities that will most likely appeal to you. \nWhere the show falls a little short however is in the final parts of the final act. The last 10 episodes in my opinion are rushed, a little too coincidental, and lacking in impact. Other than this however, the show absolutely nails it.\nArt/Animation: 8.4/10\nLook, I get it. You see a collection of still-frames from this show and immediately exclaim, “Eww this looks old.” Yes it is old. The animation is rough in a lot of scenes and the art style even drastically changes in the 20-30 episode range (I think I read that the main animator was ill during this time). HOWEVER, I find it hard to not see the true beauty in this show. The art (not the animation) is actually breathtaking (except in the episodes noted above). There was a show that recently aired called Scum's Wish that was praised for looking like an animated picture book. So much effort was put into making each scene look like it was a work of art. I feel the same way about LotGH. It simply captivates you like no other show with its more mature looking art style. The world feels grounded because of this (the character models also look very un-anime-like). \nYes the animation is dated but I think that the art makes up for it. \nSound: 10/10\nThere isn't a lot of purpose-built musical pieces in this show. What it does have however is some of the best arrangement of classical/romantic era music I have ever heard in a show. It's not just because it is classical/romantic music; it's how the music makes the scenes come to life. They are not just thrown in willy-nilly; they have a very apparent impact. I think that this show rivals Aria for best score I have heard/experienced in Anime.\nThe voice actors (...ALL OF THEM) are so skillful in their performances. They all fit their characters so well and the fact that there are so many of them in the series just makes me clap for the studio. I don't know how they pulled it off but I sincerely take a bow for them. \nCharacters: 10/10\nMeaningful character interactions and development is all over this series. You will witness so many characters grow (literally) throughout this series. Even most of the super secondary characters will show you a thing or two about character development. The interactions are, in my opinion, what makes this series so great. On both sides of the factions you have a leader who can demand the up-most skill from his allies. They both have a group of friends that complete him as a functioning leader. While their methods vary, their companions aid them in similar ways.\nHands down the best cast I have ever seen in anime. These characters are multi-dimensional and are in no way cookie-cutter. \nOverall: 9.5/10\nWhile this score will get rounded up to 10 (since MAL doesn't allow for decimal point scores) I need to stress this important point; this show is the best package I have seen thus far in anime but it is not a perfect package. On a technical level it is so astounding. The show was unfortunately cursed from being a part of an era of anime where animation was just not quite there yet in terms of what was possible under deadlines. Then again the show might not have been the way it was if not for the 80's era of OVA anime. There is a new reboot/remake of the series coming out soon from studio Production IG so maybe we will see a perfect show (since the remake of Space Battleship Yamato was so well done). Regardless, in my mind, this show is a masterpiece save for the animation and art style inconsistencies. I only rank it below Aria and Perfect Blue because those two works strike me on a additional personal level. Please watch this show. This is not an elitist trying to convert you; this is a person who enjoys many visual mediums who is trying to get you to allow yourself to lose a month of your life watching this beautiful and tragic story about the control of a not-so farfetched universe. \nEnjoyment: ∞/10\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\nSincerely,\nAwesome Drummer\n        "},

However character design and running theme designs for the factions is great, I especially love the space opera feel of the Reich.\nSound: As usual space opera OSTs are usually great and LOTGH is no different. Seems the OST levels out good with certain situations while at times I do feel it's lacking more of a tense feel when is needed but it doesn't fail to deliver for most situations and characters.\nCharacters: A lot of the side characters could have their own series, a lot of them are very interesting and add well to the universe of LOTGH. Stories of how they became who they are and their different views/perspectives of the universe they live adds to the overall story, other stories of characters webbed together like a refined spiderweb linking to a center the main story.\nFans of Space Operas this is a must, and is probably the best political drama anime.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a 36th-century (~) tale of two humongous superpowers that have been engaged in a centuries long war called the Forever War. This tale is one of two tactical geniuses. On the side of the Free Planets Alliance, the side that resembles today's bloated democratic system, is Yang Wen-li, a man who reluctantly joined the military so he could go to school and become a historian. On the opposing side, the Galactic Empire, a government that closely resembles 19th century Prussia, we have Reinhard von Musel, a noble who rose to the top thanks to his genius and many military\n          \n        accomplishments.\nThe plot is segmented into four major \"seasons.\" The first season is entirely a set-up for entire show, it builds characters, gives them motivations and pushes them to follow those ambitions, the second season itself deals with the battles that occur from the ambitions, leading to a halfway conclusion. I don't want to go too in-depth with what happens due to fear of spoilers, but these seasons in plain terms, deal with Reinhard's rise through the ranks, and eventually the second deals with all his battles with the Free Planets Alliance. From there, the third season takes another turn and deals more with the fanatical religious group known as the Terraists (who worship Mother Earth) and the underground schemes they think of to push history in their direction. Finally, the fourth season is the most philosophical, dealing with many ideas on how different political systems influence people, and how certain men's ambitions can shape entire chapters of history.\nLegend of the Galactic Heroes plot told exactly how it's presented, a piece of history. It may be fiction, but the importance of the battles, characters, their ambitions, their dreams and more, are played out like a special you'd find on the History Channel (you know, before they did exposes about conspiracy theories). This presentation is actually incredibly engrossing, each episode gives you so much to digest and it's so satisfying, and the importance of each character is also directly correlated with how important they play a part in the show. And for good reason, because this show has more characters than a George R.R. Martin novel.\nYou have major characters to the most minor of minor characters that the show often shows the names of several times because you may forget them. But because that correlates with their importance, it's often not a negative. Your Reinhard, Reuenthal, Mittermeyer, Julian, Yang, and Walter are names you will remember because those names just matter far more. And I love the characters in this show. Characters that have ideals, that have dreams, that have these inner monologues that tells us so much more about them. And even in battle, you learn more through their actions. There was a chart made associating the Meyers-Briggs personality types with the many characters here and it shows just how in-depth they can really get. There will be characters you love and hate, all for very different reasons, whether it's Yang's easygoing side or Reinhard's ambitious side. No two characters ever feel the same.\nPeople fight. People die for these two juggernauts who are meant to shape history. The epic story told here through dozens of these memorable characters, fleshed out and so well made, how certain deaths in the series affect the viewer, and how even after death, their importance is resonated, large or small, Legend of the Galactic Heroes leaves no stone unturned, closing up character arcs and leaving no story left to tell by the end. Friendship, camaraderie, rivalry, love, marriage, birth, death. The entire show is brimming with depth in every facet of it's presentation. The weight of each season is felt when the next one arrives and that weight continues on until the epic conclusion presented by the end. There is idealism presented through the show through its characters, and a sense of realism as the events occur, bringing the viewer back down to reality, that not every legend is fairy tale. As stated, the show itself it presented as a piece of history. Each episode has details upon details and tons of lines of dialogue that are engrossing, and presented in interesting and fascinating ways.\nThere is no show with as much depth that you will ever find in this medium. There are no characters who are so deep and so well-crafted. With every anime I watch, there is not one that reaches the epic level this one does. The amazing part of that is, is that this show never tries to be deep. It is meticulous in its presentation, but thanks to that, it grows, more and more, into something incredible. What is shown here comes full circle and you leave absolutely satisfied with what you've been shown. I say wholehearted, even if there are shows that I personally love more, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the greatest anime ever crafted. It is a juggernaut that has yet to ever be toppled. From start to finish, it never lets up, and from start to finish, it never lets you down. It's the very definition of the word masterpiece.\n        "},

It’s an old 110 episode OVA series with one of the biggest casts in anime. The characters mostly have German names and the story doesn’t have tons of action, it instead focusses on politics. You would think this would be a long and boring snooze fest with nothing happening and to some viewers, it is. In its first 20 episodes, the legend doesn’t seem that interesting, only hinting at more to come. So why does this get proclaimed as the “best anime of all time”?\nA lot of things. The amazing world building, the characters, the soundtrack, everything just\n          \n        makes your mouth hang wide open. It’s not for anyone. The episodes are dialogue driven with not much else. The art is atypical of modern anime and the plot is complicated. But if you stick with it, you will be rewarded.\nStory: 10\nLegend of the galactic heroes is set in the far away future. Man has traveled through the universe and inhabited multiple planets. In this universe there is war between two sides. The Galactic Empire and the Free Planet Alliance, the empire being autocratic and the alliance democratic. In this war, two men are born, Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm, each rising to power in their faction to become legends.\nThe story is really the main focus of this series. It presents itself as a novel with narration being present in the series. The plot is somewhat complicated, but not in a bad sense. This isn’t a series you can just put up in the background, every conversation is meaningful with details that can’t be overlooked. The passing is very slow, but not at a snail’s pace. The series may seem slow and boring at first, but the more you watch it, the more you appreciate the slow pace.\nThe show also doesn’t make one of the sides look good or bad. Each side has their own story to tell. There is allot of political corruption in the series and neither sides are exactly good, they just fight for their own ideals. The viewer decides what’s the best\nThe plot is really the meat of the series and it handles it exceptionally well. The only nitpick I can give is that some of the technology can seem pretty old, but this can be excused, since the anime is pretty old itself. Other than that, the story is one of the best in the genres.\nCharacters: 10\nYou would think that the characters would be the weak point of the series. But in contrast, the characters are the best part of the series. Each character is well handled with their own ideals and that’s saying allot for a cast this big. Almost every character is believable in their actions. In the beginning there are a few one dimensional villains, but they get wiped out at the end of the first season and the rest of the characters forgive it.\nEverybody can have their favorite characters in this series and there is not really one character I despise. Everyone’s actions are logical in a way, they don’t do things because the plot demands it. They all get great development in their own way. And not one character has plot armor. It’s actually shocking how many characters die, but it feels natural, since this is a war and many people die, important or unimportant.\nFavorite characters: Yang Wenli, Oskar van Reuenthal and Alexander Bucock\nArt: 8\nThe animation, especially in the first few episodes, is ok. Dialogue can sometimes feel awkward because of some stiff animation and it doesn’t help that the remastered version puts in more modern animation between the old scenes, which sticks out like a sore thumb. But the animation is good where it matters, which is in the space battles. The art is also fantastic, every character looks realistic. They don’t have silly expressions or rainbow colored hair. Everyone feels realistic, which helps with the tone the series sets.\nSound: 10\nThe voice acting in the series is phenomenal. Every voice actor portraits their character excellent, there is no real fault I can give. The OST is also wonderful, containing only classical pieces. This gives the series a feel of epicenes and makes the series feel more timeless. It feels like you’re really watching a legend unfold with the music knowing when to show its head and when to hide itself. It helps the series feel more classic and mature in many ways.\nEnjoyment: 10\nThis anime opened my eyes in many ways. It really pushes what an anime is. It doesn’t have annoying clichés, nor does it suffer from being too ambiguous. It knows what it can do and does it immensely well. I can’t think of any other anime I got this invested in. It’s also the first anime where I actually cried without any cheap tricks(*cough* Clannad *cough*).\nOverall: 10\nA must watch for anyone, legend of the galactic heroes is one of the best anime of all time and certainly deserves it spot in the top 10 anime on MAL. Although it’s not for everyone, it’s still one of the best stories ever told in any medium. A must watch for anyone who is seriously into anime.\n(This was my first review on this site, and since I’m only 16 and a non-English speaker(or whatever you call it), I would like some criticism of any kind.)
