    I&rsquo;m a big fan of Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s work, so when I heard that Paprika was showing at the Chicago Film festival nearly 2 years ago I had to go no matter what.  So there I was with a fever, headache, and doing my best to hold back my coughing.  After watching, I kind of wished I had stayed in bed.  Perhaps it was due my illness but after a re-watching it I still share the same sentiments I had nearly 2 years ago.\
Those familiar with Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s work should know he likes to blend reality and illusion.  Paprika was no exception,\
          \
        dealing with the dream world via DC mini, a device which can be used to enter someone&rsquo;s dreams.  As expected the dream world Kon created was incredibly imaginative and surreal.  Animation and art for this movie was easily the best of Kon&rsquo;s work as well as most anime.  This movie was worth watching just for the animation and surreal world that Kon creates.  Music was equally good, creating a haunting yet beautiful atmosphere.  Sadly I don&rsquo;t think its possible to even possible to describe the surreal and imaginative dream sequences in Paprika.  However, that&rsquo;s it, I could go on and on about the movie&rsquo;s technical merit, but it doesn&rsquo;t make up for its weak narrative.  \
Paprika featured highly imaginative imagery and excellent editing that Kon is known for however, what was it all for?  If we take out the imagery out of the equation, what do we have left?  The basic outline of Paprika&rsquo;s story was wafer thin and had a painfully obvious twist near the end.  In addition, a tacked on romance that made far less sense than even the most surreal imagery that Kon can muster.  Chances are you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;Its all about the execution, who cares about a weak storyline as long as its done well.&rdquo;  Yes, execution is more important and surreal imagery and crazy editing can be used to make an otherwise boring story captivating.  For example, Millennium Actress, one of Kon&rsquo;s earlier works.  However, in the case of Paprika the surreal imagery felt like it was the main point and the story/characters were secondary.  Also, the imagery didn&rsquo;t serve any purpose with respects to the story, it was there for the sake of being there and a &ldquo;plot&rdquo; to provide it some context.\
What I said was only for the main plot line, the detective&rsquo;s sub plot was sadly far more interesting.  Here the use of imagery really suits his story and conflicts, similar in execution as in Millennium Actress.  However, something is wrong when a sub plot is more interesting than the main story. \
Characters are also pretty weak.  The villain was pitifully boring and one-dimensional.  Sadly, I can&rsquo;t say otherwise for the rest of the cast.  Also, the development of Atsuko and her romance at the end was so forced it was unbelievable.  Once again, this confused me more than even the most surreal imagery Kon can muster.  Konakawa (the detective) was the only saving grace in the cast of Paprika.  He actually had a decent amount of characterization and actually developed through the course of the movie.  \
Paprika was a wholly imaginative work that only Satoshi Kon can create.  He creates a landscape that was beyond words.  This was coupled with amazing technical achievement by Madhouse, the animation studio.  However, Paprika failed in terms of story and characters.  The visuals didn&rsquo;t serve much of a purpose with respects to the plot and felt like it was there for the sake of being there.  Also, this plot was incredibly superficial and painfully predictable.  The tacked on romance and forced character development was equally painfully and confusing.  Konakawa was the only saving grace in terms of story and character however, something is wrong when a side character was more interesting than the main story.  In the end, Paprika is more like a dream than Kon probably intended.  It was captivating during but when it ends you&rsquo;ll remember only a few visual snippets and forget everything else.         \

    Paprika, Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s (Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers) latest movie, is a whimsical and imaginative journey into the concept of dreaming. As with each of his productions, Paprika is a distinctly unique and fresh film, while also retaining tones of Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s usual quirkiness and style. While this is a film that revolves around exploration into the farthest reaches of human subconscious, it has traded the introverted and claustrophobic psychological tension seen in Perfect Blue for a decidedly free and open approach to the human mind, fitting with the theme of the limitless expanse of dreaming. This gives it a more relaxed and fun\
          \
        feel, whilst also retaining its depth and profoundness. In quite the same way as Tokyo Godfathers was, paradoxically, a light-hearted melodrama, this film is an accomplished juxtaposition of emotion, as the dark themes of jealousy and hatred are played out in the hallucinatory escapism of the dreamscape. \
\
Dreams as a concept have always captivated me, and never before have I seen such a well-done representation of dreams in any form of media. Movies usually treat them as either being pointlessly strange, or pointedly symbolic, but Paprika captures their essence to fascinating effect. Dreams are as much about flow and direction as they are about the immediate situation, and this is something very apparent when watching Paprika, as the dreams flow and change fascinatingly with mundane illogic, moving from one setting to another with only a thematic thread between them. Looking back at my own dreams and how they shift from setting to setting based on the emotional context, and I see that Paprika portrays this perfectly. I can see that the dream sequences were thoughtfully brought to life, and were not just crazy for the sake of crazy. But through all its fanciful imagery and creativity unbound from realism, Paprika has a story behind it that deals with very strong human emotions, and it excellently weaves this emotional content throughout the films, particularly in the dream sequences, where the subconscious expresses the truth behind each character&rsquo;s external, day-to-day personality.\
The way it tells this story is simultaneously a strength and a flaw of the film; on the one hand I am inclined to say that it was obfuscatory in the way it obscured the plot from the viewer. While watching this movie I felt like I was trying to get my head around a particularly long riddle. As I followed it, the only understanding I really got of what was actually going on was in retrospect, and while some may call this clever, I found that not having an idea of the direction of the plot was a detriment. However, given that the movie revolves around the theme of dream analysis, it is also a fitting method of storytelling: the audience itself has to engage in the movie as though it were analysing a dream, and hence can only be understood when looking back at it. However, my advice to anyone planning to watch the movie: pay close attention to the dialogue and symbology of the dreams, because it is all too easy to get caught up in the zany fun of the dream sequences and lose track of the plot.\
When it comes to the plot itself, I&rsquo;m not so enthusiastic. Nor am I so aflame with praise when it comes to the characterisation. Both of these factors are the reasons why I am hesitant to label it as my favourite Satoshi Kon film; Tokyo Godfathers had excellent characterisation, and a simple yet powerful story; and Perfect Blue, with its introverted character study, delivered a great emotional impact. It may well be impossible to create a perfect film, but if these factors had been better incorporated into Paprika, then it would be among my favourite anime films, possibly my very favourite. It is a shame that Satoshi Kon&rsquo;s vision and creativity is let down by a lack of depth in his characters and stories now, after his consistent accomplishments in the past. I think the main problem was that the movie tried to involve a too larger cast, to whom it could not provide ample depth in its limited feature-length time-frame. The other problem was that there was very little attention given to delivering a sense of conflict, a crucial element to any story. Perfect Blue had the internal conflict of the subconscious and the conscious; Tokyo Godfathers had conflict between its characters and society; and this movie tries to incorporate an antagonist-protagonist conflict, almost as an afterthought, with neither party given enough profundity to their perspectives to make the conflict intense. There was mention of their different ideology when it comes to the exploration of dreams, and a subplot of jealousy, but little more. So the story lacks the optimal &lsquo;beginning -&gt; conflict -&gt; end&rsquo; structure, meaning it felt like it just went on and on until it finished, as entertaining as it was.\
I have little to say about the technical achievements behind this film, other than the fact that it was fantastic in almost all aspects, with only the score music lacking. It is clear he used the same musical producer behind Paranoia Agent&rsquo;s score track, and I simply cannot find his style of music appealing; it feels immature and cannot contribute effectively to the mood of the movie. Much better was the use of music in Perfect Blue, the score of which really sold the hauntingly intense atmosphere. The visuals are much better; this is his best looking film yet, with vivid animation and, as expected, brilliant direction.\
It was not given enough weight, but I liked the message that dreams are the final sanctity of the human mind, which should not be intruded upon. This movie beautifies dreams, and attaches importance to them (as seen in Atsuko&rsquo;s acknowledgement of her feelings for Dr. Torataro through her subconscious), and the suggestion that veil between them and reality is sacred really spoke to me, even if it came from the mouth of the antagonist. Paprika is a thoroughly enjoyable, visually captivating movie, which does overwhelming justice to its theme of dreaming, but which has flaws in its plot and characters that prevent it from being a great achievement as a film.\

    Satoshi Kon was among the best directors in the medium of anime until his unfortunate and untimely death in 2010. His blending of realistic character designs and settings with Lynchian surrealism created visual experiences unlike anything anime had produced before. Beautiful and haunting dreamscapes that unraveled the human psyche both literally and figuratively. A great example is his last work; the strange, dense, and insanely inventive Paprika.\
Adapted from a novel of the same name by science fiction author Yautaka Tsutsiu, Paprika takes Kon's mind-bending style and applies it quite literally to the plot. The story takes place in the near future, where a remarkable device\
          \
        called the \"DC Mini\" has been invented, which allows people to enter other peoples' dreams and access their unconscious thoughts; intended for the use of psychotherapists. However, while still in its development, one of the DC Mini prototypes is stolen. Soon, development staff members begin to have their dreams invaded and entangled, and its up to head of development Chiba Atsuko, and her chipper alter ego Paprika, to find the culprit and retrieve the prototype before more damage is done.\
This premise works perfectly with Kon's directing style and the themes he often explores. The movie weaves from dream to reality and back again seamlessly. With the DC Mini giving the ability to enter (or invade) peoples' dreams and psyches, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between delusion and reality. There are scenes which seem to take place in reality, until something strange occurs, pulling back the curtain to reveal that it is a dream instead. The dissolving wall between the two comes with some serious consequences, as characters slip into madness; becoming delusional and erratic. Kon perpetuates a sense of unease and delirium with colorfully deranged imagery, hallucinatory sequences, and sudden outbursts of insanity, keeping the audience in a state of constant imbalance. And yet there is a certain unhinged joy than comes with the madness. There is something wondrous about unconscious mind and the images it conjures; the limitless possibilities of a dream, and the hidden meanings behind those dreams. Even at their most disturbing, the surreal dreamscapes of Paprika are entrancing.\
Our protagonist, Atsuko, is cool-headed; always in control. She maintains a stern, often harsh, but logical and level-headed demeanor. She's all business, doesn't have much of a sense of humor, and little patience for the childish irresponsibility of man-child genius Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini. Or at least that is how she seems on the outside. In stark contrast is Atsuko's alter-ego, the titicular Paprika. Paprika is a free spirit, more easy going and fun than Atsuko, to the point that the two seem to be completely different people, and not just because of their differing character designs. This contrast is interesting because it shows how a person's suppressed desires can manifest in spite of (or because) their attempts to keep control over themselves. As much as Atsuko would like to think she has control over herself and everything around her by suppressing her emotions, she's only being dishonest with herself. The rest of the cast (sans Detective Konakawa), are underdeveloped, yet still likeable and interesting. Tokita adds some nice comedic relief; the two antagonists are really quite interesting, though they would have certainly benefited from more screen time.\
There is also a sub-plot involving a detective who Atsuko is treating in unauthorized sessions using the DC Mini. Here, Kon infuses Paprika with his love for movies, ironically enough through a character who claims to hate movies. Despite such claims, Detective Konakawa's dreams often are movie themed, and his strong objection to movies implies some kind of past trauma. Indeed, as the movie delves deeper into his character, it reveals he has a deep knowledge and connection to movies, but now avoids them because of unfulfilled and broken desires of his youth. The movie reveals this slowly and uncomfortably, often playing out like a therapy session, using motifs such as a reoccurring dream of a murder in a hallway which represents a case Konakawa is currently having trouble solving, or his dislike of the number 17. Konakawa's character ark also draws a interesting parallels from movies and the internet to dreams; all are places that the human subconscious can escape into. A rather meta concept, considering that you are watching a movie.\
Paprika is Satoshi Kon's most vivid and wildly imaginative work. Kon clearly let go of restraint from the deranged, ever-shifting opening dream sequence. However, that isn't to say that it is done with no finesse, quite the contrary actually. Even with the free-floating lunacy of the movie, Kon's cinematic brilliance shines through. The radical transitions from dreamscape to dreamscape, which would look awkward in less skillful hands, flow like water under Kon's direction. The imagery is dazzling (if at times unsettling), and incredibly creative, sometimes frighteningly so. The chase scene in which Paprika is being pursued by the antagonists through multiple shifting settings is a breathtaking showcase of the movie's visual ingenuity. As is the movie's crazed grand finale, which features one of the main characters growing from infancy to adulthood while absorbing another character's dreams. There are also some crafty motifs the movie implements to set mood and tone, notably the crazed parade that is assimilating all other dreams. This all comes together to create a unique controlled chaos of visual imagination that is impossible to forget. It's also worth noting that the movie has the coolest opening credits I've seen, with Paprika taking a tour of the city in a way only she can.\
The sweeping electropop soundtrack by Susumu Hirasawa is fittingly strange, but also grants the movie a sense of grandeur. The music has an odd, otherworldly texture which works very well in a movie that spends most of time roaming through the realm of dreams and human consciousness. Interestingly enough, some of the vocals were produced using vocaloid, which doubtlessly contributed to the music's strangeness. Of special note is the bouncy track titled 'Meditation Field' that accompanies the opening credits, and the bizarre 'Parade' which plays as people descend into madness or when that crazy parade of dreams shows up.\
Though sometimes a bit convoluted, Paprika is an eye-popping, cerebral extravaganza that never fails to impress and entertain. More than simply a piece of eye-candy, the movie invokes some interesting ideas about dreams and the human psyche. Both Atsuko and Konakawa illustrate some fascinating insights in how people lie to themselves or bury the unpleasant, and what repercussions that might have. Paprika is just exploding with creativity, brimming with imagery straight out of your wildest dreams, and endlessly entertaining. It's a fitting final work for a great master.\

    Title: Paprika\
Novel, Movie: Paprika is based off of the novel of the same name by Yasutaka Tsutsui, which was serialized in the Japanese women's magazine Marie Claire in 1993.\
The movie itself came out in Japanese theatres in November of 2006, and was animated by Studio Madhouse (famous for Death Note and Paranoia Agent, another one of Satoshi Kon's works) and directed by Satoshi Kon (famous for Paranoia Agent and Tokyo Godfathers).  It received a limited run in theatres Stateside in May of 2007 courtesy of Sony Pictures, and was released on DVD in November of 2007.\
Story: The story revolves around a device called the\
          \
        DC Mini, which allows psychiatrists access into their patient's dreams, which gives them a glimpse into the patient's unconscious mind and helps treatment.  One of these devices is stolen, and the researchers who worked on the project soon find themselves unable to tell the difference between reality and their dreams, which start blurring into one.  Atsuko Chiba, one of the head developers of the device, uses her alternate ego, Paprika, to dive into their dreams and try to uncover the mystery of who's screwing with them.\
In case you couldn't tell, this is classic Kon, in that it hits on being unable to tell the difference between dreams and reality, and damn, does this come through amazingly in this story.  There are points in the movie in which you are unable to tell whether you're still in the dreamworld, or in the waking world.  And the things you find in the dreamworld are several kinds of bizarre and symbolic, which is also classic Kon.\
Kon actually admits to being a big fan of the novel, as it's one of his major influences; Tsutsui was impressed by his work on Millenium Actress and approached him about an adaptation.  So this was something of a match made in heaven.  As for faithfulness ot the original novel, those who have read it (I haven't) say that Kon's adaptation is a lot less technical, and Tsutsui has expressed his approval, so I don't think there should be any worries there.\
One of the neat little touches at the end of the movie is that in the cinema in the final scene, there are movie posters for his last three major film works (Perfect Blue, Millenium Actress, and Tokyo Godfathers), and the fourth and final poster could well be a promotion for the new film he's working on (he has yet to release any details on the project).\
Art: The art for this is absofuckinglutely beautiful and bizarre.  The only way you can get an accurate sense of this is to look at the screenshots that I've included below, from the parade and a dream sequence, in that order, as I'm really unable to accurately describe the artwork in words:\
Studio Madhouse has pulled it off yet again.\
Music: Kon teams up with Susumu Hirasawa again for this, and the resulting music is amazingly haunting and beautiful as ever.  I'm a particularly big fan of the music used for the recurring parade sequence, and the ED's fairly awesome, too.\
Seiyuu: Megumi Hayashibara (famous for her roles as Faye Valentine in Cowboy Bebop and Rei Ayanami in Evangelion) plays the role of Paprika, and Satoshi Kon actually cameos in a small role.  And all the other seiyuu do an excellent job in their roles, so no issues here, as always.\
Dub: N/A, didn't see it.\
Length: Perfect, though it drags a bit at times.  Paprika clocks in at about two hours; any shorter, and it couldn't have developed things properly, and longer, and it would've gotten tedious.\
Overall: Kon at his finest.  This and Paranoia Agent are the two works of his that everyone should at least see once in their life.\

    While Paprika is very typical of Satoshi Kon's work and thus a tad predictable at times, it's still a fun, entertaining movie that does boast a few innovations.\
STORY - The merging of reality and fantasy seems to be one of the most popular themes in anime, allowing it to span over many genres and to be addressed in many different ways. The theme seems to be especially favored by director Satoshi Kon though, and many of his past works reflect this seeming obsession, including Millennium Actress and Paranoia Agent. Rather than fantasy through movies or hallucinations though, Paprika grapples with the concept of dreams and\
          \
        how they might be utilized to better understand the human subconscious for psychological therapy. Still nothing particularly groundbreaking, and even without being familiar with Kon's other works, some aspects of the story were predictable -- such as the identity of the 'true' antagonist and the idea that injuries obtained in fantasy translate into injuries in reality.\
Still, while not completely original, Kon sets up the stage for his story very, very well (as expected, I suppose), and if there is to be an example for a film with this kind of theme, then certainly Paprika could be it. The realistic and modern city setting contrasts greatly with the psychedelic dream world that's presented, which really helps drive home the theme of needing to separate and distinguish the two. The viewpoints presented by characters are believable and logic, allowing the audience to easily identify with them. Everything is perfectly paced, with events accumulating in an increasingly dramatic way towards the climax and final confrontation. Admittedly, for me, that final confrontation fell a bit short of expectations, but it was a fun ride all the same.\
Paprika also has a lovely number of subtle side-stories woven into its central plot, mostly concerning character relationships and personal development. I especially enjoyed these as they seemed to emphasize the idea of 'reality' and relationships within reality, as opposed to those in the fantasy world. This may tie more into the character section, but story-wise, it's always nice to have some lesser plots that actually do still contribute to the main idea.\
\
CHARACTERS - For the most part, Paprika's characters were very well done. Or to be more specific, Paprika's protagonists were all very well done, while its antagonists left much to be desired. Dr. Chiba and her alternate dream personality, Paprika, are excellent foils of each other and it's very interesting to see them both develop as characters, especially when the situations force them to work together. Although they are already essentially two sides of the same coin, both personalities have a depth to them that makes them even more complex while still retaining the ties to each other. That's incredibly impressive. Think of it this way, if one normal character can be considered '3-dimensional' when it obtains the right level of depth and Chiba/Paprika are actually the same person while each achieving that 3d level, then does that mean they can be considered a 6-dimensional character in the end?\
Tokita and Konakawa are also both fun characters with a good amount of personality to them. Though both may seem a little stereotypical at first glance, the situations and subsequent personality quirks are quickly explored. Both go through an introspective journey throughout the course of the movie and have intriguing relationships with Dr. Chiba (and/or Paprika), providing for uniquely entertaining interactions.\
The further we move from the main cast, however, the less depth of character there seems to be. While this is probably normal, the low number of total characters in the movie makes it a little annoying when the antagonists fall so flat. Dr. Shima is a fun little guy, but is generally a very predictable support character. Worse off though, are the Chairman and Dr. Osanai, who should not have been as easy to figure out as they were. From the moment they were each introduced, both had vibes screaming that they would eventually be revealed to the working against our protagonists. Osanai's jealousy and infatuation was difficult to sympathize with, and while the Chairman's ideas were reasonable to some extent, his crazed personality lost him credibility, making his entire plot seem cheap and cliche.\
ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Paprika is a beautiful movie. There's no disputing it. The colors are lively and vibrant, and the animation is slick and smooth. The real world is rendered perfectly with ridiculously detailed backgrounds and even more ridiculously detailed animated elements. The fantasy world is breathtaking, with even more insane details and unique elements. And when reality and fantasy come together? It's crazy just how fantastic everything looks. All the little ways they came up with to integrate to two realms was incredibly impressive -- Paprika's ability to travel through pictures on walls and televisions made for some very awesome sequences. The only real drawback to all of this is the information overload. With so many bright colors and so much movement, your eyes will probably be burning a bit when it's all over with.\
MUSIC - Paprika's score is also excellent. The theme playing at the beginning of the movie as Paprika is dancing through traffic is very trance-inducing and hypnotic, thus fitting very well with the movie's themes. The parade music for the dream sequences is also very catchy and appropriately reminiscent of real parades and circuses. There aren't very many other recognizable background themes, but those that are there are effective for the scenes they're used for, such as the haunting melodies used as the characters enter an abandoned/unknown area.\
VOICE ACTING - Though I've seen the movie several times on DVD, it's always been subbed, so I can't comment on the dub. In our original Japanese, Megumi Hayashibara is our title character and she does an awesome job giving both Dr. Chiba and Paprika distinguishable voices that are fitting to their separate personalities. The rest of the cast does not particularly stand out (probably because Hayashibara does such an amazing job), but they all play their roles well enough (to the extent that I wonder if they were merely typecasted).\
OVERALL - All in all, despite not being anything really new and despite the presence of a few annoying predictabilities, Paprika is a very well done movie that I think both newcomers and long-time fans of Kon's work can enjoy, especially if you're a fan of the whole fantasy/reality theme like me. :3\

You want me to summarize paprika in one or two sentences? Take your dog, get some colors and a big paper, let that dog run along, let him dip himself in those colors and let him do whatever he wants with that paper, Done? good, now take that paper and try to sell it on street, did it sell? No? well paint yourself and make a name for yourself and then go to a gallery and display that painting your dog made, you will soon be acknowledged as the one greatest artist ever lived. That is in the nutshell is Paprika.\
Why do directors exist? do they exist to enhance the story? or do they exist to show how good they are at directing? Should a director show off his skills while simultaneously trashing the story? Without a story, directors cannot exist and without director’s story can not be accessible. Directors job is to make the story his own and through his skill and hard work make it more effective and better. Just like music is useless without stealing listeners heart, just like an animation is useless without telling a story through animation, just like that, a director is useless without making story good and accessible. look at Erased,  It is a bad story without actually any suspense, but good music, animation, and most importantly good direction make it better than the raw story. Director can make a bad story good with sheer skill. A director is a conductor of the orchestra, no matter how good instrumentalist are if conductor sucks then performance is going to suck.\
Paprika is a mess of animation, it is a mess of music and it is a mess of characters. Paprika creates the illusion of complexity for the normal viewer who knows nothing of how illusions work, “movie feels complex so it must be good, It makes me feel smart if I like this complex movie” people with this kind of ideology may hop over it if they want to this post is not for them. There is a subtle difference between complex and complicated, complex things make sense and are enjoyable but complicated things are complicated for sake of being complicated they make no sense. Why in the end could Paprika swallow villain? why do the world of dreaming and real world merge? who the hell is Paprika anyway? Is she part of that scientist’s lady or a program? Why has villain so pitiful dream? It doesn’t make any sense. Well if someone says it shouldn’t make sense, that is the point, well then why to watch this movie, go to sleep and dream, I am sure you can have some wacky dreams, or just don’t clean you room for few month for you to not able to make sense of your room, can you live like that?\
On one hand, the movie tries to be a sci-fi, on the other hand, it tries to a philosophical movie questioning that “should human interfere in nature?”. Paprika also tries to touch phycological aspect of human life but later to all boils down to an all powerful and purely evil villain trying to the destroyed world. Paprika changes subjects faster than politicians change their statements, it just makes it a horrible mess. All respect I had about Satoshi Kon has gone down the drain, I think Satoshi Kon just want to flash his skill without regards to consistency or story. Making a scene transition every few seconds doesn’t make you a good director, making a story shine like a sun will make you a good director. Most of the time simplicity is better than complexity and complexity is always better than complicated. See ya.\

    Paprika, the last film of the late Satoshi Kon, is in a league of its own when compared to his other works—a league that is far, far below the rest. Satoshi Kon is, of course, a very talented director, and in that regard he still delivers for this film. The visuals are every bit as detailed as expected from him and his team, and the sheer amount of technical skill on display here is mind-blowing at times. Unfortunately, that's about where my praise for it ends.\
Satoshi Kon films typically take you on a psychological ride that explores its characters' inner thoughts in visually inventive ways.\
          \
        You might think that Paprika does this as well, as it would seem so at first, but the experience ends up feeling very flat by the end in spite of the film's wacky and colorful premise. The elaborate dream sequences only distract you from the fact that everything here operates on a very basic surface level. While that physiological element does exist to some extent in Paprika, it's relegated to the sidelines in favor of an uninteresting, superficial mystery plot about stolen technology featuring one-note, unlikable characters. I don't dislike this film for being confusing or for going \"over my head\" as they say; I dislike it for being astoundingly simple and straightforward. There's not much to explore and not much to think about after the film is over. Paprika delivers entertainment that's built to last for the moment and nothing more.\
But, make no mistake: the entertainment that it does provide is still very much worth experiencing just for those immediate sensations alone. The soundtrack definitely deserves a mention, as it's pretty great and the recurring themes are very strong. As for the animation, the creators are able to get away with a lot because of the film's dream setting, and with that they're pretty creative. They must have spent a lot of time discussing what sorts of things tend to happen in dreams so that they could make those sequences feel genuinely relatable. Sometimes, though, the dream elements feel gimmicky and forced, like they were thrown in to remind the viewer that the characters are, indeed, in a dream; characters will dive into television screens and paintings to travel distances that would have probably been easier to walk across. Additionally, it feels like they miss a lot of opportunities to truly mess with the viewer's perception of reality, instead making it all too clear what's really going on most of the time. \
Now, maybe Paprika just isn't trying to be some intelligent psychoanalytical film; that's fine. Maybe it could instead provide a nice cast of characters with great chemistry who drive the film forward, a la Tokyo Godfathers. However, Paprika fails to provide even that. The characters in Paprika range from underwhelming to outright irritating, with a few exceptions. Kosaku, in particular, is on the \"punchable\" side of the scale. This guy is unbelievably, impossibly, and disgustingly obese. It's played off like some kind of charming quality, and that perhaps it's what's on the inside that matters most—a touching sentiment, but unfortunately for Kosaku, he also happens to act like a literal child. Well, shit, I guess he's got no redeeming qualities no matter where you look. Did I mention that he has the most punchable face of any anime character ever?\
Even Paprika herself, despite her gorgeous character design, is deceptively dull, much like the film. Going by the title and promotional art, you might be looking forward to seeing a film featuring her as the central character. That's why you'll be happy to learn that she actually spends the majority of the time replaced by her comparatively drab counterpart, Atsuko, and receives no development of her own. In fact, there's a ton of wasted potential when it comes to both of these characters, as it's never explored why Atsuko might take on this other form in the first place, and what this duality actually means for them. It ends up feeling like the only reason this \"Paprika\" alter ego exists is for eye candy and so that we can see a cool character battling dream monsters in trippy action scenes; if that was the intention, she at least succeeded in providing that. But, with Satoshi Kon, we've come to expect a deeper meaning behind every action, and in this film the action often takes place for its own sake, feeling a little too much like a Saturday morning cartoon.\
That Saturday morning cartoon feel doesn't end there, though, as the worst of it comes from the film's villain—something that Kon's films have never featured this blatantly before, typically favoring inner conflicts over the external. This is a villain whose first lines consist of him robotically expressing his ideals, as if he'd been carefully scripting his own words, eager to recite them to the next person who'd walk into his room. By the end of the film, he'll crush your suspension of disbelief harder than any amount of surrealist dream imagery could by acting like a totally unreasonable cartoon bad guy: a comically insane person with maniacally evil plans who shouts like a baby when he doesn't get his way. To make things worse, we never learn why he feels the ways that he feels, making him an underwhelming character and a weak villain. I didn't even mention the similarly flawed supporting villain whose existence is entirely unnecessary and serves no greater purpose.\
As previously stated, Paprika does still contain a bit of Satoshi Kon's signature psychological element, and that comes in the form of side character Toshimi's plot line. Unlike other characters in the film who only seem to be concerned for their job's sake, Toshimi actually has a strong personal investment in his own arc, as he takes the initiative to find answers to the questions that haunt his dreams. You grow to care about this guy because it actually feels like he cares, too. And, for once, the dream motif is used really well to give meaningful visuals to his inner psyche—the kinds of tangible things that can actually be pulled apart to learn more about a character. But, ultimately, the problem is that Toshimi's concerns are really only his alone. They don't mesh well with the main plot at all, and when the creators attempt to mash them together the results are questionable at best. He's left with nothing to do by the climax, becoming just another bystander watching the action unfold outside of his control, having no influence on the conclusion.\
With most of the characters being as two-dimensional as they are, it's no surprise that the film's climax ends up being a thrown-together mess. Everything is resolved with actions that don't need to make too much sense, using the fact that dreams have become real as a crutch for the deus ex machina finale. There are attempts to salvage Atsuko's lack of development by introducing a romance plot that, while hinted at, feels more insulting than anything else. They were clearly and knowingly taking a risk with this particular pairing, but the necessary steps to pull it off correctly were not taken. At most, you could say that the creators were at least trying to invoke some real emotions for once, but I'd honestly rather they'd not at this point, especially when the results are this awkward. \
I don't know exactly what went wrong with the making of this film to make it stand out in such a negative way. Considering Kon's otherwise excellent track record, perhaps it's the source material that's at fault; I wouldn't know. All I do know is that Paprika, as it exists in this film, is an overall emotionless endeavor that left me wondering what the point of it all was. Regardless, I do still have a lot of respect for Satoshi Kon; he's made his fair share of masterpieces, and his contributions to the anime industry won't be forgotten anytime soon, so I suppose he's earned the right to make a few mistakes. After all, it was his willingness to take risks that brought us such great films as Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress. You can see that Paprika was made with that same level of ambition; it was just bound to fail at some point.\

    Paprika, Satoshi Kon's last film as a director, is commonly referred to as \"Inception before Inception was made\". With this kind of reputation, especially with the Kon name behind it, the expectations are going to be high when watching this movie. There is no doubt the technical aspects of this film will fulfill these expectations, however the story itself falls short.\
Paprika is surreal. From the opening credits, the film makes it clear that reality will be bent and twisted. This is where Satoshi Kon excels. Through the use of amazing scene transitions, the storytelling in Paprika keeps you guessing. These techniques work well in the\
          \
        film since Paprika is about the meshing of dreams and reality. This is the best part of the film and it deserves to be praised.\
When it comes to the story itself, not much develops. Paprika, like Inception, is a thriller that doesn't explore its themes. The premise is interesting; an experimental device used to enter dreams goes missing and it's up to Dr Chiba to retrieve it before the thief is able to abuse the device's power. For the first half of the film the search for the thief is engaging. Once the antagonist is discovered, however, the story loses focus.\
In the usual Kon style, the main theme of the film is about coming to terms with one's self. This theme is introduced early with the dual personality of the protagonist and the use of the DC Mini for psychiatric therapy. But it's never explored properly. Dr Chiba's character arc is weak with a random romance thrown in at the end and the antagonist is almost one dimensonal. The only character that appears to have a proper arc which fits in with the theme of the film is Konakawa. Due to the lack of character development and the themes of the film being unexplored, the impact of the narrative is lost. Similar to Paranoia Agent, Paprika attempts to create an epic, chaotic ending, however unlike Paranoia Agent, much less time is spent with the characters, hence this ending isn't successful.\
Nevertheless, this film should not be dismissed due to the flaws in its plot. The imagery and sound in Paprika make it entertaining to watch. The character designs all feel realistic, while the imagery in the dream sequences portray all sorts of weird and bizarre creatures. The music accompanies each scene well, contributing to the surreal feeling in the dream sequences and improving on the action. This creates a nice contrast between the scenes in the real world and the scenes in dreams.\
While this may not be Kon's strongest film, it is still worth watching. Anyone who enjoys science fiction or just trippy, surreal films in general will definitely find some enjoyment in this. But, this isn't a must watch for anime fans. There are better Kon films and better science fiction films out there to choose from. Sadly, we will never get to see if Kon could have improved from this film.\

    Paprika is actually the only thing Satoshi Kon has directed that is adapted from another medium, but in true Kon fashion he makes it no less his then any of his works. The story, adapted from the novel of the same name, is essentially just a vehicle for a bizarre vision of Kon's, inspired by the music of Susumu Hirasawa (who, unsurprisingly, wrote the soundtrack for Paprika), to create a bizarre audiovisual experience akin to that of Yellow Submarine.\
Of course, Paprika is far from a feature length music video, which is hardly surprising given its origins as a novel. The plot revolves around a device\
          \
        called the DC Mini, a device made by the eccentric, morbidly obese scientist Kosaku Tokita, that allows people to experience each other's dreams. However, the device is stolen, and starts being used to implant dreams in fully conscious people, causing them to go crazy. In effect, it's subconscious terrorism.\
The characters in this film are of a surprisingly high quality. It's not often that a single film can make a particularly memorable character, but this is a feat that Paprika manages for every member of its cast. Every one of them is memorable and well fleshed-out, and no one character takes a back seat just for the sake of the lead getting focus. The main character, Atsuko Chiba, is an uptight, stoic businesswoman, but in her subconscious dreams she takes on an alter-ego, the titular Paprika, who is essentially the complete opposite of Chiba... quirky, vibrant, and fun-loving. Toshimi Konokawa is a detective who is an early patient of the DC Mini, who asks for Paprika's help in dealing with his nightmares of a murder case. Kosaku Tokita is the aforementioned morbidly obese scientist, a man with a childlike disposition that causes him to not think through the possible repercussions of his scientific advances. The wheelchair-bound chairman (I'm not sure if this pun was intentional or not) is a stern man who believes that dreams are sacred, and that science has taken a step too far.\
One thing about this that's very much worth noting are the comparisons to recent blockbuster film Inception, and the claims that Inception ripped off Paprika. While there are some serious similarities that can be quite hard to chalk up to coincidence, most noticeably in the premise itself, and in a more specific instance the way certain characters are handled as well as a motif used to portray them (see the elevator scene in both films), neither film really comes off as worse for it. This is mostly because while the movies share similar themes, both go about it in completely different ways. While Inception runs with an airtight, professional system of rules and techniques that focus on the ways the dreams are hacked, and the ideas behind the titular technique of Inception, Paprika goes for a more surrealist, stream-of-consciousness style, blurring the lines between dreams and reality much like in previous Kon works like Paranoia Agent. As a result, while the argument that Inception ripped off Paprika does hold a fair amount of water, both films are still fantastic in their own right.\
Going back to the subject of Susuma Hirasawa for a minute, his music is an absolutely perfect fit for Paprika, as it has been in previous Kon works. He's been compared to Danny Elfman in contrast to Kon's Tim Burton, in that the two of them, when working together, manage to create a bizarre marriage of music and animation, as seen in Paranoia Agent and Millennium Actress as well. Paprika, however, is probably the ultimate example, and is sadly the last, not counting the possibility of Hirasawa working on Kon's posthumous project The Dream Machine.\
As for the other technical aspects, Madhouse deliver once again with the art. It's in the same style as Paranoia Agent, Millennium Actress and so on, and is produced to a high standard of fluid animation. The directing is unsurprisingly superb, blurring the lines of reality excellently, and creating fantastic, gleeful dreamscapes of derangedly cheerful imagery. The voice acting in the original Japanese is superb, bringing together numerous cast members of Evangelion again, and featuring a fantastic performance from Megumi Hayashibara as Chiba, and her alter-ego. The dub, while far from bad, doesn't really scale up. Cindy Robinson puts in a great performance as Paprika, but really can't cut it as her conscious counterpart Chiba. The rest of the cast, for the most part, seem very miscast. In fact, some of the performances in the dub are actually very good. In particular, Yuri Lowenthal's take on Tokita is absolutely dead-on. He captures many of the childlike nuances of his speech perfectly... and yet, his voice itself simply feels unfit to the role.\
Overall, while mostly fantastic, Paprika does have a serious flaw. In its surrealism, it loses track of the plot. Whilst the plot is mostly strong, it can become more disorienting than simply bizarre, and especially towards the ending it loses track of what was happening in the plot. It seems quite strange that this would be the case, considering the source material... which may be worth checking out, if only to explain what happened in the ending. Even after numerous viewings, I honestly couldn't explain exactly what happened no matter how hard I tried.\
Nonetheless, Paprika is something that absolutely has to be experienced because there is honestly nothing else quite like it. It's one of those rare anime that I would honestly recommend even to people who aren't anime fans. It's less in the vein of anime and more in the vein of surrealist films, but using animation in the perfect way to bring out the bizarre visions behind it.\
Final Words: Whilst not quite perfect, it's an absolute sight to behold. An absolute must-see.\

    Script - A group of sherlockian scientists are searching for a stolen macguffin technopiece that allows them to enter in patients' dreams. There's also a traumatized detective whose purpose besides participating in the artistic opening is to save the protagonist afterwards and have his struggle solved in a simplistic way because the movie was almost at the end. The antagonist is a one-dimensional anti-science old man who doesn't waste any opportunity of exposing his ideology and that also wants to merge reality with dreams because he's crazy. The heroes investigate until getting to the conclusion that was obvious to us from the start of the\
          \
        show, and after facing some real weird quasi-apocalyptical shit the protagonist defeats the villain, and they lived happily ever after. It's quite surprising that such a symbolic plot is so predictable. Don't be tense, because no problem is left unsolved and bad guys lose because good guys win. Also, accept your naughty side and assume your love for that stupidly fat man-child in one minute or less because that's the only way you'll be able to defeat the megalomaniac vile scarecrow who wants to destroy everything because yes.\
Cinematography - Good animation, very detailed scenarios inside dreams and that's it. If you like psychedelic nonsensical visuals, go for it. The character design is fine, nothing special about anything besides the effort put into it. No relation to the plot and the meaning of such visuals starts and ends in itself.\
Sound - The old scientist sounds like any old scientist you'll see in anime, the protagonist seems dead, the villain sounds like the villain since he opens his mouth, the fat dude has annoying man-child voice and the detective has a hoarse voice just like that one from Paranoia Agent. The voices don't convey anything, no fear, no concern, no shit. The soundtrack is very good, composed by that guy from Berserk and Millennium Actress, you know him. It's cool.\
1234 - Merging reality and dreams because of some machine and destroying several buildings for the evulz. Paprika exists as a manifestation of the protagonist's other side but it's never explained how she leaked out from the machine, she just exists outside of it and you deal with it. The bad guy enters in a hole in the ground and becomes a monster because yes. He hates technology wanting to enter in dreams, so he uses technology to merge both dreams and reality because yes. The romance out of nowhere because she's in love and love has no reason guys. Because the villain is a man and Paprika is a woman she sucks him, I guess it's not something chauvinistic. What happened to the city afterwards? Fuck that, I want to see both detective and old scientist talking about shit I don't care about, oh yes.\
Are you a visual fag? Do you wanna see crazy shit that doesn't owe you explanations whatsoever? Go for Paprika. Wanna see something actually good from this amazing director called Satoshi Kon? Watch all of his movies, except Paprika. Also, RIP Kon, you did your best mate.\

    Understanding is overrated. Incomprehensibility is the new clarity, and contradictions are the new consistency. Confused? Good, so am I.\
Some stories can only be enjoyed through understanding, while others must be enjoyed through experiencing. Paprika, for one, firmly falls in the second category. Comprehending Paprika on an intellectual level is comparable to nailing Jell-O to a wall: the harder a person tries, the more hopelessly confused he’ll become.\
Those familiar with Satoshi Kon’s other works (particularly Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress) should already be well acquainted with this visceral style of storytelling. Put simply, Kon’s trademark style has always been to set up his film with an\
          \
        interesting, easily understandable premise. From there, however, his films transcend into delightfully illogical chaos. One can try to connect isolated scenes from his films into a linear, understandable narrative, but the result only serves to sidestep the director’s true intentions. \
Paprika is no exception to this. Despite its engaging premise, the movie’s literal events become as intellectually inscrutable as a Teletubbies episode. Paprika falls mid-flight in its execution of the plot.  Caught in a web of its own reverie, the film loses coherence as its travels down a pipe dream of its own construction.  Although it succeeds in whisking the viewer away to an abstract landscape, several questions raised throughout the film are left unanswered.\
The animation serves as a key component to the storyline. Much of the film revolves around the dream world, and Paprika’s visuals beautifully flesh the characters’ dreams out in a way that only an animated film could do justice. The importance of the animation further deepens later on as the border between reality and hallucination becomes less and less indistinct. In the movie’s own way, Paprika is able to show this gradual merging (and the subsequent chaos) vividly.\
In terms of visuals, Paprika is nothing short of pure artistry.  Every screenshot moves like a living painting and each scene is seared into the brain.  Whimsical, and bizarre, Paprika is a feast for the eyes with its parade frenzy of drumming frogs, eerie dolls, and marching appliances.  As the line between reality and fantasy is blurred, Paprika becomes a virtual bridge between the two polar worlds.  These transition sequences are seamless and beautiful, altogether creating an imaginative flow of symbols and metaphors.\
Composed entirely by Susumu Hirasawa, Paprika’s soundtrack consists of synthesized hyper-ballads, Vietnamese chanting, and electronic techno beats.  In other words, it is the perfect soundscape for the hallucinogenic imagery offered in Paprika.  Every electronic powered track is spell-binding and creates excellent pacing that drives the animation sequences along with full force.  Notably, the film is unique in that it utilizes Vocaloid samples for its soundtrack, creating a mechanical yet organically exotic feel to the tracks.\
Sadly, most of Paprika’s colorful cast is lacking in character development and depth.  The main villain, although painfully obvious, had no bona fide motive for his malicious actions and scarcely had any progression.  Similarly, side characters were extraneous and unnecessary, especially detective Konakawa whose actions served no purpose other than to move the plot along. Although the shy, plump scientist Dr. Tokita played a larger role in the film, his character lacked some much needed development.  As a result, most of Paprika’s cardboard cutout characters served as devices to force feed the plot rather than draw us into the beautiful world it created.\
There is a glimpse of depth within Paprika herself, and her second self Chiba is just as interesting. The contrast between the charming Paprika and the icy Dr. Chiba is the most alluring aspect of her complex character.  Despite this appeal, the film sadly fails to explore it enough.  Chiba’s multiple personality disorder is too perfect of an opportunity to neglect, and her own psychological struggles should have been a pillar of the film’s plot.\
Words fail to describe the visual splendor and terror of the film’s journey into the subconscious mind. Some are going to try to push Paprika as a complex and intricately plotted intellectual exercise, while others will deride it as nothing more than a little eye-candy. In my view, the show is neither of these. The film’s entity is a dream in itself — an event to be experienced, rather than understood.\

Every character in Paprika has great personality, something you remember, everyone has their dream.\
It's magnificent, is it a persons dream or not? It's their personality and thoughts put on screen. Maybe a part of another ones dream.\
This film goes full surrealism mode and makes me as a viewer very confused at times, but still aware of what's happening on screen, a urge to jump of happiness as a colorful parade of toys and animals are marching through the streets of the city like a colorful stream bursting through my mind.\
A film as trippy and mind-fucking like Paprika is needs fitting soundtracks. That's another great thing about this one, the songs and OST couldn't be more fitting and energized.\
What's better than a fast drummer and a female vocalist in the backround? When our main character is falling through the sky at top speed, nothing beats that. It makes the viewers shit themselves of excitement!\
The visuals are absolutely stunning and the amount of detail in some of the scenes are astounding. Not to mention the edit, that would be a crime for sure. The edit is truly stunning, without the good edit this movie wouldn't be what it is. I had to guess so many times, about what was going on because you couldn't know if a character stepped out of a dream or into another. Leaving that to the viewer to find out is great.\
You create your own legit thought of what's going on.\
Kon stated that female characters were easier to write because he would'nt be able to know the character in the same way as a male one.\
I would say that he succeeded with his characters in Paprika, and i couldn't be more grateful.\
As much as i like Satoshi Kon's other films i have to say that Paprika surpassed the hype with it's thrilling and excellent written plot.\
I want to dedicate this review to Satoshi Kon himself.\
Rest in peace.\

    I wanted to love Paprika. Right from its opening scene, I was so enamored with its creative premise, and so taken with its jaw dropping animation, that I was certain that I’d be giving it a 9 or a 10. However, as the film went on, more and more flaws began to surface and in the end, beautiful as this film could be, no amount of bizarre imagery could truly obscure all the narrative problems that this film contained.\
Animation: 10  Sound: 9\
The first point I have to make is that in terms of its sound and visuals, this film is a stunner. The main\
          \
        story line focuses on the use of a ‘DC mini’, a device that allows a person to enter the dreams of another. Paprika exploits its ‘dreamworld’ premise to the max in order to create some of the most eye popping, surreal and unique spectacles ever to grace the medium of anime. The soundtrack perfectly complements the visuals and builds the atmosphere of its world. From its whimsical opening track that plays while Paprika runs through the dream world, to the ominous tune that accompanies the parade, each track is perfect at sucking you into Paprika’s world.\
Story: 2\
Unfortunately, the music and visuals were the only thing that this film has going for it, because this film is all about style over substance and was dragged down by a poorly executed story.\
The main story was supposed be a mystery thriller where the protagonists are forced to try and find and apprehend the dangerous thief who stole a DC Mini, but it was all over the place. It was full of clichés, plot twists that could be seen a mile away, character revelations that came out of nowhere and a romantic subplot  that was so out of the blue, so ham handedly handled, and so implausible that it wins the award for being the most ludicrous pairing in any medium and yes, that include fanfiction. I am used to seeing awful pairings in films, but this one was so out of nowhere that it completely pulled me out of the story and left me stunned throughout the film’s climax.\
 It felt like it was trying to do too much in a short period of time, and sadly its detective Toshimi psychotherapy subplot (which is a problem in itself; a film with a complex plot and a 1 hour 30 run time does not have the time to expend on  subplots) was more focused and engaging than its main storyline. \
Characters: 2\
All this brings me to the film’s other big problem: the bad, bad characters. With the exception of the detective, all of them were completely flat and one dimensional; the manchild inventor was little more than a tasteless fat joke, Torataro was the eccentric Doc Brown type scientist in its most derivative form, the antagonist was boring,  while the Paprika/ Atsuko character was supposed to be a conflict between a cold superego and a carefree ID, but unfortunately it was not well executed. The conflict was only really alluded to in a few dismissive sentences from Atsuko, so when it came to the inevitable confrontation between the two it felt forced and out of nowhere.\
The dialogue was also a problem, as it was trying too hard to be wacky whimsical and as a result just ended up sounding forced . Its a pity, because if this film focused on the cop subplot, and maybe explored the divide in Paprika/ Atsuko’s personality more effectively , then I would be able to give this film the score that it deserves.\
Overall: 5\
Beneath its stunning visuals, Paprika was sadly little more than a shallow, poorly executed mess. Yet in spite of its many shortcomings, this film has to be given credit. Even though Paprika failed in so many ways, the makers of this film obviously put a lot of effort into it and were willing to take risks and try something new. Personally, I would much rather watch a film that aimed high but missed the mark than see something safe and soulless with no higher aspirations than wringing money from the pockets of its target demographic.\
Although the only way I’d ever watch this film again was with the sound muted and the OST playing continuously in the background, I don’t feel like I wasted my time watching it. I would definitely recommend checking out its amazing opening and its parade scenes on youtube and, If you’re the type of person who can look past its diabolical execution and enjoy it for its gorgeous spectacle, then I whole heartedly recommend giving this a film a watch and seeing what you think for yourself.",

    Overview:\
Paprika was the final movie released by the great Satoshi Kon. This is a movie that everyone should see at least once, but not everyone will necessarily enjoy it. Paprika is a VERY surrealist movie that combines elements of science fiction with art-house cinema. Although Christopher Nolan admitted to lifting  plot elements from Paprika to create Inception, Paprika is less like Inception and far more like Kubrick's 2001 or Tarkovsky's science fiction films Stalker and Solaris. I say Paprika is much more like the latter 3 films because the focus is NOT on action and being an enjoyable \"popcorn movie\". The emphasis is on\
          \
        otherworldly visuals, human psychology, and using surrealism as a vehicle to ask rather profound philosophical questions. Paprika is a very cerebral movie and to fully appreciate it, you may even have to watch it more than once. The trippy visuals come so fast and furious that it is easy to miss key details in its rather complex and convoluted plot. This is one of those classic \"What the FUCK did I just watch?!\" kind of movies. Paprika is one of those movies that you actually have to watch without constant distractions and chatting to other people. It isn't what I would consider \"light\" viewing in other words. \
Plot: 8/10\
Minor spoilers!\
The plot is that in the future a machine is created that allows people to see into other people's dreams and project themselves into that person's dream. This machine is used by psychologists to resolve internal conflict and often shed light on subconscious problems that the patient is suffering. This of course was inspired by Freud's theory that dreams are the gateway to the subconscious mind and act as symbolic wish fulfillment of the desires we are unaware we have. However, someone starts sabotaging the project, apparently out of a desire to protect the sanctity of dreams from the prying eyes of men. Dreams are one of the last places we can escape without being viewed and judged after all. Then all hell breaks loose and the machine starts merging reality with the dream world for...some reason. Paprika is so surreal it makes End of Evangelion look tame by comparison! This is Eraser head level insanity. Ultimately the villain and his true motives are revealed and the plot is resolved with a surprisingly mundane ending. It is quite the journey to get there though. The idea of using dream invasion as a form of therapy and changing the way a person thinks is a very interesting concept. However, Paprika is more than just a high concept piece revolving around a single cool idea. It is the use of classic psychological theory, engaging characters, and tendency to NOT hold the audience's hand that took it from merely a good film to a truly great film.\
Characters: 8/10\
The main character is the psychiatrist Dr. Atsuko Chiba, who wishes to use the machine to help her patients even though it is not exactly legal at this early stage of testing. She is a strong willed protagonist who doesn't succumb to the usual cliches and traits that leading women in anime too often suffer from. Chiba's alternate persona is the more light and playful Paprika, whose form she takes when she is in the dream world. Paprika is in many ways a polar opposite of the cold and introverted Chiba, which of course is referencing Jung's archetype of the the Shadow. Paprika is cheerful and bubbly because she is everything that Chiba has repressed to pursue a career as a doctor/scientist and be taken seriously in a highly patriarchal society. Paprika represents the hidden aspects of Chiba that she has rejected and stored away. The other main character is Kosaku Tokita, who is an obese manchild that is also perhaps the world's most brilliant scientist. He is often treated poorly despite his intelligence and represents how every geek fears that society views them. However, Tokita develops as a character along with Chiba and isn't simply there to be a boring stereotype. Paprika is too good a movie for that to be the case.\
Art: 10/10\
Although the plot, characters, and psychology is very well done, Paprika is perhaps above all else a visual experience. Paprika was originally a novel, but watching the film is very different from reading the novel. Sometimes being animated is a great disadvantage, because people will take a serious live action film FAR more seriously than an animated version of the same film. However, there are some advantages that animation gives and Paprika is one of few anime that fully exploits all that animation has to offer when it comes to conjuring up nightmarish imagery and frenzied insanity, bursting at the seams with energy and sheer chaos.\
Overall: 9/10\
Paprika is a film that really isn't like too many other films I can think of. It does bare a resemblance as I mentioned earlier to other brainy, science fiction/art films, but how many of those are animated? Paprika is a unique enough film and good enough film to warrant the label of \"essential viewing for all film lovers\".\

    Critic’s Log - Earthdate: December 1, 2013. Review #74: Paprika.\
\
It’s been a while since I last had a dream and I really don’t know why. I actually like having dreams when I am asleep. Well anyway…Dreams can even influence ideas for movies and that is not a bad method for using your imagination if you are the creative type. Hell, Christopher Nolan’s film Inception was about going within a dream within a dream within a dream. Talk about complicating. Anyway, the final dream that Satoshi Kon completed is Paprika. Sometime in the near future, a revolutionary new psychotherapy treatment called PT has been invented. Through\
          \
        a device called the \"DC Mini\" it is able to act as a \"dream detective\" to enter into people's dreams and explore their unconscious thoughts. But...Before the government can pass a bill authorizing the use of such advanced psychiatric technology, one of the prototypes ends up being stolen, sending the research facility into an uproar and panic. In the wrong hands, the potential misuse of the device could be devastating and disturbing, allowing the user to completely annihilate a dreamer's personality while they are asleep. Renowned scientist, Dr. Atsuko Chiba, enters the dream world under her exotic and beautiful alter-ego, code name \"Paprika,\" in an attempt to find out who is behind the plot to sabotage the new invention. To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse which means that this movie is promised high production value. And this movie damn well shows it. The visuals look dreamy which is fitting but the animation looks amazing as well as some of the extra detail. This film is well detailed and the amount of imagination in designs in huge in this movie during the dream sequences. The character designs are just as great as Satoshi Kon’s masterpiece Millenium Actress except this is years later and the animation is gorgeous and it really shines in this movie. It is by far the best part of the movie. The music by Susumu Hirasawa is also a terrific score. The main theme is catchy and most of the background music is often eerie which is great because it invokes the feeling of a nightmare which is what fits this movie. The music even fits during the dream sequences too. What is significant about Paprika is that it was the first movie to use a program called “Vocaloid” and it’s pretty effective in this movie. Susumu Hirasawa does not disappoint with the soundtrack and it compliments the movie greatly. Like some of his previous work, he knows how to make the music work in the anime shows or movies he has a part in. When voice acting is concerned, the Japanese casting is excellent. Megumi Hayashibara is terrific as Atsuko Chiba, Akio Ohtsuka is also terrific as Konokawa. Tohru Furuya is pretty good as Dr. Tokita. Katsunosuke Hori is great as Dr. Shima, and Koichi Yamadera is terrific as Dr. Osanai. A noteworthy performance is Satoshi Kon as Mr. Jinnai. Yeah, Kon-san decided to have a little part in this. Which is nice. As with the dub. It is a bit hit and miss. Cindy Robinson is actually pretty good as Atsuko. Paul St. Peter is okay as Konokawa. David Lodge is tolerable as Dr. Shima. Doug Erholtz is great as Dr. Osanai, but Yuri Lowenthal is a little off at times or even out of character from the original intent. I don’t get to hear Yuri Lowenthal all that much in anime dubs and he does alright from time to time. This is one of the roles where he doesn’t really shine. I’ll give him credit for not being unbearable in the dub but he’s a bit hit and miss in this one. The dub is tolerable but if you want better casting, stick with the Subtitled Version on this one. The characters are well-written enough to the point that it’s good enough for the movie. Atsuko is an interesting character and she is a bit interesting. It is nice that her “Paprika” side is more fascinating than Atsuko herself and that I was questioning at first. As the movie progresses, she actually does develop well. Dr. Tokita may be a big guy, but he his a genius (according to this movie) He’s alright for the most part. Dr. Shima is great throughout the movie with his attitude and personality. Konokawa was an interesting case because he didn’t like movies, which I don’t mind but I always found that interesting about him. Then there’s Dr. Osanai who is great along the way, but not what you would expect. The characters aren’t really timeless, but at least they make the dream feel real. Then there comes the story which won’t be easy for me to talk about. I could say that the animation and visuals are the most important part of this movie, but I can’t. I simply can’t. The concept of the movie is what made this movie so interesting as well as it being such a spectacle. Even though it is such a visual feast, you really got to pay attention to this one because it is complicating yet the progression is simple. The mind-fragging visuals do deceive the eye very well unless you are very observant. And this is the most powerful aspect of Paprika and by far what makes this movie work. The story has a few twists and it has a solid plot, however the story isn’t perfect. The Chairman wasn’t as fully developed and he get’s much less screentime than the others. Regardless of all this, Paprika is a unique film that even Christopher Nolan was inspired by this movie when he made the movie Inception which is ten times far more confusing and complex than Paprika and requires full attention while Paprika is a spectacle and can be understood to a degree. Paprika does not sacrifice substance with style, there is a good blend of fantasy with reality in this one, and Satoshi Kon’s final film in his life was one hell of a dream. Keep on dreaming Satoshi Kon. Rest in Peace. \
\
Paprika is available by Sony Pictures Classics.\
With all that said, Paprika is a very creative film with amazing animation and imaginative visuals, and a dreamy soundtrack that compliments the movie greatly. Its characters are well-written and the story is unique but has a few hiccups. I strongly recommend this movie if you liked Satoshi Kon’s previous work and if you want to find something unique that can only be achieved in animation and in film. This is a dream worth having. \
\
I give Paprika a 8.7 out of 10. it is VERY GOOD!\

    This movie dazzles with high-quality graphics: great animation and charadesign. The main theme of dreaming is perfectly highlighted thanks to a rich color palette and a musical environment which perfectly fit.\
It's all about dreaming. The dreams are seen as an escape to the constraints of reality which reach their maximum in big cities like Tokyo for instance; gathering more and more people, and forgetting them sometimes (cf. Tokyo Godfather), with their dreams too. These forgotten dreams are represented in the movie by this psychedelic parade processing to who knows what destination.\
Every character of the story are associated with particular constraints: having lost one's legs (the\
          \
        president of the research center), not moving easily because of one's overweight (the genius Tokita), not being able to free oneself from inner demons (the policeman), every time suppressing ones own feelings (Atsuko). What would occur then if the dreams of oppressing beings became true. We would assist to a huge surge of nonsense, a multicolor mixture of everyone's dreams and phantasms. The end of the movie may be a bit hasty, but aren't all the dreams ending like that?\
Satoshi Kon gives here a wonderful work in all respects, both in the technical and figurative processes.\

    The general lack of cohesiveness in Paprika`s story is usually enough to ruin most movies; make them disaffecting. The premise alone, a scientific breakthrough that threatens humanity in a practical and spiritual way is kind of tired. Who hasn`t seen terminator or the matrix? The disappointingly nonsensical climax and the general lack of inspiration in the plot, evidenced by its contrived and predictable plot twist, doesn`t help its case.\
Paprika makes a few social observations, but calling it insightful would be a bit of an exaggeration. There are a couple of nods to the ills of society, from shut ins to greedy politicians. There are a\
          \
        couple of one liners that hypothesize about the nature of dreams, all of which you can easily dismiss with a wiki search on the subject or a psych 101 book. To be fair, the social commentary is a small part of the movie, and you`re never bogged down with long, faux-science/philosophy discussions on dreams or the flaws of humanity. Thankfully, they`re short.\
The soundtrack is most simply described by the word \"hectic\". The opening piece sounds a bit like techno, but there are all kinds of instruments and chants in the background. It`s reminiscent of the opening theme from Paranoia Agent (and I believe they`re done by the same artist). Lively pieces like this are sparsely scattered about, along with equally hectic tracks that seem to be inspired by circus music. You know, with cymbals and percussions blasting all over the place. There`s also liberal usage of nonsense sounds like ringing, or a fuzzy, static-y noise, which add a little creepiness to the scenes. The soundtrack of Paprika is certainly noticeable, and it fits with the vibrant and beautiful animation in such a way that every scene the soundtrack touches, it elevates.\
While a satisfying and engrossing story is usually what makes a film memorable, in Paprika`s case, it doesn`t need to be more than the sum of its parts. Paprika is filled with several memorable scenes that evoke a wide range of emotions. The protagonist`s travels through the dreams of others is filled with innocent and whimsical charm. The childlike imagination pervades the whole movie, but while it is cute in some instances, the same seemingly innocent themes and images can be chilling in others.\
The negatives with Paprika start with its story. There is a romantic element and a mystery surrounding a side character`s past that function as subplots. The problem is, both of these subplots are never worked into the movie smoothly because they have very little relation to the central story. It`s jarring and awkward whenever the movie seemingly comes to a halt in order to develop either of these elements. I can`t say that they aren`t interesting though. It`s a sad fact, but the central plot is just so devoid of creativity that these subplots happen to be the most interesting parts of the story. Paprika`s story is not only simple, in a very \"been there, done that\" sort of way, but it fumbles the climax as well. Beyond the fact that the climactic events are a bit nonsensical, there`s just never any urgency, or tension conveyed. \
My criticism of Paprika finishes with its characters. The only vaguely nuanced character is the main character, Chiba, and her alter ego after whom the movie is named. The other characters are there for little reason other than spouting supposedly thought provoking dialogue and monologues. This is especially bothersome because the main villain is also just a lecture machine. Supporting characters are usually simple in any movie, but they are particularly disaffecting here because their relationships with each other have very little depth. This means there`s very little tension of any sort between characters. Even the romance feels slapped on because throughout the movie, there was no romantic tension to speak of between the two characters involved.\
As much as I`m complaining about it, I was still touched by the one romantic scene. This is exactly why all the flaws of Paprika can be overlooked. Despite the lack of tension built up by the plot or characters, the scenes themselves, given that most of the movie takes place within dreams, are limited only by the imagination of the creators. There is all kinds of creativity in the scene direction and plenty of details to pique so many different emotions; from a skincrawling kind of discomfort to the warm and fuzzies of romance. Ultimately, this makes Paprika enjoyable, perhaps even memorable.\

    Right, I feel like I should state two things: this is my first review, at least on MyAnimeList; and there are no spoilers in it.\
'Paprika' follows Dr. Chiba Atsuko, a psychiatrist who, through a recently invented and innovating device that allows her to enter her patients' dreams, treats them on a subconscious level transforming herself into her read haired alter ego Paprika once inside their minds. Several prototypes of said artefact are stolen, and Atsuko alongside Paprika find themselves, or should I say herself, involved in a quite complicated and bizarre adventure that, however dangerous, may repair her spirit.\
It's one of those films you recommend\
          \
        only to people you know are interested in the subjects it implicates, in this case the mind, dreams, human consciousness and strong, Alice-In-Wonderland-type visual impact. It is definitely not a movie for close minded people or audiences that are accustomed to mediocre Hollywood cinema.\
It's not an easy one to watch, but if one is able to effortlessly digest its complex cinematography, whose already mentioned visual impact is accurate only due to the brilliant realism of the animation, the story, however philosophically powerful and plot-twisty, should not be a problem to process, since the symbolic meaning of each event is presented to the spectator quite digested and explicit, unlike films such as 'End Of Evangelion' or 'Akira'.\
Where the movie excels is in its characters. It contains personalities whose ideals are antagonistic but both valid and worth considering. And it is there, in the triggering of a dilemma in the viewer regarding the psychological profile of each character, where the social critique and main moral message lie and where the director truly succeeds.\
If you haven't seen it but are planning on doing so, expect lots of psychology, science fiction, psychedelic awesome art, suspense and of course a great end; which may question all the previous.\

    Being original is one thing, but being bizarre is a whole another thing. Satoshi Kon’s Paprika is a movie that walks the tightrope, often dangerously tittering over the latter side, but somehow manages to pull it off.\
Based on a 1993 novel of the same name, Paprika is set in the near future where a device called the DC Mini enables a person to enter another’s dreams. Created with the intention of aiding psychotherapy, the DC Mini is stolen and the thief utilizes it to annihilate the dreamer’s personality. The only one person who can retrieve it and prevent dreams and reality from merging is Paprika,\
          \
        the alter-ego of the co-creator of the DC Mini. Can Paprika and her eccentric crew manage to save the world from the impending doom?\
Paprika’s story is definitely not its strong suit. While the legendary anime filmmaker, Kon, has attempted to create a masterpiece by focusing on the concept of parallel “realities”, the story was given very little importance and it came out of the oven a half-baked and rather crude package. I accept that the plot did have its occasional awe-inspiring moments, but they were too little and too late into this 90 minute feature. But that’s not to say that this movie is boring. On the contrary, Paprika is very entertaining and it manages to keep you engaged. It never deviates and always focuses on the retrieval of the DC Mini. No unnecessary character flashbacks, no slapstick humor and last but definitely not the least, no dull moments. There is nonstop action and as conventional as the backdrop maybe, it’s still a lot of fun. \
The ridiculousness and irrationality of the plot is what stops you from walking out on this anime halfway. Where else can you see a man escaping a cage in a circus, then falling into a forest, then grabbing a vine to swing through like Tarzan, then slipping into a train where he is strangled by a man, beats him up and finally manages to run into a deserted warehouse, all in 30 seconds? \
When Inception, the Hollywood flick, came out, otaku around the globe were quick to correct people on how Inception wasn’t completely Chris Nolan’s original idea, but was actually ripped off from an anime called Paprika. After watching both the movies, I have to say that Inception does bear some shocking similarities, the most notable being the actual concept of using a machine to enter a person’s dream and the infamous elevator fight scene, but otherwise, these two movies are worlds apart. While both movies have the same concept, Inception was more of a man’s struggle to place an idea inside a victim, Paprika was more about retrieving a stolen device to prevent its cataclysmic effect on the world.  Paprika is also quite a disturbing film, containing visuals that range from horrifying to nightmares-for-a-week. But then again, what do you expect when you combine schizophrenics, dreams and a catastrophic device?\
The presentation is the best I’ve ever seen in an anime. Period. Rich in color and subtle in lighting, Paprika hits the nail on the head with its astoundingly smooth animation. The reason why this movie was so well received in the West was probably because of its striking artwork, which stands out compared to the high-cost 3D works of Pixar and the like. The music was flawless and the OP had a nice beat to it. Overall, this movie is a technical masterpiece and one that the storyboard artists can proudly put on top of their resumes. \
Paprika combines the randomness of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, the shock value of Baccano! and the creativity of Kon  (Tokyo Godfathers, anyone?) and sugarcoats it with the anime industry’s best animation so far. Sadly, the movie is dragged down by an average story and an absurd plot, which is at times more insane than it is creative and ultimately, that is where this movie failed to make the top cut.\
[ THE WRAP-UP ]\
Paprika is just one of those movies that you will remember for a long time to come, not because of its quality, but because of its innovation. The story could’ve definitely been better and the plot occasionally relies on shock value to keep the viewer engaged. But guess what, it’s a lot of fun and one hell of a ride! Confusing and perplexing as the anime maybe, it is the wackiness and the “Kon touch” that keeps you entertained the entire time. The animation is, hands down, the best I have ever seen and the BGM fits in well. Paprika is a great movie, as long as you don’t expect something very logical or meaningful – it’s just 90 minutes of pure entertainment. As the title suggests, Paprika is quite a spicy one. \
~I would also like to take this moment to pay homage to the director, Satoshi Kon, who passed away in early 2010 due to pancreatic cancer. I’m surely he will never be forgotten by any of us. Thank you for all the wonderful films – Arigatou Gozaimasta, Kon-sensei. ~\

    Satoshi Kon’s final work Paprika is a colourful, energetic and surreal trip. It’s a film that asks us ‘what is reality?’ and for the most part does a great job of exploring the relationship between dreams and the real world. Filled to the brim with remarkable visuals from Madhouse, a good level of story complexity and even some commentary on the topic of cinema itself, it’s a big love letter to industry. While Paprika is a visual feast and directed with great attention to detail, it’s a shame that the story sacrifices clarity for surrealism at moments when questions need to be answered. The story\
          \
        contains a mix of ideas touching on ethics, discovering one’s purpose and what defines reality. Some of these ideas get ditched and others explored in greater detail, but the end result is still a very memorable film.\
Our story follows Atsuko Chiba who uses newly created technology without permission, which allows people to share dreams, to help patients with stress in the form of an alter ego Paprika. Trouble starts when versions of the device with no security fall into the wrong hands. This would allow the culprit to enter the dreams of others and cause untold amounts of deeply rooted psychological damage, even enough to destroy one’s psyche. \
I found myself actually drawn more towards the story of detective Toshimi Konakawa and his attempt to understand why his dreams are affecting him deeply at a psychological level. He is without a doubt the most deeply explored character, as one of Chiba’s patients. His attempt to overcome the unsolved case at his job is starting to toy with his mind and his past becomes caught up in these thoughts. Every time his dream came to the fore I was captivated. I thought the payoff for his journey was slightly underwhelming. Yet at the same time I knew the ending was only appropriate things take the direction they do considering the themes of the film - hiding our true feelings and creating a new reality so we don’t have to face the other one.\
It’s only appropriate that our main character Chiba be the one to best represent the idea of discovering one’s true self. While the film initially posits Paprika as a façade for her to treat others you start to question whether her fake persona is actually a better representation of her true self – someone more free spirited and approachable. While the internal struggle isn’t as plainly laid out for the viewer to see compared to Konakawa, it’s definitely there. Kon’s clever direction goes a long way to achieving this. From the repetitious use of glass to mirror Chiba’s other side of herself or the almost unnoticeable cut between reality and dreamscapes, it all works. Chiba herself isn’t actually that interesting of a character at face level, though that’s quite intentional. She has a cold demeanour, exuding this barrier of defence around herself. Paprika acts as a means to express her repressed emotions. As a collective, the two more are complete and fulfil what the other lacks.\
On my main criticism: Paprika as a film does little to explain the boundaries and the rules of its world and instead lets the film play out as an ‘experience’. Even the exposition of the movie isn’t clear at first. Though this lends to being entertaining it hinders the exploration of its themes. Something being intentionally difficult to understand without giving us an explanation doesn’t instantly make something amazing, it can be infuriating. While I actually like the idea of figuring things out for yourself and applying your own interpretation to things, there’s some cases where we need boundaries explained. This is one of those cases, in a film blending technology and the subconscious. The film’s ending actually starts to go against our understanding of reality and I just took it as one of those things I’ll have to accept. It actually reaches a point of absurdity that took me out of the experience. On top of this, the antagonist isn’t that interesting and gives the grand finale an underwhelming amount of impact. \
On the topic of visuals, a much more positive point, I rarely see animation so good that I actually find myself saying ‘wow’ as I’m watching it. There are so many moments full of warped transitions, literal world-bending scenes that are breathtaking. Kon loves flow between scenes. His scene transition here was at master-level. It keeps the film dynamic and does a great job of keeping you engaged. The opening credits scene in particular is one of the most memorable moments which showcase this fluidity to Kon’s direction. If you’re also looking for a movie that utilises repetition well then this is the one for you. It allows to see several things, such as how far our characters have overcome their psychological problems or seeing things in our dreams that makes us reflect upon reality. \
Paprika is a must watch. Story-wise it may get a bit too big for its own boots but it’s the perfect example of the journey sometimes being worth more than the destination.\

    \"Paprika\" is a visually stunning movie, and is one that I plan on watching again. Its psychedelic and surrealist dream art create a vibrant and exciting atmosphere. It has left me speechless. If I could give the \"Art\" category more than a \"10\", I would. \
My only qualm with this piece were the characters. The characters, although not the main focus, aren't personally relatable or exciting (save the main female scientist). I wish that the story and character development was as dynamic and interesting as this work's visuals.  \

I recommend this movie to those who appreciate art, especially\
          \
        those who like Surrealist, Psychedelic, and mild Guro. It is also good for those who are familiar with the dreamscape (vivid dreamers), as well as those who are sentimental.\

    'Paprika is an anime that aims high.'\
The first thing that struck me when I first heard of Paprika was the setting by which the plot evolved. It had dreams, consciousness and what defines reality as the basis for its story. I thought that most of these questions had been explored to exhaustion by many other anime and that this was going to be another one of many. I couldn't be more wrong.\
I'll start from bottom to top. The soundtrack, praise to Susumu Hirasawa, stands on its own as a remarkable composition of music, unique in style and very well placed in the anime. It is\
          \
        very unusual, most of the instruments it uses you won't be recognizing and does well with voice distortion making it an enjoyable out of ordinary experience.\
Well drawn, Paprika relies heavily on the visuals of the movie. The dialogues aren't very well executed and often are kept simple and direct, leaving the subtleties of philosophical questions, to the drawing and animations. \
Every frame inside the realm of dreams (which you will keep questioning yourself whether it is or not) is well thought, and generally, every small object is full of symbolism. It is well polished, colourful, varied and will make it for a good experience as well.\
After I praised the two strongest characteristics of Paprika, lets delve into the other equally important aspects, story line and character development.\
As mentioned earlier, Paprika starts with a great premise: a device that allows whoever who uses it, to connect and explore the subconscious and dreams of other people. The movie starts when it is found out that someone outside the scientific research team has access to one of the devices. It then introduces different characters amongst which is the alter ego of the woman protagonist, Paprika which tries to find out whom it is. A psychological police trial, one could say. \
The story is fast paced and doesn't leave any holes in it. However at the end, it may leave on you a feeling that more could of been done and that the ending was somewhat rushed.\
Summing up, Paprika was a good surprise in many aspects, it could of been better, but stands amongst the crowd of many by trying to do something different. Recommended.\

    I’ve watched Paprika many times as it is one of my favorite movies. Paprika is a movie directed by Satoshi Kon and its music is made by Susumu Hirazawa. Those two working together is a great combination. Satoshi’s way of expressing creativity and portraying a dream world is al translated into music when Hirazawa made the soundtracks. It all fits together.\
The movie is about a scientist called Chiba, who works in a psychiatric medical center where she sercretly treats her patients with a machine that enables her to enter the dream of a patient. This machine called the DC-mini is stolen and some person uses\
          \
        it to mess with the dreams of his victims trapping them in a nightmare they cannot wake up from. Chiba enters the dreams of het patient as her alter ego, a girl called Paprika. Paprika is almost the exact opposite of Chiba.\
One outstanding part of this anime is its art. All the backgrounds are so detailed and well made. Some parts of the background are looking almost photorealistic. Next to that, there’s also an incredible amount of detail in everything. The parades in the movie are so detailed the only way to seeing everything is pausing the movie. In the end of the movie the real world and the dream world are mixing together. This is well done to the point you can’t tell the dream world and the real world apart. The psychedelic effects in this movie are done very well. My least favorite aspect of the art in this movie would be the way the characters are drawn. Even though they fit into the whole movie, my personal preference would be to draw the characters a little bit more cartoony, even though they are drawn very fitting for the type of movie, but that’s probably something personal.\
Like I said before the music in the movie is also very outstanding. Sometimes it’s just as chaotic as all that’s on screen, yet it’s still pleasant to listen to. Soundtracks like “parade” capture the greatness of the parade in the movie, while a soundtrack like “A drop filled with memories” shows the movies tenderness.\
The characters are also well done. They all have their individual struggles and flaws, and seem realistic. They all have their own way of dealing with their struggles. For instance, Tokita, a genius whose way to deal with stress is just to eat as much as he can. (as he says in the movie “I can’t fight terrorists on an empty stomach.”) I’d say the least realistic character would be Paprika. She seems to be an overly happy teenage typical anime girl. But hey, she literally is a girl of your dreams. Also, jealousy is a feature that drives the characters, which is making them quiet human. Also, the development of these characters is done quite well. They gradually become more self-loving and accepting.\
The story of this movie is also very interesting. The way the real world and the dream world are connected is a unique feature to this movie. Also, the way the characters behave seems realistic and they are easy to relate to. Everything in this movie is not what it seems to be. That’s for the characters, the story but also the visuals. ",

    Prior to anything, let's just take a moment to appraise the unmatched ability of Kon to play with one’s mind tactfully, uninhibitedly, preposterously. \
You’ve got to admit how Satoshi loves to play riddles and run through mazes unbridled. And it begins just as the opening sequence commences, taking us through years via a short leap off a rollercoaster. However the ride wasn’t as enthralling as I hoped it could be, but I’ll put down something sort of a review to appreciate how Kon admixes reality with illusion to create a surreal world.  \
Paprika. \
Dreamcatcher, dream reader, dream narrator. \
The concept of dreaming and dreaming\
          \
        as a concept has always fascinated me beyond bounds. I’ve always wondered if I could live the dream, yes, lucid dreaming is closest to that. Then appears DC Mini, which liquidates the confinement where dreams are restricted from reality, and offers wild navigation and activity. Offering this implausible invention to aid in psychiatry, Dr Atsuki along with others connect several minds to the device. Just like the invalidity of light without dark, there’s no thrill if one doesn’t breach the sanctum of rules. And henceforth, the story unfolds in its realm proper when you flinch in apprehension as the Chief actualizes the brainstorm journey into the world of ballyhoo and caprice, throwing himself out the window. \
The story line seems a bit chaotic at times, Reality warps into dreams and dreams get engorged by cacophony, merging and personality swaps, steering from one scene to another. The fact that the device can distort a dreamer’s personality sets ablaze one’s repressed desires. \
“The conceit of the daydreams residents is what the nightdreams resident want.” \
The device engulfs the city at the end collective everyone’s dreams which coalesced into a huge delusion. Pinched and provoked.\
The plot isn’t appealing enough to substantiate gravity and is entirely dependent on its stellar imagery. All brownie points are earned by brilliant execution of the setting.\
Characters are objectively bland and lacklustre. The only one who can tickle your fancy slightly is Dr Tokita, the fat-arse genius with the child of a mind, creator of DC-Mini. The villain doesn’t let anything to forebode. Even the two-into-one entity couldn’t upgrade him from one dimension. Ended up being an old school monster of any random shounen lacking depth and maturity. The forced feel-good romance was as meh as it could be.\
Music isn’t remarkable. Inputs some peppy jams. However pretty much liked the opening sequence. \
Art and character designs on the flip side are fresh and crisp, with pliable and fluid animation making it the other strongest suit of the movie. The use of colours are well justified. Daydreams being vibrant, while nightmares are depicted with shades of grey. \
Withal, the movie holds a message, though vague but interpretative. \
Dreams are sacred and to intrude upon them in any form is committing a sacrilege. \
“The dreams are horrified that their safe refuge is destroyed by technology. In a world of inhumane reality, it is the only human sanctuary left.” \
Dreams are to be left untouched, unsullied and pristine. It is a temple for our vulnerable minds. \
For at the end of the day, “Science is nothing but a piece of trash before a profound dream.”\

    This movie is amazing. Thats that. Its thought provoking, riveting and definitely keeps you on the  edge of your seat. Its just a great movie from a great writer and an amazing director. One thing though that I would like to mention that doesnt seem to have been touched on...is the soundtrack for the movie. All of the music is original pieces by Susumu Hirasawa, who, in my opinion, is quite possibly the greatest composer in the world, definitely up there with Williams and Elfman. I recommend that anyone who sees or buys this movie to GET THE SOUNDTRACK. The opening theme 'Mediational Fields'\
          \
        will make you want to drive 5000 miles an hour down a highway, the rest of the soundtrack triggers so many emotions...its amazing. When I first heard the music..i literally had tears in my eyes. It was just perfect. So, overall, an amazing movie with an equally amazing soundtrack.\

    Hello and welcome to my completely objective metric based review of Paprika. In this I'll be judging the work of Satoshi Kon and Yasutaka Tsuisui on completely a completely rational, numerically justified set of catergories\
- Characters\
- Plot\
- Art\
- Music\
Characters (8/10)\
 I thought that the constant struggle between the free-spirited Paprika and the cool Atsuko, as well as Atsuko's stormy romance with the man-child-genius Tokita really served to ground the show in a distinctly realistic and mature way. It comments on human identity and our deeply pent-up desires and our need for dreams to mediate between those desires and our conscious minds. I thought that the\
          \
        characters were loveable and vibrant and served to fulfill their numerical criteria to the extent that I gave this category an 8.\
Plot (2/10)\
The subversive nonstandard fragmentary dreamlike plot does not have a tight linearity that befits all the other plots for works that I love so I must give Paprika a 2 for that on the basis that plots must be justified in some objective set of criteria and function, ergo the 3 unities of Aristotle.\
Art (10/10)\
This is where the show really shines in a way that needs to be justified by numerical criteria. The sheer imagination of Satoshi Kon deserves a 10/10 scale because the way it was so imaginative allowed it to fulfill the objective rational criteria of exactly what an anime should be. And as seen from the fact that countless other 'imaginative' and oneiric pieces like the works of Miyazaki and Kyousogiga are also highly rated then clearly my metric must contain this aspect of 'imagination' as a fulfilling criteria. Thus logically the art must receive a 10/10.\
Sound (5/10)\
My music-based metric indicates that I don't find the music particularly attractive outside the context of the work. Since objective numerical criteria needs to separate the work into distinct component parts and judge them on their own basic individual merits then I don't think I should allow the Sound aspect of the work to be numerically justified. Rationally I gave this a 5.\
Overall (9/10)\
Numerical criteria aside the fact of the matter is that Yasutaka Tsuisui has been one of my favorite authors ever since I came across his short story collection Salmonella Men on the Planet Porno, his novel Hell and his other short story collection cum novel The Maid. Tsuisui has always been half a Kafka and half a Freudian. His stories generally are about the detritus of the human spirit and he has been the most edifying writer of humiliations; raw humanity without any romantic ornamentation other than exaggeration and laughter (the tools of Swift or Rabelais). Rumours about me for example is about a businessman that suddenly receives massive startling scrutiny from the media for no apparent reason at all. They hide in the cupboards and take notes on the amount of times he masturbates per day and what small things he eats. Its a witty commentary on the idea of 15 minutes of fame, on tabloid press, and on the small little humiliations that exist in our private life. Salmonella Men on the Planet Porno is about a utopian planet whose ruling principle is sex and erotic desire as opposed to war and aggression. The Maid is a series of stories about a psychic maid who can see into the heads of her various owners. Naturally, befitting Tsuisui's cynically satiric worldview, their heads are full of nothing but pent up lust, unjustified angers, and futile thoughts. Even his lightest and friendliest work, the Girl who Leapt through Time, is about using a device like jumping back in time to undo the small little mishaps of the day. Tsuisui has always been about placing an exaggerated focus on our small desires, our meager betrayals, our silent disgusting thoughts and our banality as human beings. In a way his works can be spiteful, vibrant, as well as touching in some cases.\
Paprika, being about dreams, is the most consciously Freudian of all his works. He raises everything beyond its size here. His is a madman's Tlon, a carnivalesque outburst of different cultural symbols and subconscious imagery that Satoshi Kon masterfully paints together into a cohesive picture. Paprika speaks a language that we never quite grasp but we feel enthralled always. Furthermore the art never feels like gorgeous ornamentation in the same vein as Madoka but always has a grounding in being just a bit uncanny and despicably human.\
Satoshi Kon has a mentality that syncs with Tsuisui about essential human detritus as well as humanity's constant and joyfully endearing nature amidst the trash heap. Tokyo Godfathers is about the light-hearted troubles of a series of the lowest denominator of human society. Perfect Blue is about the dark terrifying truth of the openly pretty and pure pop-idol culture. Paranoia Agent is entirely about the constant need humans have to escape from modern alienation and various other small troubles rather than confronting these things face to face. The only most openly romantic of Kon's work is Millennium Actress, being a complete homage to the idea of film and its best qualities as well as being a tightly made love story.\
Apparently Tsuisui's Bianca Overstudy project is still underway. A light novel about biology and semen. For those who only know him through Paprika and The Girl who Leapt through Time this may seem like a complete twist from nowhere. People who have no idea about his other works think its some kind of ecchi show capitalizing on the market for such shows.  For those who have already been indoctrinated in the darker side of Tsuisui's mad world, this is a battle cry from the master depicter of the insignificantly disgusting joyous human elements within all of us. \

Ok, I'll stop saying that this movie isn't a normal thing...\
First of all, I've found this movie here: http://myanimelist.net/featured/1700/Top_25_Best_Psychological_Anime_of_All_Time_Updated\
All started because I was wasting my time insted of being studying. Then, I've though: \"Why not complete the top 25 best psychological anime of all time?!\"\
So I started watching this movie. \
Paprika is a really crazy thing, not in the bad way of the term, but in the good. It really seems like a dream that leads you through your subconscient, with a bunch of scenes and suddenly everything change, and your only choice is to keep going on!\

          \

    (Foreword: This is based on a formal writing piece I had to do for college, and any further reviews I write will probably be done in a different style to this one. Also, I'm against the numbers method of reviewing, so just take this as a \"why you should watch this\" style of review rather than an attempt to critique this movie in an impersonal manner)\
Satoshi is one of those directors who seemed to do no wrong. You could make a bingo card of tropes and themes from one of their movies and fill out the whole thing with any of their other works. At\
          \
        little more than a glance, Paprika seems to fit that role; a gifted and independent but somewhat mentally disturbed woman in Tokyo ends up being dragged into a surreal and somewhat horrific series of events with chase scenes, stabbing and a rather odd conclusion.\
The story itself also starts out somewhat generic. Paprika beings her story exploring the dreams of an obsessed detective, in a sequence that simultaneously has little to do with the main story while also serving as a great introduction to it. The concept of exploring dreams may feel old by this point, but Paprika was actually the groundwork that paved the way for movies like Inception to come. However while Inception focuses on a dramatic story and action-heavy scenes, Paprika uses its medium to its benefit. The visuals capture and interpret the aesthetic of dreams in a manner that would be impractical, arduous and awkward to replicate in live actions. Unprompted switches between scenes, nonsensical morphing of characters and distortion of objects and surroundings can blur the line between dream and reality while also keeping them separate in a way that Satoshi’s previous work, Perfect Blue never could.\
From this point the story branches out into several parts. The doctors behind the DC Mini (the invention that allows them to enter their patients’ dreams) discovers that one of its engineers has stolen a copy and is using it to wreak havoc throughout Tokyo. The investigation of the theft leads to a much larger scheme that gets Paprika and the detective’s dreams caught up in the chaos, eventually leading to the reveal of who and what Paprika is. In addition to this, there are multiple subplots involving the detective, trying to find the meaning behind his dreams, the hospital’s chairman trying to shut them down due to his opposition of invading dreams, and an executive doctor’s obsession with finding Paprika. What makes this all shocking is that this movie is shorter than the average feature film, with a run-time of only 1 and a half hours. All of these stories are crammed into 90 minutes and yet none of it feels superfluous. Even amounts of character development are spread among the cast, and each separate story has an influence on the third act.\
With Satoshi Kon’s untimely death in 2010, his fifth work Dreaming Machine (which itself is referenced at the end of Paprika) never made it to theaters, making Paprika his swan song. With the amount of love and care put into every frame, it shows. Every member of the cast plays their role well, all the stories intertwine in the third act, leaving nothing unfinished and no plot point or aspect inconsistent. The visuals are unique, bizarre and beautiful and the soundtrack captures the feeling perfectly with a collection of songs that vary but also share the same base. I may be heavily biased but this is easily Satoshi’s best work and is the closest thing I've experienced to what can be described as a masterpiece. It would be a disservice to not experience this movie at least once.\

It was confusing, it was sometimes funny, it sometimes made me wonder, 'wtf is going on?', but at the end, it all came clear.\
Story: 9/10. The story was DEFINITELY one-of-a-kind. I gave it a 9/10 because at times, it was confusing, but that just makes you want to finish watching it to completely understand the whole thing.

Art: 10/10. Not much to say, really. I thought the animation was well-done and the art was nice enough for me to enjoy.\
Sound:: 10/10. Again, not much to say. The music fit well with all of the events that went on, and the opening and ending was nicely done.\
Character: 10/10. I thought all the characters were definitely well-developed and all unique in their own way. They all had their own personality that made them different from each other, yet they were all in the same hole of the same problems.\
Enjoyment:: 9/10. Honestly, I thought there were some parts that were a bit slow-paced and could have been better if it was faster, but I enjoyed this movie quite well and finished it thinking, 'wow, I've never watched anything like that.' It is definitely something people need to check out. I think Satoshi Kon is an amazing director. :)\

    One of Satoshi Kon's weaker movies, lackluster story development and characters with EXTREMELY forced romance in the end. Really disappointing, actually. I expected so much from the show after the opening scene which was very well done. Although I must say I really enjoyed art and especially the soundtrack which absolutely stunned me, that kinda saved the show for me.

Last week I saw one of Sakoshi's (Kon) most praised movies, and - unfortunately - his last. Paprika. Based on a manga written got knows when (1994!), Paprika tells the story Atsuko Chiba and her alter-ego, Paprika (notice how many times I said Paprika in this review?), as well as Atsuko's team of scientists, as they found that 3 DC Minis have been stolen, making all those that used it start loosing grounds of what is dream and what is reality.\
Good things first, the art is motherfucking amazing, it conveys exactly what it wants\
          \
        and its really pretty to look at, each frame is beatiful. The sound, as well, is catchy and well-composed, it fits very well with the overall theme of the story. This makes the whole movie an extremely enjoyable experience, like you got a DC Mini, looking at the dreams of the author, or rather, the characters themselves.\
Sound Effects are great as well (if not a little bit annoying with the mix of sounds when various things are mixed on the same scene) and the voice-acting is top-notch (heads-up to the English Dub that made an amazing job!)\
Now, for the bad thing, Story and Characters. Sorry, but as creepy as Himuro is and as badass as Paprika and the cop guy that I don't remember the name, they hardly had much depth, specially Chiba and her forced romance with fat NEET brain-of-a-spoiled-4-years-old-brat guy. This is understandable since they only got 90 minutes to show everything (it would be dreadful on an actual series), but doesn't make anything any less disappointment.\
The Story has an insteresting premise, and starts nicely, but ultimately becomes a good guy/bad guy conflit that didn't really interested me as much as Himuro and fat guy relationship, that was completely fucked flipped and ignored once they both \"died.\" (I guess...)\
Overall, should you watch Paprika?\
Yes.\

This is probably my favorite anime movie that I have ever seen (And I've watched a lot of anime movies). \
Why do I love this movie so freaking much?\
Let's review the different aspects of the movie.\
Story: \
Though many might find it confusing or just plain strange the psychological aspects mixed with the all of information of the making of film make for a good thriller. On top of that the fantasy dream elements create a great balance between reality and the dream world. \
Art: \
Honestly I'm probably not the most qualified to judge art but I can tell as compared to the other anime\
          \
        and manga I've seen/read it's very well done. \
Sound: \
One of my favorite things about this movie is the sound track. Usually with movies or shows I might like the soundtrack but I don't make an effort to seek out individual tracks. With this it was different, my favorite tracks being \"The Girl In Byakkoya\" and \"Parade\" \
Characters: \
I loved the characters! Not much to say because I don't want to end up spoiling any thing about character development but these are some of my favorite anime movie characters ever. \
Enjoyment: \
If you can't tell I have that 10/10 for enjoyment. I loved the twist and turns of the plot and everything out of it! \

10/10 for enjoyment! :)\

The story seemed to be very confusing at first and at times you think, WTH JUST HAPPENED OMG!!! But by the end everything is explained and it's ust somethign you need to sit and pay your attention to and follow it, t was a very unique story.\
Animation\
The art work was nice but not the best, better than most though. The art work seemed detailed. Regardless of how nice the art work was, it didnt 'wow' me. Lacking off on that, thus the 9 out of 10.\
Sound\
I don't like the style of music paprika was based\
          \
        around it's not my usul tastes but in this case it worked well, the music was a grat feature in this movie.\
Characters\
This lacked and only got a 7 out of 10, the characters seemed well designed but they wasn't exactly memorable. There was a nice variation of personalities but I didn't feel as if I could connect with them.\

    \"Paprika\" is a movie about dreams. You could even say it is a dream.\
With the future of science being as advanced as it is, the development of a system where you can view and interact with dreams in real time called the \"DC Mini\", is being used as a psychotherapy tool.\
But without limitations installed on the prototype models, they could be dangerous tool, if stolen.\
That is sadly, exactly what happens.\
The only one who can stop this is Paprika, a mysterious women who coincides in the body of Chiba Atsuko, the head of the DC Mini development team, along with the literally larger than life genius,\
          \
        Kosaku Tokita.\
\"Paprika\" was originally a book written in 1993 by Yasutaka Tsutsui, who also wrote \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" in 1967. I have not read any of his books yet, but with the experience I've had with his writing so far, he's a very intelligent, imaginative writer.\
This film being directed by the late Satoshi Kon, you will no doubt end up with quality product, this being the last film he directed, it's a nice good bye. We did end up with quality.\
For character, Paprika and Atsuko Chiba occupy the same body. Paprika seems to have the ability to travel between dreams an reality.\
Torataro Shima is a gifted psychiatrist who is supporting the \"DC Mini\" operation along with Morio Osanai, kind of an underling of the operation.\
Seijiro Inui is the chairman of the Institute for Psychiatric Research where the DC Mini operation is being funded and taking place, and what he says goes. He's against the development of the DC Mini for the most part.\
Toshimi Konakawa is a a cop, and a college friend of Shima's, and is under psychiatric treatment using the DC Mini, he's kind of a subject.\
Kosaku Tokita is the genius who created the DC Mini. He is quite immature, he basically started this whole mess.\
Homera Kei is a suspect who may have stolen the DC Mini prototypes, he was Tokita's friend.\
The art in this picture is of high quality, which is something to expect by Satoshi Kon and his crew. There is some nudity in this production, that is basically it when it comes to obscenity in this film... Other than the messed up dreams of course.\
You could show this film to a young adult.\
The sound in this film is excellent. I seriously cannot get enough of Susumu Hirasawa, I thank Satoshi Kon for promoting him, as well and showing us this amazing composer and musician! The SFX are very imaginative and unique. \
All of the seiyuu are excellent, nothing to complain about there.\
---\
This is an intelligent, imaginative film. It's nothing deep (Unless you want it to be), a very unique psychological thriller, except replacing all of the gore and mind games with crazy dreams filled with parades, butterflies, enchanted forests, gibberish, and a giant naked woman eating someone else's dreams (You'll just have to see it).\
This is not a long film at all, 90 minutes in fact, the shortest that movies come. For that length, this is a film worth viewing.\
I would recommend this film to anyone interested. In fact, I would recommend everything Satoshi Kon has created to anyone interested, he's that good.\

    For me Paprika is one of the greatest anime films of all time. Of Satoshi Kon's movies, it was Paprika that impressed me the most though Perfect Blue and Tokyo Godfathers are very impressive films too. \
Paprika is not going to please everybody at first hand though, it is quite a complex movie and perhaps more adult-oriented. Surreal yet very imaginative, the vibrant yet atmospheric colours and detailed backgrounds are a real feast for the eyes. The score is a wonder to behold as well and fits perfectly within the movie, epic and truly memorable, it serves well also listening to it on its own.\
          \
        The script is quite complex in tone, but is incredibly thought-provoking and is written in a very literate and intelligent way. The story is always involving and clever, and it is easy to understand once you know the film's intentions. \
The themes interwoven into Paprika are very strong and interesting ones and never dealt in a heavy-handed way. The characters are engaging and easy to relate to, complete with a nicely diverse range of personalities. The voice acting is very dynamic. All in all, a terrific film, unique and a feast from the visual and musical front.\
RIP Satoshi Kon\

    Released in 2006 and produced by Madhouse Studio, Paprika is part science-fiction and part fantasy by dealing with an unusual theme: dreams. It was directed by Satoshi Kon.\
The movie feels like a complete dream, with surreal visuals and, at times, a difficult to follow story. This is, at the same time, the biggest compliment and criticism I can make about it. During some scenes, I had to stop and think: “Wait. Am I dreaming?”. This just proves the immersiveness of the movie and how perfectly it portrays its subject matter.\
Despite being produced in 2006, Paprika‘s visuals managed to leave me in awe. It has a\
          \
        very particular style that fits the dream theme, complete with strange examples of surrealism and the nonsensical nature that dreams can take. If I didn’t know that it is almost a decade old, I would have thought it was released last year, as everything has a very modern style with amazing detail.\
But the story doesn’t shine as brightly. It can be a bit hard to follow if you aren’t devoting your full attention to it. The desire to make it like a dream makes the story illogical. Actually, this can be seen very clearly during the conclusion, in which the villain is defeated in a very strange way that is an ass-pull and doesn’t really have any build up. Still, it was a highly entertaining ride in this regard also.\
The soundtrack is composed of mostly techno songs, but it fits perfectly the imagery seen and also has its own charm. The voice acting for Paprika/Chiba is amazing as it done by the same person, but sounds completely different. It is really like hearing two completely different people talk.\
Sure, the story is a bit confusing and its conclusion, specially, isn’t as great as the rest of the film, but manages to complete exactly what it set out to do: create a dream. More than that, it still manages to be highly enjoyable to watch, in a multitude of ways.\
I would definetly recommend it to anyone that is intrigued by the idea of a story about dreams and also to fans of fantasy and science-fiction alike.\

    Warning possible Spoilers\
Looking at what happens in this film, you can definitely tell this is where Inception got it's inspiration from, because this is for certain a very trippy adventure.\
Story (9/10)\
The story concentrates on a group of scientists, who have created a device called the DC Mini, which allows them to access peoples dreams. However someone manages to hijack control of the dreams and it is up to Paprika and her gang to find the villain.\
Now the plot for this show was a little confusing, especially towards the end where the situation got very trippy and weird, but it didn't feel bad in any way.\
          \
        It was fun and interesting seeing Paprika and the scientists trying to find out who has been trying to control the dream world and use it for their own gains, we also need to remember this was directed by Satoshi Kon, who also directed Perfect Blue and we all remember if you watched it that it had a big plot twist with who the main villain is, here it's not done as well, but it did surprise me that the main villain was alone in his endeavours.\
The story also kept getting more and more crazy as the boundaries between the real world and the dreamworld eventually came together making everything look like you were high 24/7.\
I think the only downside to the story is, when it didn't concentrate on Paprika and the others trying to find the main villain it sorta slowed down a little, for example whenever it concentrated on the Detective it didn't do much for me and took me out of what was going on before it, plus it didn't really make his character look good.\
Also the way it ended didn't feel right either, it just stops, maybe I was expecting something else to happen and was just surprised, but the fact it stops threw me off a little.\
Characters (9/10)\
The characters were pretty good, but nothing too special apart from Paprika.\
Atsuko Chiba AKA Paprika is a really interesting and mysterious individual, who is one of the main scientists on the DC Mini project and has a special second personality called Paprika. Chiba is a cold and detached woman so you won't get much from her personality, however Paprika is entirely the opposite of her, she's much more playful and positive. Chiba can actually interact with Paprika in the real world making her a special case that the film never really explains for some reason.\
Toshimi Konakawa is a Detective, who is being helped by the scientists with the DC Mini. He's a fairly odd individual sometimes, the issue he has with his past is a constant problem in the film until he overcomes it and he did save Chiba at some point, but I didn't find him to be a good character especially when after he saves Chiba he just randomly kisses her, which didn't make much sense and seemed kinda creepy and weird.\
Kosaku Tokita is probably the fattest anime character I have ever seen, yet he is incredibly smart being the creator of the DC Mini, he tends to get stuck in doorways and can be a bit reckless with his decisions, but he seemed like an ok dude, at least he didn't go crazy like most scientists.\
Art (10/10)\
Once again Madhouse show why they are so good at creating such weird worlds, mean looking at the final part of the film when the real world and the dream world collide my brain was going nuts over how crazy and ridiculous everything was getting, the same can be said with the whole parade gimmick too.\
The characters were all well designed and all of them looked and acted to the way they were designed, which was a pretty interesting thing to notice.\
I will say though that one moment where Paprika has been captured and the dude was tormenting her was pretty messed up and made the film go from pretty wacky to wtf am I watching.\
Sound (10/10)\
It also had a phenomenon soundtrack, the main theme and the parade music fitted perfectly to the way the film was and the main theme is really catchy to listen too. When I heard the main theme during the intro sequence it made me realise I was in for something good and it went so well with that sequence too.\
Extras:\
As a psychological film, it does that very well, much different to what Perfect Blue was doing, since that was trying to show how Mima was changing over time from what was going on, whereas this is made to change how you feel really, because my mind was losing it's sanity the more I watched this. I think it was also showing that dreams are a whole different reality to the real world where there is an infinite amount of possibilities within them and how they can also affect your memory too.\
I'm not exactly sure why the horror genre is here, other than a few murders and that weird molesting scene there wasn't much to qualify it as a horror.\
It definitely had a good mystery behind it, just like with Perfect Blue, it did well to keep the true murderers identity hidden, until they revealed who it is was much earlier than Perfect Blue did and it wasn't trying to hide it either.\
Enjoyment (9/10)\
Overall (9/10)\
Overall this was definitely a weird trip into the dream reality and it was a fun ride, aside from a few things that just didn't sit well with me, however this was another fantastic film created by Satoshi Kon.\

    Story (6/10):\
I'll be honest here and say that i was not impressed by the story of the movie. It had a lot of trippy aspects to it but that mainly was caused by the visual effects and directive approach, the actual main plot however was really plain and simple and i actually figured the whole thing half way through the movie and the excitement factor was just gone.\
I was really disappointed that the story didn't offer any darkness. Had it been a little bit more dark it would have made the movie much more enjoyable \
Characters (6/10):\
Except maybe for Paprika/Chiba and Konakawa yet again i\
          \
        find my self not caring about any of the characters in an anime and i feel like all the other characters were more like props than actual characters.\
Hell i only found Paprika interesting because of the whole alter ego thing that was going on. And Konakawa backstory arc was kind of nice\
Art and Animation (10/10):\
Surely as an anime created by Madhouse it offered a visual feast for the eyes. Characters designs were great with sharp movements and gestures even the weird creatures and things that show up during the dream sequences were if great design. Environments were well drawn and very colorful as well.\
Animations and movements were top notch, everything was so alive and a blast to watch.\
Music & VA (7/10):\
The soundtrack of the movie matched it's vibe perfectly, it helped with creating the trippy world of the anime as well as the mood\
The VA was not half bad it had a good English dub and the voices matched the characters quite nicely \
Effectiveness (7/10):\
I did enjoy the movie but not for the right reasons. The visuals were top notch and the movie can simply be watched for that, as for the story i did state that beyond it's trippy aspects it was not that impressive (but maybe i have watched a lot of trippy stuff that i actually find these kind of things normal)\
I did not watch any of Satoshi Kon movies before but from what i have read online many of his fans find this movie \"Good but not his best work\"\

    Paprika is a 2006 film from renowned director Satoshi Kon.\
First thing first, i must state that this film totally dissapointed me. It was a dissapointment from Kon's career perspective and from the anime media perspective. As i had heard marvels about this film i couldn't be more excited, yet all that thrill faded rapidly away. \
For the story, the concept is interesting and the initial presentation of characters and setting engaging, but as the plot advances on it gets simplier and simplier to the point of being just a mere story of good guys vs bad guys. Also, the plot is predictable a lot of\
          \
        the time so there is little to no thrill. \
The visual part of the film is possible the best, as the animation itself is as good as it can get, what you should expect from a top tier production like this. The designs are similar to other Kon films, perhaps the colour palette is brightier than in his other works. The film exploit its resources trying to give life to the world of dreams with uneven results. Most of the times they look good, but i cannot leave behind the sensation that for a film of this scale it should have been a lot more wildier and exciting, all the oniric sequences are not especially original, not a single moment that leaves you breathless, and that is a shame accounting other works of the director. Saying that we can tackle other of the film problems: It relies too much on the visuals to enhance the narrative. Normally this shouldnt be a problem, moreover a strengthy feature, but as the story is pretty simple and the characters are just what meets the eye you get to the feeling that there should be more to fill that void. In other animes happen that the design and visuals tend to be symbolic without a true meaning, Evangelion for example, but in those cases those visual features set the mood and give identity to the show, even if what you see is there for the sake of itself. Paprika is not the case, here you get the impression of being fooled into think it is a visionary and intelectual work when it isnt.\
The version i saw was dubbed in my language (spanish), for those with interest in it, i must say that it was quite alright, a correct dubbing exercise without special merits but without many flaws. The only complain is the usual heartless performance of the voice actors, but in spanish anime dubs this is common to happen so i really wouldnt give it a lot of attention. The Soundtrack and sound effects are good, the same as with visuals, what you might be expecting from a film like this.\
Overall, Paprika is a well-intended film with good direction and production but is dragged down by a mediocre plot. Not just an mediocre plot but a plot developed in the way that it builds high expectations just to burst the bubble as minutes go by.\
 I personally consider this the worst film work by Satoshi Kon and a truly overrated piece of anime. \
You wont die from seeing it, but it is just a little above average, dont expect any masterpiece\

    When one watches Paprika, I must warn it is not an anime for newcomers. Those of you who know Satoshi Kon films will know they are masterpieces but can creep out other people's minds. Paprika is no exception. The story is based on terroism and dreams and reality becoming one and a doctor who has an alter-ego that helps patients known as Paprika. The animation is breath-taking, so many times in the film for example when Paprika is falling from the sky, you'll wish you were in her shoes. You'll envy the dream worlds conjured up. The sound is very addictive, if you don't like\
          \
        sound-tracks getting stuck in your head, Paprika is a potential to cause it. The opening theme is amazing, no arguments there. The characters are very distinguishable and memorable. The only part of Paprika which doesn't make it recommended to everyone- is that purely, many parts of the film contains disturbing scenes. However, aren't dreams actually like that sometimes. It's a very good attempt by Satoshi Kon. The enjoyment of the film is very good, however there will be times when your mouth will be left open especially in the finale. Overall, a 9 due to great story, concept, art, music and characters. The dub is very good, with proper voice actors instead of newbies. Worth definitely watching, however don't say I didn't warn you if you get disturbed.\

    Art: Fine. Character design is decent, faces are shaded (at least in close ups), objects and backgrounds are well drawn as well so no complaints here. A big annoyance is when Chiba's face is sometimes drawn with no shading other than under the nose and lower lip making her face look completely flat other than the aforementioned areas. \
Animation: Mostly double or triple framed with minimal single-framing that you probably can't even notice unless you went through it frame-by-frame like I did. Intense action scenes like the tentacle scene could really have done with single framing but I guess the budget couldn't allow for that.\
          \
        Overall the animation is not noticeably choppy so it's acceptable I guess. \
Choreography: What choreography lol. There are no fight scenes in this movie which is the biggest disappointment for me. Actually the dream sequences really let me down because I was expecting more lurid sequences and fight scenes but there were none. The only action consisted of Paprika running around to escape tentacles or whatever. Pretty boring. \
Conclusion: Not as good as I had been expecting. Dream sequences could have been more lurid, no fighting, very little violence. A shit ton of movie references for seemingly no reason other than \"the police guy didn't finish a movie that he was making with a friend\". Makes no sense. I didn't like Paprika, she seemed too artificial and forced. Chiba acted like a bitch. The fat genius guy also seemed too stereotyped. None of the characters were convincing at all. What's the theme of this story, really? Is it a beauty and the beast, as in, the fat genius as the beast, and Paprika as the beauty? Why is every male character in the movie madly in love with Paprika? The dream rape scene felt weird and out of place. In the novel Chiba actually does get raped, physically. That's pretty edgy dude. Thought this was supposed to be fun and not serious and adult. Oh well. That's what you get for thinking that popular = good. \

    I don't even know where to begin on this review, there was so much in the movie that I can't really just pin point one little thing. Everything about the show is everywhere, and I like it so much I just wish I had more. Paprika is a movie that will mess with your mind, for it's story is told in such a psychedelic manner that somethings will not make sense until the very end. The story isn't all too linear either, it has a few beautiful side stories that made me care for the characters and made the movie more enjoyable to watch. \
So\
          \
        what makes this show good, and why do people talk about it often? It's because the movie is just way too fun to hate. Sure the beginning of the movie can be a little confusing, but don't let that put you off from watching the show. Near the end everything starts to make sense, and once you understand it all the show goes all out and has fun with the rest of it. There is a bit of lore in the movie so don't completely turn off your brain, but don't try to hard to critically think about what's going on.\
The movie was made to be fun to watch, not as a homework assignment that forces you to think hard.\
Story: The story behind Paprika is a few people have found a way to record dreams for therapeutic reasons, but has been taken one day and confusion is led to mayhem. For the story, I will say trying to understand all the information being thrown at me within the first few scenes was not too bad, but as the show moves on it tells more things that may confuse you. Now like I stated earlier, the show explains things later and it was meant to just be a fun show. So when things get confusing just take a deep breath and think it'll all come together soon and don't think about some scenes as hard as you might want to. The dream sequences do tell some story as well, so don't disregard the dreams.\
Over all the story was pretty unique, and done excellently.\
Characters: This movie has very good characters, it was probably one of my favorite parts of the movie. Each character is lovable in their own way, and sometimes they may just seem a little unbelievable, but that's the charm of the show. They certainly made every scene likable and just fun to watch. As the movie plays the characters secrets are exposed, and it just makes the characters that much better. It makes no scene a dull moment as you explore their world and their personalities. \
Art & Sound: Stunning art, and a beautiful soundtrack make for a great combination. The art is probably the most talked part about this show, for the psychedelic scenes make for entertaining moments to never fade. From the beginning to the end the art pulls its weight and really pulls the movie through with beautiful scenery as well as well crafted animations. Also the music, was by far probably the most memorable from any other anime I've seen. It had a unique style and sound that made it an audio masterpiece to fit with awes inspiring visuals.\
So overall, a very enjoyable movie. When watching please don't use your brain too much. Some things may not make sense at first, but trust me, when the show pulls it all together this will be one of your favorite anime movies.",

    I shall sait it from the start, is not a good movie.\
Sure, I see the reasons why people view this as a classic and whatnot (i saw it like that too) but when a while back saw the movie again, I ended up really disapointed comparing it to what I thought I had watched a long time ago.\
Let's say the good things first. \
As a concept, this movie is fantastic and the visuals are the primary reason for that. They give you a sense of magic and mistery and hype unique to this movie, and is enjoyable as long as it goes. The characters are\
          \
        ''rounded'' and almost feel like people, the music is all around amazing and when it ends it leaves you with a good feeling. Buuut, when you start analyzing it, you start watching the problems with it.\
 I'm too lazy to do the rest, I will edit this someday to expose this as the piece of shit that really is.\
So, I came back. As I was saying.\
Although this are all really strong points in making an anime, we shall not forget the primary and only reason why we're here: a good story.\
Sadly, paprika doesn't have one. They have a great concept, but the movie could have been so much cooler if they just focused in the psychological part of the series, instead of a lot of really trippy imagery trying to justify it.\
For example: To me, the greatest parts of the movie are those were the detective Kogawa Toshimi apears (yes, I just googled it. Don't judge). From the begining of the movie, we know there isn't something right about him. He has a recuring dream of shooting someone in the back, and all that causes him an inmense stress (I won't say more because spoilers). The point is that, this movie could just have forgotten completely of the stolen aparatus and just centered in the PSYCHOLOGICAL part of the cast, their personalities, inmerse in THEIR dreams and it would have been so much better, concise and not all around stupid.\
Sincerily, a guy with free time. (that is an Austin reference)  \

    Without warning, Satoshi Kon mixes dream and reality and takes us far, far away in his dreamlike delirium. It requires from the outset a steady pace which remains from beginning to end in leading us in the constant action while exploring all facets of his approach. We have the feeling of running in all directions so much it's rich, especially as the graphic quality is amazing, especially in terms of movements, which are also constant, fully consistent with the purpose. With Paprika, there is no barrier to the imagination, no concessions to this delusional epic at the heart of the complex psychology of colorful characters.\

        Paprika is an intense movie both in terms of the pace of the action of the concentration it requires to follow everything. In one word : MASTERPIECE. \

    Story (6/10)\
-Paprika is a film under the categories Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Psychological, Sci-Fi, and Thriller. Under these genres, Paprika does not seem to shine in anything specific, although, sure, it's a Fantasy and Sci-Fi movie about a revolutionary technology that enables doctors to delve into the minds of their patients (the Psychological aspect, I presume). The doctors end up in a mad cat and mouse game when it seems dreams and reality are becoming one (Horror) while trying to find the culprit hiding behind closet doors and abandoned amusement parks (Mystery, Thriller). \
-Perhaps the plot itself was not thoroughly thought through by the author of\
          \
        the original novel, but when taking in account the time this was written (1993), the thought experiments tentatively presented by authors back then were a little wishy-washy not-very-solid anyway, so you can't really blame him.\
-If you were expecting more details on the Psychological aspect of the technology behind the movie, you'd be disappointed. The movie and director explain the science behind the device by waving their hands and throwing glitters in your face, chanting “Sci-Fi, Sci-Fi, Science Fiction!” The only scientific term used in the entirety of the movie is REM.\
NEXT PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS\
-The thing about Paprika is that its plot does not run deep, but it's a movie crafted around trying to dive deeper. I mean, literally, the plot is about an big, scary, evil man wanting a different body while the scientist who jacked up protocol and didn't manage to apply security features to the earpod (whatever) does nothing all throughout the movie and yet still gets the girl in the end beause his intelligence is just that attractive even if he's 450 pounds, apparently. If Accel World had the masturbatory self-insert that was Haruyuki Akita, in this film we get Kousaku Tokita. Also, I'm quite convinced that the only real reason Paprika was named such is just to make two puns at the end of the movie.\
END OF SPOILERS\
-Does the story include moral lessons? Sure, yeah. But they're not really lessons that you've never heard of before: Our dreams are creative, they play quite a big role in our subconscious mind, our fears, motivation, and interests show up in them. Does this really pique your interest?\
Art (10/10)\
-Madhouse was leading in the animations studios' race to flawlessly seam together 2D and 3D in visual art, and it shows in this movie (which was made in 2006; way to go, guys!). This animation studio is a powerhouse in light effects and fluid motion, as well as one of the best in anatomical accuracy in my opinion. The art was very very finely detailed, and had a sense of a Miyazaki film with its love for indiviual character designs. Every movement is finely tuned to smoothly transition from one frame to another without losing the sense of time. Madhouse is especially good at slow motion sequences, most probably because of their leaning towards action-packed shows that enable them to show you just how good they are at messing with motion.\
-This animation studio is never one to back down from risky lighting and awkward angles, because they're not afraid to make their characters look unappealing while still keeping that cartoony edge. It's scary how confident they are, but it seemed to work in this film. The directing was easy to appreciate, specially with the focus on the monochromatic reality versus the ever-so-colorful dream world.\
Sound (6/10)\
-The sound wasn't particularly enjoyable, but I suppose one can say that all the music presented were applicable to their respective scenes. I'm not much of an action anime watcher (I just end up with them) and one quality they all possess is the same rising volume and beat towards the climax of any scene: while most commonly using orchestral music. The sound is not bad, per say, but it's not anything to write home about.\
-No notable songs or sounds that sparked true emotion for me. No sadness, no relief, no misery, no anger, no empathy whatsoever on my end.\
Characters (5/10)\
-The characters all felt one-dimensional to me besides our main heroine. Unfortunately, the reason for her dynamic persona is found out in the middle part of the movie, and it's less of a characterization and more of (alright, completely) a plot device that heavily influences the outcome and overall flow of the story.\
SPOILERS\
-I really can't get myself around to liking Tokita, mostly because his character only has one scene of “development” and yet it never really helped the plot or anyone else in the least. If he had not dove into his assistant's dreamscape, there would be absolutely no difference in the plot. Maybe one. That would be Atsuko's conscious participation in saving the day, rather than her half-coma state of eating everything in sight. That, in itself, would have been a better ending. Atsuko did not once even show to be a tsundere, and it's bad writing to make her so. Her relationship with Tokita should not have been more than what it was at the very beginning, mostly because Atsuko is an ambitious but caring doctor despite her cool outward appearance, while Tokita is an obese man obsessed with the next project and eating 3 dishes per meal. Tokita's character is toxic, because the starting conflict was a result of his mistake, his investigative skills are abhorrent, and we never get to see any real character development coming from him. It's just. I do truly hate the writing behind his masturbatory, self-satisfying character.\

-Paprika was disappointing for me, but only because the only other movie I've watched about dream-diving was Inception and that was a complete masterpiece with immersive situations. Perhaps if you don't really mind trying-to-be-deep stories you could enjoy this for yourself. I, however, would not watch this again.\

    I'll start by saying that this movie in my opinion is quite overrated. I've heard it mentioned on numerous times and finally decided to give it a try.\
This movie has a good idea but bad execution. The manipulation of dreams  provided an interesting showcase of animation, it's all very colourful and nice to look at however... What exactly was the plot again?... from my perspective, this movie lasted for 90 minutes yet barely had any character development or story progression. \
The last 30 minutes were the only truly enjoyable part. The midway point feeling like a chore,  I had to pause the movie\
          \
        and take a few minutes to relax. \
If you're thinking this movie is Sci-fi... well, I'm sorry but the summery lied. This movie is purely fantasy except for a few references to technology known as \"DC Mini\" which fair enough, does allow for people to share dreams but this is soon forgotten after the first 40 minutes. The main characters don't even need the \"DC Mini\" any longer.\
The art/animation is great and the character designs are pretty good although these characters are very uninteresting and not very likeable. I'll be honest \"Tokita\"  is one of my most hated characters.\
You might be thinking that I'm calling this movie horrible or that I dislike it. No, not true. I actually enjoyed the animation, the sound and the conclusion to the story. I enjoyed the movie and for that reason, I'm giving it 8/10. \

    Paprika.\
It's a a magnificent film raises a question of dreams. More precisely part of the dream, names REM sleep, when  the most colorful and emotional dreams accure, also dreams taking place in  the slow parts of sleep, but they are shorter and less emotionally colored.In general, there are three main theories of dreams: Sigmund Freud's, Carl Jung's and the concept that sleep is a kind of encrypted message pertaining to the future of person and his entourage sent by some higher beings. I only know the name and the basic provisions of these concepts, so I won't stay on them.\
Let us turn to\
          \
        the film itself.If you haven't seen this movie, i strongly recommend not to read any reviews on it.But i'll try to avoid spoiling a lot.\
From the very first moments of the film, I was shocked in some sense. Full surrealism of what is happening makes me almost irresistible urge to jump ahead a bit and peek or rather steal from myself at least some shred of explanation about what is happening. And yes, the first couple of minutes my facial expression unconsciously express the phrase \"What the hell is going on here? '.However, all quickly rises on the places:\
Childish and boundless genius inventor (Kosaku Tokita) was created DC Mini, a device that allows people to watch other people's dreams. This device is used illegally by Paprika, Chiba Atsuko's(dispassionate and balanced head of the development team DC Mini) alter ego is a playful girl that guides others through their dreams in the experimental psychotherapy treatment.One of them is a detective Konakawa Toshimi, the protagonist of this action, which is trying to deal via paprika with a torturing him sleep. Further the narrative adventures of these characters in dreams and reality, and on their facet await us.Further analysis of the plot isn't necessary.\
The overall plot is quite clear and consistent, the characters are extremely well developed, the animation is simply gorgeous, well and sound, as for me,  let us down a little.\
The main ideas of the film, I would name:\
-Creation of human hands are not in themselves neither good nor bad, but they can only be employed by people as a tool to achieve their own goals, meet the ambitions of power, or just wreak havoc under the guise of different ideas.Invetors also quite often lack of understanding and not divining the long-playing effects and attitude to their creations by public.\
Perhaps the most famous example illustrating this may be an conviction of the society invention of dynamite after a false obituary that was an incitement to the establishment by Alfred Nobel, through the testament, universally known Prize, awarded irrespective of nationality, on the money earned by them mainly due to the production and sale invented by him dynamite.\
-Even the most it would seem minor facts and details that can simply be forgotten or consciously and unconsciously, are excluded from the memory may well play a determining significance in the life of man.\
This paragraph i also have seen in the previously wathced work of Kon Satoshi.\
Thank you for your attention and time.\

    Re-watching this movie the other day may have saved anime for me. I was getting too far away from the raw creativity and beauty of the art form, getting lost in a sea of cliches and contrivances. Aside from Evangelion 3.0 coming out later this year, I had given up on anime as a whole. I'm not going to name names but... Eden of the East, Full Metal Panic, I'm looking at you.\
Anyway, this movie is just brilliant. It's a mess of a plot really. I still don't understand a lot of it after the 3rd viewing. But that's not the point in this case.\
          \
        The point here is to loose yourself in a truly TRULY bizarre visual roller-coaster ride, the likes of which really have no parallel. This is proof that animation is capable of depicting the most surreal images that the mind can muster- those that we see when we dream. One could compare the conventions found in Paprika to those of The Cell or Inception, both live action films. However, because Paprika is not constricted to a certain level of realism like those films, it is allowed to take similar subject matter (the dream) and outshine them in nearly every facet. The things that you will see in this movie range from orgasmic flourishes of color, back to muted modern sheen, and then back again to the type of psychedelia infused imagery that would send an LSD-user into a shrieking fit of terror.\
Anime is interesting to me for this reason primarily: Its difference from conventional western tropes. Maybe to an avid fan of Japanese cinema, the imagery here is not so strange. I suppose if you are subjected to anything enough, it becomes rather average. And maybe that's what happened to me back in 2010, when I, mostly just bored of seeing the same things over and over again, threw in the towel on anime. But this movie may have been all I needed- a relentlessly creative bombarding of the senses. A dream.\

    The reason I wanted to watch this movie in the first place was because of the plot line. It was creative and engaging. Not something you see every day. Often times I find the plots of anime movies to be a bit dry and irrelevant to my human existence, but this story really had a lot of thought put into it. However, at the same time, it did not take itself too seriously, and there was a phenomenal spectrum of emotion weaved into the story line.  Though a lot of serious things were happening throughout, it always kept a complex air about it of\
          \
        cheerfulness and love for others.  It was all \
Upon seeing the poster, I knew this movie would be beautiful. The vibrant nature of the artwork in the dreams is a great contrast to the amount of grave danger the main characters often find themselves in. Beautiful red-headed, big-eyed Paprika is obviously also a nice touch. \
I found the soundtrack to be very similar to that of Paranoia Agent. (Which I loved.)  It's very open and whole-toney, a wonderful contrast to the dire consequences of failure.  \
The characters seemed a little one-dimensional, in my humble opinion, but that may have been because their minds were being intercepted half the time.  It was difficult to keep track of who was friends, who was enemies, who wanted what, who was on whose side, etc.  However, thus is the nature of life.  I felt as though there was a lack of genuine character development by the end.  Key word \"genuine,\" because there was a clear intention to have the characters discover things about themselves.  \
This movie had an inviting atmosphere.  You'll like it if you enjoy psychological thrillers and that weird, nonsensical stuff that sometimes goes on in anime.  You know what I'm talking about.  ",

    It's been a while since I've seen this film, so this review is just the general impressions that it left and that I still remember, instead of something more definitive in regards to the plot and the characters.  But that's really OK because you aren't watching this movie for a strong plot, or even characters that you can really understand and relate too, because that's all secondary.  The real reason to watch this movie is the luscious animation, intelligent direction, and sound and effects that boggle the mind.  It's a fun romp into the human subconscious that never really gets too deep.\
          \
         Many questions are left unanswered, and there are plot holes so big that it would take an entire new movie to explain. To its benefit, most of those are really only after thoughts, and they are lost in the experience of actually watching this movie.  It sucks you in with it's inventive style from the quirky and witty opening sequence to the bizarre and psychedelic end.  \
If you like your movies with a stronger plot, and a sequence of events that make sense, then you might not like this film.  If you are open to the idea that a film like this could be a spectacle of pop art, or enjoy sophistry masquerading as deep philosophical insight, then this is a film you can sink your teeth into.  Personally, the pop art aspect of this movie is what really appealed to me.  Style and wit over true substance, a feast for the eyes and ears, candy for the soul.  Tremendous fun, but a bit empty and too light to really take anything away.\

    While being somewhat typical of Satoshi Kon's oeuvre and style, and feeling slightly overlong, Paprika is still a masterpiece of art and imagination. The story is an excuse to explore a deep visual dreamscape that often blurs the distinction between the real and the non. Overall, the story is great, only seeming slightly overlong. Partly, the playfulness of the movie misleads us a little bit and, quite masterfully, Satoshi Kon turns out the story's true message. To any extent, the story plays out well. In part, this is due to the strength of the art.\
The art is sharp and fluid and, indeed, quite masterful -\
          \
        especially in its interplay between light and shadow. As well, there is great depth, detail, and ingenuity in its depiction of dreamscapes, which truly allow the strength of the art to show through. In turn, this supports the story well and keeps it engaging. The art is, in short, outstanding. Another exceptional area of the film that deserves highlighting is the music.\
The music, like the art, is one of the strongest areas of Paprika and certainly shines throughout. Playful, imaginative, strange - and yet quite catchy - musical themes abound showcasing the unusual events of the movie. \
Overall, Paprika is outstanding and has only very minor faults. Indeed, it is an excellent example of Satoshi Kon's strength at bending reality and stands apart as a modern masterpiece.\

    Some titles like Serial Experiment: Lain exhibit increasingly confusing plot twists that seem to thrive on their incomprehensive nature just about enough to convince you that the creator just served you a complex banquet of style over substance. With bizarre \"classics\" like Lain in mind it would seem that at least a considerable portion of anime fans are starting to support the notion that understanding is unnecessary and that the only justification a Mindfuck title needs to revel in its complex glory is the exploration of some philosophical or sociological theme. With these fascinated, dubious and more than anything ambivalent thoughts in my head I\
          \
        set out to re-watch Paprika; the last full-length feature ever produced by Satoshi Kon, otherwise known as the demised master of visual expression. In this piece of amateurish writing I'll do my best to sum up my thoughts.\
Story: 8/10\
Once you've reached the, in my opinion mistaken, conclusion that absolute comprehension is unnecessary it might be a good choice to value the experience a complex movie provides rather than its explanations. In this sense Paprika is an undeniable success as it makes use of a concept we've encountered before, where the once unexplored landscapes of our dreams can be invaded after recent technological advances, to manufacture a story of originality and brilliance. Throughout the movie we get to follow the team of scientists who developed this technology as they are attacked by a dream terrorist who seems to have stolen a copy of their equipment. This results in outbreak after outbreak of severe psychological terror causing suicide attempts and downright disturbing behavior. Sounds interesting? That's because it most certainly is.\
There can be no denial that Satoshi Kon has mastered the art of carefully structuring a narrative as he blessed his final work with enough psychedelic nightmare sequences combined with clever dialogue and a refreshing sense of humour to make it an incredibly memorable ride. Paprika breaks several clichés in its profound determination to entertain whilst telling an increasingly interesting and complex story in a creative and semi-experimental approach. Viewers are offered a gloriously surreal spectacle where dreams merge not only with other dreams but also with reality, resulting in an intellectual, if a tad incomprehensive acid trip of amazing proportions. Disappointed over not understanding the movie after the first watch? Don't worry, that is definitely to be expected. After several viewings though I'd like to add that Paprika despite popular belief does bother to explain its oddities in a relatively comprehensive language and the notion that it's too complex for its own good is one that I simply don't support. The fact that you'll need to re-watch it an unspecific number of times to get the gist of it might be considered a flaw in and of itself though. You make the call.\
Animation: 9/10\
In the world of Japanese animation you'll find several collaborations that are as frequent as they are benevolent. The one between Studio Ghibli and composer Joe Hisaishi is one example but seems to fade in comparison to the splendid co-operation between Satoshi Kon and animation studio Madhouse. When Paprika was first released in 2006 it looked absolutely stunning and six years later it has maintained its ability to mesmerize in its visual appeal. As the key point of the entire movie itself the visual section seems determined to observe a landscape of dreams that constantly changes based on interior and exterior events which result in a disturbing and beautiful turmoil of bizarre proportions. Just like a character mentions in the later part of the movie, there are no boundaries in dreams, a statement that the entire movie exploits in frame after frame of surreal brilliance.\
Sound: 7/10\
I really wish somebody had bothered to give Paprika a less introverted soundtrack. Admittedly, the common lack of attention-demanding music does work in favor of the atmosphere on a few occasions but some moments seem to demand a heavier instrumental focus to more properly enhance the suspense. Don't get me wrong, some scenes are complimented by interesting and memorable electronic compositions that fit in perfectly with the overall surreal approach, but judging the soundtrack in itself is a tedious chore because there isn't that much to speak of. Worth to mention though is that the voice actors maintain a relatively high quality that suits a movie of such top notch production values.\
Characters: 6/10\
So far we've been talking about all the magnificent things Paprika features but now it’s time to actually mention some of its flaws. Most experimental features are so pre-occupied when it comes to featuring cryptic commentaries on the aspects of humanity and enhance their visual exhibitions further that they forget to place a heavier focus on characterization. Thanks to the terrific script, Paprika is almost able to escape from this curse as numerous dialogues explain characteristics in ways that almost replace direct development. One example includes one of the wheelchair-bound chairmen for the company that produced the above mentioned technology used to invade dreams.\
As contrary to how a regular movie would make use of somebody in a powerful position this man seems to reject further technological advances that defile what he describes as the sanctuary of dreams. In other words he provides the moral value usually uttered by a main character only to metamorphose into a menacing antagonist who seems to have discovered the value of freedom he can only achieve in his dreams. Other examples include a surprising side story of a romantic nature and a dream world alter ego whose identity and relation to her realistic equivalent are shrouded in mystery. What needs to be said though is that all of this is based on minor implications gradually revealed throughout the story and while this in itself is an indication of skillful writing it doesn't entirely hide the fact that Paprika lacks the time to do things directly.\
Overall: 8/10\
Despite a few flaws, Paprika is intelligent enough to rely more on its visual superiority to transcend what some might call the boundaries of storytelling, making it the perfect gateway drug for those who haven't realized what the medium has to offer. In its ability to fascinate and encourage additional viewings it stands out as a remarkable feature that more than anything else is a title well worthy of being the last creation of Satoshi Kon*. If you're looking for an intellectual but comprehensive, occasionally slow-paced but intense tribute to moviemaking and the abilities of humanity, look no further.\
* Unless Madhouse actually manages to finish the movie he was currently working on before he died.\

    \"Paprika\" has quite deep symbolism and surrealism. \
And I like how \"Paprika\" concentrates in itself all of Satoshi Kon favorite images and themes: \
1) Like an escape from reality into a world of illusion or dream\
2) The devastating consequences of the invasion of illusion into reality and getting rid of these illusions\
3) The sudden realization that the difficulties can be overcome, but turned to face them\
4) Detective story filled with riddles and symbols\
5) Surrealist paintings of collective and individual insanity\
6) Adult man tired and lost in his past\
7) Young woman who live a double life and hiding from all its second, the internal and true\
          \
        \"I\".\
But I think Satoshi Kon described these all themes best right here in \"Paprika\" (that's his last finished work, by the way, before he is gone). In my opinion this is his best work after all. \
I really liked \"Paprika\". Try this one even if you didn't like his \"Perfect Blue\", for example, like myself. I think you will not be disappointed. That's quite for sure.\
Moreover there are great qualitative soundtrack, beautiful and detailed, outstanding animation.\
P.S. Sorry for not very good english, it's my third learned. But I just wanted to write some about \"Paprika\", so I hope my small review/recommendation will help somebody.\

    Apparently, this is the film that supposedly inspired Christopher Nolan's film, Inception. So already, this film has an interesting background. It is about a world where there is a machine that lets people enter your dreams. Someone missuses the machine one day and it is up to a young female to stop him.\
PROS\
A lot of people seem to be familiar with Sataoshi Kon's work in animation, as he has done other anime in the past. I, for one, have never heard of him until now. I think, for the most part, the visuals of this film are splendid and intriguing. Unfortunately, at times, they seem\
          \
        to be a bit of a mess. There will be times when there are so many things happening on screen that certain objects in the film will look better than others. It's very odd. I've never seen anything like it. But this does not take away much from the film. As a whole, the film looks very similar to any of Miyazaki's works. \
The originality of this story is very nicely written. It is no wonder that this film inspired similar films, like Inception, to be made. I have to pre-warn anyone who plans to watch this that it is a very complex storyline. You have to pay close attention to everything that is happening. If you miss even the slightest of events, you could completely lose control of what the film is about. This happened to me and I was forced to re-watch the film because of it.\
CONS\
Although I was rooting for certain characters in the film, they weren't anything special or too interesting ether. They get the job done, which is what I want in any film or anime I watch, but I do expect more. \
OVERALL\
Paprika does many unique things and goes places where other films have never been to. It isn't layered in character development and relies on the viewer to pay close attention to every detail of the story. If you are up for that, you'll probably enjoy this film.\

    Have you ever had a bad trip and then after that, sat there thinking \"holy fuck, what did I just witness?\". Paprika is like that, except a lot more crazy and a lot less \"well, that makes sense!\". Seriously, don't watch this movie unless you've forgotten how to put two and two together and want a crash course in chemical engineering that involves brain surgery. This is a film that takes what you knew about the world and pushes it off the top of the Eiffel Tower. \
Paprika follows the adventures of a dream persona and her waking world self, Dr Chiba Atsuko as they\
          \
        investigate the theft of a device called the DC Mini. Throughout, the lines between what is real and what is a dream are blurred, to the point where the two merge. Basically, this is where Inception got its idea from, except ramped up by the sum of 0 divided unto itself. Suffice it to say, Paprika is the original Inception. \
The characters are fantastic, if a bit one-note. Paprika is carefree while Dr Atsuko is strict and rule-abiding. The antagonists are self-centered and controlling, drawing on a dialogue about how people will always seek to control what they cannot because they fear a lack of control in their own lives. The cop, Toshima Konakawa, is plagued by regrets over a past unresolved. The way he handles his past and the resolution is heart-warming, if a bit cliche. \
So let's talk about the music. Something Satoshi Kon does is follows a strict rule with music in his films, and that is using music that fits the theme. In Paprika, the music fits as well as the Noire-esque music of Tokyo Godfathers and the frenzied notes of Perfect Blue. Paprika is first and foremost a whimsical film about how dreams affect us, and the music plays to that. Even in the climax, the music is whimsical and fun, much like being at a circus or watching a parade. It works because, like all of Kon's works, the music is a natural part of the film itself. \
Finally, the art. Colorful, vibrant, and yet, it has a sense of emotion to it. Every shot is full of emotion, reflecting how the characters feel or how we should interpret the world around them. The beauty of Paprika is that while it is full of color, it doesn't feel overwhelming or TOO bright. It has the right amount of energy and emotion to convey the emotions of the scene while giving the appearance of something truly beautiful.\
Before we finish, it has to be said that Paprika's weakness is teasing us with something that has yet to happen, and perhaps Kon's crowning moment. \"Dreaming Kids\" is suggested to the detective at the end of the movie by Paprika, and as he approaches the theater, posters of Kon's other works are pasted overhead. It's a personal theory of mine that while we never got \"Dreaming Kids\" per se, Kon's fifth movie was teased to us prior to production. \
Overall, it's a great film with a lot of great things, and Kon's climax in anime before he passed. If Kon had not passed, this would have been perhaps the film that came before he revolutionized anime forever. \

    Let me start off on a positive note for this movie.  This is definitely one of those movies that is more 'Art' than it is 'Entertainment'.  I feel that if you are someone that and look at a very well done painting and appreciate it for what it is, then you will love this movie. I, however, am not one of those people.\

The character development was well done and I did care for most of the people in the film by the end.  Although I admit through more than half of the film I really was not liking many of the characters.  By the end of the movie each had won me over.\

The animators really flaunt their skills in the numerous dream sequences throughout the film, and the Japanese voice cast drive it home with their emotive and textured performances. I greatly appreciated the tight knit cast, which made the story more comprehensible and personal than comparable works. This film feels very much like the Star Wars prequels, in that the director may have had free reign with limited feedback based on the outcome. I say this in part for some of\
          \
        the disconcerting imagery throughout and in part for some of themes present, which can feel a little heavy handed in the later acts.\
I had a great time with Paprika, and it may be of interest to you if you at all like beautifully animated films, anime comedy, psychological thrillers, or deep prodding ideas to contemplate. \

    Sorry for the lame english. I had heard much about Paprika and I had high hopes, but disappointed in the end. The story in general is really good and I like it, but in one point at the movie I felt there was no point, the dream world is really cool and the art and music really good, but you had to look at many things at once, scenes too full of objects, which ultimately were not looking nothing. The characters  were well developed, except at the end, when I most expected development they became \"simple\"...\
In short: good story and good characters, but at\
          \
        half the movie got out of hand.\

    To see PAPRIKA once would be a grave mistake, as it must be experienced twice, once to watch and admire its visuals that are so over the top and brought and encapsulating that it can only make sense it dreams. It outshines the dreamlike worlds of any other great animator, whether it be Walt Disney's FANTASIA or Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY. The second time one watches PAPRIKA, the visuals, though it may be difficult to do, must be downplayed and placed in our peripherals so that the film can be correctly understood, or understood as much as it can possibly be.\
The 2006 film, by acclaimed\
          \
        anime director, Satoshi Kon, begins with a bang, colors flashing and clean animation that is poppy and mind-stirring. A circus scene happens which cannot be understood in a first viewing, where detective Toshimi Konakawa is rescued by young female Paprika, after being trapped in a cage in the middle of the circus, and then escaping through a series of labyrinths and scenes, including jungle and pulp film scenes... it ends with him viewing a man getting shot down and making his escape, unidentified. He is distraught and we find out that this lack of identifying the perp hangs as a heavy burden on Konakawa's shoulders. He also hates the movies.\
To begin to backtrack a bit and provide some background on the events our eyes first witness, Doctor Atsuko Chiba, Doctor Toratarō Shima, and Doctor Kōsaku Tokita. Chiba is the occupier of alter ego, Paprika, while Doctor Shima is an elderly chief doctor, and Kōsaku Tokia belongs to the genius mind who invented the DC mini, a machine allowing the user of the device to observe dreams, and absorb others into them and enter others'. The machine was unfinished and stolen.\
Later, upon investigation and upon viewing the dream of Shima, after he goes loopy and almost kills himself by falling off of a ledge, with his mindset out of whack with his dreams causing it, Kei Himuro is spotted, who worked on the DC mini with Tokita. It is suspected he stole the machine, and it seems that he is attempting to off anybody who threatens him. Himuro is found to be an empty shell of a body, however, and the chairman is the true perpetrator. He, along with Doctor Osanai, have stolen the machine, and the absorb others into their dream, combining all, and allowing for the chairman to be a dod of the dreams, of sorts. He is able to do so because, with the machine unfinished, there is no passcode-type system to protect individuals, and they can be overtaken easily. It is similar to, if nobody had a password protected wifi, one could absorb and take any one he or she wants. The chairman can absorb and take in any dream he desires.\
Osanai turns out to be the perp, and this is all found out after a chase sequence, enlaced in wonderful pulp-fashion, and it is artsy and fun. Konakawa shoots Osanai dead and, and the action ends on a generic and purposely cheesy line, like an old film, and typical spy flick music plays and he stands with a girl in his arms, like an old JAMES BOND movie. It is very stylish. Osanai dies in real life, and it disheartens the chairman, as he has prepared to overtake his body, using him. He then manipulates the dream of Tokita and uses the best man as a counteractive weapon, and Paprika must save the day. She loves Tokita, despite her resisting the admitting of this, and this acts as her motivation. She is very much a superhero, and that adds even more of a delightful touch into this film that is already such a wonderful example of post modernism, blending in every Hollywood cliche yet. She swoops in and absorbs the chairman's body and swallows him whole, voiding this dream world, and dissolving all dream elements from the streets. She saves the day, and all is well. Later, a message from Paprika arrives on Konakawa's computer, and she suggests a film to him to see, as before his killing an discovering of Osanai as the true criminal plaguing his incurring and repeating dream, movies have been his enemy and something he despised. He is now healed of this. He walks to the theater, and the posters provide a couple of easter eggs for us Kon fans. We see, on his way, movie posters for TOKYO GODFATHERS and MILLENNIUM ACTRESS, both films also directed by the talented animator. Like it for the thriller of a story, mixed in with psychological candy, or enjoy and admire it solely for the visuals in themselves, all while not wholly understanding the film, like I was in my first viewing of MEMENTO, you are in for a good time.\

    To be really honest i didn't actually think that I would enjoyed this movie but I did anyway. I really don;t watch that much of psychological anime except for experimental lain but this made me more interested in watching more psychological anime.\
Story:\
I'll five the story a 8/10 because although some side weren't perfect it actually let me enjoy the story because as the movie goes on you begin to see the parallel within the character mind dreams, and reality as if weather you can determine if they are really asleep or awake. I love how at some part in the movie they didn't making anything\
          \
        obvious until we understood as the story progress. My favorite part of the movie is the dimension between Chiba and Paprika because they were well written with each other. I really love the fact that the movie had you thinking thought of what's bound to happen or not which why I really enjoyed this film so much.\

    Well, in my opinion plot is weak and not so plain sometimes. But you shouldn't focus on that, like you're not focusing on WHAT happens while you're dreaming instead of looking (or hearing maybe) HOW it happes.\
I don't want to call this movie and hour and a half was a bit too long for me watching this show maybe...It's more like \"animated chaos\" supported by very good soundtrack.\
\"Good\" for dancing refrigerators :)\

    Im not going into details or the background of this movie. Its just simply too awesome and I do not want to ruin a bit of it for anyone who has yet to see this movie. If you have seen Inception (2010), many ideas will instantly click when you watch Paprika. \
The art work is very vivid and colorful and this is one of the factors that makes the movie so great. The production company cut no corners in the production of this movie. However many of the scenes throughout the movie are quite trippy. \
The sound track is equally amazing. Check out the Paprika\
          \
        OST and you'll understand why. But the music is another component that makes Paprika the masterpiece that it is. \
The movie  will almost certainly captivate audiences with its audio/visual appeal.\
Overall, I must say this is a must watch movie for all Anime Fans. It is fun to watch with your family but be aware if you have children for there some elements meant for slightly older audiences. This movie is very engaging so you and your friends might engage in some serious discussion afterwards. And if you really enjoyed Inception and thought that was a mindfuck, take this one for a spin, im sure you will enjoy it too. \

    A solid film, but I was expecting something more from Satoshi Kon.\
PLOT: Extremely interesting plot – the concept of dreams has always fascinated me, so the plot of this film really did appeal to me. It’s a jumble of events as half the film takes place in the dream world where there are no rules. When dealing with peoples dreams its always going to be weird and convoluted, so its best just to go with the flow. I certainly did enjoy the ride, but now that I’m reflecting on the film I cant help but feel slightly unfulfilled. There is not nearly enough character development\
          \
        and no closure on what triggered the whole sequence of events. The characters are quirky and memorable, as you would expect, but they feel shallow and stereotyped – I find myself wishing I knew more about them and the reasons behind their avatars appearances in the dream world.  This is always a problem with movies since they are short on time, but with Paprika its particularly annoying as I felt too much time was wasted on looped scenes.\
ANIMATION: As you would expect from a film animated by MADHOUSE, Paprika is visually fantastic. An absolute riot of colour, detail and action – every frame is jam-packed and the action sequences have a brilliant sense of movement and fluidity. A small criticism is the fact that there seems to be a lot of recycled animation – most notably of the parade, it seems to appear way too often in the same sort of way. Character designs are nice, if typical of a Satoshi Kon production.\
MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Music is good – very reminiscent of Paranoia Agent, especially the title theme and the credit theme. Similarly voice acting is also good, but nothing overly spectacular.\
Overall Paprika is a very enjoyable anime film, but I have been spoiled by Satoshi Kon’s earlier work and Paprika just isn’t as good as Tokyo Godfathers, Perfect Blue or Paranoia Agent unfortunately.\

    I was very interested in the core concept of Paprika and began watching it with an interest that I feel only fellow anime watchers can understand.  An outlandish feeling of being taken somewhere else.  Somewhere you never knew existed and although it's scary and disturbing it's also amazing and full of joy.  \
The music of Paprika is, if not the best, certainly up there with the greats that can only be described as the music of the animes.  The mixture of plot, art and sound in this incredible display is the what makes Paprika stand out.  \
Although, I must admit,\
          \
        it's not the best anime I have seen, it's definitely one of the best.  Throughout the viewing you will feel awed and surreal.  The concept of dreams is of course a subject which is of vast interest to most people, but here it is taken to a level that allows you to realize the power that they possess and the consequences they can deliver.  \
I do not want to spoil anything so I will say no more, except that the music of the march inspired me deeply and moved my soul.\

    After reading some polarized reviews of Paprika I went into this movie not knowing exactly what to expect and I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.\
The visuals are absolutely stunning and the amount of detail in some of the scenes are astounding. This movie is a treat for the eyes and ears as the music is amazing as well, but i'll get back to that in a second. Some of the dream sections in the movie are just mind blowing with everything that's going on and even if you don't always know exactly what's going on in these scenes you are enjoying if\
          \
        none the less and you feel like you've really been on a journey by the time the credits roll.\
The music is really memorable and never failed to impress me. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack right now and I can't get enough of it! The use of Vocaloid fits really well and adds a lot to this already catchy, but still epic soundtrack.\
The plot itself is a little predictable, especially when it came to the villains, but its still an interesting concept and the main cast of characters are a fun bunch. I really liked the main characters split personality with Paprika being a full fleshed character of her own an not just a part of Dr. Chiba. \
Overall this movie is a great watch with fantastic visuals and an amazing soundtrack and also a cool story that makes for some mind bending scenes in the dream world. 9/10 Would recommend to anyone.  \

    This is not going to be a helpful review. Because I didn't even know what the heck did I watch. No offense to the people who watch this movie.\
I can't get my head into the story plot when I watched this movie. For the first 30 minutes of the story, I often found myself struggling to understand what is going on. It is like watching a movie with a full long riddle. Unfortunately, either I am too dumb or my imagination isn't high enough I can't get myself to like the story for the first 30 minutes. However, I did braced myself to watch the\
          \
        entire story, and I glad I did. At least I can get my head back into the plot line and understand better about what is going on actually with each of the important characters that are involved.\
What I like :\
- The art is good and does not get bored to watch.\
- This movie is unique, unlike any other movie that I've watched so far. I kinda like the whole storyline.\
-I somewhat kinda like the way the story ends where the beauty got together with the beast (no offense). Anime nowadays often pair the beauty with the same par, or often with a guy that is far more attractive. No offense to all those fat guys out there, but you guys also deserve to be with an attractive woman right?\
What I dislike :\
- The characters, their roles are important in the storyline, but the same time I often kinda feel their significances are not enough, such as Himuro and Tokita.\
- It might has less value to be re-watched. I am wondering now if I ever would want to watch this movie again.\
Overall : \
I don't even know what I've written, because my mind probably kinda fucked up and I might have nightmares for a day or two after watching this movie. This movie is probably worth your time to watch if you like stories with high imagination, fantasies and stuff like that. But for me, maybe I'm gonna re-upload the movie somewhere for backup purpose, and delete the file on my computer as I might not want to watch it ever again.\
