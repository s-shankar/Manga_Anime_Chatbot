    I'm glad I waited until this series was finished before I started. Considering I finished all 108 chapters in less than twenty-four hours, I'm not sure how I would have survived if I'd started earlier.\
STORY - Morals and ethics are serious business, and it isn't often that they're addressed so directly in a series. The lines that people draw vary greatly from individual to individual, and the last thing any writer wants is to severely offend any portion of its potential readership. I found it incredibly impressive then, that Death Note could so effectively address such a controversial issue -- capital punishment -- without alienating\
          \
        anyone in the audience. Wrapped up and packaged with some rather generic supernatural elements, Death Note may not seem like anything particularly special at first glance, but the eerie realism in the rest of the world begs the question, 'What would you have done?' And I find that connection one of this story's greatest strengths.\
Despite the flexibility of his manga though, Ohba's personal morals and overall message is clear. All the same, if his primary intention was for readers to think and contemplate the issue, then he certainly succeeds, regardless of whether individuals agree with his views or not. He doesn't offend them with his opinions, and that's good enough. Death Note's story progresses rapidly and quickly spirals into a very involved suspense; it's a tension-filled chess game that the protagonist and antagonist carefully play (which character is the protagonist depends entirely on your point of view). Yes, there are many more words than actions, and yes, it can be frustrating, and even comical at times, how long the chains of 'I knew that you knew that I knew that you knew' become. But these words and lengthy passages of expository serve their purpose and keep you on the edge of your seat, and it's obvious from the beginning that this ain't no shounen title.\
Sadly, I've found that a lot of readers stopped halfway through the series, citing that the tension ramped off severely after the major spoiler. While I understand their position, I would disagree and honestly applaud Ohba for breaking through everyone's expectations with said spoiler. If anything, the uncertainty that's left behind and the vague impression that there's already a winner in the battle for justice makes the latter half of the series that much more interesting, even if the absence of certain things may be a blow. The stakes are higher. It's the last stretch of the race. Up until the very end, Ohba is able to keep the ultimate victor a secret. Those last forty seconds waiting for the last few names written into the Death Note to die? Killer. You'll breeze through the pages, but your heart will still be pounding afterwards. And it's all worth it in the end.\
CHARACTERS - Death Note had a fantastic cast of characters, and you really find yourself emotionally evolved. You feel for them. You love them. You hate them. You hate them. I find it to be a sign of incredible character writing and development when you can come to hate a characters as much as I hated Light Yagami. Mediocre characters just don't invite that much attention. So I didn't hate Light because he was a bad character; I hated him because of his personality, his morals, his reasons and logic, and the way he used his intellect. It didn't start off that way though. Light progresses a lot during the course of the series; his arrogance heightens, and his character warps. In a way, it was incredibly realistic and fascinating to watch as his personality and growing neuroticism turned him into a sociopath (not to mention frustrating, when certain things about him are revealed). It was also kind of scary. Seriously though, there's no denying that Light is a well thought-out character, and as much as I love to hate him, I can't help but think he's the most well-written character in the series.\
L, as the antagonist/protagonist, is just about everything that Light is not, but that isn't as clear-cut as it may seem. As noted by several of the series' other characters, L's tactics can be rather questionable, and so even though his ultimate goal is to defeat Kira/Light, even his morals are not spotless. This adds another degree of realism to the story and provides for a very interesting foil. Additionally, L's personality quirks are some of the most interesting and endearing ones I've ever seen, though this may serve to cancel out the previous realism points for some people. As much of his past remains mysterious for the duration of the series, L's personality does not seem to progress or change as much as Light's. Still, the way he adapts and reacts to each of Light's changes definitely keeps things interesting.\
The rest of the cast seems to be scattered across the moral spectrum, providing readers with many choices as to who to sympathize with or to relate to. Detective Soichiro Yagami is likely the most moralistic of the lot, though not unrealistically so. His relationship with his son is fun to follow throughout the series, considering their vast differences. Most of the other detectives are also clustered on the 'ideal' end of the spectrum, though there's enough variation and personality quirk that they manage to establish meaningfully different personas (ie, they're all definitely different characters, even though their roles are fairly interchangeable). Misa's morals are more difficult to assess as they seem incredibly flexible; rather than morals, her character is defined by her utter infatuation with Light. I find this interesting mainly because it started off as an infatuation with Kira, but once she learned of Kira's identity, her affections were transferred to Light as Light rather than Light as Kira. Because of her lack of a moral standing and the one-dimensional nature of her 'love' though, it's incredibly easy to lose interest in Misa, despite her importance as a tool in the grand scheme of things (this is also true for Takada and to some extent, Mikami). The lack of development in her 'love' is also what made Rem not-as-interesting to me.\
Now, Mello and Near. I kind of feel like Ohba tried too hard to mirror the quirkiness of L's character, what with Mello's apparent obsession with chocolate and Near's with toys. Still, both of them grew on me, and I was satisfied enough with the way they played their parts. And finally, there's Ryuk. What's there to say? As probably the only character with no real ultimate goal, he serves as kind of an objective bystander throughout the course of the series. He doesn't care one way or another as long as things are 'interesting.' Because of his attachment to the Note given to Light, he does end up helping Kira now and again, but I don't think that hurts his objectivity all that much in the end. In a series rife with moral and ethics, it was ironic to have the character that started it all so removed from all the conflict.\
There were no useless characters in Death Note. All of them contributed in one way or another to the series as a whole, either by offering a variation in moral standing or by acting as a tool for another character to use. Sure, there were a few generic archetypes (the butler, the love-stricken slave, the vengeful widow), but I suppose there just wasn't enough depth to go around when the two main characters take up so much of the spotlight. God, I ramble a lot.\
ART - Obata draws beautiful stuff, no question about that. From his wonderfully detailed backgrounds to the wide variety of character expressions (including Light's five hundred different creepy smirks), this artist's incredible prowess is evident throughout all twelve volumes of the series. Angles and perspective are expertly rendered and the meticulous attention he pays to each character definitely makes up for the fact that there are a lot of talking heads in Death Note. The human world is wonderfully realistic while the shinigami world offers everything you might expect from the supernatural. Character designs vary from being very simple -- Light and L -- to being very complex -- Misa and the shinigamis -- but all are well done. It's an incredible treat to go through this manga as the artwork is definitely up to par with the sophistication of the story.\
OTHER - I've yet had a chance to read Viz's translation of this, so I can't really say much about its English adaptation unfortunately. :< I've heard pretty decent things about it though. Other than that, I really wish I could review the first two live action movies on this site because they were incredibly impressive and are two of the few book-to-film adaptations that satisfied my rampant purist ways, despite significant changes.\
OVERALL - Death Note has probably impressed me more than any other manga I've read (which isn't any incredible number, but still). Its degree of sophistication in all categories, story, characters, and artwork, is incredible. The story is significant; the characters are engaging; the artwork is beautiful. It's like hitting the jackpot, and I really feel like this is one of those titles that almost anyone can enjoy; better yet, I feel like this is one of those titles that can act as a gateway for the not-yet-a-manga-fan, encouraging them to explore the media further. Yeah, there's a lot of hype around Death Note, and they're definitely milking it for what it's worth (an anime, three live action movies, video games, and several spin-offs, all in the course of what, two or three years?), but for once, I think this series deserves every bit of attention it gets. Don't take the numbers on this review too lightly. I don't give 10's that often.",

    Alright, first let me say that, the manga is infinitely better than the anime. INFINITELY. But, with that being said, I believe the manga should have ended at chapter 58/59. After that, it's just a crapload of \"yeah-right\" and \"ooookay\" and \"bullshit\". Seriously, I hated the second half of the story. However, the first half was so ridiculously good, that I just couldn't give the manga a bad score.\
With that being said, on to the details.\
Story\
Brilliant. I can't think of anything else that has even come close to something like this. Entertaining, smart, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You'll want to\
          \
        read the chapter after chapter to find out what happens next.\
Art\
Looks good to me. Figures are drawn well and the females were good looking.\
Character\
By far, the best part of this show. The characters were...alive. You felt like you really \"knew\" the people. Almost like reading a book there was so much detail. There aren't any that follow a typical \"stupid\" or \"cliche\" trademark either. Thank god.\
Enjoyment\
Well, as I said, I didn't enjoy the second half of the story. After the first half, my enjoyment level plummeted. Read the second half, if only just to say you have.\
Overall\
Do yourself a favor and stop after chapter 57-59. You'll enjoy the manga a lot more and probably be happy with a well thought out ending (as opposed to the chapter 108 thrown together ending).\

    Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? \
A: Death Note. \
The protagonist, and his adversary, are both genius pretty boys (with the odd names of Light and L) who have an incredible amount of achievements and skill for their young age. Light somehow predicts things that he could not possibly have the foresight to predict, because, you know, probability is a thing. Don’t worry though, it’s not like you know that he’ll always win, because L possesses this exact same unexplained and ludicrous ability to predict the future; he just does so without a cheesy \"Just as planned!\" catchphrase\
          \
        that makes me want to shoot myself every-time it graces my ears. In this way, rather than being a dark and mysterious thriller, Death Note often manages to be an overblown mental mudslinging contest between two impossibly perfect master practitioners of bullshit who are both describable in a single sentence. This is epitomized in an early scene where the two, who both have tennis skills at a professional level, get into a match and engage in a ridiculously drawn-out internal line of logic about how the desire to not lose might relate to the true identity of the other. \
\
Furthermore, what kind of psychological mystery thriller has a plot entirely driven by coincidences, improbabilities, and impossibilities? Again, Death Note. Plot devices like this were used every-time the manga found itself in a narrative corner, and these cop-outs always completely killed the tension that was built up to that point, while simultaneously disengaging the plot from the audience. \
\
The concept was intriguing, and I won’t say it did not entertain me at some parts, but it was ultimately far too flawed in its execution to be called enjoyable or good overall, and it never managed to pull off the promise of its premise. It seemed overdone at times, with eye-roll worthy developments, and lines like \"I take a potato chip and eat it!\" delivered with the utmost significance and conviction, devoid of any irony or self-awareness. Light’s ability, of writing a name in a notebook as a method of killing, is initially well established and limited, while being relatively creative, although you would think he’d be able to do a bit more with it, but the way the new rules of the note are introduced as the story goes on can get a tad contrived.\
\
Characterization quality is somewhat varied, but I would say that it's generally not all that good. It was bad, really. Light is a bit too perfect, his only flaws being the well-concealed logical results of his perfection, such as his narcissism and overconfidence. It could be argued that this flawlessness was intentionally done in an effort to depict the deconstruction of a seemingly perfect human being, but I think this concept eventually fell flat. It would have been far more interesting to see an average teenager find the note and watch the scope of his ambitions and arrogance develop over time. Light is arrogant, ambitious, and a staunch consequentialist from the very outset; this, logically, kills almost all opportunity for development. As for the rest of the characters, L was far more interesting and entertaining than Light, although he was even more unrealistic, evoking the child prodigy and boy detective clichés among other things; I mostly found myself rooting for him rather than the protagonist. Light's eventual \"girlfriend\" falls in love with him, to the extent of obsession, right away, as the plot commands it, and this insufficiently-explored obsession with him defines her entire character. There is absolutely nothing to her besides that, despite her eventually becoming one of the most significant characters in the series. In all actuality, the motivations for most characters, besides the protagonist and the Shinigami, are hazy at best and, with the exception of L, none of them are interesting in the slightest. \
\
Death Note has some religious symbolisms and themes, which are underplayed and done well until a forced Christ allegory towards the middle, but this all kind of falls apart in the second half and all of the symbolism quickly vanishes into thin air. To make matters more dire, the already limited development of the protagonist stagnates and his adversary is quickly replaced by two identical, yet duller and less compelling, copies. At the same time, while the developments and additional rules to Light’s ability in the first half were often a bit contrived, they were usually better than nothing; pretty much all evolution stops in the second half, and it only gets worse. The manga essentially loses everything that it ever had going for it, and it then lies fallow in that inadequate stage for the remainder of the plot, all leading up to an anticlimactic conclusion that the audience knew was coming from the very beginning. The manga would have lost nothing to speak of had that conclusion come around 4 volumes earlier than it did. Therefore, as the plot progressed, it increasingly lost its higher significance and simultaneously started to wear thin the initial appeal of its premise. \
\
The art is arguably the strongest, or least flawed, aspect of Death Note, the character design being particularly astounding, with the exception of a couple characters introduced in the second half whose designs were either dumb-looking or recycled. The art is generally pretty atmospheric and it never skimps on detail out of convenience, although not much detail is required in the first place. The design of the main antagonist, while understated, is particularly impressive due to the fact that he manages to be very aesthetically appealing, despite the ridiculous heroin chic vibe that the audience gets from him. It is usually pretty stellar, although side characters aren't all that detailed. \
\
In the end, what Death Note did accomplish was hackneyed and not all that original; it could not be called \"deep\" nor was it ever cutting-edge in the grand scheme of things. The coincidences and general improbabilities that drove the plot bar it from being called \"realistic,\" more than the out-there premise ever could. That said, it should be given some credit for featuring a true antihero, who is still often admired by the audience, and ultimately not being afraid to portray him as pathetic. It also never used the character’s high school age as an excuse to throw light school-life hijinks into the plot. But these positive qualities unfortunately failed to have too much influence in the industry, and they are additionally outweighed by negatives in the universe of the manga itself. Code Geass, a blatant Death Note rip-off, wasted no time at all in taking every single good Death Note did and flipping it all on its head. I might recommend Death Note, if only for the first half, but only with a warning that it fell apart and that even the first half is not as great as it's often made out to be. You honestly might be best off watching the first half and simply skimming the plot summary of the second, because it has nothing of value to offer the reader beyond that point.\
Note: This is mostly a modified version of my review for the anime. They follow the same storyline and suffer from the same fundamental issues. \

    Death note is a perfect manga of suspence and thriller. The story line is rich and tasteful and characters really standout from other manga and anime by the fact that they are so different. while reading Death note it will make you think and guess until the end. This manga is has dark themes because the main character basically goes on a killing spree for 6 years to create the perfect world and outsmart this foes.\

    There are a limited number of manga series that can be considered worldwide hits. Rather surprisingly, considering the amount of dialogue and seriousness of a story that the author had doubted would be accepted as a Shounen (young boy) Jump title even in Japan, Death Note became one of those titles. When a story about someone in our world finding a killing tool Death Gods use (and killing anyone they view as evil with to create a better world) becomes so successful it's a little special - it isn't every day that a story where words and not fists are used as weapons becomes this\
          \
        popular. Death Note has become so popular that there have even been stories on the American news about kids at school getting suspended after notebooks were found on them with details of deaths written inside!\
My first encounter with Death Note was with the anime. I saw discussions about it on a forum I used to visit frequently just after the anime started airing in Japan and what I read interested me, a lover of dark and depressing stories, enough to download the first episode. I was blown away by the quality of the story, the mix of real world and fiction blending superbly. Every episode thrilled me more than the last during the first section of the story, never allowing me to remove myself from the edge of my seat. I watched all 37 episodes weekly and was very rarely disappointed.\
Fast forwarding to the recent past, I discovered a Death Note manga box set was coming out by chance. Each  of the volumes has a different coloured spine, with an image of a different Death God at the top of each of the spines. The covers all have the same theme: a cross, one or two characters shown and faint Death Note rules in the background, with each cover using a different coloured background. The art inside the books is truly wonderful; clearly benefiting from Death Note having had one person work on the story and another on the art. The characters expressions are amazing, with the artist clearly being very good at showing extreme emotions. The only problem with the art I spotted was with the early drawings of the Kira investigation team members being poor, the reason for this being that the artist didn't know during the early stages if they were important characters or not.\
After only recently reading volume 1-27 of Naruto and seeing the author of that series use the pages in-between the chapters to reveal lots about himself, what disappointed me about the volumes wasn't the covers - it was the lack of extras. The author of Death Note seems to have used a pen name, meaning he or she didn't want to reveal too much, which seems to be the reason behind the author not adding any information about his/her life in-between the chapters. Sure, there are a few Death Note rules in-between the chapters, but most of the rules aren't very interesting...reading about the experiences of the author would've been much better.\
I can now finally get into what matters: the story. Death Note is, as you can doubt work out from the name alone, one that deals with death on a regular basis. It starts with Light Yagami, a genius student who finds life all too easy, finding a notebook that a Death God dropped into the human world out of boredom. Light's initial reaction was to not take the notebook or the rules written inside it seriously, but he soon came to the horrifying realization that the notebook wasn't a joke when, out of curiosity, he wrote down the name of someone who was holding kids hostages in a school - the person died from a heart-attack 40 seconds after the name had been wrote down, just as the Death Note rules stated. Once Light paid attention to the rules, he understood that he could make anyone have a heart attack if, with their face in mind, he wrote down their name, or he could be more creative and specify exactly how they die.\
From there, Light quickly overcame his fear and started to think about how he could better the world with this power. He was bored with his life prior to finding the Death Note and was disgusted with a world where criminals escaped punishment time and time again, so the Death Note made him happier than he'd ever been once he got over the fact that he'd actually killed another human. But, as you'd expect, Light wasn't doing this purely out of the goodness of his cold heart: he wants to become the God of the new world he plans to create with the power of the Death Note. As Ryuk (the Death God who dropped the notebook) accurately points out at the start, even if Light manages to accomplish his goal he would have to write his own name in at the end since he would be the last 'evil' person alive.\
Much to the frustration of Light and the joy of suspense lovers worldwide, an enemy who could stop him was quick to stand in his way, the enemy being someone called L; the greatest detective in the world. Light's arrogance and temper allowed L to stun Light in their very first encounter, and from that point onwards a psychological battle between the two got underway. Light/Kira (what he comes to be known as by the public) wants to discover the name and face of L in order to kill him, while L wants to find out who Kira is and capture him. Both hide behind masks and, with Light able to kill anyone he knows the name and face of, the battle between the two is not without many twists and turns as the two geniuses try to outwit the other.\
Death Note is mostly very well written and thrilling to read. The first 34-36(ish) chapters are all brilliant, the best manga I've read. The quality does then drop during the Yotsuba section for a fair few chapters, with comedy and needless chatter taking away from the seriousness and slowing down the story, but the story returns to being epic before too long and then hits its highest point with the tear-inducing finale to the first half of the story. Then, once the second half of the story gets going, it starts out exciting but the quality quickly deteriorates and the pacing becomes very poor, with far too much needless chatter taking up space. And, after a lengthy period of boring chapters, the story resumes being thrilling near chapter 80 and this time it doesn't stop until the very end - the author seemed to rediscover the magic that made the first section of the story so amazing.\
I suppose it's fair to call Death Note a bit of a mixed bag due to how the quality shifts from stunning to average from time to time, but the best parts of the story more than make up for the less interesting parts. I don't even think the areas I've described as average were that bad, they just don't have the wow factor the best sections of the story have.\
What makes Death Note stand out in my mind is how well the author depicts our world. The Death Note world is bleak, depressing and full of people who don't deserve to live - just like our world. Whilst reading, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if a Death Note appeared in our world: would people still say killing is wrong or, as the world changed as more and more criminals died and crime reduced dramatically, would Kira become a God in the eyes of people? It's a question we'll never know the answer to but it's pretty interesting thinking material for a Shonen Jump title to provide readers.\
The author has made a lot of surprising comments in interviews, the two most attention grabbing being that he/she supposedly only had up to chapter 3 planned when he/she started and that he/she didn't intend to send out a message with the story. It's fascinating that someone could write such an intelligent story with so little forward planning and create so many in-depth discussions about topics such as good and evil when the author only intended to create an entertaining story. Using myself as an example of someone who reads more into Death Note than the author intended, I've always thought the message Death Note sends out is clear: it's not possible for a human to reach the realm of God, no matter how perfect the person who tries may be.\
With the story parts done and dusted, there is one more important area I need to talk about: the characters. Death Note has a cast of characters that start out complete, which is highly unusual. Everything you need to know about Light is revealed in the first chapter (he's intelligent, selfish and has a God complex), L is an eccentric genius with no social skills (no development needed), Misa is a simple woman who is obsessed with Kira due to her past and everything you need to know about the important members of the Kira investigation team is clear from their personalities. It would've been nice if, for example, a few flashbacks to L's past had been included, but it wasn't necessary for either the plot or his character, and the same can be said about the others. I mean, did we need to see a flashback of Light's past that tried to make him into a more sympathetic character? It would've ruined his character; he's supposed to be a character that cares only about himself, not one who started hating others because of a tragic event or something.\
There is one fairly big character negative that needs to be mentioned and, due to the risk of spoilers, I'm going to have to be vague. A character who enters the story in the second half starts out by doing everything he can in order to be the best, even going as far as using and killing others to reach his goal. But, near the end, he does something illogical that goes against his character, and that illogical action resulted in the story ending how it does. So, at the expense of the character, the author used him in order to reach the conclusion he/she she wanted. Even though I love the ending, it's bad writing for a character to do something out of character for the sake of the story.\
...Anyway, since this review has gone on for far longer than I intended already, I'm going to attempt to end this after I touch on one more issue: The anime. In my eyes, the anime is the best manga adaptation in existence - it's near enough perfect in my eyes. Madhouse (the studio behind the anime) made the experience far better with the perfect choice of colour, great 'camera angles', small additions that made certain scenes far more dramatic (such as a certain evil grin in episode 25) and a FAR better second half of the story. Madhouse did the best thing they could've done when they removed all the boring chatter out of the second half of the story - they turned what was slow-paced and boring into something fast-paced and exciting. The ONLY thing they did wrong was changing the ending slightly. Also, I have to mention that Death Note has the best soundtrack I've ever heard (I still listen to it even now) and the best Japanese voice acting performance I've heard.\
To sum it all up, Death Note is brilliant and no-one should miss out on reading/seeing it. If you're the sort of person who likes to see a review end with a rating, 8/10 is the rating I give it. I think it's fair that the (in my opinion) inferior manga receives a slightly lower rating than the anime. Although I want to go into more detail, the review has gone on for longer than I intended already and time is getting on, so I'm going to stop here. I hope whoever reads this finds it at least a little bit helpful!\

    I don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece... I guess I'll start by proclaiming Death Note as my favorite story ever. Almost everything about Death Note is perfect. The plot is enjoyable, creative, and deep. The characters are well-developed, interesting, and symbolic. The art is fantastic, fitting, and realistic. My enjoyment and fascination aspect for this manga is beyond description. If you haven't read this manga, or watched the anime (which by the way is a great adaptation of the manga) then I suggest you drop whatever you're doing right now, and go read/watch Death Note as soon as possible. I can promise\
          \
        you that you will not regret. But remember, when you read or watch Death Note, turn your thinking caps on and pay attention to the details in art, you'll realize all the symbolism going on, references to the bible, and other religious aspects. \
Now, in Death Note, there are lots of philosophical questions about our reality, that the readers must consider before reading, while reading, and after reading. (I'm going to write a whole load of questions, since I thought about so many things while reading Death Note.) Are all human lives equal? What truly is life? What are people's role in life? To what extent can people shape their own destiny, and how much is down to fate? What truly is death, and where do we go after death? Is the world we're living in pure, or rotten? What's making the world pure/rot? What's human nature, and how can people overcome the disgusting side/temptations inside of them? How can we tell apart \"right\" from \"wrong\", \"good\" from \"evil\"? Human beings created the ambiguous terms, \"right, wrong, good, evil\" and everyone interprets these terms according to their own philosophies, so there's no \"correct\" definition; then how can people truly consider themselves more \"right\" and \"good\" over others? What makes a crime, a crime? What is justice, and what is \"fair\" justice? Who should be able to decide the fate of criminals? Is the death penalty truly a humane, and fair punishment method? Is murder always wrong? Religion, which belief is truly correct in reality? Lots of philosophical questions right? That's just scratching the surface of all the psychological concepts the anime delves into.\
Death Note is actually (sort of) told from the view point of a Shinigami (Death God), named Ryuk. Ryuk's world, the Shinigami realm is just a rotting world with the repetition of everyday life. Seeking an adventure, a way out of boredom, Ryuk purposely drops his Death Notebook into the human realm, Earth. What is the Death Note? The Death Note is the deadliest mass-murder weapon in human history; any person's name that's written in the notebook (writer has to have the face of the person he/she's writing down) shall die within 40 seconds of their name being written in the Death Note. Our main character, Light Yagami, a genius high school student happens to stumble upon the Death Note one day after school. At first, he didn't believe that the Death Note's power was real, but out of boredom, he tested it out by writing the name of a criminal who was being shown on TV in the Notebook. 40 seconds later, the criminal is announced to have died. Knowing of this ultimate power that he's obtained, Light Yagami vows to use the Notebook for justice. Light Yagami's dream is to kill all the criminals in the world, and create a utopia in which mankind will be able to live in peace and harmony, while Light himself rules as \"God\" of the new world. But the question of arises, \"Is what Light Yagami doing, righteous, or evil?\" Certainly Light believes that his dream is righteous, because he's ridding the world of \"evil\" and making the world a safer place for the \"good\". In public, people begin to take notice of all these mysterious criminal murders, and they give this unknown murderer the name, \"Kira\" (this would be Light) derived from the English world, Killer. But the world's greatest detective, L Lawliet doesn't seem to be very fond of Light Yagami's ideals. L Lawliet believes that murdering any other human being (even criminals are people) is an act of evil and that Kira is nothing more than a psychopathic murderer. And so,  the entire premise of Death Note is a ingenious cat - and - mouse game between Light Yagami and L Lawliet, with Ryuk spectating our human world. Who will win, \"Justice\"? Or \"Justice\"?\
Is the plot original? Yup. Is the plot enjoyable? Yup. Yup. Is the plot well-written with little to almost no plot-holes? Yup. Is the plot tragic? Yes. Is there a deeper meaning behind the story, with lots of symbolism? Yup. Is the story ambiguous in order to let the reader decide for themselves what they believe the answers to those philosophical questions are? Yup. Does the end of the manga end in a cliffhanger? Yes and No. Is it honestly all that great? Yup, Greatest manga ever. The plot-holes were kept to a minimum and they never affected the overall plot; I can't really think of any plot-holes actually, everything was important and well-developed/explained. The pacing of the manga was perfect, the attention-grasping beginning, to the subtle deeper theme/developing plot alongside great plot-twists, that eventually help create the ideal climax of the story, and then the very tragic downfall and ending that made me cry. What made the manga so enjoyable was not only the well-written, suspenseful, exciting criminal-detective chasing thriller aspect, but also the addition of lots of genius literature symbols and narrations to help solidify the deeper symbols/meanings of the entire plot. \
The biggest question in the anime really is: \"Is what Light doing good/righteous/moralistic?\"\
Often in great literature, the main character is some sort of ambiguous character (hero more often than not), that has an unachievable dream and gets lost along the way of achieving the dream due to multiple problems: harshness of reality, greed, temptation (usually a woman, but can be any thing else: serpent) and ends up becoming a tragic figure that's meant to send the readers a deep message. Such was the case of Death Note's main character, Light Yagami. Light Yagami was a teenage boy who had everything. His family was financially stable, he had a loving family, he had the good-looks, he had the popularity, he had the brains, and he had a bright future ahead of him (#1 student in all of Japan). But there was something missing to Light Yagami's life, and that was a sense of personal happiness and acceptance of reality. Light Yagami viewed our reality as repetitive, rotten, and repulsive. Everyday life of going to school, going home, hanging out with friends on permanent repeat, but not only that, on T.V, the same news on permanent repeat: War tensions between countries, crimes happening all over the place, disgusting people always joking about disgusting things. What does the justice system do? Nothing, there's no stop to these violent, inhumane acts. Light Yagami wanted to change our reality into a better place, and be \"justice\" itself. But obviously he didn't have the power to do achieve his dreams.. Until he found the Death Note. The Death Note is the forbidden apple, the temptation in Light's case. It's human nature to not be able to overcome temptation/desires, and so Light uses the Death Note to kill the \"vermin\" (people that he judges to be \"evil\") from the world. But what makes a person truly evil, isn't that different per everyone's belief? Light taking the bite out of the forbidden apple (use of Death Note) opened Light's eyes, deceiving him into thinking that he could become a God that could determine good apart from evil (Ryuk is the temptation serpent). And just as Ryuk warned, Light would not live a happy live for making that mistake (of giving into temptation), thus, the fall of man due to sin (Book of Genesis). Light's once pure dream of making the world a better place became corrupt along the way due to the overwhelming power of the Death Note, the magnitude of his dreams, and his greed for survival ---> becoming a God. Light Yagami is not merely an ambiguous figure, but he's a religious and even deeper character than most people realize. Light's name is \"Light\" for a reason. He is that one \"light\" that Ryuk is waiting for, to die out. Ryuk's body is that of a crow, with crow feathers flying all over the place; this symbolizes what crows to before eating their prey, they wait until the prey dies out. \"Light\" on Earth becoming corrupt and eventually dying out is one important theme to look out for. Light represents a Godlike-Angel, The Devil, and a mere human being. Light wanted to protect the innocent people, create a utopia and become a father figure for the world (Jesus), but unfortunately in his attempt to achieve his naive dream, he became the Devil (Masqueraded Angel of Light, Father of Lies) and killed innocents, contradicting his original pure goal. But Light in the end, is still a human. \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" This was the very case for Light. It's in human nature to want to seek adventure, to survive, be tempted to try something, be greedy for more, and achieve your dreams no matter what it takes. That's all I'll say about Light. (SO MUCH MORE TO SAY!)\
L Lawliet, the other main character has the word, \"Law\" in his name, because he believes that following the \"law\" that human beings created is the righteous way to approach criminal acts in the world. But is that truly effective? L and Light are the ultimate foils for each other; while Light had everything he could have wanted in life, L had absolutely nothing. L had no family (therefore obviously a financially unstable, and harsh childhood), L had no good-looks, L had no friends, and L had no trust/love from anyone. L wanted to protect the people of the world by following the laws set by the people, even the people that didn't trust/like L. He came, served, cared, protected and ______ (Jesus). The plot may have been focused upon the cat - mouse chase, but due to some astonishing plot-twists, L and Light end up teaming up together to catch Kira (^o^ confused?).  Despite their complete opposite philosophies, and distrust for one another, there's always a sense of growing bondship/friendship/brotherhood between these 2, which really adds a lot to the overall plot. \
Ryuk and Misa Amane, are two characters whose importance to the entire manga are often overlooked. Misa Amane in Death Note was quite the interesting character, because unlike almost all, if not all great literature, she (the female) was subject to temptation of love (of Light, the male). Misa Amane lost everything in her life, her happiness and in the end, ____ because of her unrequited love for Light Yagami, who really was also the serpent in a way. Ryuk giving Misa Amane a rotten apple telling Misa that it would grant her a wish (and she taking a bite out of it), was very symbolic. It symbolized the poisonous apple from Sleeping Beauty; the apple does not actually grant any happiness/wishes, it's in reality poison. Ryuk is the crow-like devil waiting for \"light\" to die out in the human world, and for corruption and darkness to take over. \
Melo and Near, L's students receive a lot of hate from readers because of their inability to be as great as L, and because of what they do to Light Yagami. I will not get into detail about these 2, because of what they did to Light Yagami, my hero. \
The art in Death Note was nothing short of amazing. The minor details that went into each scene mood-fitting wise, and symbolically were amazing. The portrayal of each character, Light = handsome, seems like a perfect boy, L = irregular, ostracized boy, Misa = Beautiful girl whose dumb enough to give into temptation of Light's Love, Ryuk = a crow-like devil, and Melo-Near = Each have a resemblance to L in both looks and behavior; they both take after their sensei. The hints of religious symbolism with the cross glowing behind him, the heavenly light shining upon him, and the stairs (that usually represent ascent and descent, often times from one to another) that symbolize descent from innocence romanticized dreams to knowing the horrors of reality/realistic dreams, when ____ dies was a marvelous artistic touch that added all sorts of deep concepts/hidden messages to the manga. \
The ending of each chapter will definitely have you wanting to write your name in a Death Note for more. The conceptual questions I mentioned in the earlier part of this review are definitely some questions you have to keep in mind and watch for what the writer/creator, Tsugumi Ohba has to say about each. This may be a bit far-fetched, but do you think that Shinigami and Shinigami world really existed? I felt like the Shinigami's boredom, thirst for adventure and change was a reflection of Light Yagami's thoughts (no one that doesn't know Light's thoughts sees Ryuk), and the Shinigami realm was a reflection of the human world; repetition of everyday and slowly rotting away. Ultimately, the nativity of Light's romanticized dreams are not possible in reality, and while showing the concept of romanticized Vs Realistic, the anime delves into Life/Justice/Evil/Right/Wrong/Death/Religious concepts; truly a genius piece of writing that EVERYONE should read. A perfect 10/10, and still this rating doesn't do this manga justice. I also recommend watching the anime adaptation of Death Note, very well-done.\

    Light Yagami is the perfect student, probably the smartest you'll ever see.  He picks up a Death Note on his way home from school and his life is changed forever.  He goes on a killing spree by ridding the world of all evil (or what he deems evil, rather).  A detective named L Lawliet decided that this was too much, and stepped in to end Light's killing spree.  They fight a long battle of wits!\
The second arc comes along, a wannabe named Near and a chocoholic named Mello become the new protagonists (well actually Mello is more of an anti-hero). \
          \
        Anyway, they challenge Light (who is still trying to kill these evil guys).  But Light is very smart, how will they be able to put a stop to reign of evil?  The only way to find out is...\

    I cannot help but love this manga. I first read it in Shonen Jump magazine a long time ago. I still have it here somewhere. Since that first chapter I went crazy and had to know what happens.\
It draws you in fast, because of the many twists and the amazing minds and strategies the two main characters use against each other. Its like a literal battle of the gods or good and evil.\
Its also very deep, you get to know these characters and things happen that you wont expect.\
I can't say much without spoiling it. But if you enjoyed the anime check out the manga.\

    At first I didn't want to read Death Note because people were telling me not to. They said it was boring and all the main character did was kill people by writing their name in his note book. If you know people like this, don't listen to them. I picked up volumes one through three in my school library, read them, decided to keep reading and now I'm a fan of the series.\
The story is good, it's not the greatest thing ever. It includes a lot of talk and content that makes you think, if you're not into this then maybe you should pass it\
          \
        up. Anyways, it's basically the same thing back and forth between Light and L but you become intrigued to see what happens next every step of the way. There are a few intense moments during the story but that's about it.\
The art style isn't amazing either but it's a lot better than other things out there are the moment. The detail isn't prized so much in the backgrounds but in the detail of the characters. They're given a lot of detail in certain frames and it makes their 'emotions' stand out.\
The characters are probably the most interesting part of Death Note. Light and L really steal the show for different reasons. For Light, it's because of his ever changing personality and his quest to rid the world of criminals using the Death Note. He was donned with the nickname 'Kira'. With L, it's because he's so abnormal to anything I can think of right now... from the way he sits to the way he plays with his food. I'll let you find out for yourself. If you read it from beginning to end, you'll see how much the characters evolve and change.\
I actually really enjoyed reading Death Note... up to volume seven. Something big happens in that volume that turns most readers away from reading it but because of the way my brain works, I read it all the way to the end. The second half of Death Note was decent, it didn't have that original fire to it but it was still enough to keep me wondering what will happen next. I found that the final volume was well worth having to go through four mediocre volumes to get to.\
Overall I think Death Note is something that you either love or hate. You can't really say until you've tried to read it and then make a fair judgment. I still think that Death Note would have been considered amazing if it ended at volume seven. Even though it went all the way to volume twelve, it could have added some sort of good spice to the mix instead of giving the readers a new annoying character in Mello. Anyways, it was a good read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading psychological manga.\

    Created in 2004 by writer Tsugumi Ohba and illustrator Takeshi Obata, Death Note originated as a manga that received critical acclaim a month after its release. The anime, released in 2006, was given great praise immediately after it‘s TV distribution. Having heard of its fan base and popularity, I decided to purchase a few volumes of the manga and rent a few episodes of the anime, careful to not have big expectations.\
What I got was simply a riveting masterpiece that I have no shame in calling this the greatest manga/anime series in the world. Regardless of whether you love or hate comics or animated\
          \
        TV shows, Death Note is a series that should be enjoyed by those who love thought-provoking concepts, endless twists, turns and main characters that are so complex that pages of literature can be based upon them.\
The story centers on a teenager named Light Yagami, an intelligent student who finds a notebook simply titled \"Death Note.\" After discovering that he can kill people by writing their name in the notebook, he decides to use the book to rid the world of criminals, believing them to be the cause of all grief. After killing countless criminals, half of the world embraces Light as a god, while the other half labels him a mass murderer, even giving him the nickname \"Kira,\" Japanese for killer. Soon, the amount of criminal deaths catches the attention of the International Police Organization, which immediately attains the help of a brilliant private detective, commonly known as \"L,\" to capture \"Kira\". A psychological cat-and-mouse game quickly arises between the two.\
What makes Death Note so riveting is just how much detail was given to the story. Every character, event, subplot, etc… seems to be brought to life with the use of superb writing and a beautiful art style. Throughout the series, Light seems to be headed down a self-destructive path, which may lead to his possible downfall as he acknowledges that he is in fact some god meant to pass judgment upon the world. Another factor is the way the story is told: each episode gives a lot of information, but offers just as many questions and mysteries, guaranteeing an addicting experience.\
If Death Note gives you the unlikely impression that it’s a kid’s show, think again. Not only is this the most serious anime/manga I have seen, but it also contains vast amounts of adult content. Death Note is the story of an anti-hero, a disturbed individual who tries to play god but ends up losing his humanity and everything that is dear to him in the process. The tragic story is probably not going to attract people below the age of 14 because of its complexity and R rating.\
Death Note is not only one of the greatest Japanese products I have ever seen, it also deals with a controversial subject worldwide: capital punishment. It cleverly discusses this issue without alienating the viewer and leaves room for lots of post-episode discussion. Death Note is an enjoyable TV show and comic book, which will entertain those who are interested in a series that offers many captivating concepts, regardless of what your opinion of cartoon shows and comic books might be.\

    Story: First off, I should say that Death Note is extremely wordy. It honestly would've been better off as a light novel from the start. If the author could plot all that is in Death Note, I don't think he would've had a problem describing character emotions and setting the tone for the atmosphere. That being said, this is definitely not a manga that a young, not-as-knowledgeable person should pick up and read. Not for explicit content, but for fear that their little brains would leak out through their ears after trying to read and guess what will happen next in the plot. Plus, y'know,\
          \
        the whole heavy death theme.\
However, that's where the beauty of the story of Death Note comes in. There were many twists and turns that keep the reader hooked and guessing, up to a certain point, the story keeps the reader guessing on when it will end. The first half was very creative. Some of the things that Light thought of and {even more impressively} pulled off, had gained him some respect points in my book. I was always curious to see what he would do next, given the situations he was put in.\
After the aforementioned point, not much happened story-wise. More lovable characters were introduced, but I think it was a bad move on Ohba's part to move around some of those characters, so he couldn't put them to their potential use to make the second half of the story more interesting. I understand that some significant things happened in the second half, and I probably would've liked them if those significant things were presented in more of a climatic light.\
Even if the second half was kind of boring, I recommend sticking with it. The ending sort of washes away the mundane of most of the second half. It's a beautiful display of human emotion and character development. For the close-minded people who couldn't {or refuse to} see the possible other side of the story and think that Kira is invincible, you might be surprised by this ending. While I sort of saw some aspects coming, the ending surprised me as well. It gets the respect it deserves.\
\
Art:﻿ ﻿I don't even know what to say about the art. Everything was done beautifully. While it was a manga, the art didn't have that manga feel. It seemed more realistic to me, which was a nice change from oversized eyes, appendages, and hair with enough volume to inflate and cause the character to float away when a breeze rolls in. Most of the character designs were simple, but when it came to the shinigami and {at points} Misa, Obata drew them well. And let's not forget the volume covers and chapter pages. It's those specific art pages that we really get to see the nice proportion that the artist used, and the creative ways he makes the characters look good with a nice mix of clothing creases, shading, expressions and positions.\
\
Characters:﻿ The characters in this manga were wonderful. The characters were developed well, every character {even supporting characters} had some special trait about them and a specific personality. I absolutely loved how every character was dynamic -- they changed in some way at the end, even if the plot didn't examine how they had changed. They were absolute; you either liked or disliked certain characters, there was no middle ground. There was even contrast to the characters -- Light is a bit mean and introverted, while Misa is quite extroverted, L never sleeps or goes anywhere and always has his eyes open, while Watari has his eyes closed and is L's runner, etc. The characters in Death Note were characters that you wouldn't really find anywhere else because they were all stock characters with a special twist on each of them.\
\
Overall: The Death Note manga is certainly worth a read. Even though it's only 12 actual volumes, all the stuff that's packed in to those volumes make it seem longer. Plus there's anime, live-action movies, video games, and a later light novel prequel. Death Note raises good moral questions and is a good display of human nature. This isn't for someone who doesn't want to THINK about what they're reading while reading it. This IS for someone who wants to see a battle of brains and wits go down instead of fists and swords. A spin on something supernatural that doesn't involve mindless fighting makes for a good manga. Have fun with it.\

    This was the first manga I ever read fully and it remains my all-time favourite. It deserves all its popularity and hype, and you will not be dissapointed if you read it! Honestly, I decided to start this one day and it was very hard to stop. Very very hard. I think I read this all in a day the first time I read it.\
First things first, the story is incredible. The characters work so well together and the story takes a lot of risks but all of them work really well. The time jumps are great and mean the story doesn't sit around doing\
          \
        nothing at any point. Light is a character you can both love and hate, as you can see both that he is wrong in using the Death Note, but the reasons behind it - to start with - are pretty pure. L as well is my favourite character of all time and the two are perfect as both enemies and friends - which remains one of the complex and best relationships I have ever seen.\
The characters are almost all enjoyable, though I can't say I liked Misa much - this might be just my opinion - yet the story does take a few turns that will have some people extremely upset. Death Note though is great in that it kept on creating brilliant new characters throughout, who are even better than some of the original characters!\
The art is great, and each character is given their own 'look' as well. I liked how Light always wore something that suited his personality, considering how many different outfits he went through, and how this point applied to everyone else. The artwork for L as well made him stand out from every other character, which showed just how different he was from them. The shinigami also have some great artwork too as some are made to look like humans - only twisted - while others are made to look only like monsters.\
This manga is well and truly a classic. It's not easy to create characters and a story that focuses so heavily on moralistic values and good and evil. Each plot twist is cleverly crafted and it always is made to feel fresh, especially when new characters are involved. If you have not already read this manga, do so now. If you have already, read it again. It is one of the best out there.\

    Summary of the story: Morality. Every character has a radically different conception of justice, but who is the good guy? And is there one? Who's right? Who's wrong? Those questions have multiple answers, so let's find out.\
What defines good and evil? How should evil be dealt with? Who decides which is which?  Death Note doesn't necessarily answer these questions, but it doesn't intend to; the point is that such questions have been asked for centuries and will never be answered but humans simply can't find answers as living beings in this world. This anime pits formidable personalities with wildly different worldviews against each other,\
          \
        and none of them are afraid to say \"I am justice!\". The question of who is right haunts every character and ultimately go unsolved, so let's see if we can't get to the bottom of it, using the three characters at the center of the show's moral conflict.\
As Yagami Light, a protagonist is not necessarily a hero and Light proves it in the first episode. \
It's not enough for him to take a stand against violent crime; after only five days with the Death Note he's written hundreds of names and declared himself the \"god of the new world,\" vowing to strike down any who stand in his way. It's a noble cause, but easily corruptible; it's basically the communist ideal. It's worth noting that in the five years of Light's reign as Kira, the crime rate plummets and all wars are put on hold. From Light's perspective, it's one step closer to an ideal world. But a world governed by altruism is a far cry from one governed by fear. By this time Light and his subordinates have started killing pickpockets and other petty criminals, judging mankind on acts rather than reasons. The rule of law rests entirely in the hands of three flawed individuals.\
Perhaps only fear can motivate humanity to coexist so completely and so quickly, but the second half of the plot makes clear that Kira has addressed symptoms and not causes. Fear, ignorance, and anger still exist, and Light is perfectly willing to manipulate these flaws in his favor, as when he organizes a bloodthirsty mob to storm the Kira task force's headquarters. And lest we forget greed, this same mob is distracted and neutralized when Near showers them with the remains of L's fortune to cover his team's escape.\
Remember that Light's original motive is boredom. \"Day in and day out, the same news on permanent repeat,\" he laments, shortly before picking up the Death Note and changing the world forever. Though he vows to strike down the wicked, he makes no distinction between hardened criminals and those \"who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others.\" The troublemakers are culled through disease and accidents, while the truly terrible serve as examples. One could argue that Light's power gives him the responsibility to reshape the world for the better, but the world he seeks to create is unquestionably in his self-centered image.\
L is described by Tsugumi Ohba as \"slightly evil\", and it isn't difficult to see why. As the undisputed king of detectives, L has essentially limitless jurisdiction and resources. In a world that turns on the interpretation and manipulation of data, he is as close to superhuman as one can get. It's the perfect recipe for a villain: wholly without rivals, with every eccentricity tolerated and he even is a star athlete. With the ability to succeed at seemingly anything he does, why does L devote himself to the law?\
In a way, L is just as vain as he proves Light to be in the second episode. He admits that he's \"childish and hates losing,\" which indicates a certain amount of pride at stake in his work. He also will not take a case unless at least ten lives or a million dollars are on the line. If his detective work is indeed just a game to him, it makes sense that he would seek out challenges. He may also believe that his intellect is wasted on any but the most dangerous and impossible cases. But both he and Light declare \"I am justice!\" at the end of the second episode. The parallel is no mere dramatic flair. As Misa's extrajudicial kidnapping and torture prove, both men are willing to go to extreme lengths in the name of their principles. But while they both work from the shadows, L has an existing legal framework on his side—one that he is more or less free to dictate. While he insists that extraordinary foes require extraordinary actions, he's also not above outright lying—everything from using convicts as expendable decoys to insisting that his trademark crouch increases his reasoning abilities by 40%. \
Humans are inquisitive by nature. We want answers, and Light's tenure as God proves that many of us look up to powerful figures who claim to have them. Light appeals to an innate desire for justice in all people and uses that to rule the world from the shadows. But his arrogance consumes him throughout the second season because he has no equal to keep him humble. It's possible that L is the same way: he gravitates toward law, detective work, and justice simply because he has to succeed. Where Light represents individual, retributive justice, L represents law at its most perfect and least merciful.\
While we're on the subject of L, why does the discovery of shinigami shock him so deeply? Because of the supernatural upsets the balance of the hierarchy he has crowned himself king of. Gods of death operate by completely different rules than humans, physically and psychologically speaking. Once he's acknowledged that he's dealing with forces beyond his understanding, of course, the shinigami are just one more challenge for him to fit into his worldview. So what is there to understand about Ryuk? Of all the characters in Death Note, Light's companion shinigami is the most honest. Ryuk may be deliberately evasive or obtuse, but unlike the humans he meets, he never tells an outright lie. His reason for dropping the Death Note into the human world is clear from the beginning: \"I did it because I was bored.\"\
Is it evil to allow a deadly weapon to potentially fall into evil hands? Perhaps, but would you call gun shop owners evil? All they do is respond to the demands of an existing market. The difference is that Ryuk knowingly attempts to stir up trouble - the most \"interesting\" humans are the ones who make extensive and creative use of the Death Note, and those who rise to challenge them. Ryuk sets in motion the deaths of thousands - perhaps hundreds of thousands. But he does not hide behind ideals or principles. There will be other lives, and as long as they do interesting things - and give him apples - he is content to watch them destroy each other. He'll be the first to tell you. It may sound like a paradox, but there's an undeniable integrity to that sort of morality.\
The answer to the question of right and wrong is that there is no answer. Good and evil are mutable concepts that change with perspective and context, and defining them is a constant undertaking that stretches back as far as recorded history. Both Light and L believe that humanity is fundamentally unchanging, both use that belief for their own gain, and both have different definitions of justice to back it up. Ryuk, as one of a stagnant race, is wholly amoral, but he is under no obligation to be otherwise. Nor does he feel it necessary to disguise his motives - why should he answer to alien laws? Trying to decide who is on the side of justice - whether they take a side or not - misses the point of this show. The idea that there are sides drives human history and achievement. But in the world of Death Note, those who see beyond the abstractions have the power to manipulate them, for better or for worse.\

    When I began to read Death Note, I was thrilled. The plot and idea pulled me in, it was interesting, and I just loved it. The (occasional) slow pace wasn't that bad then.\
At some point, though, the pace of the story started to bug me a little. With both our detectives, L and Near, as well as Light, they kept going over the same things, talking big, planning bigger... I don't know why, but that became the most annoying aspect of the whole story: it began to drag its feet when it could have already moved on.\
There was a slight change of pace when the\
          \
        end of L's era came and Near stepped in. I don't know why, but it just seemed different. More elements got involved when Near appeared, as well as Mello, and move moving pieces were added to the mix.\
I don't know what to really think of the conclusion of the story. I kept dreading it from half-way through the whole series, because there were really only a couple of options: either Kira would win, or L/Near would. It was a thrilling ride, to the very end, and the characters that in the beginning seemed unimportant (Matsuda, Aizawa, Mogi etc.) stayed with us far longer and much more prominently than could have been expected in the very beginning.\
The art of Death Note was fantastic. The details, the beauty, the little things that made it unique... I especially liked the Death Note's \"How to use it\" parts, because they were written both in English and Japanese (I'm studying Japanese at my leisure, so it was good practice whenever I decided to try and read it). The font was a bit hard to see, too thin against the black surface, but it gave the manga a very special design.\
One thing I loved, and which wasn't used nearly enough, was the Shinigami. I totally loved Ryuk, and the others were okay as well. There should have been more of them, definitely. With all the talking and masterminds playing against each other, they were a refreshing break.\
It was funny how after 12 volumes, I'm still not sure how close to the characters I really got. Even in the last volume, it didn't feel like I knew them very well.\
Altogether, one of my favorite manga series - even though the amount of talking threw me off a little. Looking forward to seeing the anime and the movies.\

    Alright, first review I’ve done on this site, so apologies if it isn’t exactly the best thing. The reason why I decided on Death Note was for the simple reason of…it was because of this site that I got into it, and Death Note opened me up to series where fighting isn’t really relevant, so I felt it would be fitting for my first review on here to be about one of my \"Life Changing\" manga/anime. Let’s just get into this though. Oh yeah, I’m putting spoilers in this review, nothing major (I think anyway), but you have been warned.\
Story: 9/10\
What is the whole premise\
          \
        of Death Note? Essentially, it’s about a high school student who found a book that can kill people and decides to play God since he has the power to \"judge\" people now. This student, Light Yagami, starts off only killing criminals that he deemed were too evil for this world, but eventually decides to kill anyone that is a threat to his ideal world. One of these threats is a detective that goes under the alias of L. The first half of the series mainly dealt with Light’s rise to godhood while having a mind duel with L, the one person Light thought could figure out he was the culprit for killing all these criminals. If I can make an analogy, this battle between L and Light could be compared (albeit on a much serious scale since whoever loses between those two loses everything) to Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba from the original series. Much like Kaiba, Light is hell-bent on defeating his rival and then rising to the greatest in their series (Dueling world for Kaiba and the world in general for Light). On the reverse side, L and Yugi are more focused on just doing what they do best, and take all challenges, including the challenges of their rivals. I can also say that the battle between L and Light was the greatest part of Death Note, and I can maybe even say one of the greatest in manga period. The plot twists are also so amazing. The most controversial one of them all is still in my Top 5 moments in all of manga, even after all the other series I have read. I’m not saying what it is, but you can probably figure it out if I told you it involves L’s and Light's final confrontation. All in all, I say an amazing plot. The only reason why it’s not a perfect score is because near the end, they were making a lot of characters almost nonexistent (Misa being the prime example).\
Art: 8/10\
If I can say anything, it’s that the characters are drawn pretty well. With one exception, I don’t think there is one character that looks bad and even then, the one character I think looks bad is probably just me. The scenery looked nice, and when something evil from an \"evil\" character was about to happen, I could definitely tell that most of these characters were enjoying themselves with their facial expressions (hello Light!). I’m not good at describing art, so I’m keeping this part short.\
Characters: 15/10 (10/10)\
 Oh. My. God. These characters are some of the greatest characters I have ever had the privilege to read about. With one exception, I really love every single character in Death Note. I think every single one of them are written in a beautiful way that makes them extremely interesting and diverse that you can’t possibly mix up any character. I’m going to put it his way for all you video game enthusiasts and especially Portal fans; I would say most of these characters have the same charm and likeability as the ones in Portal and the sequel. I’ll go a little in depth about the two main characters so you can see where I’m coming from.\
Light Yagami, the main character of the story and probably the most well written character, isn’t your typical hero where he’s good and he can never do evil. No no no, he’s far from good. If I can give him one title to describe it would be Satan, and that’s why I love him. He is so distant from what I was accustomed to for a main character of a manga, that I was actually upset whenever he was losing against L. I think the biggest reason why I love the guy though is probably because of the way he had fallen from grace. Based on what I said previously, you would assume Light was evil from day one right? He actually started out with good intentions, only killing criminals that he saw doing crimes himself. Eventually though, he started becoming more and more power hungry, and killed anyone he felt didn’t fit in his ideal world. That is actually a believable reason to descend into become the very evil you set out to destroy, not because you felt like being a dick (like most hero-turned villains in media sadly). Other than having the power to kill all, Light is actually a realistic character. Anyone would become corrupt if they had that much power. I could go on with this, but I got one other character to do plus a whole other section, so moving on.\
L, the second main character and my second favorite character (you probably wouldn’t ever guess my favorite), is probably one of the strangest characters if he isn’t the strangest character in the series. My first impression of the guy was that he was going o be a guy that looked interesting but would only have one good moment in the entire series, not counting when he beat Light. Boy was I wrong and I was so glad about that too. While Light got the most development as a character, L was the more entertaining of the two in my opinion. He’s a real pleasant surprise since, like Light, is almost nothing like the standard hero of a manga. He isn’t afraid to do cruel and demented things like torture Light and Misa to get answers, and even considers writing people’s name in the Death Note to see if it really does kill people. He’s also not afraid to be out there, with his strange sitting position or how he admits that sleeping would make him stupider. He’s still a genius though, despite his weird habits. Only someone like L could pull off having not one, but three different aliases and not get discovered, all of it with no one but his butler knowing his real name. That is pretty impressive, no matter how high your standards are. \
Again, most of these characters are written so well, that I think there is only one character that I think could have been improved on. The characters are definitely the reason why you read the series. \
Enjoyment/Overall Rating: 10/10\
Overall, Death Note was a blast to read/watch. If you are just getting into manga/anime, go and give this series a read, you’ll probably love manga in general after doing so. If you are already a long time fan of manga, why haven’t you checked this out? You are missing out on an amazing series and should check it out. From the characters to the amazing plot twists, there wasn’t a single dull moment where I just wanted to give up on this series. I’m not afraid to give Death Note a 10/10, as it really deserves it. Thank you for getting me into non manga Light and L, hope you can do the same with other new people to the world of manga.  ",

    Death Note is a must read. I would challenge even those who say they don't like manga to pick up this series- I am convinced that anyone will be hooked by the plot, characters, and overall themes in this manga. \
The storyline of Death Note is essentially a murder mystery- however, this mystery is told from the perspective of the murderer, Light Yagami. While this alone is enough to catch the reader's attention, the author continues to provide well thought out characters and plot twists to the very end.\
The art, characters, and plot of this series are all very good, and often more complex than\
          \
        your average shounen lineup. However, what really made Death Note special to me was the surprisingly challenging questions on justice that the author managed to raise in this short series. Questions like: Are the laws of justice decided by the fickle majority, by unchanging principles that humans naturally understand, or by some sort of god? Who should enforce justice? Can criminals be forgiven? Is it morally justified to get your hands dirty if it brings about a greater good? These are only some of the many age-old themes that are brought to life again in Death Note.\
This series is not only a brilliantly drawn and creatively written manga; in my opinion, it is also a contribution to the ongoing search for the meaning of justice. I highly recommend this series.\

    Extremely addictive.  Make sure you have all 12 volumes ready for the reading before you start!  I literally could not put this down.  \
A caveat that I saw the live action movies before I read the manga.  (I believe the first movie is covered entirely in the first 3 volumes.)  The story is quite different in those two mediums.  I liked how they did the fiancee thing better in the movie, but there are also a lot of things I liked more in the manga... basically way more elaborate.  The thinking behind this manga is just genius. \
          \
        I could just be a nerd, but I get so excited when L and Light reason and talk their way through stuff.  It's deep, thoughtful stuff too, but despite it being talky at times, it never weighs down or slows the story (Liar Game has this problem).  It's thrilling!!  \
So with so many great things to say, why a 9 only?  If this manga ended in volume 7, it would have literally been an absolutely perfect manga that would be a clear 10/10.  Gonna stop before I give anything else away.  But even with Vol. 8-12, it's still a very solid read and one I would definitely recommend.  \

    I really love Light Yagami as a character. It's so refreshing to read about a protagonist that is confident, assured and downright selfish rather than the usual beta MC people pleaser we see these days. Light doesn't do anything for his friends, his family, to save the world or to become a great warrior. He's purely fuelled by his own ego to outsmart his opponents and have the power to kill others when he pleases (that's the real reason he uses the Death Note, the peaceful world is just a pretext.)\
Most of the other characters were great too, even if the main antagonists were a\
          \
        bit young to be believable and the mangaka tried too hard to make them eccentrics. The main female MC is probably the worst one, the way she fawns over Light even when it's obvious he is just using her becomes too apparent in some scenes, and other characters never point it out to her even when they have reason to do so. She felt too much like a plot device.\
I know a lot of people dislike the second half of Death Note but I personally enjoyed it all the same, it was an interesting change of pace and led to a very satisfying and fitting ending for the series. \
Death Note is one of the best psychological thrillers not just in manga but any medium, the plot twists and turns so many times and you have no idea how it's all going to turn out, it's dark and brutal without being edgy, and the lore and concept of Death Notes is interesting and a lot of fun. There's a lot of test in the series as you see the characters interior monologues as they guess and second guess themselves and each other about what to do next so be prepared for a lot of reading. I'd recommend this series to anyone, even those who don't like comics or manga. \

    Probably the best psychological thriller there is. Not many mangakas i'v read put as much thought into their manga as the authors of this have. Work like this is the reason I prefer japenese comics over american comics.That said the Plot is not consistent. The plot becomes somewhat predictable and disappointing after a certain important event (it really is important) but that taken into consideration it still is top on my list of favourites\

    Some Spoilers Ensue:\
Perfect ending to a flawless series. I love the anime and the manga is just as good. The show followed almost exactly, minus the last chapter which was an interesting take on Near's thinking. The theory in the end could even have kept going and I would have loved to hear more. However, I enjoyed it all the same. I thought without L the series would lose steam, but Light's character is so dominant and evil. I enjoyed Mello and Mikami as well. Near was not my favorite, but I like the idea that the two heirs equal one L. The overall satisfaction\
          \
        came from the explanation of not only the ending, but every major twist in this story. I didn't pick any of them which was refreshing and all were interesting and smart. The artwork was beautiful as well. This is in the top 5 anime I've ever seen and now the series is added to my favorite manga as well. 10/10 flawless.\

    I don't think I'm being original when saying Death Note is one of the few original stories to have ever come out of Japan. However, that I would say this, along with the rest of the world, only goes to prove that the world agrees with this opinion; declaring  Death Note to be both brilliant and original. Though what is most curious is Death Note's strong theme of justice that has been portrayed in a way that will make you question yourself and your own sense of justice as your head and heart are torn between the ideals of the severe Kira and the\
          \
        righteous L as it poses the question –\
– is murdering criminal’s justice...or murder?\
Story [10/10]\
The concept of playing god has been toyed with countless times in countless formats though never has it been so well done or to such a high intellectual standard as it has been with Death Note. The story of a teenage prodigy who comes across a great power that allows him to toy with life itself and of those who oppose him as he attempts to cleanse the world of all hate and all its criminals; it seems like a fair enough summary though what you need to hear is not this.\
There are two factors that prove the most intriguing in this manga:\
First: The intellectual drama is amazing, the thought and thorough planning that goes into every act is indescribably intimidating and can only be compared to a game of chess between two of the greatest minds in the world. However, despite the intellectual drama it does not bore you. The manga doesn't play with intellect in a way that it grows dull and flies straight over the readers head, instead it's the bulk paragraphs of information that keeps you entertained instead, greatly overpowering what would otherwise be mindless slaughter (which I would have still enjoyed), it is the intelligence that gives the usually mindless act of murder a second chance at redemption.\
Second: Redemption was the word I used; redemption of a usually condemnably heinous act: murder. But is it really murder if you are taking the lives of those who have committed crimes so much more heinous? Is it really murder if there are people who will suffer throughout their lives if these criminals are not killed? Would it make you just as bad a person if you took the life of someone who had done the same?\
This is the crux of Death Note; it takes you out of your comfort zone and forces you to confront your own beliefs. Who will you side with? Will it be Kira or L? To this day I am not completely resigned to just one. It is this that you will remember most of the story, even if you don't realise it.\
Art [10/10]\
I am feeling rather silly, handing out so many perfect scores though am comforted by the fact that the manga is deserving of such praise.\
The art was perfect, syncing with the themes and the story just how you would hope it to. The art was severe and realistic; it steered away from the large haired, big eyed style, opting for a more realistic approach. Why? There is a simple reason for this –\
– the more realistic, the easier to imagine it really happening.\
The style choice wasn't designed for comic relief or for romantic scenes or even as the Mangaka’s personal style, it was specifically designed to let you see how real and severe the situation truly was, how easily relatable their world and our own are. It was sending a message of \"what if\".\
It was designed to frighten us.\
Character (9/10)\
Why not a perfect score? Well, I will be a little selfish here so that I might comment on something:\
The men in the manga were legends, powerful and nigh invincible creatures that you could only sit in awe as you witnessed their brilliance. Though what of the women? The women in Death Note were portrayed as idiots or weaklings, even the strongest of them where either designed to not be taken seriously or killed mere chapters into the manga if they showed any signs of intelligence. However, I would hardly say that it would take an entire 1/10th off of the score, if I could I would make it a 9.99/10, but I needed an opening to explain the women’s side of things.\
Now, women aside, the main characters and even the supporting characters showed remarkable story and character development and their responses were so well thought out and flowed so well in conversation. A personal example is after completing the manga I went back to the beginning and was thoroughly shocked, the Light from the first chapter and the one from the last were completely different and, uncannily, I had barely noticed his transformation at all. This shows how smoothly his development as a character was underwent and how well thought out he had been since the very beginning.\
Enjoyment (10/10)\
There was never a moment I was bored or even slightly disinterested, I'm actually glad I read this manga after it had completed publishing else I would have been driven mad had I been left to fend for myself for weeks at a time, my suspense and curiosity slowly killing me from the inside. Overall, I don't think it's possible to not enjoy this manga.\

    Not much more needs to be said than that this is the manga that piqued my interest in Japanese animation and stories, as well as clearly reaching a level of appreciation that I felt inclined to review just what an outstanding manga this is.\
It is possibly one of the most well-known anime/manga and with good reason, for it is a pleasing read that traps you with an incurable desire to binge-read and follow the downward spiral of a man with his morally-twisted intentions.\
Every character is given certain quirks that add to the art of the story, as the reader is brought down a psychological journey\
          \
        of speculation and interpretation of their own thoughts of intensifying storyline. \
The manga has a fantastic build-up filled with characters constructed from both great abilities and human flaws, allowing the reader to sympathize with not only the heroes, but also the \"villains\" of the story. My only complaint is the lack of a strong female character, all of the feminine heroines held at steps below the men, not just in terms of development and personality but also in their actions. \
Although the women do play their part in the storyline, the female characters seemed to lack personality, especially when held in comparison to the men. \
However this is the only \"fault\" I found with this manga, and it did little to take away from a story that prods into your mind as you struggle to answer a recurring question through the series; what is moral justice?\
Both Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata nail a conclusion that could have easily been botched, as a story with so many intense twists incited high expectations of an exhilarating and solid ending. Flowing with a captivating journey to a final epic ending, Death Note truly demonstrates how mangakas work their magic over readers, soliciting emotion in both art and words, causing one to ponder their own convictions of the world.\

    Each era of anime is marked by its own trends, its own conventions, its own shows that dominate the conversation and shape public perception of the medium among fans and non-fans alike. For the 2000's, Death Note was one of the biggest, and a good argument could be made that it WAS the biggest. It achieved a seemingly omnipresent level of saturation, you could not go to a forum on any given nerd hobby without people filled with avatars and signatures from the series, and its famous lines are parroted even now. Its anime adaptation was immensely popular and reached a level of pop cultural\
          \
        osmosis that was thorough enough that even people who don't care about anime obtained a passing familiarity with at least the eponymous concept. As of this writing, it is even getting a westernized adaptation on Netflix with Willem Dafoe of all people as Ryuuk. \
\
Unfortunately, I can't really hold the series in an especially high regard for a number of reasons despite all the critical acclaim and praise that has been lavished upon it.\
To get the good out of the way, it certainly has a pretty fascinating hook. The ability to easily kill anyone without leaving any proof, thoroughly avoiding any consequences, merely by writing their names in a notebook, is a pretty interesting and memorable concept. It has immense potential for all kinds of storytelling possibilities, such as the development and psychological effects that this would have on the person using the Death Note, the wider sociological repercussions of a mass series of killings that seem to be divine punishment, whether it's morally justifiable to kill criminals given that any justice system is heavily skewed in certain ways, etc.\
Secondly, it has very good artwork. While Obata is not among my favorite manga artists, it would be disingenuous to not recognize his draftsmanship as arguably the strongest point of Death Note. It is not by any means easy to create polished and detailed art on a weekly basis for manga even with assistants, and yet Obata pulls it off with aplomb and a very strong aesthetic. My favorite part are probably his fantastical shinigami designs, which have a very \"demon punk monster\" vibe to them. \
Finally, the actual focus of the plot, the cat and mouse games between Light and the investigators (whether they be L or someone else) are pretty entertaining to watch. I don't think I was ever BORED reading the series since there was almost always something going on, some zany scheme or gambit at play that kept things moving. This was by Ohba's own admission what he was writing the manga around, and I can understand that decision since Death Note must have pulled in a strong readership when it was running in Jump due to its suspense on a week to week basis.\
But unfortunately, even with all those things going for it, it can't make up for what I consider Ohba's crippling flaw, which is generally that I think his characters are very lackluster for the most part.\
Light CAN be a fun character to watch, but I ultimately feel that he is a detriment to the series because he isn't especially nuanced or interesting. Everything related to his \"development\" is handled in an extremely underwhelming manner. Any scruples that he has are quite quickly tossed aside in a manner that makes later developments to paint him as a good person prior to the Death Note as completely unconvincing. He is little more than a petulant, arrogant sociopath with a god complex who only becomes more and more unlikable and pathetic as the series goes on. He has very little in the way of humanizing traits or moments, which just renders him completely impossible to like or get behind. This may have been the point, but I don't feel that it made for a good character because you can still have a complex and nuanced villain who is still someone to hate, but who also has layers and where you understand why he became the person they did and perhaps connect with them on some level against your wishes. Light does not achieve any of that, so as it stands I just don't find him to be that great.\
L is probably the best character in the series, a fun character to watch with enough bizarre quirks to make him feel more human than the other characters, even if it's an exaggerated animu way. I would honestly say that he is one of the series' biggest assets, every scene he is in is one where he has your attention. I don't think that I can hold him up as one of my favorite characters in anime and manga, but among the ones in the series, he stands supreme.\
The thing about this though, is that it makes the conflict in place have a pretty clear right and wrong. I have heard a few times about the supposed moral ambiguity of the story and the idea that people debate on who to root for, but with all due respect I just find that to be malarky. Light is such a horrendous, sanctimonious individual that it is impossible to suggest that he is in the right with a straight face. His entire worldview and methodology to using the Death Note is fundamentally and horrendously flawed and likely led to many innocents being killed, he simply cannot be trusted with that kind of power. This is someone who killed a man entirely because he insulted his ego, that is his defining character moment at the very beginning of the series. He isn't even the kind of charismatic villain who you want to see triumph. The idea that anyone should root for him or want him to win is completely laughable. \
I don't think most of the other characters really have that much going for them, honestly. Almost all of them are defined by very superficial characteristics that make it hard to really care about them in any meaningful way. IIt feels like Ohba only really cared about them as pawns on a chessboard to move his thriller plot along, without bothering to put some effort into humanizing them and making them compelling characters to be invested in.\
There was one moment in the story where one character leaves the investigation due to anger at how he is being treated, and is greeted by his daughter who asks him what's going on, leading him to burst into tears and hug her. This was one of the few instances of warmth and actual humanity in the story where I actually cared somewhat about what was happening on an emotional level, but there was never any other time where that happened. Overall, Death Note is quite an impersonal and cold story as the characters aren't really people you connect with all that deeply.\
Now, it is not necessarily true that you need super great and complex characters in order to have a worthwhile story. Some people may say that, but I don't think it's true, per se. If your story is more theme and idea-driven, then it is ok for the characters to be a bit more flat or to be more representative of ideas and philosophies, or be more timeless archetypes in order to make a point. The story need not be super emotional either, as long as it is interesting.\
But for that, your ideas need to be actually interesting and you have to deal with them in a meaningful and insightful way. \
Death Note never does that because it is entirely focused on its thriller elements. Ohba himself said that he wanted to leave moral judgments and sociological commentary for the audience to think about. I suppose I can understand that decision, but Death Note completely neglecting this area of the story feels like a bunch of squandered potential. All of the questions that I mentioned above regarding the premise's potential that could have been explored due to the premise are left as footnotes or passing mentions at best. \
This means that Death Note only really works as a reasonably entertaining thriller; it cannot to be said to be a strong character-driven drama, nor is it a poignant thoughtpiece that presents interesting concepts and gives  insightful answers.\
What this basically means is that looking back on Death Note, I am just left feeling that the version of the story that I got from the premise was not at all the kind of story I would have preferred to get from it. I would have done a lot of things quite differently, such as significantly changing Light's character, focusing a lot more on societal effects of Kira, putting more character moments to add complexity to the cast and make you care about them, etc.\
But I suppose in the end I can't really be that hard on it, since I was entertained reading it. It just isn't anything more than a 6 out of 10 for me as an experience.\

    Death Note is a thrilling, captivating manga, which will let you wonder and guess the whole time. \
Story:\
Yagami Light, a brilliant high school student, finds a notebook Every person of which his/her name is written in the notebook will die-if the cause of death is specifically written that will happen,unless it's something that can't happen;like someone from Japan dying in England,and if the cause of death isn't written the person will die of a heart attack-, with a few other rules. The Shinigami Ryuk/Ryuuku had dropped the notebook on purpose out of boredom and has to follow Light, the owner of the notebook, now. Light\
          \
        has a strong sense of justice and a strong will and has decided to kill off all criminals who commited big crimes-he doesn't punish people who commited small crimes,people who didn't do the crimes on purpose or people with a criminal record but who changed-and to let the world know someone is punishing evil people getting sudden heart attacks becomes Kira's trade mark. When criminals keep dropping dead the people nickname him Kira en the authorities send the legendary detective L.With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goal... or his life? The story was great-in the first half it was the absolute best for me. The second half was nice too, but not as great. After 'major spoiler'-like the others call it-I was truly shocked. Really,for a second I thought it was just a joke. After all that happened I didn't expect thát to happen.Most people stop reading it at that point,but  I wanted to know how it ended and then I got shocked again. Still, I promise it's worth to read it. I agree with the other people who say it would have ended better at the point of 'major spoiler',but it's still great to read.It's like a cat-and-mouse game and I keep getting like 'Okay,what?' at points when they think so far ahead as how they would respond to the plan of the enemy on their plan or how their plan worked-I was really confused at the end thanks to Nears response-but okay. Mello and Near appear later as more of Lights enemies,but L still surpasses them for me. I still give the story a 10 as it still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.\
Art:\
The arts great-I really get goosebumps at times when Light shows me an unbelievably creepy smirk and then comes up with even more versions of it.It's drawed well and accurate, so I give it a 10.\
Character:\
The characters are truly astonishing. Light is so smart that it's frightening and L is on par with him. Really, the characters developed greatly and you managed to understand them and predict their reactions. Well this obviously doesn't count for Light,L or Near. Even though most people dislike Light because he uses people to achieve his goals-mostly Misa,to which Light is everything-and because he looks down on people,but I took quite a liking to Light-well apart from the creepy smirks and the using and looking down on people Light is just trying to get a better world. I wonder if Light never had picked up the notebook and someone else had become Kira,would he and L have become friends?I really hope so.  The Shinigami were quite scary at the beginning,but I began to take a liking to Ryuuku,Rem and Shidou-Shidou was so foolishly adorable it was hard not to. All in all I give the characters a 10 too.\
Enjoyment:\
I really enjoyed reading this  and couldn't stop reading it once I started.If you are looking for something which will make you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time,keeping you wondering and guessing what will happen,then this is the ideal manga for you.If your just looking for something enjoyable you should give it a try to. It's worth it. I give it a 10 too.\
Overall:10/10\
Well,you wouldn't expect any other score with all the 10s I gave,eh? But still, I really love this manga. It's awesome and you'll surely like it.\
Just give it a try and keep reading.\

    My scores may not make much sense but it's because the story series delines as it progresses, but the art and characters remain strong. The enjoyment was a 10 untill roughly halfway through the series and this has marred my overall opion, as explained below...\
It's good untill it gets stupid - I can accept the initial premises of a manga like this (Shinigami exist and kill people by writing their name in a book), that's fine because it's explained right at the start and as far as I'm aware that's the only difference between this universe and the manga's.\
However, unfortunately, the plot devices just get\
          \
        too ridiculous. It didn't help that my favourite character died but that really isn't why I stopped reading (same happened in Claymore and I still really like that). The thing is, this manga claims to be intelligent, which it is to a degree but it fails at being intelligently silly which, regrettably, is what this becomes around the point when I stopped reading...\

    The first thing you wonder about when you start to read DEATH NOTE is whether the stories main protagonist is good or evil. After reading a bit further you realise that your suppoesed to keep guessing right till the end.\
DEATH NOTE was the first manga I read the entire way through and I will continue to re-read it over and over, till the day I die.\
The story of DEATH NOTE is a detective story that runs over the course of about seven years. However, it has a edge-of-your-seat speed and danger about it that is strangely alluring. Tsugumi Ohba has managed to weave a tale\
          \
        with many twists and turns that you don't expect until it's right there on the page in front of you.\
Takeshi Obata's artwork begins very well. Then gets better. It is perfectly dark and worrying, and the Shinigami (Death Gods) almost look as if you could meet one in reality. But it is at the end where the imagery is most powerful and amazing.\
The most important part of DEATH NOTE is it's characters. All of them are well developed from their unveiling. Even some of the characters that are only in three or four frames seem to have been created with the same love as the main characters.\
DEATH NOTE is enjoyable for almost any body in their teens and onwards through adulthood. It can be (and has been) enjoyed by all ages, all genders, race, religion and political preference. And always will be.\
Overall, this series' excellence speaks for itself and has paved the way for an Anime and Film adaption as well as a prequel novel. No one can really say how good this series is. The reader must judge for themself.\
And more often than not, they judge it wonderfully.\

    Deathnote has a unique storyline although it seems similar to all the others, save the world from criminals and bring peace however Light's way has got a way of getting into are minds, there is an morality battle raging in the readers mind, would you consider it ethical to use the note to end the lives of those who destroy and torment other peoples lives, could use the note to kill someone you deeply and truely despise or to kill someone in a jealous rage. Also can you kill a criminal who for all you know could be innocent.\
Light and L go into a deep\
          \
        cat and mouse game and to me Light's way of bringing peace is a little mad (hehe). Ryuk the Shinigami is a delightful character that brings in the subtle humor that helps to balance out the dark and evil genre of the series (he's got big eyes too!). The one thing that I dislike is the fact that you didn't get many opinions of this mass murder case by the police and FBI, only one person showed that they agreed with Light's idea and this was met with disapproval. \
Overall a great occult/thriller classic which I think doesn't deserve it's 16+ rating because of it's total lack of violence then again I don't think that kids of 13 could take death on a massive scale.\

    I began reading this series, thanks to a friend, when it was still being translated. As soon as I picked it up I couldn't put it down! I spent an entire week going to the book store after a day at college just to read another volume! \
I was pretty broke back then and couldn't afford to buy the series, but even after I'd finished it I was surprised and stoked when a 13th appeared! By then, I'd bought the whole series and I had to have it too (even if it's not a story volume) and I was pleased as punch to discover L's\

    Ok so Death Note is a huge manga and anime/manga fans who havnt heard of it have got to be living under a rock. Death Note is definitely a must read for all anime and manga fans whether you feel it's your type of story or not. Why do I say this? Well it's because Death Note is so original. It's thrilling, suspenseful and always keeps you well into the story. There's always something going on as the plot leads one thing to another.\
What I love about Death Note is how the plot is so well planned. Not even I could think up all of\
          \
        the plans which Light, L and Near plot! It's simply too genius which also makes for it's downfall. The last half of the story is when Near and Mello are introduced into the plot and that's where it kinda starts to get a bit confusing. I do understand what they're all doing but sometimes I need to read things over to get it. Some of the things didn't make sense for me which explains my '9 instead of 10' rating for enjoyment.\
The characters were very well thought out. The roles they played, their attitudes and personalities added to the already amazing plot but the character I am most thankful for is Matsuda. I was so glad he was there to bring comic relief and to lighten up the manga! Some of the characters were rather annoying which explains the '9 out of 10' rating and when I said 'some of the characters' I was meaning Misa in particular. She's annoying and clingy but at times I did think she was cute and did bring some comic relief. Also Light was pretty creepy in the final chapters.\
I remember when I first started reading Death Note. I had heard of it and I only expected myself to read a chapter or two so I could at least understand what it was about. I ended up reading the next 10 chapters on the same night and I thought it was unbelievably awesome! I understood at that moment why Death Note was so popular. Sure Death Note is another story with the good guys and the bad guys but the good guys always win in the end but Death Note is far from cliche. We all know who wins in the end but it's the 'how' which gives it its originality. Overall it was an outstanding manga for me and I'm sure the anime is just as excellent. Death Note deserves the praise it receives.\

    Throughout the time I read the manga (I haven't seen the anime. Is it good?), I was giddily bouncing in my seat and squealing. Yes, it evokes a deep sense of fangirlishness and, actually, suspense. A real page-turner.\
Story: The plot is something I've never seen before. It is definitely my personal favorite, but if you want to do yourself a favor, stop after reading chapter 56-58. It gives you a sense of ending. After that, they introduce the new characters; L wannabe, Near, and chocoholic Mello. The plot gets a little tedious, and often I found myself wanting to skip through it.\
Art: As far as\
          \
        I can tell, the art is pretty well drawn, though sometimes a bit sloppy.\
Character: Not many people have noticed, but I have to wonder if the creators are misogynistic. All of the females portrayed are seen as weak and helpless - even dumb. For example, there's Misa, who will gladly give away her life for Light and is not so smart. Yuri, who was just being used for barely two chapters, Sayu Yagami, who was basically just used so Mello could kidnap her, the lady who was Raye Penber's fiancee, who is shown to be obviously in a more dominated side of the relationship, and though she was smart, was killed off soon enough.\
Otherwise, I find everyone to be very lifelike.\
Enjoyment: I enjoyed it very much; up until chapter 60. With that, it started up again (the plot) and it felt kind of forced - like fanfiction when the author had writer's block.\
Overall: Overall...I find it very difficult not to give it a high score. Go read it. Now.\

    DISCLAIMER: This is my first review. Don't be to harsh on me ;).\
MINOR SPOILER ALERT\
Death Note is known as one of the best Manga of the Manga universe. There is a lot of merchandise, there are even theories about death by Death Notes in real life.\
Today I want to talk about this over popular manga.\
Story: 9/10\
The story revolves about the Death Note, a notebook that when you write a name in it, that person will die. It is a very good Idea, if it is done right. Death Note creators Takeshi Obata and Tsugumi Ohba did it right.\
They show us how people, who have no\
          \
        specific problems or other, can turn into killing psychopath.\
My only problem with the story is how they handle some of the characters. But overall, it was very enjoyable.\
Art: 8/10 \
Very good, but not my favorite. It fit perfect to the stories and characters, and can make you shiver when Light gets a laughing strike.\
Characters: 8/10\
The characters where all very interesting, L and Matsuda being my favorites from all. My only problem with the characters, is Light.\
I can hear the Fan-girls crying already. \
Well, let me explain. Light starts out to be a very intelligent young man with the will to change humanity to the better. For the next chapters it stays that way. But at the end, he starts to turn into a psychopath. Don't understand me wrong, I don't really mind when that happens, but not only does he go crazy, his character kinda changes as well.\
Enjoyment: 7/10\
My enjoyment shifted quite a bit from \"This is sooo cool!\" to \"Are you serious?\"\
At the beginning, my expectations for this series wasn't high. But then after a few interesting changes in the story , it got more and more interesting. But it dropped down again by killing someone rather important. I quite liked the ending though.\
Overall: 8/10\
I quite enjoyed it, even if it had a few this and that's, but I would recommend it to anybody who likes  the mystery, supernatural and suspense genre.\
For recommendations I would point out: \
-Bloody Monday, having also a suspense plot line in it and a little mystery. \
-Ajin, has also a suspense plot line and you get kinda the same feeling while reading it as when you are reading Death Note.\
Thanks for taking your time and reading my review! ;)\

    death note starts with your average (but smart) student light yagami who sits in class staring out the window, notices something falling and goes to see what it was after class, and low and behold, it was the death note! which is basically a shinigami (death reapers) tool of killing literally anybody. at first light didnt believe it was real and was just a gag or something, as any body would at first. but then he tested it. he gets lots of ideas and decides he wants to start killing more and more, he wants to be basically the justice of the world to make\
          \
        it a better place for all the good people. but as expected, the authorities dont see eye to eye and they try and use all their resources to find light. through the whole series its always \"omg omg omg how is this gonna work\" and such. light always blows your mind on the things he does, its a rollar coaster ride from start to finish. one of the most popular series of all time and for a good reason.\

    Death Note is definitly one of the masterpieces that exists. The art is incredible, the history is very well crafted, everything glues together, and I think I don't have to say the characters. Until this day I remember the first time I've watched and surprised myself with the Light vs. L confrontations, the investigators from the police, and everything else.\
I gave 9 to Death Note just because one simple (or it should be) mistake, and the name of this mistake is NEAR. After Near introduction, the anime went really down to me. He got everything that L got and just \"\"\"\"solved\"\"\"\"\" the case with poor\
          \
        strategies. He is a BAD character that is only a fail copy of L, doesn't have a personality and is totally disappointing.",

    Unlike the brilliant anime, the Death Note manga in my opinions isn't quite as good. Yes, the story-line is identical apart froma few minor differences, nothing that changes anything. If you've seen the anime, you'll find it tedious re-reading the manga. Its the same.\
However Death Note doesn't quite suit the manga as well as the anime. It starts of very good, but towards the later numbers it becomes heavily text-based and you'll be trolling through pages of talkign which is slightly more bearable in anime.\
The only down-side to the manga is the artwork. Overall it is very good, but at time if you read it,\
          \
        you'll notice it is a bit sloppy, L most of all looks kinda retarded at times and a lot like an ape, therefore\
Overall it still is very good but just not quite up to scratch compared to the anime, I'd still recommend it as a good read.\

    This is so far the most awesome manga I have ever read in my life. There is a lot of good mangas that I really enjoy but this one is just epic.\
I like almost everything, from the story to the art concept.\
There's a lot of things I LOVE from this manga, the most important is that really makes me feel excited! the whole week I went to sleep thinking in \"What the hell is going to happen next...\" during the day, at my work I continuosly stopped thinking in who to resolve the puzzle... so I think the whole plot is awesome, both writer and\
          \
        artist are great to create such a interesting and umpredictable characters and make me feel like this.\
And of course there's some things I hated of this manga:\
The complite manga was quite... machist. Well... I'm a girl and I felt insult by most of the female characters. Totally superficial and stupid. Doing everything in the name of 'love'.\
If you like action, puzzles, suspense and yaoi (sorry but I have to say this, YAOI lovers will feel delighted with this piece of work) so, go a head and read it right now! and then watch the anime :)",

    Ah, Death Note. Not your ordinary manga story. I could honestly see something like this happen in real life, minus the shinigami and creepy death notebook. \
When I first saw Death Note I was like, \"ew.\" But then my friend told me to read it, and he even brought it to school. I wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to read manga when I saw it, so I read it. I fell in love with the first volume. The first chapter honestly isn't so, \"OMG I NEED TO KEEP READING\" but it's more like, \"Hm, interesting. Turn the page...\" few chapters later...\" OMG THIS\
          \
        IS AWESOME!!!\"\
What I really like about Death Note is that it's a real battle. Not a battle that's made with magical weapons and awesome powers, but a battle between who's right and who's wrong. And finally who reigns supreme. The two main characters, Light and L are some seriously badass geniuses. The battle is so tight you always wonder what happens next. What's their next plan? What's their next move? What about now? Keeps me awake all night thinking about it. XD\
The reason I gave the character a 9 is because I hate the way Light is portrayed. I understand why, but it's just ew. And also sometimes, you can't tell when a character is good or bad because they're just that vague. But overall, it's an amazing story a definite good read that will NOT disappoint you :)\

    Story: [10/10]\
The story is amazing. Light and Ryuk both think their world is rotten so they try to make it better. Ryuk escapes his world and looks for entertainment on earth by dropping a notebook. The best entertainment he could wish for, Yagami Light, picks up the book. This is when one of the biggest geniusses on earth starts to make that world a place worth for a god to live in... by killing criminals! Of course that makes him a criminal himself in the eyes of the law and the police and detective L. Light searches for L and L searches for Light, both\
          \
        to stop them. As they are both invincible since nobody knows anything about them, desperate needs lead to desperate deeds.\
I found myself a few major plot holes, but I just think of that as \"That person wasn't smart enough to do that\" but it really was searching for them and almost as hard to find as L for Light and visa versa.\
Art: [10/10]\
Simply the best art I've ever seen in manga, shonen at least.\
Characters: [9/10]\
Light and L both have my deepest respect. L is extremely cool besides his lack of social skills and Light is exactly how I would imagine an insanely smart person with that kind of book. He acted in most cases how I would act. \
the -1 is because of the position of women in this series: they are all relatively dumb and half of them is used. They also all fall for light like autumn leaves as if they have no mind on their own. Besides that: the heroine is very annoying.\
Enjoyment: [10/10]\
This is the part of the review I wanted to write the most:\
This manga challenged me mentally and logically. It made me question moral and death and it learned me to look at things differendly: more conciderately. The only other manga's/anime's that accomplished this so far are Liar Game and Akumetsu, but none of them was as strong as Death Note. \
Overall: [10/10]\

    This manga came out of left field and blew my mind away. I cannot recommend this manga highly enough- everything about it was amazing! The deep character development and the twists make you feel like your riding the craziest roller coaster from beginning to end! However if your looking for crazy, bloody action sequences  you might want to look elsewhere. This particular manga will definitely crack open that mind of yours and really make you think, almost forcing you to put yourself into the shoes of some of the characters, and there is quite an amount of reading to do.

    Hmmm what can I say about Death Note? It's almost indescribable. It's good I can definitely say that. The plot is brilliantly conceived and it excels in the way it evolves, twisting and turning and oh so much thinking.\
It has a perfect pace, with events unfolding just right, very calculated. And it also has the comedic relief to lighten the serious tone that this manga so frequently has. The artwork is lovely, the Shinigami are drawn creatively and I like that they differ from preconceptions and no two are the same. I'd love to learn more about them.\
The characters are great. I love Near, Mello\
          \
        and L, they are so off the wall and original. Light, wow, he's so calculating and clever it's scary but at the same time he's loveable and I pity him for the curse of the Death Note. The whole idea for a story is so unique and clever and it's been told wonderfully.\
Is there a downside to this manga? I don't actually think there is, I can't think of any criticisms. I don't like L and Lights fate but its all in the telling of the story, everything that happened had to. Nope I have to say this manga is all good.\
And the best bits are the amount of thinking and calculating and second guessing the characters do. Sometimes I found myself lost in their thoughts and in awe of their plans. I also liked the way we didn't always see the plans being made, we saw the outcomes and then flash backs.\
If you like a fast paced action/detective/thriller manga or just fancy a new series give this one a go. Just don't expect it to be a happy go lucky story.\

    Ok, so I read Death Note religiously for 5 days and finished all 12 volumes of it. And I absolutely loved it. For this review I am going to start a new format where I list the basic pros and cons with no spoilers, then go into a person rant about what I loved and hated.\
Pros:\
-Very smart and cunning characters\
-Suspenseful story, always making you want more\
-Interesting love story\
-The ever complicating rules of the Notebook\
-The ending\
Cons:\
-The main character's God complex becomes overwhelming at times\
-Can't tell if the main character is evil, a jerk, or just psychotic \
Personal Rant +SPOILERS+\
Okay, so I decided that I would read\
          \
        Death Note as a quick break from the other manga I have been reading, but then I was absorbed into the story line in no time at all. So first, the things I hated. I did not like how Light was defeated, it was so unprofessional. Then again, when Ruyuk killed Light himself, I applauded him. At first when Light died, I thought deep in my heart how I didn't want Light to die and take over the world with Misa. Then, after I thought about it, I was so glad how Near won. I also liked it how Misa was kept alive, she was my favorite character, of course she did turn into a Kira worshiper. Another thing I loved was how the rules of the Notebook were used in so many different ways. So I give this manga a perfect 10!\

    Glad I finished this on a whim after dropping it roughly half way through. Death Note is a well regarded classic at this point and not without a reason but it's not without flaws. \
Art: Realistic, detailed and grounded. Usually this combination leads to good looking but rather bland looking titles, not the case here. Obata is really talented when it comes to design and style, he deserves a lot of credit for making a manga about people talking always looking so cool. There's a lot of care put into the way every character looks, dresses or walks to separate them from each other and\
          \
        complete their personality. Designs for everything paranormal are exceptional, I wish Shinigami played a bigger role if just to see them more often. \
Overall the look is very clean, everything looks like it was meticulously drawn with maximum precision which basically means no sketchy lines or visual inconsistencies. Shading is very detailed which helps that realistic look but there's also some nice hard light and shadows for more dramatic scenes. \
Characters: while main cast is pretty interesting and varied, it's not the point of the manga. It's about a tense game of playing cat and mouse so it doesn't really matter how deep or developed the characters are. However they are distinct and quirky enough make their interactions fun to read. \
Story: Death Note, at its core is a battle of wit between two opponents, trying to stay one step ahead of each other to accomplish their goal and assert their own superiority. \
While it can provoke a discussion about justice and morality, as author stated, the point of the manga is just to a fun, thrilling ride which is why won't discuss those themes. At no point they are really explored or even addressed so even if you applied the whole author's death concept there would be little to talk about. However I think Ohba is admirable for managing to create a story where it's still possible to root for the villain even if you disagree with his ideology well at least I do). \
In summary there's little variance in plot progression, until the very end it's just a constant back and forth with stakes gradually getting higher, from faith of one individual to entire humanity. It all comes down to whether or not you'll find that enjoyable. There's valid complaint that many events are unrealistic , unlikely, and some other 'un's. However I think if you're gonna read a manga with gods of death and notebook that kills people in any possible way, some suspension of disbelief is in order. \
At last, there's one complaint I had and it's that the whole thing can get very drawn out and wordy at times. In particular when Death Note gets in the hands of corporate assholes the manga asks too much when you're supposed to care about page after page of really boring musings about how these people you know nothing about will use the notebook. There are other minor moments when characters explaining their deduction process becomes redundant but it's far less offensive. \
Funfactor: Death Note is an entry level title for a good reason. It's well made and easy to get into or recommend. It's probably a good get if you somehow still haven't seen or read it. \

    In my opinion Death Note is one of the greatest manga series of its time. The artwork in the manga was very realistic,  the facial expressions are so real it's like you are experiencing what the characters are going through.  The story also had me on the edge of my seat because you never knew what was going to happen next.  It was full of suspense and it kept you guessing on what was going to happen.  The characters were also very well done.  They reacted to situations in a realistic way, which is surprising given some of the supernatural\
          \
        elements of the manga.  The  characters were also drawn in a way that fit their personalities.  I would highly recommend this manga to others because it combines thriller and action all rolled into one.\

    Death Note is a rather interesting piece of work. I had never come across a manga quite like it, or characters like the ones I see in here. It starts off with 17 year old Light Yagami finding the Death Note. A Shinigami's handbook that if you write a person's name in it (and assuming you know their face) they die. Sounds like some sort of a sick joke right? Right? Wrong. The power of this little notebook is very real, and so real Yagami couldn't help but be tempted. \
\
Welcome to the world of Deathnote where deception, and keeping on your toes is everything.\
          \
        That is what really hooked me about this manga is the complexity of most of the cast. Especially our two main men, Light and L. The dynamics between the two of them were intriguing. I was finding myself unable to put the manga down once I bought it! Everything in this manga does not happen without a precise, and clear reason. There are no piddly plot holes, or things that are untouched. To the first time viewer you may have to read it, and maybe one volume, numerous times to catch something you missed. Make sure you read the dialog again, and when you come to the volume after, go back and make connections. It's like your part of the twisted and macabre tale. \
As far as the art goes Death Note is superb. The characters all imbue a sense of realism. Painting the realistic portrait here is what makes it so frightening sometimes. Characters are also top notch, and you'll notice many personalities. One character that stuck out the most, aside from the main cast was Touta Matsuda (hence my SN). He just seems like a genuine goofball, a light hearted guy through most of this. To me he was refreshing he was so undeniably human. \
So give this manga whirl, I can bet you will not be disappointed. \

I want to make love with this manga's collection. I want smothered it all my love. \
Reading this make me feel like riding a jetpack while having double miniguns and fu*ked all the dinosaurs into extinction by time machine.\
It's so good, I feel like I was frolicking at the back of a hairy polar bear while riding a unicorn while watching godzilla and some random monster from ultraman fighting each other.\

Ok, let's cut to the chase.. the Review.\
The story is undoubttly have any plotholes (for me, I don't know if any Death Note fans out there have any). Every action, event and path for the storyline in the manga is just good and make sense in any way or another. \
They don't have boring storyline at all, they just kept us entertained and suspensed railing on for waiting the next chapter.\
It's a story about an excellent student, Yagami Light that really have a remarkable sense of strong justice run through his veins. Well, wait 'till you see when he possessed the Death Note, he went from Genius to batshit insane of a mad murderer.\
Of course, what comes around goes around.. here comes the Detective infamous of it quirks and child-like behaviour,L.\
Of course, the clash of minds begin and the odds one will be eliminated.\
\
****MAJOR SPOILERS******\
L IS DEAD! RAMMED BY A CARGO FULL OF CANDY!!\
************************\
As for the continuation. another Detective by the heir of L himself.. N and M ,Mello. The stories went a little bit of confusing but you can pretty much catch it up all the way~ \
That's for the storyline, other than that I can't reveal anymore. I know putting spoilers are ridiculous because this manga is considered fossil by today's date, but have a respect for the new reader that never enlightened to read this manga on how good it is.\
The art is a little bit different from any typical manga you ever read. Because they keep it realistic and seriousness. Of course, even I would've crap this manga if they done any MOE stuff in it. \
The character are well DONE! They have the story portrays as a hardworking genius battles with a natural genius. Each character have it's own interesting attribute and design that we could differentiate one and another.\
Their motives are clearly shown, their personality and others.\
If you ask me, my favourite character would be L. Of course, it's highly typical with other Otakus out there.. but I like him because I can relate pretty much everything with him and little bit from N.\
I'd say L is more smarter than N but with a little bit more of an initiative but in logic skills, N takes it all the way.\
Overall.\
It was great, I recommend everyone should read the manga alongside the BB case itself. Yes~ the Los Angeles Beyond Birthday case. Probably the most mind twisting and gore, but explains on how Wammy house operates itself.\

    This is truly a great series. The story starts off with a teenager who finds a book labeled Death Note. He finds out, after testing it, that writing the full name of someone you've seen before kills that person. Young Light tries to bring justice to the world by using this book but is challenged by the government, telling him that what he's doing is wrong. I absolutely loved the beginning of this series when it was Light vs. L. Towards the end it started to  progress a little fast and I was a little bit disappointed with the ending because I felt it\

    To anyone planning to read this manga (or watch the anime) please take your time with it because it is a handful of things to take in and trust me, you'll probably get confused sometimes, but nonetheless this series is actually one of my favorite manga/anime. First of all, both the concept and the art work for DN are what really drew me to this manga in the first place. Takeshi Obata did an excellent job with the character designs even with the minor characters and the atmosphere that he created with the scenery in the background really made it enjoyable to both read and\
          \
        look at. I couldn't take me eyes off of it! I would sometimes stare and stare at a page for about 5 minutes or more! Takeshi Obata is truly one of manga's most talented artists in my opinion. Ok, so now to Death Note's story/concept. This manga really gets you thinking even with just reading the first chapter. Just think about it, a notebook that can kill just by writing someone's name in it. How cool and twisted is that? And it even comes with your own personal shinigami (or Death God) so why not? But in all seriousness, if you want an manga that really gets you thinking with good artwork and great character designs, then read Death Note. I'm sure that you won't regret it.\

    The story of Death note is divided into two sagas. The first saga consists of the first seven volumes. Surely this saga is the best. We can see the battle of wits among L. Lawliet and Kira (Light Yagami). It's one plot twist after another.\
The second saga is worse than first saga. Some key characters are vanished, and some situations become repetitive.\
Takeshi Obata is a great illustrator. I love his dark style.\
Very good manga, many plot twists (the ending is incredible), not much action, but much reasoning.\
For the most part, the characters are good (Lawliet is the best!).\
Maybe not for all. Anyway reccomended.\

    Reading Death Note was one of the defining manga moments in my life. Up until I had read Death Note, all I had ever read was shounen manga. Which, don't get me wrong, can be awesome! But Death Note was the first series I read that played with more mature concepts like life and death, morality, and the individuals role in society. All of that was coupled with some of the most suspenseful and masterful storytelling I've ever read.\
The premise for the series itself is amazing, our hero/antihero is given power over life and death itself in the form of a notebook. The two main\
          \
        characters are unforgettable. The story is a battle between two sides of the law, between two views of the world, and two total bad-ass geniuses. The art was perfect for the story, which is all I look for. The first half series of the novel was stronger than the rest. But when I think of Death Note, I know where the series ends for me truly (with the resolution of the conflict between L and Light).\
Death Note will always hold a special place in my manga history and my heart.\

Death Note is a series that I hold very dear because it illustrated to me that anime/manga can be very smart, clever and at the same time, enjoyable. \
When I first read the series, I loved it and considered it a masterpiece; I wouldn't do the same thing now, but it's still a great series.\
The series itself is very clever in nature and is very original. It has great use of literary devices such as foreshadowing which can be seen in the first chapter, great character development, and several red herrings peppered throughout the series. The mangaka duo, Ohba and Obata, seem to change\
          \
        Shounen manga series each time they write a series. With Death Note, they delivered a great complex mystery thriller that is a great gateway for people who generally don't like manga or anime. \
          Story:\
I really liked the cat-and-mouse game between L and Light. Each battle was extremely intense, and each genius always was attempting to outclass the other. The subsequent arcs were very methodical in nature and  greatly planned out. The whole story basically questioned your morals and whether or not you thought it was right to kill criminals to create a utopia in a extremely hypocritical manner.  The second half is much weaker than the first half as an important happens that changes the course of the story; the second includes two very prominent but weak characters who seem to be duplicate L's. That's it; it was as if you took the \"logical\" side of L and turned that into a character, and his \"emotional\" side and turned that into a character resulting in two very bland characters: Near and Mello respectively. \
          Characters:\
First we have L.  L was an amalgamation of everything odd with humans. He was an extremely paranoid individual who really didn't know how to present himself in society whilst at the same time being so incredibly intelligent that many people considered him to be one of the smartest in the world. He was pretty cool with his weird quirks, BUT he was also pretty bland, almost only there to move the plot forward with his plans against Light. On the other hand, we have Light Yagami. A genius high-school student who goes through a mental rewiring once he basically attained absolute power. Each is essentially the polar opposite of the other, as Light is clean, presentable and neat, while L is a \"mad-genius\". The cat-and-mouse games between the two geniuses were so cleverly done that in order to outclass the other, you would have to secretly kill people while eating potato chips. Yes, potato chips. \
Basically what I got from L and Light was that if wants to be so intelligent, then that person must border on insanity. This was exemplified through the actions of both individuals. \
Near and Mello were very poorly handled, and I think it's an unfortunate result of Shueisha insisted on continuing the story of Death Note; Tsugumi Ohba possibly felt that the series was coming to a close after the death of a certain character. Either way, I personally didn't like the characters or the subsequent second halves as much as I did with the first half. \
          Art:\
Obata does an amazing job with his crisp drawings of all of the buildings and character designs. With his great understanding of human proportions, you have great scale drawings of humans and the shinigami. \
Overall, Death Note is a great series with amazing art, an amazing first half, an OK cast of main characters, and one hell of ride. The pacing can get sporadic at times during the second half, but the aforementioned cat-and-mouse games and great use of literary techniques and themes makes up for it. \

This manga started off very good and I couldn't put it down, but I felt it just went on too long. It should have ended around volume 7-8. The story arc with L vs. Kira was great, an almighty battle of wits between two geniuses. The next arc after L dies, with Mello and Near just seemed boring to me and diminished L's significance. I thought it was kind of lame that when L died there were a bunch of other kids from the orphanage that could just take his place. For this reason I even stopped reading and have this series on hold.\
Also, there\

        was SO MUCH exposition and explaining in this manga series. There is explaining of rules and explaining of theories and explaining of plans, it got very tiresome to read after a while. I found myself re-reading pages because I was confused.\
Overall I would give this series an 8 because the art is fantastic, the story is very original, and I really enjoyed the first story arc. However, I will say that I don't think it is as amazing as people have built it up to be.",

Okay, so.... I really Death Note. The characters were SO COOL AND INTELLIGENT!!! For example Light, and L!!! \
They're both really intelligent, and good at deceiving people!!! I LOVE HOW THEY TRY DECEIVING THEMSELVES, AND THEY BOTH KNEW WHO THEY REALLY WERE!!!!\
For example, one of my favorite cool part is how Light manages to trick L many times, and another of my favorite part is when Light's plan (to loose his memories, and after regain them, so he can clear his and Misa's suspects as Kira and Kira 2) was so, so INGENIOUS!!! \
The story was REALLY good except at the end,\
          \
        when Light was trapped by the police and L, and he begs Ryuuk to kill the police and L, but Ryuuk kills Light with the Death Note instead of killing the kill the police and L. That part was so sad. How Light was begging Ryuuk to save him, but instead, Ryuuk kills him.... I really liked the plot. The powers of the Death Note... \

    \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\": a quote that Light Yagami would have done well to understand. In Death Note, the question of the value of human life and the solution to crime is presented to Light in the form of the Death Note in question, and the events that ensue are one hell of a ride. \
The story of Death Note grips you at every single stage, and never lets you go. Even when the main cast of characters change into slightly less-enjoyable counterparts (cough Near), the excellent story-telling is preserved. The story begins with a young Light finding a mysterious notebook while on his way\
          \
        home from school. Written inside are rules that state 'whoever's name is written in this book will die'. Believing it to be a hoax, Light jokingly tries it out on a criminal that he can see on a nearby TV. To his surprise, the criminal is found dead of a heart attack. This is all it takes for Light to be convinced that he has a higher purpose in life: to become a god of the new world. Soon thereafter, news agencies begin to see a trend developing and realize that there must be murder plot, and so they call in the world's greatest detective, 'L'. He becomes Light's prime enemy in the series, and the intellectual battle between the two geniuses is quite simply one of the greatest stories put to paper. When Light's secondary antagonists come onto the scene, they seem to pale in comparison to 'L', but if you can look past that , they are enjoyable on their own merit. The ending is a source of much contention to many fans; I will not spoil anything but whether or not you are on team Light or team 'L' will drastically change your reaction to the ending. I found it very satisfying, all things considered, and the tension in the final confrontation is again some of the best written in manga. \
The art, as always with Takeshi Obata, is absolutely stunning, and it only gets better as you go along. There is so much detail in every panel that you may find yourself getting lost in each and every scene, admiring the way his hair and faces just appear perfectly natural. If you pick up the black edition like I did, you are greeted with some beautiful colour pages at the ends of the volumes.\
The characters are a perfect mix of likeable and hate-able, which makes it very hard to choose sides in this manga. Even though Light is a bat-shit crazy serial killer, I can't help but root for him through every step of the way, just like how 'L' is trying to stop my favourite character and arrest him; I still get excited for 'L's' victories, because they are all equally enjoyable. The Shinigami, basically gods of death who grant Death Note's to humans, provide most of the comic relief in the manga, and all three of the main Shinigami are done very well, each with their own distinct personalities. This is also true of the Japanese Task Force, which is present through ought the entirety of the manga and thus you get to know each of the characters and their tropes very well. The only slightly weak characters are the aforementioned second antagonists to Light; they aren't terrible, but they pale in comparison to 'L', so they end up feeling like a useless waste. \
I actually watched the anime first. In fact, Death Note was my first anime and remains to be my favourite. This was also the manga that got me into reading and collecting the medium, and I couldn't have picked a better series. With the manga, I got to experience Obata's gorgeous art and Ohba's story in their original form, and it was very interesting to see how the endings differed and the theory that Matsuda presents at the very end totally changed my perception of the ending.\
Overall, Death Note has treated me, once again, with a fantastic and thrilling treat. I can safely recommend both the anime and manga to anyone even slightly interested in either, as they are nearly perfect. And hell, I know its great for beginners because it totally converted me. Death Note is one of the few mainstream series that is actually worth the hype, and nearly all snobby anime elitists will even agree with that sentiment. If you want an engaging story that treats you like an adult, then this manga is for you. 10/10\

    I'm so going to miss reading this manga!\
First of all the plot is very genius and unique, the characters (Light, L also Light's father and Ryuk) are absolutely great and different.\
However,\
1) I think that this manga would've been better if it was 9-10 volumes because there were a lot of fillers which had no purpose at all (example Yotusba weirdos)\
2) if the writer did only ONE person point of thinking (which would be Light's) and not every character because seriously who cares what a police man REALLLLLY is thinking especially that it won't add a thing to the story?\
3) if the L replacement was actually\
          \
        A SMART DETECTIVE not a retard little boy (near) who's character is soooooo boring and unrealistic.\
4) Mello and Near NEVER HAPPENED.\
Another thing I can say is that Obata only focused on developing Light character but failed with some others.\
I was so sad to see Light die this pathetically in front of Near :\"( and why Near have to live?? Argh! And yes, I do think that near used the death note, I don't trust him!\
Overall, the manga was really good, could've been better? YES but it was really good (except for 3 volumes) and I'm glad that I read it as my first manga and I recommend it for everybody. \

    Everybody pretty much knows what happens in this story. A battle of wits between \"L\" and Kira. I'll keep it short and straight to the point: the art is incredible, especially the hair, but the plotlines with the different tactics was awesome to read, especially towards the end where \"N\" and Kira give their big monologues about how they got the advantage on the other.\
While reading the story, you may come to understand Kira's side (evil needs to be wiped out, but can only be done by a divine presence. I believe that's a truth in this world.), but you will love L even more\
          \
        for all the stunts he pulls. Now there are going to be characters you'll hate, such as Mello, Misa, Higuchi, Mikami.\
Now, of course the best part of the manga was Kira vs. the original L (Lawliet), even though that had a huge decline in quality with the Yotsuba group story-arc (just pointless overall), and I didn't really care for Near (N), as he was plain useless until the last 10 or so chapters. Near is no Lawliet. That said, you'll absolutely love this classic. \

    I completely fell in love with this manga. I loved the way the two main characters faced off with each other and their intelligence. I loved how the story line basically talked about one of the world's most asked questions and whether or not L's side was right or Light's side was right. However, after a certain main character died (people who have read the series know who I am talking about) the series just fell out for me. It wasn't as nearly as fun to read anymore and I felt Light was making too many mistakes than he was before and that the way\
          \
        he freaked out so much about getting caught was so uncharacteristic. I wish the authors hadn't did that but hey, maybe they were reaching for the element of surprise. Any who, good story, just wished it could have been changed at some parts. \

 L, who also uses the aliases Hideki Ryuga, Ryuzaki, Eraldo Coil and Deneuve, the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second&mdash;and third&mdash;best detectives in the world, is quite secretive and only communicates with the world through his assistant Watari. He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refer to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\
 \
 L's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\
 \
 L suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\

 The original Shinigami who dropped the Death Note in the human world, and also love apples, which Light would pick up. Acting out of pure boredom, Ryuk begins the story of Death Note on a whim. Perhaps neutral by nature, Ryuk often refuses to aid Light and instead enjoys watching him struggle for his goal. The most important facet of Ryuk's character is that he is not Light's friend. He acts for his own interests and entertainment, and often fails to tell Light key details about the Death Note. Ryuk is selfish, however, and will aid Light if it serves his own goals, such as providing amusement or obtaining apples.\

 Light, born on February 28, 1986, is a third year high school student (12th grade) at Daikoku Private Academy (大国学園, Daikoku Gakuen) who also attends supplemental classes at Gamou Prep Academy in the beginning of the story. Light has a father, Soichiro Yagami, who is the head of the Police Force. Light also has a mother, Sachiko Yagami, and a younger sister, Sayu Yagami.\
 \
 In Spring 2004, Light becomes a first-year student (freshman) at To-Oh University (東応大学, Tōō Daigaku), becoming one of two freshman representatives; L is the other freshman representative. During a tennis game with L at To-Oh, spectators reveal that Light was the junior high school tennis champion in 1999 and 2000. After his 2000 victory, Light quit tennis as he entered high school.\
 \
 Yagami Light is a brilliant college student. Nicknamed \"Kira,\" he uses the Death Note to create his ideal world of justice under him; its new God. Though he looks frail, Light is an extremely athletic person, with an aptitude to find an opponent's weak point. He is a genius, which adds to his notion that only he is fit to judge humanity and steer it on a proper moral course.\

 Misa is a famous model, singer and actress and has an immense crush on Light Yagami. She usually refers to herself in the third person by calling herself \"Misa-Misa\" and tends to be hyperactive. She poses as the second Kira to attract the attention of the first Kira.\
 \
 She decides to devote her life to Light because he punished the criminal that killed her parents when she was younger; a burglar killed Misa's parents in front of her eyes. Misa, unable to forgive the killer and wanting to kill the burglar herself, saw multiple delays in the killer's trial before Kira killed him. The Shinigami who follows her is Rem. Misa also performs two eye trades, cutting her lifespan in half twice; the first was with Rem, and the second with Ryuk.\
 \
 According to How to Read 13, Misa falls into despair after learning of Light's death through Matsuda. Misa commits suicide one year later on February 14, 2011. It is also revealed that the cloaked woman who appears at the end of the manga is not Misa, but simply a follower of Kira.\
 \

 Halle Lidner, real name Halle Bullook, works for Near as part of his investigation team, along with Gevanni and Rester. She is mentioned to be a former CIA agent.\
 \
 \
 In the manga, Lidner knows Mello and leaks SPK information to Mello; Near is unaware of Lidner's SPK information leaking. When Mello questions her and asks her which side she is on(Near or his), She replies that she is on neither side, and merely helps both of them because they are after Kira. Later on, she calls Mello and tells him about Near's plan(Having Mikami write everyone's name down in the notebook), and he replies \"I'm the only one who can do it.\". This can be seen as the real push that drove Mello to kidnap Takada and eventually save the lives of both investigation teams.\
 \
 Mikami views her real name, Halle Bullook, with his Shinigami eyes and proceeds to write her name as well as the other SPK members' names into his Death Note, but she remains alive due to the notebook being a fake.\

 In Chapter 98, he fires a smoke bomb at Takada's bodyguards as a distraction to allow Mello to kidnap Takada; in the next chapter he meets face to face with Takada's bodyguards.

 Mello is the older of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. When it is decided that Mello should work with the other successor, Near, Mello refuses, citing an inability to work with Near, to whom he is considered second. Similar to L's fondness for sweets, Mello is often seen eating bars of chocolate. How to Read 13 states that Mello has \"an excellent mind\" and that he \"sometimes lets his emotions get in his way.\" The book cites Mello's \"hatred of Near,\" which created \"a flaw in [Mello's] personality.\" The book states that Mello isn't purely evil, citing his apology and genuine care for Matt's well-being. Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of Death Note, stated that Mello \"works hard for everything.\" Ohba added that Mello's name \"doesn't really stand for anything,\" as opposed to Near's name standing for Nate River, etc.\
 \
 Mello is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki in the Japanese anime,  David Hurtwitz in the English version and Javier Olgu&iacute;n in the Latin Spanish dub.\
 \
 Mello decides to find Kira his own way by joining the Mafia. After obtaining one of the Death Notes from the Kira investigation team by kidnapping Sayu Yagami, Light Yagami sets up a raid that leaves Mello badly scarred and his real name in Light's hands. After learning that Light is Kira and Near was going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello kidnaps Kiyomi Takada, but is soon killed by Takada's hidden pages of the Death Note. This action causes Teru Mikami to expose his own Death Note to kill Takada, an action that Near picks up on and is eventually able to use to thwart Light's plans. Near reflects this during the final showdown and credits Mello as the single most pivotal person in discovering Light's plans. Hal Lidner further believes that it was Mello's plan that he would be killed to expose Light's plan, but Near rejects this theory.\
 His date of death is January 26th, 2010. Age 20.\
 Mello is the narrator of the spinoff novel Death Note - Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases.\

 Wedy, real name Mary Kenwood, is a professional burglar in the employ of L. She installs bugs in the Yotsuba Group's meeting room to secretly observe the group's weekly meetings. She does the same for Higuchi's car, allowing the team to watch his desperate attempts to kill Matsuda. Since she is a professional criminal, she is known solely in the underworld.\

 Wedy uses her initial in computer communication; to avoid confusion with Watari (\"W\"), she deliberately uses the lowercase form, \"w\".\
 \
 She (like Aiber) is referenced to, but does not appear in, Death Note: Another Note.\

 Ohba said that he created Aiber and Wedy so he could use characters with \"special abilities\" to advance the storyline. He said that he wanted to use Wedy more than Aiber. As an example he explained a scenario involving Light controlling Wedy, making her place cameras in the headquarters so Misa could see L's face \"... or something.\"\
 \
 According to Obata, he drew Wedy as a female model as he did not know what kind of character she would be. Obata added that Wedy has the \"stereotypical female spy look.\" Obata believes that if he drew Aiber and Wedy to look \"a little bit more original\", Ohba could have included the characters in a larger role in Death Note.\

 After L's death, Light kills her using his Death Note; Mary Kenwood dies in a motorcycle accident in Colorado. \

 He and his family, as well as Yagami's, were investigated by FBI agent Raye Penber over the leaking of information to Kira. Following Penber's death by Kira, L ordered similar investigations on both families: Kitamura's daughter was even approached by Mogi, posing as L, implying that she was under suspicion of being Kira — while L himself approached the actual suspect, Light Yagami. Kitamura confronted Soichiro Yagami over the issue of his daughter's treatment and was frustrated by Soichiro's insistence that secrecy prevented him from revealing details of the investigation, though Soichiro did admit that it was his own son who was the real suspect.\
 \
 Kitamura later helped Soichiro out of the Sakura TV studio after he had seized the Kira tapes which the station was broadcasting and which had led to several deaths by Kira. Kitamura sent a riot squad with police buses, shields and face-covering helmets in order to get Soichiro safely out of the building.\
 \
 However, he was later forced to call off the Kira investigation when politicians were threatened by Kira and bribed by the Yotsuba Group for whom Kira was then working for. He told Soichiro that he had tried to oppose the move but had little choice but to comply while telling the public that the investigation was still ongoing. He did offer Soichiro the right to continue the hunt for Kira, while performing other non-connected police duties, provided that he cut off all ties with L. Soichiro and other members of the Kira Investigation Team decided instead to quit the police force and continue to work with L, eventually exposing Yotsuba and its connection to Kira.\

 Tota is known as the most outspoken member in the investigation team. He plays a crucial role in the investigation of the Yotsuba Group after sneaking into the company's building without the knowledge of the team. His designated investigation team alias is Taro Matsui.\
 \
 By following L's instructions, Matsuda gains the trust of the company's board members, fabricates his death (he uses the alias Taro Matsui) so that Yotsuba members can not kill him), and serves as a temporary decoy to lure the suspect into the Sakura television studio during the second Sakura TV incident. Despite his excitable, na&iuml;ve personality, Matsuda manages to stay alive through quite a few dangerous times. Matsuda sees Soichiro as his mentor.\
 \
 While it is clear that most of the investigation team views Kira as a an evil criminal, Matsuda often wonders if Kira is performing good deeds, especially since more and more people seem to be agreeing with what he does. Matsuda is scared by Mikami's intense loyalty to Kira when he hears Mikami's public announcement on Sakura TV. Matsuda proves to be somewhat supportive and sympathetic towards Kira's followers nonetheless.\
 \
 When Light is revealed as Kira at Yellowbox Warehouse, Matsuda is the most shocked of the team. He has always liked Light and is outraged to learn that he had been fooled; he is particularly upset, asserting that Light's actions had led to the death of Soichiro. Matsuda succeeds in saving Near's life by shooting Light's hand, causing him to drop the pen that he was writing Near's name with. Matsuda shoots him several more times to stop Light from writing Near's name in his own blood. The enraged Matsuda nearly kills Light with a shot to the head, but he is stopped by the rest of the Japanese investigation team.\
 \
 \
 As shown in the final chapter, Matsuda suspects that, to help with Light's capture, Near has used the Death Note to control Mikami's actions before killing him, but Ide says that he has no proof and it may be a \"wish\" on his part, perhaps related to his thinking of Light as a friend. \

 In Death Note, Near is the youngest of L's two successors raised in Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children, in Winchester, England, United Kingdom. Of the successors, Near is the more level-headed, calmly assessing the situation, while the other, Mello, is more emotional and quick to act. Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice. Near uses the Wedding Text font \"N\" and \"L\" to represent himself and the fake L, respectively. But later in the aftermath, he used Old English font \"L\" like the original L did. He is voiced by Noriko Hidaka in the Japanese anime, Cathy Weseluck in the English dub, and Bruno Coronel in the Latin Spanish version.\
 \
  It is speculated by Matsuda in Death Note: Oneshot that Near uses the Death Note to manipulate Mikami into failing Light in the final battle, which would shed light on some major plotholes. It's important to note that Tsugumi Ohba has said that he wanted it to be left up to the readers on if Matsuda is right or not.\
 Tsugumi Ohba, writer of Death Note, said that Near \"becomes less likeable\" as the story advances, citing Near's plan to take the notebook at a later point in the story. Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from \"the difference in their attitudes\" and that people may have viewed Near as \"a cheat.\" Ohba added that Near's \"cheeky behavior,\" intended to \"reinforce his childishness,\" had been construed as \"annoying.\"\
 \
 In the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Obata views Near as not liking L much so Obata had Near depict L as \"ugly\", and that Near \"worked hard\" on Mello's puppet as Near \"liked Mello.\"\
 \
 Obata said he enjoyed drawing Near and that Near is also one of his favorite and his least favorite characters, considering him to be the smartest character in the manga \"because he cheats.\"\
 \
 When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and \"maybe Light.\" Regarding Near, Ohba said that he does not leave his house often.\

That he is Kira only enthralls her more, especially when he asks her to be his queen in the perfect world they only dreamed of when they were in school together. Mello and Matt kidnap Takada; Takada's bodyguards shoot Matt while Mello takes Takada. Mello forces Takada to take her clothes off, and Takada writes Mello's real name in the Death Note. In Chapter 99, Light writes her name into the Death Note as a suicide by fire, after she tells him that she has killed Mello.\
 \
 According to <i>How to Read 13</i>, Takada was born on July 12, 1985 and dies on January 26, 2010. She is 5'4\" and weighs 97 lbs. Her blood type is AB.\

 He is later disposed of, along with the rest of the Yotsuba group, by Light's writing their names into the Death Note. \

 Death Note: How to Read 13 confirms that he was killed by Kira (Light Yagami), though in the manga Light himself does not openly confirm this in his thoughts or in conversation. Near and Mello themselves speculate that it could have been either Kira's doing or actual suicide. \

He is voiced by Kiyoshi Kobayashi in the Japanese anime and French Tickner in the English dub (except for the film, in which Ron Halder takes over). \
 Watari's name was originally going to be \"Shadow\" in reference to being L's shadow, but the editor disapproved, which led to the name \"Watari\", which references his role as a handler.The design team decided on Watari's design during the second chapter. Obata did not put much thought into Watari's disguise because his face did not appear, but afterwards, the rough drafts had Watari as an elderly man with a single strip of hair. Obata decided to keep him as an old man because older characters were more fun to draw than younger ones because of the \"weird angles\" that could be created with their wrinkles, while younger characters may be designed as \"attractive, normal, or ugly.\" Obata likes leather coats, so he had Watari wear one.Watari is Obata's third favorite human character because he likes older characters and that because Watari \"seemed to be hiding a lot of ability\" and \"had depth.\"His birthday is May 1, 1933. Watari was always counted as a father and is often seen giving L snacks.\

Light asks her out so that he won't arouse suspicion, since he is well aware of being followed by Penber.  \
 When the bus is hijacked by Kiichiro Osoreda, he writes a note to Yuri, telling her that he will try to attack the hijacker with a technique his father taught him. \
 \
 Penber sees this, and warns Light that it's too risky and to let him handle it. Light replies that he doesn't know if he should trust Penber, since it is possible that he could be the hijacker's partner. Yuri nervously questions what Light is saying, and he replies that during hijacks, there are often two criminals working together: one doing the hijacking, and the other disguised as a bystander. To prove that he can be trusted, Penber shows Light his identification, certain that Light cannot be Kira. \
 \
 Light, now having the information which he needs, drops a piece of paper from his Death Note onto the floor. Osoreda sees this and, as planned, picks it up and reads it, to discover that it is only date plans. When he looks up he sees Ryuk, and starts shooting him, using up all of his bullets. Osoreda then runs off of the bus and gets hits by a car, getting killed, just as Light had specified in his Death Note. \
 \
 Despite all of this, Yuri seems to recover, and insists on going to Space Land. Apparently she has quite a crush on Light. \

  synopsis = "A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm. High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be. With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
