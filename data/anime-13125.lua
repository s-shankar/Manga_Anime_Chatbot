            Little inspection into the dystopia genre is required to realise that the majority of the dystopic anime are set in a cyberpunk universe. Be it Psycho Pass, Ergo Proxy or Texhnolyze, the average viewer is likely to have seen these \"hi-tech\" interpretations of future societies. Enter Shinsekai Yori – a series where whose setting is uncannily quaint such that on first glance, it is hard to see it as a dystopia; but it is, and an exceptionally remarkable one indeed.\
\9What distinguishes Shinsekai Yori from its counterparts is the sheer unorthodoxy of its universe. It is one where\
          \
        the modern society as we know it has not been replaced by a technologically advanced civilisation but that of a small picturesque town characterised by a community whose lifestyles have regressed into that of villagers. It is within these bounds that we follow our protagonists from the ages of 12 to 26 in this insidiously deceptive world. Throughout the series, Shinsekai Yori’s universe is constantly developed with fascinating conceptions such as the Karma Demons, Cantus and the Queerats (an entirely different yet intelligent species) that all bring into question many of our humanity’s morals and beliefs. Each concept is thoroughly explored and reinforce each other to create a powerful and fascinating dystopia whose elements successfully examines and challenges the philosophies we take for granted.\
        Despite its complexity, it does not lazily “narrate” the ideologies that we question. You won't be sitting through monologues of lecture-like philosophy or psychology. You see society being critiqued through the journey and consequences of the actions of our protagonists. This is what I find to be the most impressive aspect of the show because Shinsekai Yori fully takes advantage of anime as a medium - a feat that I feel is rare in this genre. The characters' dialogue exist to explore their mind whilst it is their actions and interactions with this post-apocalyptic world that we explore humanity. In order to truly appreciate Shinsekai Yori, it has to be completed as only then will the experience be complete as the show's construction of its world is careful to convey certain messages and hidden meanings throughout the show allowing viewers to formulate and reformulate key ideas and questions without ever stooping to overbearing narration.\
\9The characters in Shinsekai Yori all play crucial elements to our story and the range of our cast fully captures the countless perspectives that people in such a world can hold. They are all effectively portrayed via their interactions which unravels how multi-dimensional they are. These interactions are genuine and there is an excellent balance between dialogue, silence and narration from our female lead Saki whose voice actor must be praised for such an alluring performance. Despite the show’s timespan ranging from our protagonists’ youth to their adulthood, the pacing is impeccable as it changes from a slower pace to accommodate the universe-building to a faster pace needed to match the gravity of the conflicts that occur. \
\9For an immense dystopia, it only makes sense for it to be accompanied with diverse artwork. As we observe their world throughout the seasons and its numerous settings – oceans, mountains, villages both desolate and populated, they are portrayed with their own unique environment and colour choices. This is all contrasted with the use of experimental visuals and cinematography during the more dream-like and ethereal scenes which do not exist to simply invoke awe but contribute to subtly send hints across to the viewer on certain mysteries and foreshadowing certain events. Complementing the visuals is a soundtrack which encapsulates the essence of the show with each track strengthening the visuals and enhancing the overall experience. The soundtrack demonstrates how effectively music can make emotions across the human spectrum more compelling whilst respecting its role of being a supplement to the show and thus maintains our focus on the story the series presents - one which no extent of audiovisuals is required to make its ideas any more resounding than they already are.\
\9 All in all, Shinsekai Yori is a series that delivers in every single aspect it aims to explore. It displays enough to connect all the ideas examined together into a singular full dystopia but leaves enough for viewers to intellectually ponder and elaborate for themselves. It is profound yet not pretentious and examines humanity without falling into a safety net of tropes that may suffice the viewer but do not inspire. Unlike many of its counterparts, Shinsekai Yori is not a dystopia that relies on a singular premise but a whole host of powerful conceptions that coalesce to create, not just a society, but an entire universe. It achieves this with excellence and elegantly provides us with the most wholesome and meticulously crafted package of dystopian fiction I have ever seen and I unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who seeks the same.\

    Rewind back to the dawn of fall 2012, you are looking at the fall 2012 anime chart, and you pick probably 5-7 anime you are going to watch. But I can promise that the majority of you, as did I, most likely did not have Shinsekai Yori as a pick. During midst of 2013 I looked at Shinsekai Yori, the promotional picture did not catch my eye and the premises did not spark my interests. However, I did give it a shot and after finishing the anime I can promise that it is truly a spectacle, a diamond in the ruff.\
The story takes place in\
          \
        Japan a thousand years from the present in a utopia where a portion of the population retain a special power called psychokinesis. From the beginning we follow a group of five children as they grow up in the anime and see how they develop within a community bounded by strict rules, and deal with the decisions they make that alter the course of their lives and the entire society they live in. The plot of the show flows very nicely from episode to episode and just as we approach the climax, there’s a plot twist and the storyline from that point just flips upside down in a way you would never expect it to. \
The characters in this anime are just something else, with Saki as it’s shining star. The main characters start off as children and by the end of the anime they are adults, with proper illustration of character development. There are a couple of anime who have attempted this children to adulthood metamorphosis motif within one season but they do not pull it off as well as Shinsekai Yori. With an anime that has twenty-five episodes, you would think it would not be enough time for proper character development from children to adults. However, Shinsekai Yori pulls this off very smoothly, which is evidently seen with Saki and Satoru, which even applies to the supporting characters as well. You will not see one character behaving as such and then the next episode they are being the polar opposite, everything is explained and shown very well.\
The sound is one of the areas this anime excels in. Every sound that you would not even care for is implemented in every episode and added in the appropriate places, at the appropriate times; the echoing of the voices in a dim room, the rippling of water flowing from a stream. Not to mention soundtrack produced in this amine, which is amazing. Just youtube the battle theme, even if you have not watched the anime yet, it will entice your interests in this anime.\
The quality of the art and the animation is what you would expect of any anime standards that are out there today: clear, crisp and pleasing to the eye. The characters and the environment in each of the scenes are drawn to a level of detail, not too simple, yet not to far in detail as well, just in the middle. The quality of art really makes you focus on the message the anime is trying to radiate to the viewer; more than focusing of the wow factor on how amazing the art is. \
In terms of the enjoyment, this is not an anime that starts off on a high note and continues as such from there. The first two or three episodes really butters you up, but once you hit the fourth or fifth episode, I promise you, you will be hooked and you will just watch one episode after another. Even if you are more into romance, comedy, action or any genre that is not related to Shinsekai Yori, this anime is definitely worth watching and will probably open the doors to other anime series you never bothered to watch.\
Overall I really enjoyed this anime, people should give it a try (unexpectedly, it even became one of my favourites). It did not look appealing to me at first, hence “diamond in the ruff”, but once I started and things picked up, I just wrapped myself in a blanket and marathon’d the whole show. Just looking back at the anime, I will say that one of the highlights of this show is it's ability to take the morals and values of the world we live in and put it into perspective from watching what the characters do to each other and the outcomes that blossom from their decisions. Give Shinsekai Yori a try and you will see what I mean!\
I hope you enjoyed my seemingly short review, I would not mind any feedback and if you enjoyed this series or feel enticed to watch it after reading this, feel free to leave a comment !",

    “We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.”\
Shinsekai Yori was that show where I could sit in awe watching the director roll out things one after the other making it look so very effortless. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't bat an eye if the writer actually happens to be from the future because his description of the ‘New World’ is not only persuasive but also connected.\
The story is set in the future [1000 years from now] where mankind has created themselves an utopia, though the events are restricted to only Japan. It follows the students of a certain batch in a certain school\
          \
        that helps the students master their PK[Psychokinesis] ability aka Cantus. In this period, PK users[humans] are the dominant species and Queerats are their sub-ordinates or slaves and often address the former as Kami-sama[literally translating as 'God']. We follow Watanabe Saki and her friends through the sufferings and pain they endure as they try to unravel the origin and possibly vile past of their present society. \
The synopsis and the first episode speaks a little to nothing about what the anime truly aims to deliver but the intro of 1 minute[First episode] was enough to keep me reeled in. Fourth episode was bewildering, I had to watch it twice to get most of what was being explained. There was also a portion that temporarily lost my attention and then there was the conclusion that meticulously sealed off the deal on this beautiful creation.\
Fantasy toned genres never piqued much of my interest but the whole future setting here was surprisingly compelling. Even the plot holes get over shadowed by an unbelievably smooth story transition. One could almost relate our world with the ugly facade put up by the otherwise apparent dystopia. I am deliberately refraining from describing the story but I assure you it's a staggering watch indeed. Whenever I thought- this is it, this is the writer’s limit of imagination, the show would prove me wrong. This is not purely SF or Fantasy, bring in a darker theme, an ingenious screenplay and Shinsekai Yori is born. \
Shinsekai Yori does contain violence/blood and profanity saturated at some parts of the show. The happenings and revelations in this series can be depressing hence should not be mistaken as a light watch. Shinsekai Yori impressively manages to portray the discriminatory nature in us humans in a completely unorthodox thought provoking manner. Story becomes pretty linear after 6th or 7th episode, but that doesn't stop it from keeping you at the edge of your seat especially near the end. I still can't commend the writer enough for the conclusion he’s given to this work. Best possible ending, as far as it concerns me.\
As for the Homosexual sequences[very little amount of Shounen Ai and perhaps a little Shoujo Ai/Yuri, 1-2 Episodes tops], it saddens me deeply to see people dropping Shinsekai Yori because of the same. I believe they play a tiny yet essential part in describing the re-casted lives of humans of their time and do not qualify enough for a reason to drop this series.\
The character designs can be hard to get used to for many, but I've come to realize how much it suits the whole 'Shinsekai' module of the show. A1 pictures out stood themselves again in the Backgrounds Dept. The backgrounds are extremely gorgeous to look at; effects and animation are well above mediocre. Just wow to all the creatures we encounter other than humans and queerats. The color selection fit perfectly and beautifully brings the New World concept to life. Indubitably deserves to be watched in 720p or more.\
The characters in their entirety do a great job in painting the manufactured mentality and traits native to the people 1000 years from now. You'll doubt their authenticity, their feelings, pity their helpless state and still be able to relate to a degree, for they are at core still humans like us. Again, this is something that the viewers should see for themselves. [ Queerats : If you're familiar with Harry Potter franchise, Queerats look similar to Dobby, but more disfigured and fat with further diversities as well. Squealer is one of those queerats and plays a significant role in the later half yet main plot of Shinsekai Yori by assuming the personification of 'Resistance' against the atrocities of the Powerful. ]\
Sound- Bravo! It blends so well into the setting and environment that I couldn't help being mesmerized by it. The BGMs & OSTs were captivating and spot on almost entirely. A custom version of ‘Going Home’ [adapted from the second movement of Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)] featured earlier in Mawaru Penguindrum was used in Shinsekai Yori, and for me it worked magic in the latter. I remember watching the first episode again and again just to hear that and the first ED 'Wareta Ringo'. Voice actors did an incredible job, I don't know how but Hanazawa Kana-san's voice always gets me.\
I personally enjoyed Shinsekai Yori way more than I'd initially expected. The entire run had a consistent dark atmosphere, which contributed in keeping the tension. I haven’t been this satisfied with an ending in a long time. This is unquestionably a rare gem among the current trend in Japanese animation industry and is not something one should overlook. Sure there are downfalls like the slow pace in initial episodes, few dry episodes in the middle, minuscule amount of homosexual themes that can irrationally put some viewers off, perhaps some sloppy facial animation now and then, but in the bigger picture Shinsekai Yori more than makes up for the flaws and to me it's no less than something close to masterpiece. \
That being said, Shinsekai Yori is not a show for everyone but do try it and decide for yourself.\
Overall Score: 8.5/10.\

    Shinsekai yori is truly a great series. I've been wanting to write this review for a long time but I decided to wait until the series finished to do so as to write an accurate and coherent review as possible. After 6 months and 25 wonderful episodes, here it is. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free. \
Adapted of the novel by Kishi Yūsuke, Shinsekai Yori tells a story of a civilisation set one thousand years in the future. Mankind has evolved into beings capable of a obscure power known as \"Juryoku\" or Cantus, a powerful psychic power that makes the\
          \
        impossible possible. In this new world, Man has neither need nor want for technology and reigns supreme over the New World's indigenous species called Bakenezumi and other new organisms we come across as the story unfolds. All seems well and peaceful in the Utopia man has created for itself, however, as our main characters learn early on in the story, Man's evolution came at a price and the New World's mysterious history is written in blood and hidden in secrecy.\
Interestingly enough, this series, despite its utter brilliance across the board, has been overlooked by many and is appreciated by few, which is unfortunate as this underrated gem outshines any other series of its season by far in terms of story, characters and execution. Not only is the story of Shinsekai yori highly ambitious, it is intelligent and thought provoking in many ways. Each episode, especially after episode 4, is both thrilling and captivating to the point you simply would not, or better yet, could not view this series one episode one at a time if you had the option not to.\
Despite its initial appearance, Shinsekai yori is most definitely not a show for kids; be prepared for a lot of death and gore, deceit and some adult themes. The story requires a great deal of critical thinking to coherently understand and appreciate the narrative. I found myself confused several times early on in the series though the plot later on becomes more linear and thus easier to comprehend. Shinsekai yori is a story that addresses inequality and the flaws of the human condition. It shows us the sinister side of absolute control, the price of secrecy and the perils of curiosity. Undoubtedly, Shinsekai yori tells an intense and utterly satisfying story that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more with each passing episode. The characters featured, both the humans and the Bakenezumi are both compelling and likeable. The main characters prove to be intelligent and very inquisitive but are far from perfect as each have intriguing characteristics that defines them with such subtlety and grace I must commend the author, Kishi Yūsuke, for weaving their personas into the story without making it overly obvious and distracting from the plot. It is my fear that diving in any further in the story and characters would simply ruin the experience and thus I will leave it at that.\
It may interest you that the title name of Shinsekai yori, From the New World in English, was taken from famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's Ninth Symphony, written in 1893. I find this to be incredibly fitting as we find out the world set a thousand years in the future is indeed a New World in its own right.\
Moving on, the art is somewhat unusual but fitting for an unusual story, more so than any other art style I can think of. Though not much attention is given to detail as far as facial characteristics go, it beautifully depicts the scenery and maintains an overall cleanliness to it anyone ought to be able to appreciate. Truly, it is beyond my ability to describe the fascinating world of Shinsekai yori but I would wager it is unlike anything you have likely seen; before. A1 Pictures has done this series justice in its world building, using just the right colours and shading to create a perfect blend that is both visually pleasing for the average viewer and stays true to the story's setting. The studio has done an above average job the majority of the time with the animation, slipping up only occasionally and consistently producing quality episodes. It is worth nothing that there are some scenes - quite a few actually, that are absolutely breath taking in their beauty. And of course this is only augmented by the angelic scores that play at just the right time, at just the right pitch to deliver a powerful trifecta performance of story, art and sound in an astonishing meld.\
I absolutely enjoyed this series. For 6 months this was the one show I looked forward to the most on a regular basis. While it may have a slow start, after the first three episodes the story takes an sharp turn into awesomeness and intensity comparable to a thriller movie. Having said that, there is something to be said for lack of closure on a rather important element in the story towards the end, which unfortunately is left up to the viewer's imagination and some other nuances, but aside from that, it was overall very satisfying and well worth the watch.\
While not perfect, Shinsekai yori still remains a masterpiece in my eyes, and so my final score is a 10 out 10.\

    In recent years, many series have found success by centering themselves upon flagrant fanservice and fast-paced action. Shinsekai Yori, however, is the antithesis of this trend. \
Before beginning the series, you should be warned— Shinsekai Yori is not a light watch. This is not the kind of anime that will provide laughter and cheap entertainment. It is an anime that requires the viewer to think and analyze in order to fully enjoy the story. As a result it can be a difficult show for some viewers to get into, but what it provides instead is an experience with far more weight and meaning. \
Set in\
          \
        the distant future, Shinsekai Yori depicts a world ruled by humans with psychic abilities. Using their \"Cantus\", these individuals have the power to meld their thoughts with the outside world. Whether for building, crafting, entertainment, or defense against animals and monstrosities, there are a myriad of ways for Cantus to benefit society. But there are also hidden truths surrounding it. Horrors and conspiracies that will threaten the life of any who uncover them. For Saki and the other members Zenjin Academy's 'Group One', this is a danger that they lamentably fall victim to. \
Despite the dark, foreboding tone set from the beginning, it's not until the group uncovers a secret on their school trip that everything starts to go dreadfully wrong for them. Disappearances, assassinations, and invincible beasts aptly called 'Fiends' are but a handful of the mysteries revealed to Saki and her friends. Society is evidently not the utopia that it seems.\
The story is primarily conveyed through the perspective of Saki, but rather than focus on each character individually, Shinsekai Yori instead centers around interpersonal characterization. Group One is often treated as its own character due to the five's inseparable friendship, and this friendship itself serves as one of the core themes of the story. Gradually and together they mature from the naive children that they were at the beginning of the story, directly as a result of their relationships with others. However, do not be misled: this is not an anime about its characters. It is first and foremost a story about the mysteries and conflict that they find themselves pulled into. \
Adding to the main cast is an astute race of bipedal mole rats, referred to by humans as \"Queerats\". Despite having intelligence nearly equal to that of humans, they are oppressed and treated as little more than the animals they have evolved from. Understandably they are not pleased with this. Instigating the inevitable rebellion is the Robert Fly colony, led by the machiavellian leader \"Squealer\". His presence serves to create a deeper sense of conflict in the story, but he is also one of the more well-written antagonists in recent years. He is not motivated by tropes such as madness or greed but by a deep sense of loyalty to his people. It's interesting how none of his actions can be defined as inherently 'good' or 'evil', and it makes one wonder if he might have been the hero instead if the story was told from a different perspective. \
Such themes are not uncommon in Shinsekai Yori. Rather than presenting its story through black and white reasoning, there is instead an abundance of pertinent ethical questions posed to the viewer. Does the end justify the means? Do the same rights as humans apply to animals, and what truly sets humanity above them if not intelligence? Complex topics such as the human condition are also explored in detail and the story is not afraid to portray loss and death in a frank manner. This is an anime that's meant to be analyzed and it rewards the viewer for doing so. \
One of the strongest aspects of Shinsekai Yori is its atmosphere. Throughout every episode exists an overbearing sense of dread and melancholy: the feeling that something very bad is about to happen, and indeed it often does. The pacing is also very much on the slow side, with several expository episodes before the story finally takes off, but once it does it becomes very difficult to stop watching. Shinsekai Yori is a macabre, sometimes uncomfortable story that will succeed in immersing you in its dark atmosphere. There's nothing else quite like it out there, which makes it an especially enticing experience. \
As if to defy the conventions of mainstream anime, sexuality plays an important role in the story. The main characters are not innocent and devoid of sexual feelings, even despite their young age in the first two arcs. Much like us, they fall in love, experiment and desire to act out on their feelings. They are not restrained by otaku concepts such as 'purity', and this is an immense benefit given the mature tone of the series. One further thing to note is that they do not only express romantic and sexual desires towards the opposite sex— but towards the same sex as well. \
Though one has to wonder why this created so much controversy. Even if the viewer finds bisexual interactions to be uncomfortable, there is scarcely a scene that displays such behavior in the first place. These relationships are not used for superficial shounen-ai or shoujo-ai appeal, but are instead there to reflect the characters maturing in a society unconstrained by social stigma. The most conspicuous of these few scenes is during the ninth episode, when two male characters play on the grass and then kiss for five or ten seconds. Why did such a trivial scene disturb some people so much? It's hard to say.\
There are certainly legitimate criticisms to be had towards the series, though. In particular, the first few episodes are filled with expository dialogue which oftentimes amount to infodump. Granted, this is necessary to give the viewer a proper understanding of the setting and the rules which the characters live by, but there is no doubt a more elegant approach that could have been employed here instead. Further problems also exist within the two timeskips of the story, as it will abruptly change with no transition between past and present. This is especially an issue in the second timeskip, where twelve entire years are passed in the blink of an eye. We also see very little character growth in that time, which is quite odd, to say the least.\
But these flaws are more than made up for by the sound design. A quality soundtrack in anime is often treated as an afterthought more than anything else, but Shinsekai Yori is one that understands the value that a good score can have. The music here is largely composed of haunting choir melodies, percussion, and ambient noises which serve to heighten the tension and atmosphere of their respective scenes. There's one particular song in the anime, usually used during the beginning of an episode, which was able to send chills down my spine each time it played. Now, this is the sign of a powerful score— having the ability to evoke emotion through music instead of drama. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the soundtrack is Shinsekai Yori's greatest strength, and that is not a statement that comes with little weight. \
The art also compliments the tone of the anime quite well. Dark shadows accentuate the gloomy atmosphere of the story while thick lines are used to emphasize the characters and their facial expressions. There is a lack of polish, though, with regards to detail and animation quality, but you can hardly fault an anime for not being granted a lavish budget. Shinsekai Yori fortunately makes the very most of its modest budget, and its art quality manages to compete with some of the more mainstream titles to boot.\
If you are looking for something unique in an era defined by generic rom-coms and ecchi titles, then this is an anime that will likely fill your appetite. Sure, it may not be a flawless triumph that will be remembered until the ends of time, but as one of the better anime in the past few years, it is well worth your time to give it a try. You would be hard-pressed to find anything else like it. \

    Fear, Loss, Hope and Betrayal. Desire, Strength, Lies, and Perfection. If only Shinsekai Yori could be described with just these few words. You rarely see an anime that blends the Story, Art, Sound, and the growth of Characters so fluently. Its not simple to achieve this level of artistry. As a result, it’s not a simple story to watch. Your constantly given questions till the very end. However this makes the anime incredibly enjoyable to watch. It feels as though your brought closer into the story because of it. This Dark masterpiece questions humanities desires, darkens the line that separates Children form Adults, and presents\
          \
        a twisted morality as the cost for power. While never losing hope of a better future.\
With 1000 years passing society has been shattered through the evolution of humanity. Humans awakening of Cantus/Pk, proved to be unruly. As the episodes progress more of the timeline preceding the present is reviled. As shocking as the past appears, sadly its not an unrealistic possibility given the chaos created through Cantus, and the nature of humanity. \
The setting is placed in what appears from afar as a utopia. Vast flora surrounds a seemingly tranquil town. While flowing stream’s cascade into waterways, connecting lands of mystery and wonder. The setting is very breathtaking, although its only the contour of the story. Strongly influenced by the lives and minds of the 5 children in Group One at Sage Academy, a school for teaching children how to use and control their Cantus. The story follows them from age 12 to 26. The main cast is incredibly realistic, often making believable choices and appearing very “human\". However they feel distant, as far as becoming attached to them. I thought personally while they each had their moments of brilliance, they struggled to break away from simply, appearing “normal” (Looking past their Cantus of course). Although the cast overall, portray’s friendship and conflict, in a fashion that is easily some of the best writing I’ve seen. Personally I loved having the narration told by Saki Watanabe, I felt an allure about her through out the story. Hearing her reflect thoughts on her past at times, while also watching her own life mature, created a beautiful temperament. \
I enjoyed that almost immediately there is a sense of danger placed into the story. Its not direct at first, but by using stories told by children, it makes for a intriguing prelim. The plot is paced extremely well, allowing for proper character development, (which there is a lot of), and story progression to mature simultaneously. At times it may feel that a lot is explained at once. So don’t be afraid to re-watch a section if you think you missed something. Its difficult to review the story with out touching on spoilers. There are so many details intertwined together, to create a perfectly flowing story. It takes adventurous children, turned rebellious teens, and finally determined young adults. Mix’s in a beastly, yet sadly relatable conflict. This being the sub species Queerats relation with the Humans. While using realistic context, the story also ties in romance and desire. Along with unique ideas such as, Cantus Leakage, Karma Demons, and Fiends. When you put it all together it creates a wonderful story. That with each episode continues to impress. \
Your taken into this vast world filled with deep colors, blurring reality and fantasy effortlessly at times. The characters are drawn with detail and look very appropriate. I thought each character had a fitting appearance to portray their personality. Although their design consistency, wavers now and then unfortunately. Some details vary depending on the Key animator, working with that episode. Also a few minor animation effects, such as awkward amounts of arrows. Feel out of place but are easily forgotten by the end. Overall the shadows and colors are always vivid. While the art tone maintains a darker look. The entire story resonates to eclipse the viewer into and different but familiar world. Reflecting rivers and warped realities, the mysterious fauna seen throughout the story. All the Art elements together, create a perfect tint for the clandestine theme in Shinsekai Yori. \
With music generally maintaining a serious tone, Shinsekai Yori has an incredible soundtrack. Traditional Song of Shadows, Ienikaeru (Going Home), History of Sorrow, Last Letter. They are all such moving pieces and there are so many more. The themes and scenery are portrayed wonderfully though the music, making it all very chilling. It seemed to me that appropriate score’s are often used as an introduction, in place of a opening sequence. It was a wonderful choice for the story, because of the absence of a typical OP, the show maintains more of it's mystery. The voice acting is excellent (Viewed Subbed Version). The tones match with the character designs/personalities, and it never feels forced or inadequate while expressing emotion. The entire Sound (Songs, Effects, Voice) is presented spectacularly.\
This anime is incredibly detailed and well written. Ranging in all emotion it dose have a more serious tone to it. This is not a show for everyone. However it is incredibly unique, especially well written, and immense with beautiful music. Your able to see children, grow into teenagers, and finally as adults. The emotions of innocence, adolescence, and maturity, mixing together along the journey. Creates characters that are relatable and show believable emotion constantly. The choices made, and how they grew after each trial, made them feel all so real. You watch as life tries to survive, but it’s more then just that. This a true masterpiece to watch. The story will leave you thinking about not simply what you’ve just watched, but about Life and the choices we ourselves make, and the choices of societies past and future. \

    Shinsekai Yori is propably the most underscored anime of the season, because it's story is building up really slow compared to most other anime. The first 3 episodes it feels like nothing happened at all and a lot of viewers propably stopped watching this great anime.\
But if you hold out until episode 4 you are awarded with a lot of insight in what is hidden behind this happy-world facade.\
Story: 10\
Shinsekai Yori is really dependent on it's story which slowly builds up and keeps surprising the viewer every 2-3 episodes with some new shocking story details or an unexpected twist.\
Art: 8 - Sound: 9\
Art and sound\
          \
        are overall very good and match the style of Shinsekai Yori pretty well. Also IMHO the outro song Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda is the best anime song of the season!\
Character: 9\
Each character of the group is really unique and the character development leaves no one behind. Also the focus on Saki as leading character is really good while she tries to figure out the greater image behind the story.\
Enjoyment: 9\
It would be 10 points for me, if the first episodes could be a bit more interesting, but otherwise this anime keeps me eagerly waiting for every next episode.\
Overall 10\
Why 10 points you ask?\
Simple because Shinsekai Yori has a story which is so unique and thrilling!\
IMHO we need more anime like this which make more use of the story instead of simple fights, ecchi etc. etc. etc...\
EDIT: After having seen 19 episodes I can confirm, that this is certainly a masterpiece of a story and a really well done adaption as anime!!\

    Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related to\
          \
        the original psychological thriller-cum-mystery opening. \
A slew of nonsense begins here, where thematically, there was never any room for. A political drama and action anime begins immediately after episode four with a romantic drama unconvincingly inserted in right afterword. This all joined together by a supernatural setting which seems boundless to the viewer leaves for massive plot holes, unnecessary subplots, and outright disregarded information.\
The characters of the series are extremely simple. Many characters are written in as attention grabs, who die without doing anything but progressing the story without adding any additional layer of emotion (Inui, Shisei, Squonk,  Rijin). These characters come frequently in Shinsekai Yori and feel cheaply and artificially used. That the story is furthered again and again by use of character introduction and eventual demise at first feels necessary, that the pacing and lack of character focus serve a greater purpose. Yet, by the end of the series we reach a conclusion that nulls most characters entirely from the series, leaving the viewer wondering what the purpose behind many subplots and character scenarios really was. \
The main cast of the series feels particularly unkempt. Between the two time skips, none of the development behind the characters is shown on-screen. For the most part, it felt as if new characters were created and replaced the familiarly named cast. Saki, whose character has unbelievable plot armor, manages to survive every obstacle that she comes to face with despite having average to no ability using her psychokinetic abilities. Opposite her is Satoru. Satoru's character repeatedly changes based on situation, and despite Satoru receiving the most screen time, next to Saki, he never truly interacts with another character. Both he and Saki go on many adventures together, but never do they have any sort of deeper connection other than that they were in the same group of friends together. Satoru's character changes from a one-dimensional precocious to a one-dimensional smarmy without reason, and then from the latter to an one-dimensional hero.\
Shinsekai Yori attempts at creating a gray morality by only using black and white arguments. Squealer fervently backs up this claim. Introduced in episode five, you can only assume what a character named Squealer can be like. In this leave-it-to-the-name style character design, squealer squeals on the main cast. He betrays them multiple times in three episodes. Then later on when Squealer is reintroduced, he is still literally a backstabbing rodent. The daft main characters seem almost impervious to the obviousness of Squealer, resulting in one of the most painfully direct and drawn out politically based story lines in an anime. The masquerade of moral ambiguity only serves to mock the viewers intelligence, leaving for an extremely expected and dissatisfying ending.\
Shun is the most interesting character albeit a Gary Stu. Throughout the first nine episodes of the series, he remains mostly static, supplying seemingly otherworldly insight to the other children simultaneously acting humble. He receives a healthy dose of character development during a particularly interesting story line in the series, but is soon forgotten in lieu of continuing the romantic drama aspect of the series. What is worst about this strange intense focus on Shun followed by a dramatic disregard is that he inexplicably  influences events even after he departs from the series. Saki is saved on a handful of occasions through the voice of Shun, which makes it feel once again that the characters only served a greater purpose of linearly reaching a happy ending.\
Mamoru and Maria are so negligibly involved in the main series events it is laughable, and like their position to the story, their characters suffer immensely. The most thrilling part of their characters is that an uninteresting romance forms between them with no prompt which should be noted is not even really character. This romance of course serves only to produce a plot point later in the series. \
The art and sound receive solid praise. The series has an excellently used voice cast. The lack of an opening helped the pacing of the anime. The background music, while overused and often misused for a cheap \"spooky\" effect or to create tension in undramatic scenes, for the most part was enjoyably used. Sound effects were decent, but a notable flaw was the clicking of the queerats, which was more annoying than stylistic. The character designs were very bland but served well to create a muted and realistic-looking cast. The animation was regularly on par, but many scenes can be identified as cheaply made by overuse of black backgrounds, extreme close-ups, and static mouths - especially at a distance. Note episode five, without a doubt an atrocity of animation. Beyond that animation was regularly fluid and even exciting. Monster designs stayed fresh throughout the series as well.\
What started as a fanciful mystery quickly became a predictable drama. As a final opinion, I do not recommend Shinsekai Yori. Many other anime approach it's philosophical topic in superior ways and do so without treating the audience like children. Shiki quickly comes to mind, with Eve no Jikan following on the shortlist. Shinsekai Yori ultimately is crippled by it's many genres and quick, deliberate shifts in tone. The many plot holes and bland characters make for a regrettable and sadly unmemorable watch. \

    Having watched 21 episodes prior to writing this review, I have to say Shin Sekai Yori is perhaps the most intelligent anime series I have ever watched. The premise of the story, the interactions between races, the policies set into place, and the rationale and philosophy behind them are both believable and well thought out. Furthermore, the actual execution of the story is superb; they will drop frequent hints and include much foreshadowing, allowing you to draw your own conclusions, yet they still manage to completely surprise you. Note that the first few episodes do not begin in medias res, or have an explosive introduction\
          \
        into a new world like most modern anime do; rather, you experience events as the children do – learning more about the world around them and gradually realizing that something is horribly wrong with the society they live in. \
Story: 10\
This anime is heavily reliant on its plot in order to engage you. It begins with an introduction to the world of the children: The 66th district of Kamisu, set 1000 years in the future, holds many secrets from the children, and is a powder keg for disaster. The story is extremely well told: there are no actual filler episodes, and after the first few episodes about the children’s daily lives, the story will begin to snowball in intensity and tension.\
Art: 9\
The art itself is superb: it creates a beautiful backdrop for Kimisu’s seemingly utopian society, contrasted with the monster rats’ rather disgusting design. The design of the monster rats will play into the interactions between the two races. The humans are attractive, but the designs are not distinctive or bold – they are, after all, normal people in Kamisu. \
As opposed to the art, the animation is good, but not amazing. This is not Kyoto Animation spending a huge budget on animating Haruhi’s guitar playing, or Joshiraku’s 6 seconds of amazing animation. However, while the “wow” moments were few, there were no noticeable moments where the animation was actually lacking. I still wish A-1 pictures had been given more money for the animation though: the result would have been simply astounding, especially given the cantus powers.\
Sound: 9\
The music provided the mood in during times of tension and during particularly traumatic/dramatic moments. While not as distinctive or engaging as Kanno Yoko’s music in Sakamichi no Apollon or Cowboy Bebop, the music in Shin Sekai Yori was definitely very good. Each of the characters are well voiced, and reflect their characters. Note that there is no opening in this series. \
Characters: 8\
I’m going to say this now: Shin Sekai Yori is not an anime about the characters; it is about the story that takes place. The characters were designed to be human, not larger-than-life like Lelouch or Medaka, or eccentric like L or Haruhi. All of the characters, whether human or rat, act like humans: They can be intelligent, they can be irrational, they can be fearful, they can be calm and collected. However, at no point in the series do they become unbelievable. I give this an 8 because the character designs are spot on, and the people involved manage to drive the story forward, but in the world of Kamisu 66, the events that took place could have happened in any village in Japan, not necessarily the one the main character lived in. \
Enjoyment: 10\
I’d like to address something before we move on: This anime is not heavy on fanservice. There was a yaoi/yuri scene that played in very well with the story, given the premise of the show, and many viewers dropped because of this. This only happens once, and is not indicative of the series. It is not like the manga in this respect. \
With that out of the way I’d like to say that Shin Sekai Yori is an immensely enjoyable series. Once the story gets rolling, it shows no signs of stopping. The anime frequently foreshadows future events, yet manages to surprise you every time. The tension in this series is always quite high, and there are quite a few “crowning moments of awesome” in the series. \
Also, this is a series that makes you think. I would recommend watching this anime 3-4 episodes at a time and watch it with friends or go talk about it on forums, simply because the themes involved are quite deep. What is the value of a human life? How far do human rights extend?  There are more, but that would require spoiling the anime. In my humble opinion, this series is probably the most enjoyable of 2012-2013. \
Overall: 10\
The story is what makes the anime. The art fit the story perfectly and supplemented the story with the character designs and backdrops. The animation was good, but not the very best I’ve seen in anime. Likewise, the music and sounds were great, but not the best I’ve seen in anime. The characters were believable, not larger than life, but this supplemented the story well again. Ultimately, this culminated in a highly enjoyable series, one that I would not be afraid to show to friends and family, and one that – to use the cliché saying – “keeps you on the edge of your seat.” ",

    Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World, is a teen-oriented piece of dystopic speculative fiction, the latest addition in this new wave of teen fiction to which the success of Hunger Games has opened the doors.\
The series follows the adventures of five kids, from their childhood to their adulthood, in a medieval-ish post apocalyptic setting, where the only human left are the one possessing a special psychic ability called \"Cantus\".\
While the first episode is quite good, establishing the setting and the mysteries behind it (\"what's the government hiding?\", \"how did the world get like this?\"), the series pretty much falls downwards after that, with episode\
          \
        2 weirdly shifting the tone to high-school hi-jinx (admittedly it is foreshadowing but, as it happens many times in the series, in order to deliver us world details it suddenly changes tone, making for a very disjointed and uninteresting episode) and episode 3 basically killing any mystery with a long exposition sequence.\
With almost everything resolved, the story stumbles aimlessly for ten or so episodes, as... things... start to happen. We get to see lots of short story arcs that, while again foreshadowing small story details, don't really feel connected to each other and don't offer any particularly gripping narrative. The series even pushes the reset button a couple of times, making the character forget, and having to re-learn, story details that we already know... riveting...\
The story does pick up a bit with the last story arc, putting together all the awkward foreshadowing it did until that point and finally having a long story arc that feels significant to the world in which it is set.\
While I feel that the first batch of episodes was intended to be about establishing and exploring the main characters before letting them loose in the final arc, in the practice it doesn't really work that well. First of all, I'm sorry, but the characters are just not that interesting, as most of them are pretty one note, secondly the main conflict of that part of the series is basically kids vs shady government... which would be fine, except that the government in question is... just not that shady, as again we learn all of their motivations in the third episode... and... they make quite a lot of sense.\
Also this series has a serious problem with beating us over the head with things that have already been explained over and over again.\
So... with an interesting setting that gets squandered, likable but ultimately flat characters, big problems with tone and pacing, and the trivialization of any mystery element the series could have had... is there anything good in Shinsekai Yori?\
Well there is that one amazing musical theme we get to listen at the beginning of some episodes, and the series direction is quite good and can set a very eerie mood when it wants to (and when the characters shut up). Most than anything though I like how it engages with sexual themes, working as an interesting allegory for the sexual confusion of puberty and adolescence.\
To be honest I quite like how Shinsekai Yori approaches youth and puberty as a whole. and how it manages to translate those themes into a post apocalyptic coming to age story. Sadly though, while the ideas behind it are solid, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that it is a 25 episode slog doesn't really help, as it does feel that with a few episodes cut down the series would flow a lot better and generally be far more enjoyable.\

    Shinsekai yori was something else...\
First let me say Shinsekai yori was not a light watch at all. This is a thinker's anime. Casual viewers will probably be very turned off by the serious nature of the show. Having said that, for those of you who are looking for an anime that shows the story of a dark, fear ridden society in a brutally honest way keep on reading!\
Shinsekai yori is unique in which it has no correct set of morals. The line between good vs bad is blurred to the point where the viewer sympathizes with the antagonist.\
Why is this?\
It is because Shinsekai Yori is\
          \
        very realistic. \
Let me give an example to further the meaning of the previous statement: In modern society many consider stealing to be a sin while others justify the act in order to feed their families.\
In other words survival is all that matters and that is what Shinsekai yori is, a situation in which survival is the only thing that justifies an action or not.\
Now logic such as this will undoubtedly result in very disturbing outcomes and decisions so viewers should brace themselves for very gruesome events.\
If anyone is expecting to see plenty of action/comedy/happiness I suggest you think twice about trying this anime. Positive moments are stretched out far in between and thus rare throughout while tragedy is almost always present. Also casual watchers should beware that Shinsekai yori requires some degree of analysis for it to be enjoyed to its utmost potential.\
If you are still with me, Great! Here goes the review. Everything is spoiler free!\
Story: 9.5\
The setting involves a dystopian society 1000 years into the future that has actually reversed progress regarding industry and technology due to human beings obtaining telekinesis. We observe the society of year 3000 through the eyes of 5 children who are just as clueless as the viewer. The story is narrated by one of the children, Saki, as the anime shows the events of the children's lives and their fates from the ages 12-26. Throughout the anime the group of five learn of the evils and secrets that society has hidden away. Upon learning, life changing events take place throughout their lives, affecting not only their relationships but their sanity as well.\
The story of Shinsekai yori takes the concept of a dystopian future but applies it in its own very original style. It explores various sinister and dark themes of the human mind through solving the thrilling mysteries of the society and its past.\
The story was highly original and refreshing due to its thought provoking and mature layout. Taking a story such as this and adding the amount of realism Shinsekai yori provides results in a story that is close to flawless.\
Art: 7.5\
Now I must admit, the art would amaze me one episode and then would make me cringe the next. For example there were many instances where some of the character's faces and bodies were so warped it shocked me that such mistakes were made in production. Although having said that, there were various instances where the art was absolutely stunning. Gorgeous still shots and surreal dream sequences beautifully portray the gloomy environment. \
Just try searching up Shinsekai yori and looking up some HD scene pics.\
I give the art a 7.5 because the production team really made some episodes look absolutely horrible while others were done brilliantly.\
To sum it up the art is inconsistent and is a hit or miss depending on the episode.\
Sound: 9\
Shinsekai yori did not have an OP, which may bother some. I skip the OP 95% of the time so the fact that Shinsekai yori had no OP was not a negative factor personally.\
The soundtrack was spot on in providing the gloomy dark atmosphere for the anime. It really stood out. Each time a track played it would send shivers down my spine as I watched in awe as to what was happening on screen.\
For the episodes where the art was done well, once the music played, it would produce some of the most chilling scenes of any horror anime I've ever seen. \
One thing that should be noted about the music is that it is very repetitive and is rarely varied. Although in Shinsekai yori's case this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\
Why change something that does its job 110%?\
Character: 7.5\
Now I have to admit that the characters are decent at best. I doubt that even Shinsekai yori lovers and fan boys would put one of the characters in their favorites. Although they are not very memorable the reason I gave it a 7.5 was because their actions and reactions were very realistic (something the whole anime has going for it). From tough decisions to shocking news, all the characters reacted in ways that the viewer could relate to. \
Other than the realism most viewers will likely not be very attached to the characters which will thus reduce the emotion induced upon tragic events.\
Nonetheless, I still give it a solid 7.5.\
Overall: 8\
Boasting a plot and environment that could have potentially catapulted it into my group of masterpieces Shinsekai yori falls short due to suffering to a tedious build up with some unmemorable characters and inconsistencies in art.\
Overall I highly enjoyed Shinsekai yori and its wonderfully refreshing story and believe that any anime fan that truly loves mystery, horror, and plot twists must give Shinsekai yori a try.\

    There's often a point in one's life to acknowledge the possibility of another worldly phenomenon that is outside of our collective conscience from where we live in that is in contrast with our own ideals. This has always been a subject of discussion since Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" that chronicles how our limited understanding of the reality that we perceive may not be what it seems since we're so entrenched in our own ideological society. Many works of fiction have dabbled this subject matter numerous times with some succeeding and others failing. Unfortunately for Shinsekai Yori, it falls into the latter, but not entirely.\
To\
          \
        start out the basic idea of how the story of Shinsekai Yori pans out is the fact that it's a coming of age story focusing on five different characters and their journey in discovering what the past history of human civilization eventually transpired into pure dystopia. In the beginning it starts off extremely well with building up these characters that are all very unique and distinguishable from each other. There's never a moment where I couldn't remember who a specific person was and it's not just from their appearances but from their well-written personalities and backgrounds. Their childhood arc paces itself nicely in giving an atmosphere for us to take in that's mysterious and puzzling in a very limited understanding of what the world is actually like because that's how the childish mindset would actually be like in this scenario. However, once that arc was finished and we get our first time skip it doesn't get too extraordinary as one would hope.\
One thing that makes the time skips really off-putting is how there's hardly any build up on how these characters' personalities matured over time. For instance, one of the most controversial things about the show was the relationship between the characters that were of the same-sex. It's not so much the relationships themselves that I have a problem with, it's how it comes out of nowhere with hardly any development behind it. In this sense it feels as though there was more to their relationships but for the sake of timing constraints they had to rush it so it won't feel dragged out. Because of this one might feel inclined to give it a pass, but for me that cannot be forgiven with the given context this show brings on the table in wanting to be this grand epic that ultimately feels lazy from a writing perspective. In fact, the best romantic development in the entire show was between Saki and Satoru because of how long we've followed these two together and how strong their bond was in helping each other through the hard numerous obstacles. Alas, the rest of the relationships that are thrown out didn't really make a huge impression because how weak and lazy they implemented it into the story; if they actually had anything of value for us to see how they got to that point it would've been for the best.\
While the story itself isn't something we've seen before, it is still a mysterious and very suspenseful drama that manages to pull off some great twists through the course of the narrative. That is until the realization comes to mind when the pacing of it all fails to make it a masterpiece in the writing department. Like I said before about the time skips, they really dumb down the pacing because of how they rush some of the arcs that felt like they could've been more effective had they have been done with better intentions such as at least showing us a montage of them overtime. That shouldn't mean that time skips are unnecessary in any given situation but it takes a lot of care and precise handling to make them work. Time skips aside, the other pacing issues mostly happen in the middle part of the show where scenes lacks clarity in it's exposition in giving us a clear concise way of what has happened or what will happen to the characters or future events. Too fast to even comprehend the over-arching conflicts that arise from the protagonist feel muddled and disorganized for us to piece together on what will transpire. This could come into play with the fact that the show skips over some of the important details in the novel, but for the sake of reviewing the show itself there's no need to go over that aspect.\
How Shinsekai Yori handles its world-building through expository dialogue receives a mixed response from me. It works like a pattern where one of or all of our heroes are journeying or trying to find answers and eventually they'll talk to someone who will explain everything to them in no more than ten minutes either the dark history of Japan and how it eventually became a grim dystopia or what the ethics counsel is really like underneath. While the history itself is really thought-provoking at times that bring into question human nature and how society structures itself into chaos, I can't help but feel that it could've been done more better with less tedium and not feel like a lazy attempt at being profound.\
It's not just the writing that feels off, but the technical side of the show feels very limited and looks really shoddy in the process. That's not to say all of it looks bad, there are definitely a lot of beautiful set pieces drawn into the backgrounds and the character designs look very unique and fit well to the tone of the show. However, there are a lot of problems with the designs of the monsters that inhabit Shinsekai Yori where they don't look really well-drawn and their animations look like if a low-budget studio was hired to animate them. There's even one episode where the animation took a complete nose-dive where the queen of the queerats looks like a huge blob that wasn't drawn fully of what it was originally supposed to look like. I'm not saying that all shows have to look extremely high-budget or in order to be called good art/animation but it doesn't really strike my fancy when there's nothing significant to gaze at to begin with.\
Now with all of the negativity I've had for Shinsekai Yori, there are still a number of things that are really good and even fantastic that are worth watching. It is without question that the amount of suspense and heart-pounding tension that Shinsekai Yori has to offer is astonishing to say the least. The first three minutes of the first episode alone garners some needed praise for it's really well-directed atmosphere, right down to the music and editing of all of the events that happened in present-day Tokyo. It's tone is not pretty and it will nonetheless make a lot of people feel uncomfortable to sit through in some instances, but that should warrant a lot of credit to the show in giving us a very mature tone that comes in full-swing. What makes the suspense amazingly good and imposing is the amount of mystery that we are given through the children's perspective and how we can never see how the adults' see the situation that goes on in the world. Often times you don't see stories handle mystery this way and make for an intense experience to go through. The first person narrative through Saki gives a distinct feel to how we see her grow into this person who is fully aware in later life that feels undeniably human to me.\
As many have told me about the story in all of its faults is that the ending makes up for it, and it definitely does provide to the story a satisfying conclusion. There were definitely no predictable outcomes that were present in the narrative's end and that guarantees Shinsekai Yori some much needed acclaim for at least not giving us a story that isn't inherently generic in a predictable sort of way. There's no Hollywood gimmick that severely tarnishes the gritty tone, it handles itself in a very realistic fashion that feels very satisfying to see first-hand.\
Musically, it mostly consists of really bombastic chanting music that is very haunting and intimidating from the style of tone it tries to set. There are very few questionable choices of songs that Shinsekai Yori has that feel out-of-place in any scene. Intense orchestration that also borrows from some minimalist influence in some ambiance tone it gives with light electronically ambient mixes in-between scenes that are inherently quiet and simple in their nature.\
Ambitious though it may be, Shinsekai Yori just doesn't cut it fully as a supreme masterpiece that has come out in recent years with the problems it possesses in giving us a badly paced story that can't really give a concise narrative that's hard to get around. Character development feels good in some areas, but due to the poorly put time-skips, their relationships felt contrived with inconsistent expository problems that feel as though they wanted to make the same-sex relationships so that it would seem more progressive when it really comes off as just lazy development. I wouldn't classify this show as completely bad in that the amount of suspenseful tension makes for a really intense experience to behold in showing us the one great development of Saki into a full realized character. After all, a worthwhile experience with many faults in its technical aspects is at least more tolerable than a show with great technical prowess with no added value to the experience whatsoever.\

    Shinsekai yori is an adaptation from a novel, with the same name, which has 2 volumes that were released in 2008.\
 The story of this anime takes place a thousand years from now, many humans have evolved, now they are able to use a psychic power called cantus, but there's no improvement in technology.\
 In that kind of world , the 5 protagonist, live in a village that's seems normal at first sight, but they start to realize that their town have a lot of forbidden knowledge, to put it simple Shinsekai yori is the tale of a group of friends that start discovering many\
          \
        conspiracies, and how that affect on their adolescence.\
 When I watched the series I couldn't help to compare the events, on how the conspiracies affected me, and I didn’t find many differences, because the reactions of the characters are portrayed very well.\
 The story also has good action phases, fast scenes, warlike times; fantasy besides the humans, the animals have also evolved, now they are able to think, speak as humans, and that makes them more interesting and important in the plot; mystery, the fact that censure/conspiracy is the most recurrent theme in this series makes mystery one of the strong points of this anime, here you are equal with the protagonists discovering the mind blowing secrets of that society. With those aspects and many surprises, the story in synthesis is so dynamic, that makes the necessary suspense to make me wish for more after the end of each episode. (10/10)\
 Concerning art, with pretty sceneries, animation that is slightly better than the standard in the late 2012, shinsekai yori deserves a \"very good\" and a bit more in art, but how the complex power of cantus and the mystical scenes are well portrayed, for me it deserves the \"great\". (9/10)\
 Now sound, well in like the 5 episode, i realized \"wait... this anime lacks of OP\", but I don't mind, the ED \"wareta ringo\" it's so good, even the lyrics of the song have the essence of the series, I’m even grateful that the anime doesn't have an OP, because I can see more shinsekai yori, and that the ED didn't change after the episode 13. Concerning the background music, it never disturbs, it has good relaxing songs, and it placed at the exact moment, so it's good. (9/10)\
 Characters, I think that here is where shinsekai yori shines the most, because the psychological characteristics of the characters is splendid, there's always an explanation to the reactions of the protagonists, and the reactions are never exaggerated. I consider shinsekai yori as a psychological drama, because the psychological factor is fundamental in the series. Also knowing that they are teenagers, their changes are so unpredictable, that helps to the dynamism of the series. (10/10)\
 Enjoyment, here there's not much left to say, as I said before I can't wait for another episode after seeing one, I really like this series. (10/10)\
 And finally overall, I haven't seen a well thinked series like this before, where nothing is random, this anime makes you think, and entertain you. It's seems that many people drop the series (and gave it a low score) in the first chapters, because the story is so slow at the beginning of the series, but who prefers a series that starts good, then it begins to get bad and finally it ends horrible; in this anime occurs quite the opposite, it starts slow but then every ep is better. I highly recommend this series. (10/10)\

    **SPOILER FREE REVEIW**\
During the Fall season of 2012, animation studio A-1 pictures was airing two anime. One of them was the infamous Sword Art Online; the international sensation that essentially made money faster than it could be printed. It went down in history as one of the most hyperbolized and dramatic popularity explosions of all time. In the wake of the massive tidal wave created by the anti-Christ itself (or the messiah, depending on your perspective), there was another anime; an anime that was swallowed whole by the mainstream hype of the industry. An anime that barely anyone bothered to watch. An anime that nearly\
          \
        everyone in its already small audience dropped because of a 10 second yaoi scene in episode 8. An anime that was a complete financial failure. \
Why is this story concerning? I’ll tell you why: because that anime was called “Shinsekai Yori”. If the name doesn’t mean anything to you, that’s probably because you haven’t seen it yet. There is little debate that this anime is something special; it has one of the most mature and refined tones in the history of the medium, the music and animation are unbelievably atmospheric, and the world building is absolutely unparalleled. To the anime community, none of that mattered. Shinsekai Yori’s monetary disaster coupled with SAO’s monumental success sent a very clear message to the industry: More SAOs, less Shinsekai Yori’s. *Sigh, this is why I drink. This is also why I write reviews. Ladies and gentlemen: Shinsekai Yori.\
Synopsis: One millennium into the future, society exists as a utopia in which every human possesses “the god’s power”; a form of incredibly powerful psychokinesis. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in this utopia that is completely barred from the outside world. However, her and her friends begin to discover some of the dark secrets behind their society as their perfect little reality begins its slow, downward spiral into disaster, as all utopias seem to do.\
Let me reiterate something I mentioned earlier; this is a very mature anime. When I say that, I don’t just mean that there’s a lot blood and gore/sexual themes (although those things certainly exist in the show). Rather, I mean to say that you have to be a mature person to enjoy and understand this show. The pacing is very, very slow, there is a LOT of info-dumping, and the show lacks the energy or excitement that you would typically see in a psychological show. Virtually all of Shinsekai Yori’s plot is spent building its vast, unique, fascinating, and disturbing world.  This anime is the absolute pinnacle of world building; arguably the best of all time. The utopia that is the focus of the story can only be described as staggering. The most beautiful thing about the setting isn’t merely its depth, however, but rather the way in which the show’s themes are built so perfectly around it. The implications of the way this society is run and how it began are legitimately shocking, dark and frightening. This anime will almost certainly give you the chills, but it goes beyond just that; it makes you legitimately think. Perhaps the scariest part about the show is that nothing about it is unbelievable. Nothing about it is unreasonable. There are no good guys, there are no bad guys. There is only a group of organisms behaving according to their nature. At the risk of spoiling the plot, I will not go into much depth about the intricacies of this outstanding storyline. Just know that it will leave a serious impact on you; it is easily the highlight of the show.\
Because the main focus of the show is undoubtedly the world building, Shinsekai Yori’s characters don’t receive nearly as much time or attention. However, that certainly doesn’t mean that they aren’t good. Our protagonist, Saki Watanabe, serves as a parallel to the audience’s experience; she learns about the truths of her world at the exact same pace as we do. This makes her extremely relatable and the audience is able to know what she is thinking and what she is feeling at all times. Although some could argue that she (as well as all her friends) merely serves as a medium to explore the setting, the reason I believe that she is a fantastic character is because she is ultimately the one who brings the themes full circle at the end of the anime.  Although she is certainly passive most of the time, it is ultimately her thoughts and actions that hammer in the message of the show. Saki is one of my favorite female characters ever. The supporting cast, however, lacks depth.  While they all have their own basic personalities and motivations, they ultimately just serve as the passive mediums I mentioned earlier, this time without the thematic implications of Saki. They are certainly likeable (I really liked Sataru), but they don’t offer as much as I would have liked them to. Then there are the antagonists (if you can even call them that).  Going into any detail on this matter is a spoiler, but the seemingly evil actions executed throughout the narrative puts the concept of morality itself into question; it makes you legitimately consider what is evil and what is justified. That is the mark of truly fantastic writing.\
I also feel the need to mention the superbly surreal presentation of the show. The animation is incredibly crisp and the color pallet is visually appealing, but the artwork stands out in particular for its wide variety of amazing designs.  Every human character has a great design, which is impressive enough, but the show also features a plethora of strange, grotesque, and fascinating creatures. Shinsekai Yori does a fantastic job of coming up with creative appearances for these creatures and making them all memorable. In short, the animation is top notch. The music, on the other hand, really steals the show. This anime has no OP theme, as is tradition, but it instead has one of the greatest ED themes of all time. Some would argue THE best. However, it is the OST that’s the really impressive aspect of the sound; it is absolutely mesmerizing. The potent combination of haunting, spine-tingling pieces and sad, somber pieces combine to form a remarkably large part of the show’s atmospheric and chilling environment.  Also, the voice acting is well above average. Truly a memorable presentation style.\
In conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is one of a kind. It chooses to walk the path of a mature, thought provoking, somber tale and never strays from that path. It’s not flashy nor is it particularly exciting, but it certainly is remarkably written. If you ask me, Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece. You would be hard pressed to find a more fleshed out and imaginative setting in all of fiction; not just in the realm of anime. Needless to say, I highly recommend this show and I’m glad to see that it has gotten the attention is deserves after an initial period of failure.\

    Where is the line drawn between what's morally just and what's misguided conviction? \
Unsettling, immersive, mystical and also sadly overlooked. Shinsekai Yori is a gem that has fallen through the cracks of the general populace's graces. Not to say it isn't known but rather it's become degraded and stigmatized by those that resort to petty remarks regarding the infamous episode 8. This in turn impeded many from watching the show and that's a shame. But for those that have given Shinsekai the light of day, it can be said that it's truly an anime worth one's time and its lately garnered praise is proof of\
          \
        that. Today I'll try to shed new light on this title, if for no other reason than to encourage a few others to also give it the benefit of the doubt and to see pass the naysayers. For those that do, you'll be gifted with a new anime to remind you why anime as a medium is so remarkable. \
By far the strongest aspect of SY is it's story. Most shows tend to tackle only one aspect and keep that as its focus throughout its duration. It's difficult to tackle several major storylines in a short time period but not only do SY do so, it also manages it with ease. The transition from a show wrapped in mystery to one that deals with human ethics were impeccable and well linked. The first storyline we tackle involves the slow unraveling of the show's lore and the dystopian society our characters are apart of. That alone would be enough to last the shows duration but it took this element and further used it by expanding to the second half of the conflict. Through proper foreshadowing and buildup this was made possible as the mystery, when solved, opened up a new bag of worms that is carried all the way to the show's very last concluding scenes.\
  The second part of the show involved the foreshadowed conflict involving the beasts of the land that \"coexist\" with human society by serving them. The beasts of the land known as the Monster Rats can be seen as allegorical representations of forced subservience and mistreatment that plagues mankind. The show leaves their presence unsettling but never resorts to preachy melodrama. With those familiar with Orwell's novel Animal Farm, it becomes easy to draw comparisons in the approach the novel takes with SY in displaying this animosity that humanity is known for. But unlike the novel the conflict is escalated to a grander scale. It isn't the most subtle way to tackle the subject but certainly a one uncommonly used, especially in anime, which further makes the title a rarity. The problem begins with humans and how they mistreat the beast. But it doesn't simply show fear and the inferiority complex brought on by it but also the retaliation caused by being in constant oppression. It's a historical fact the oppression leads to uprising and eventually war, this anime perfectly captures that in its own obscure way. If there was ever an Japanese proverb to sum up what this premise tackled it would be \"a cornered rat will bite the cat”, the \"rat\" further establishing the merits of my aforementioned allegory example. In the end the show forces you to ask the question \"who was right / who was just?\" with its last minute revelation. \
If there was ever an area that needed any improvement it would be here. The animation was very lackluster to say the least and when compared to other shows released around the same time it becomes more apparent BUT where the show lacks in fluid animation it makes up for in highly detailed art and proper color placement. There are many times in the show where contrasting colors, monochromatic scenes and color limitation was used to properly capture and convey the given tone it wanted to represent. May that be with a scene involving only cool darkly tint colors to invoke isolation or that of a sunset that brings on an ominous aura. The people behind these subtle but effective choices show that they're very well versed in their field of work. They worked with their limited budget and through clever lighting and other techniques made most of it's limitations to go unnoticed by the untrained eye. \
\
Simple yet effective. It's amazing what a few soundtracks can do to enhance a show's scenes. The color choice scenes I mentioned above became further heightened when coupled with the music. May that be the beautiful yet bone chilling choir chanting along with booming instruments or the softer long sweeping ones that gives a feeling of dismay and helplessness. Each and every track fell into place with grace and is one that will stick with you long after the credits roll. Also worth noting that the ending is among the best I've had the pleasure of listening to with the intricate guitar composition and well timed vocals. The voice actors were all fine and even tolerable dubbed as well. Standout being John Kaiser's role as Squealer.\
This is the only area of SY that I can find a true qualm with. Despite it's well explored setting and great world building only two characters were given any layered characterization and dimension. The first being our lead Saki as she's the one tossed into the difficult situations and grows as she learns more about the hidden secrets in her society. What makes her great as a lead is that she isn't portrayed as a 1 sided \"fight for what's right\" mouthpiece but rather she understands the need for the  necessary evils. That doesn't mean she doesn't fight against it but she don't act in a way that's pigheaded or irrational. She isn't made out to be someone with stubborn conviction that isn't subjugated to change but is shown as someone who simply wants what's right. She is later developed as the show goes along, making her time on screen one welcomed.\
The other layered character is Satoru as he's a constant companion to her. He doesn't get anything in the way of development as Saki did but he is layered enough that he feels like a person and not a simply a 1 note character. They could of spend more time to flesh him out further but given the show's focus what we got was enough.\
The antagonist for the series isn't layered per say but he becomes the one that forced the viewer to take a second look on the show's overall interpretation. As such his role is fine in the context of the story and adds value to it.\
The side characters don't really have much in terms of layered dimensions as they were never given any prolonged screentime to be flesh out. They were better as a whole than when viewed individually. But what can be noted was how the show handled them. It showed how fragile their mentalities were by the misgivings of their society's social order. The bonds they try to uphold and cling on to can be seen as co-dependence since they can't stand on their own. Something like a mental crutch that adds an interesting dynamic to their relationships. It's handled with a certain nuance which makes up for what they lack as individuals. \
Enjoyment: 8.5/10\
When I saw the propaganda surrounding this title floating around the anime community I became one of those people that was hesitant to give the title a try. I had forgotten about it and it wasn't until months later after constant praise that I watched it. If I had any regret it would be not watching it sooner as I hold this title in high regards. I can't recommend it enough. \
Overall: 7.5/10\
Shinsekai yori is a title that deserves more acknowledgement, not only is it a tribute to dystopian literature but also one that sets a benchmark for other anime titles to reach for. It is truly a masterfully written tale that is handled with a sense of class and finesse. If given the time of day I'm sure you'll receive something substantial out of it. \
For similar titles I recommend:\
Shiki: A tale about vampires that follow the same ethical themes brought up in SY. Not as polished in writing but still one worth watching.\
Suisei no Gargantia: both contain a plot twist that are identical and answers the same questions regarding perception of morality. Although it isn't handled with the same level care as Shinsekai it's still short enough and easy to watch to recommend giving a try. \
Wolf's Rain: dystopian-esc setting with discrimination and war, more of a \"road\" anime shrouded in mystery but gives off the familiar aura of the unknown that SY does. \

    What started off as an interesting piece on a dystopian style future fantasy world quickly squandered all the good sense it had at the outset and devolved into a moral confused and seemingly pointless story line. \
My main problem with this series is that it began with some top-notch world building mixed with an air of mystery that should have been the main focus of the show, but it seemed to just forget all of this and move forward in a completely unrelated direction. In this world, every child has the potential to essentially destroy the society and everyone in it, and the people find\
          \
        that the only way to preserve their own way of life is to kill any child who seems to be straying and to employ the widespread use of memory alteration and hypnosis. To me, this seemed to be setting up a very thought-provoking question: should this society exist, or would it actually be better off destroyed? \
Instead of engaging this morally interesting and consequential question, the story runs through a veritable roller-coaster of plot contrivances to set up a completely asinine and borderline offensive question: is it okay to commit genocide on intelligent, seemingly conscious creatures if you have magical powers and they don't? Then the show has the gall to act as if the big reveal at the end somehow changes things and tries to present that question as morally gray while a character who could reasonably be called a civil rights activist is portrayed as the ultimate villain. \
The main characters in this show are incredibly boring and most of them seem to exist only as plot conveniences. Characters are introduced, given the most cursory amount of development possible, then discarded once they have served their apparent purpose. Meanwhile, we are simply told to believe that the protagonist is a strong and interesting character, but she never really lives up to it. \
Overall solid artwork, animation, and sound can't save what is, at its core, a fundamentally broken story.\

    Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) is something of an eclectic anime series. It's based off a novel, which hands it very different premises compared to anime that are based off manga or games (and for that matter, original anime), which is pretty evident in its characters and story, following few of the bigger anime clichés.\
Much can be said about its story and its contents, but at heart it's a big metaphor of growing up, from the utopian-seeming setting in the beginning to the more nuanced view we're treated to later - not as a result of the world changing but as the result of\
          \
        the viewer - and the main characters - simply finding out more about the world and how it works, and adapting accordingly. It doesn't just settle with \"children growing up\", however, at every point and turn there's dark revelations and disturbing implications, some of which are never answered but deftly left for the viewer to contemplate, and right up to - and including - the ending, you always feel that something is just... out of place. The setting feels off, but in a good, \"this is disturbingly cool\" kind of way, so while maybe a little uncomfortable, it amplifies the overall mood of the series. Dread is, perhaps, a good word for the sensation.\
The characters are treated to a lot of interesting hurdles and obstacles, and it's interesting to see them interact with the world and each other, even if some characters take an unfortunate role as vassals of the story or infodumpers. Even so, the series' focus on karmic elements, the evil of the subconscious and the gnawing effects on those humans left isolated from their peers all serve to further define and contribute to the character dynamic. The latter half, where the pace really picks up, also brings about themes of oppression and supremacy and skillfully manages to instill a sensation of moral gray rather than good and evil. Conflicts are abound, simply put, and challenges the characters in intriguing and often unexpected ways.\
Aesthetically there is little to hold against the series. The colour palette is lush and the animation fluid. It rarely fails to deliver excellent character designs and animations, and likewise its special effects are lovely indeed. On the auditory side, it delivers a soundtrack that contributes strongly to the perturbing mood of the series. The opening theme is as harrowing as it is good, and the ending theme wrote itself swiftly into my favorite list. The voice acting is overall good, I am especially impressed with newcomers  \
To sum up Shinsekai Yori is hard, but its essence is a dark story about a world where few things are as they seem, that deals with a large host of themes - many more (and no less important) than the ones already mentioned -, set in an aesthetically wonderful world. It adheres to few of the clichés and stereotypes of the day, and is that anime that comes along once in a while with a really refreshing concept and story and executes it well. Characterization could have been done a little better, initial pacing maybe too, and some story elements were a little hard to accept, and so on and so forth. Regardless, I can only finish with this: Give Shinsekai a try!\

    Everyday we wake up, preform our daily ritual, then go to sleep, and all the while the world around us seems so perfectly normal. We, as people, have evolved to accept the normalcy of everyday life. It is seeing how people really act when normalcy is torn away from them that many people find so intriguing. \
The sad fact of the matter is that mystery thrillers are so rarely done right that people over look them without a second glance. Shinsekai yori is one of those gems that does it right, and should not be looked over so easily. \
The Story (10):\
Shinsekai yori is set\
          \
        one millennium in the future. Yet the the depicted future will remind you more of a feudal japan as there are no fancy gadgets or mecha robots to really say \"Hey, this is the future!\" Instead people in this distant future have created themselves a Utopia, and hold psychokinetic powers know as Cantus. \
In this \"New Age\", Cantus users are the dominate species on the earth, while humanoid rats known as Queerats also inhabit the planet. They are treated mainly as slaves and do work that Cantus users don't deem worthy to be done by themselves. These Queerats literally refer to Cantus users as God.\
The events of Shinsekai yori follow a certain group of friends as the try to master their Cantus through schooling. All the while Watanabe Saki and her friends try to unravel the mysteries of their society, and in doing so also unravel the normalcy that we humans hold so dear.  \
The first three episodes are entirely used for world-building, while nothing special they lay the foundation for a beautifully intricate story to be woven. After finishing episode four, the story of Shinsekai yori becomes a compelling work of art. Any small plot holes this anime may seem to have are hugely overshadowed by the seamless transition from one episode to the next. \
It becomes almost impossible not to relate the world of Shinsekai yori to the world we live in now. As normality is ripped away from the lives of our protagonists and the darker themes are revealed you will realize how truly mind boggling the writing of this masterpiece is. \
The ending of Shinsekai yori could not have been better. It leaves no questions to be asked and really ends the story right. It does not leave one wanting more, rather the ending concludes the story in a way that sums up all events and any questions you may still have.\
One of the biggest complaints about the story of Shinsekai yori is that there are homosexuals scenes, and yes there are. These scenes are in 1-2 episodes tops and the are completely relevant to they story. I assure you that they are not there for no reason, and will, if anything, add to the depth of the presented story. \
Art (9):\
The character designs of Shinsekai yori may take some getting used to for some, but it very beautifully done and suits the work quite well, the backgrounds are desktop worthy, and the animation effects are quite stunning. \
The only misleading part about the artwork is that it appears to be very light and happy. Shinsekai yori is not light and happy, Shinsekai yori does have some graphic violence at heaver points in the show and the art style can somewhat take you out of the moment. But it in will no way keep you from being on the edge of your seat as you click on the next episode. \
The highlight of the art in Shinsekai yori is by far the backgrounds you will see. The artists put a tremendous amount of detail into the work, and it payed off in making some of the best scenery porn in anime.\
Sound (10):\
Wow. The tracks played with this anime blend so smoothly into the moment that you won't even realize the music is playing. It sets the feeling in a way that enhances the story, never once did I find a kink in the sound that would have lessened my enjoyment. Something that really blew me away was that Shinsekai yori doesn't have a musical opening. Instead, it has one of the best musical endings in all of anime. That is no exaggeration, the EDs for Shinsekai yori are fabulous. \
The voice actors did an immaculate job. I can't express this enough, the voice actors did so well with this anime. They fit the characters perfectly. \
Characters (9):\
Often times we see plot driven anime fall short because of the characters in them. It is when we find a set of characters that fit a story perfectly that it really shines. Shinsekai yori has a beautiful cast of characters. You will even find yourself loving to hate the antagonists. As I said earlier, the VAs did so well with the characters that you will never doubt why they are doing what they are doing, or why they feel the way they feel. What actually happens is that you begin to see yourself in them. \

I watched all 25 episodes in one go. I believe this anime to be a masterpiece in the best way. The entire show felt tense/dark, and I couldn't help but get sucked in. Yes there are some pacing issues, and there are homosexual themes in 1-2 episodes but that never took away from the enjoyment I experienced watching this anime. \

    Please, please, please, check this show out when you have the opportunity. Whether you are old or new to the world of Fantasy adventure anime you are sure to love Shinsekai Yori!! There are so many good things I can say about this show however due to time I'm going to keep it short and sweet. Of the many things I loved about this show the things that stood out the  most were the story, character relationships, (which I must also add, that the show is really emotionally powerful so get ready to feel some while watching.) art, and soundtrack. While there are noticeable\
          \
        scenes and uses of CGI used during of a few of the scenes in the show it doesn't take away the beauty and appeal of the artwork, mostly the scenic settings for example fields, skies, deserts etc. Battle scenes and competitive events were also parts of the artwork that I loved too.\
Back to the story though the most important thing about the show, the story is something very powerful. It's like a \"learn your lesson\" no a \"learning experience\" type show. Meaning, when you watch it, most if not all of the events going on in the show have some sort of lesson/advice behind it. It's very psychological, it really gets you thinking about things such as \"the future\" and \"life ahead.\" What made things even better about the show was the relationship between the characters, a bit of a spoiler here, but I must give you a bit of advice and tell you, the reader, try not to get too attached to the characters, this is a horror so expect some things to happens. That aside, the friendship and mostly the interactions between our characters is so powerful, that it really made me feel like I one of their friends so when some \"things\" happened during the show I \"felt\" pretty damn hard.  Now with the music, I cannot remember who the artist and composer was,that aside he or she did a really great job making the events that happened during the show more intense and engaging with the music. So expect to hear some really great emotionally powerful and very intense music to look forward to during the show. Lastly, and overall I must again, highly recommend this title to anyone who is into fantasy and adventure because this show in my best opinion met the proper, and ideal criteria of what an \"outstanding\" or \"masterpiece\" of work should be about! 10/10\

    Five episodes in, I’ll have to say that the experience Shinsekai Yori offers is very varied. At times, I am greatly enthralled by the intense and well executed scenes. Other times, the series leaves me wondering why I’m not doing something better with my time. The story takes place in a future post-war Japan. Rather than being futuristic, the setting leans more towards the feudal side featuring few advanced technology and more magical powers known as the “force”. Five children stumbled upon a discovery and come to understand the history and true nature of the world they live in. They are thrown into an intense\
          \
        life-threatening adventure, as much psychological as it is physical. However, as interesting as the settings may seem, which it is, a range of factors deters the enjoyment that it could otherwise have brought.\
The perhaps greatest problem with this show is the detachment of the main characters from the story. For a good half of the first five episodes, almost all of the plot and background is brought to the viewers solely through flashbacks and narration. The main characters themselves do not actually take place in any plot-driving events in the early episodes. This is not a flaw per se as the interesting element of the series is not the actual story, but the intricate settings and the gloomy mood. However, after the story picks up its pace and the characters get thrown into danger, the show turns into more of a horror/thriller than the mysterious and psychological experience that it has previously established itself as. This is very much uncalled for, as the thriller part feels forced and is put there only to push the story along. The things that are actually interesting in the show, that is to say its mysteries and the characters’ minds, are left unaddressed.\
If it did not seem obvious from the previous paragraph, Shinsekai Yori suffers from a terrible pacing. The episodes are frequently inconsistent; some moments have so much stuffed into them that the viewer is not able to reflect over what is happening, while other entire episodes can be about almost nothing. A lot of time is spent in unnecessary interactions between characters. On the one hand this can aid the viewers’ attachments to and understanding of the characters, but on the other hand these are often pointless and serve no apparent purpose except to occasionally brighten up the dark mood. \
Apart from the pacing problems and the detachment of characters from the story, this series is also plagued by some minor flaws here and there. The characters, while not horribly done, are somewhat clichéd. Sometimes the behaviours of the characters are also not all that believable for their age, such as displaying great calm and maturity in grave and life threatening matters. Some situations are over-dramatized through exaggerating the characters emotions. Even seemingly unimportant and trivial scenes would see characters scared and crying with the sole purpose of reinforcing the “seriousness” of the show. However, this is somewhat forgivable as they are kids. Many measures are taken in order to simplify the advancement of the plot or to make the settings of the show more believable, and unfortunately some of these are irrational or do not make sense. \
While the flaws mentioned above can make this series sound like a poorly made show, this is not actually the case as most other things are done fairly well. The mood that this show manages to bring out, alas not consistently, is quite intriguing and deserves recognition. This effect is achieved in part through the dark and frightening settings, but mostly through the art and sound which is definitely a redemption point of this show. A very diverse collection of background music is used, ranging from classical instruments to modern music, as well as a mix between these. The music pieces are almost always used in the right occasions and do a great job in reinforcing the mood or certain emotions. Some of the sound effects, especially during horror scenes, are so brilliantly made that they manage to turn what’s otherwise trivial into something terrifying. The voice acting on the other hand, while mostly well performed, would occasionally give way to very poor and dry voices. However, this is not common and is a minor issue. Another thing in this show that deserves praise is its art. Almost everything, with the exception to some monsters, is illustrated beautifully. In some situations the pictures are distorted or the colour tone and hue would be completely changed in order to reflect the mentality and emotions of the characters. The exceptional art and sound greatly enhances the mood of the show and is a saving grace which really adds to the enjoyment of the series.\
Overall, while Shinsekai Yori contains a wide array of flaws, it is not actually a bad series. It does suffer from problems such as inconsistent pacing and detachment of characters and story, but there are many good sides to it. The settings of the story is very interesting and the mood of the show, through the use of great art and music, is very enthralling and offers great immersion. This review is only based on the first five episodes of a total of 25 episodes, so all that has been reviewed is preliminary. 20 more episodes, given the innovative and compelling story, leaves great room and potential for something great. Right now the show needs to move away from the pointless thriller to elaborate on the mysteries of the world as well as explore the mentalities of the characters. \
*PS: To my great dismay, I discovered that after five episodes, I did not manage to remember a single character name in the entire show. This is not necessarily a bad thing though.\

    Upon revisiting this anime exactly two months from when I last finished it, (03/31/13) I am reminded of things that I have missed and that is this.\
If there is anything to be said about this anime, it's that it is extremely emotionally draining. With the trivialities of art and aesthetic pleasure aside, this anime is incredibly real with its plot twists and deep themes. With enough analysis, one could make an extremely satisfying paper on the choices of the characters and the moral injustices that may or may not have been present during the series.\
STORY 10/10\
Starting off with my initial impression of this anime, I\
          \
        would like to say that I knew what was coming (having finished it) but admit that I had no idea what the hell I was in store for when I watched that first episode. Did I expect this to be a happy-go-lucky anime? No. Did I expect this anime to be abundant with extremely dark materials? No. Did I expect a lot of the things that happened? No.\
The truth is, all of the events that transpired made sense in the end, and that many of what seem to have been irrational decisions were not without reasoning behind them. The story is so complex and ripe with plot layers that it's hard to comprehend many of the actions that the characters devoted themselves to.\
Which is why I would give the story a rating of 10. It was incredibly well done and, though it may seem naive to rate it such high a score, I believe that it deserves the effort that was placed into it in order to lead us into a state of enlightenment at the end.\
ART 9/10\
As touched upon very briefly during the intro paragraph, I mentioned that the aesthetic appeal was none too great in this series. And although many viewers would be put off by this \"more realistic approach\" to an anime that is quite newly finished, I would like to state that it was self-evident that the art helped itself rather well. With a more human approach to anime, Shinsekai Yori did a fantastic job portraying humans in their own habitat. \
Which is why I gave it a 9. Not incredibly pleasing in an aesthetic manner, but did work quite well in order to provide a more realistic approach to modern day anime.\
SOUND 9/10\
Dvorak, need I say more? Being an avid follower of classical music, \"Largo\" (aka, Going Home) from \"From the New World\" by Antonin Dvorak is a beautiful piece that is visited in much of its glory. Playing the part of one of the main themes of Shinsekai Yori, I was quite disappointed to see that not much of the rest of the movements of this said piece was shown. Otherwise, the sound was superbly done, with amazing ending songs and a dramatic opening tune that always nicely introduced the episode.\
So, well, 9. There could have been much more variation of songs, but otherwise the sound aspect of this anime wasn't very crucial in understanding the major themes and plot. Well done, and an extra point for Dvorak.\
CHARACTER 10/10\
I could write an entire essay on the analysis of these characters. With that being said, I leave much of the judgement up to you, as the main individuals of this anime were incredibly well-written and developed. Though antagonists or protagonists weren't very clear, I would have to say that this aspect made many of the characters more believable, as no individual can always be extremely good or extremely evil.\
The characters in the story made extremely practical decisions based on their situations and acted very maturely in certain predicaments despite their age. \
Bravo, indeed, for the characters. Bravo. 11 if I could, but I can't.\
ENJOYMENT 8/10\
This was obviously an extreme displeasure to finish. As explained prior, this was an extremely draining anime that I took much time and deliberation to finish. Breaking down before the half-way point of the story, I could not find myself enjoying this anime but continued for all the other rewarding aspects. I think that I enjoyed it, but am unsure due to my feelings for the overall perspective on this anime. It was wonderfully done and I enjoyed it.\
I simply wish I could have enjoyed it more. Sorry, 8.\
OVERALL 10/10\
This is the TL;DR part. Damn it, if there's going to be something you're going to not regret watching this entire freaking year, it's got to be this anime. Rich with make-believe history and moral lessons (as well as absolutely satisfying characters), this anime has made it to the top of my list of favorite anime. Just watch at your own caution and know what you're getting into. Much content in this anime is suggestive but all leads to an established point. Watch it, and you'll be smarter having finished it. Cheers, and enjoy.\

Shinsekai yori is the type of anime that makes you confused, fall in love with it and then stabs you in the  back as soon as you think you\
          \
        understand. Shinsekai yori is a horror drama with a supernatural twist. It's the perfect mix of every one of those genres. This anime is definitely a psychological anime as well due to how many problems each character faces and has to deal with each of them. You see them work through their fears and their happiness. \
The main character is Saki Watanabe, she's a high school student who has many male fans who are seeking her company. The other supporting characters play a major role in Saki's life are Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano. They all struggle together and help each other fight through school to harness their powers. However, rumors start to spread about a mysterious cat that starts haunting students for unforeseen reasons until Saki and her group of friends go out hunting for the answers.\
During the entirety of the anime, it follows Saki and Satoru, mainly, and their fight to save their friends who become hunted by the cat. To find the answer to win, they have to go through a lot of trouble and in the end did they win? What did they really accomplish? Through deceit, Saki achieves what she's after, but what she has lost along the way is very tragic. Although the ending seemed to be a happy one, one can only wonder how much she could be suffering on the inside after such a loss. \
8/10 Overall. Would recommend for those who like a good psychological, slightly horror, thriller.\

    When I first heard about Shinsekai Yori, I was only slightly interested due to the somewhat lack-luster description of the series that was on the chart I viewed before the series aired. However, as I began to watch it, Shinsekai Yori quickly drew me into its universe, immersed me in the art and the lore, and become one of my favorite anime of all time.\
The story of Shinsekai Yori is experienced through the eyes of the main protagonist, Watanabe Saki, as she grows from childhood to adulthood, making it a partially autobiographical experience as an older version of Saki voices parts with narrative. Set one\
          \
        thousand years in the future where almost every human has developed psychic powers called Cantus, the world of Shinsekai Yori is full of both the familiar and unfamiliar. While the humans all look relatively the same as what you could find today in areas, the other denizens of the world are much different from what you would see now. The first episode immediately establishes who should be watching the anime as people get instantaneously squished and torn to shreds in flashes of blood in what would seem to be present-day Japan however, it then quickly shifts to where and when the main story actually takes place. From the first episode alone, it is immediately apparent that something is clearly amiss in the quiet life of Saki's village and the story plays off this sense of mystery. While watching, I never felt that I was left out of the loop on the lore or what was currently happening; the story is paced well so that you basically know everything that Saki knows, and, at times, it isn't really all that much. I felt some sort of connection to the protagonist, Saki, as she journeyed and strove to know the truth in the world she lives in. Much like her, with the passing of daily life and with only one episode airing per week, I gradually began to forget some of the same things that Saki did, almost like the creators actually desired this effect. In short, this show will test your memory. While you don't have to remember absolutely everything to enjoy the story as there are plenty of twists and turns, you will probably miss out on some subtle hints that are dropped by the characters as they talk. Shinsekai Yori is definitely worth rewatching purely to see how all the pieces fit together after you've experienced it once already. Another thing that is worth mentioning is that the next-episode previews of Shinsekai Yori are probably the best I have ever seen, revealing just enough to make me make me wish the for the next episode to come faster, yet not spoiling too much in the process. However, though I always ached for the next episode to come faster, there was a certain “hump” in the story in the first few episodes that was particularly dull but, after you got over said “hump”, it was smooth sailing from then out and I felt the ending was particularly satisfying.\
If the art of Shinsekai Yori were to be summed up in one word, “amazing”. I found that the art style itself is unique and very polarizing. The humans have a somewhat “bland” look to them in comparison to everything else in the anime, mostly because they look “normal”. The background art can be absolutely stunning at times and the creatures often look grotesque and revolting, which is why I say the humans look “normal” or “bland” in comparison. The creatures are supposed to look that way and, in all seriousness, the fictional depiction of a “Fiend” gives me the chills every time I see it. The animation isn't necessarily the best and while there were parts that could have been better, those are minor and somewhat rare. Although there aren't too many major scenes with crazy animations, there are often small and subtle animations that play a part in the overall story or character interactions, and small stuff like that tends to go a long way in my eyes. All in all, despite the animation not being the greatest, the art in Shinsekai Yori is definitely worthy of an experience that only blu-rays could offer.\
The sound design in Shinsekai Yori isn't so much to create an epic soundtrack as it is to create music that fits the mood, and it does so perfectly. The background music is generally dark, mysterious, mellow, or any combination of the three and while there are certain tracks that stray far from this trend, never once did I feel that the music was intrusive. As I am a proponent of a proper use of silence, or a “lack of music”, I must say that Shinsekai Yori pulls off those moments well. In fact, it was due to those moments that Shinsekai Yori became the first anime I have watched where I legitimately felt scared during an episode; there are definitely parts in the series that are meant to instill fear. Mood-setting and silence aside, it is notable to mention that Shinsekai Yori does not have an opening theme at all but rather only has two ending themes. The first ending theme, “Wareta Ringo” by Taneda Risa, is possibly my favorite ending theme song from the Fall 2012 and Winter 2013 seasons (the time span which Shinsekai Yori aired) and the second ending theme, “Yuki no Saku Hana” by Hanazawa Kana, is good as well, though it definitely gives off a more melancholic feel than the first ending theme.\
So, just to get this out of the way, yes there is homosexuality (both male and female) in this anime, however, it is not prevalent throughout the series and I thought it was taken in a mature and logical way, reflecting the ideals and culture of the anime's society. Homosexuality in Shinsekai Yori can be surmised as such: homosexuality is accepted and it is perfectly okay to love whoever you love but, at the end of the day, homosexual couples often split up to pair with partners of opposite gender because they cannot reproduce otherwise and therefore cannot further the human race but, their love for one another often stays. Although the characters are all psychics, most with the power to wipe out entire armies if they wished, none of the characters ever seemed inhuman- with some exceptions. They laugh, cry, discuss societal issues, and develop strategies, some of which are fairly brilliant. I love how human everyone in the series is but, the ironic thing is that my favorite character isn't even human. While I won't go too much into detail as it is somewhat of a spoiler, he is the ideal warrior in every way, shape, and form and, in my opinion, is a character who demands respect. As far as character development goes, the most major developments happen on-screen while other minor developments happen off-screen. This is mostly due to the nature of the series; Shinsekai Yori tends not to waste your time on the worthless everyday activities that the characters do (except in the beginning), instead using time-skips to get to the parts that are actually important. These time-skips are done in a way such that it doesn't seem like anything major changes about the characters other than appearance, and even then, the characters are all easily recognizable. There are only two personal gripes I had with the characters. The first how Saki acts near the end of the anime- though, in all honesty, it's completely understandable given what she goes through over the course of the series. The second is what truly happens to certain characters, specifically to the ones whose ultimate fates are implied throughout the latter parts of the story but you never actually know for sure (some of you who have already watched the series will probably know who I'm taking about).\
Despite the “hump” in the story-telling in the beginning and minor, personal gripes near the end, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of Shinsekai Yori. Every new moment provided either new insight into the universe, characters, or story and there were plenty of twists and tense moments to keep your eyes glued to the screen and keep you on the edge of your seat. The art provides some absolutely gorgeous visuals at times and the soundtrack will provide the correct atmosphere for each scene without taking away from it. I felt connected to the characters, shared both their happiness and pain, and never felt alienated from them. In short, I absolutely loved Shinsekai Yori. After each episode I groaned “Man, why can't the next episode be out already?” Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece of story-telling and definitely worth recommending to anybody as long as they can appreciate the mature themes the anime tackles.\

    I don't know how I overlooked this series while it was airing, but I'm very glad I found it. Shinsekai Yori takes place 1000 years in the future in a world populated by psychics possessing the godlike Cantus ability, which manifests as various psychokinetic abilities. Along with the psychic imbued humans, humanoid mole rats called 'Queerats' make up the bulk of the Utopian society in which this story takes place. \
The story follows a girl named Saki and the rest of her school group, Group One. They uncover that something is definitely rotten in the new world. Viewers beware, this series is not the lighthearted\
          \
        romp that the description and series image portray it to be. It is a post-apocalyptic dystopia with recurring themes of memory, ethics, and morality. Violence, gore, and sexuality populate the series at every turn as the mystery of the Utopia is uncovered. Shinsekai Yori doesn't shy away from depictions of free sexuality, often depicted as 'forced drama' in other series but is merely part of the setting. Unfortunately, the focus on that aspect of society wanes as series goes on, providing one of my few gripes about the plot. Interpersonal relationships make up much of the plot during the first two time arcs but takes a major backseat in the final arc. \
The core of the series is a mystery, and it does it spectacularly. The viewer has a distinct advantage over the characters due to plot devices involving memory and occasional voice-overs by an older Saki. This break allows the viewer to attempt to solve the many mysteries of society. While the major twists will come as no surprise to veterans of the dystopia genre, that by no means diminishes the enjoyment. The first four episodes provide the bulk of the knowledge base for both the viewers and the main characters, which is why those episodes are sometimes criticized for being tedious. It's likely a necessary evil, and is fortunately not provided by a one-and-done plot device. \
One of my favorite things about this series is that there are two antagonists. The first are the Queerats who act as both allies and enemies. The second, more interesting foe is the internal one. The inner conflicts of the characters drive the themes of memory, ethics, and morality in a way that a physical antagonist cannot. The final conflict in the series is very well done, but the quest for victory felt underwhelming and insufficiently explained to me. \
The musical score deserves a special note. Excellent variety of music that added perfectly to the overall tone of the series. Whoever was in charge of that deserves a raise, and then some. Worth listening to just for the music, it is rare to have visual and sound mesh so well. \
Character development is great, but not perfect. The characters don't change that greatly, even though the series undergoes two time skips with years in between. That said, it was refreshing to have no character fall on a strictly good or evil characterization. Each character has their own viewpoint and moral compass by which they abide. \
The art style takes some getting used to, and while I was tempted to give it a slighter lower score it was consistent, leading me to believe that the art style chosen was intentional and I refuse to fault them for that. The Queerats in particular are well crafted, and the action sequences are well done. The scenery often overshadows the characters themselves in terms of detail. I believe this was intentional, and is due to one of the recurring plot points which I will not spoil here. \
Summation: This series is excellent and well crafted by any metric. I'd highly recommend it to more mature viewers, but I question how much a younger viewer might get out of it. It would come as no surprise to me if Shinsekai Yori were to eventually end up on 'Must Watch' lists. \

    This is one of the most overrated anime out there. Unlike many other anime this one takes a more serious tone but it really devolves into just being an anime that includes the elements that are present in more serious anime rather than tell a good story.\
Story\
The story itself is broken into three arcs, this is problematic and would cause the story to suffer. The background of the  story that a sudden outbreak in a few people obtaining telekinesis powers results in dystopian feudalistic future.  The story talks about a few characters and their lives in school and then as adults and their\
          \
        understanding of the world and interactions.\
The anime sets up a premise that has pretty big flaws, ones that it doesn't really address or even provide any sort of explanation for. It simply establishes that somehow people with telekinesis wouldn't continue to wage war among themselves. There is no explanation of what would be created to limit destructive behavior, the viewer would have to simply make a guess.\
Because of the 3 arc format, it means that a lot of elements of the story are just thrown at audience rather than developed. This makes the story appear to be a cliff note version, with elements rapidly introduced and then removed to make room for other ones.\
Of the three arcs the first one is remotely watchable, the other two are either weird or boring. The first one explains the world that the characters inhabit and gives away the entire plot, which is government doing shady things. The problem is that because of the formatting or because of the creator’s wish to create an anime that is more “unique” than well developed the plot doesn’t exactly fit, as the explanations for this “shady” behavior isn’t all that shady. The second arc is focused on romance but because of the 3 arc format the story is hastily thrown in together with the characters acting in odd ways making the whole 2nd arc simply odd, weird and just overall pointless. The third arc simply confirms what the audience learned in the first arc, the government does shady things, but not really.\
Art\
I cannot say that there is anything all that good about the art. It wasn’t bad just nothing remarkable and interesting. There was a possibility of creating some interesting art but it wasn’t done.\
Sound\
The sound is where this anime does well. The music chosen is pretty spot on but not without its imperfections. That is the music at times is used to create a tense situation when the situation wasn’t tense at all and simply made the whole feeling weird.\
Character\
Because of the 3 arc format the character development is pushed into hyper mode creating major jumps. Nothing interesting is about the characters, they all are their own stereotypes and simply are boring. They don't develop in any sort of way.\
Enjoyment\
This anime was one that showed a lot of promise but because the creators wanted to create a unique anime than a good one meant that whole thing just seemed more of a marketing push than anything.\
Overall\
It is crap, elements are just thrown in with little to no explanation and everything about this anime was focused on creating a unique one.\

    Story: My god, the writers know how to thrill you. Sociopolitical themes, human weakness and strength, incredibly deep and tragic love, fickleness of memory, communism, post-Apocalypse, and telekinetic abilities! Every development has its importance, and even the initially homosexual scenes have a great, looming weight behind them - history and zoology - yes, zoology. Watch it for your own curiosity. All plot developments has been beautifully placed together one after another, and every twist is a wonderfully orchestrated dance with the viewer's fragile emotions.\
Art: I love the soft lines, the gentle colors, and the animation for this anime. I think a very important decision that\
          \
        I fully support was to include the animation director of Casshern Sins into one of the most important, beautiful episodes in the entire series so far, and it blew me away. The soft colors give a very squeamish aura, which fits perfectly into its intended delivery, and the result is exactly what it is: art, and good art.\
Sound: I am not an expert on sound, but I thought that the music was enchanting, always matching the scene perfectly. The chorus of children singing provides gloom beyond gloom, as things start dropping heavily near the later parts of the series. The sounds of all the inanimate objects, voices, and the different creatures, all sound perfect to me, so I have no real complaints or opinions to offer.\
Character: This is where the story pulls curtains one after another on you, through the characters. Each character has a distinct personality, one developed through the time you spend watching them move, behave, talk, and think. I loved every single one of them, especially Yakomaru, whose intelligence and aura are outstanding. The main character is not particularly interesting, nor is she intelligent or observant, but she does know how to narrate, and she does that well enough. Her thoughts and reactions are completely normal and expected, and I think she is the reason the viewer is struck in shock at every moment, because she is completely, absolutely, just like you.\
Enjoyment: I wouldn't miss this for the world. I watched the first 5 thinking, bah whatever, it's a little boring, but the plot picked up faster than NASCAR, and I'm still sputtering from an episode I watched 4 weeks ago. My jaw still hasn't recovered from some of the drops made in that week, and by God, I will buy this in Blu-Ray if it means the end of civilization (pun intended). I enjoyed every bit of it, and I have to say its tour-de-force is in the final 10 episodes. No anime I have seen henceforth has had such tremendous impact on me, and including Clannad, that means something.\
If my raving so far has not been enough, I will say again that I love it. You owe it to yourself to try this anime, at all costs, lest you miss out on something extraordinary. \

    \"Shinsekai Yori\" is an dive into an incredibly well-thought-out post-apocalyptic universe, with interesting \"laws\" and \"mechanics\", where everything may seem weird at first, but eventually completely makes sense.\
This anime carefully crafts a complex and varied universe without leaving any doubt about its inner workings - it's an accomplishment that not many media can claim to have achieved.\
And, in this amazing universe, an equivalently well-thought-out story is told: rich of dark social themes, interesting characters, romance, action, sci-fi/fantasy/mystery elements, and more.\
And again, everything just \"makes sense\". The level of immersion this anime has on the viewer is unbelievable. \
There hasn't been a single moment where I\

        questioned the logic of something happening during the series - all events, dialogues, locations, phenomenons, mechanics, and characters were extremely believable and presented in such a way that the viewer felt they were real.\

    This review contains basically every spoiler.\
Shinsekai Yori had a case of not knowing what precisely it wanted to be. It was an action show aimed at teenage boys, a political thriller for the older crowd and a philosophical drama for those who want to think. Except it failed to deliver on all of these promises. A significant amount of this is due to the poor characters, though the plot was decent for the most part.\
Characters:  \
Saki, being the main character, severely disappoints with her constant passivity. She is rarely proactive which means that other characters always have to drive forward the plot. This includes\
          \
        Satoru, Shun, Kiroumaru and Squealer. She has very few defining character traits other than being very self-preserving and resilient. The only sequence where Saki drives the plot forward is when they are searching for someone, of which they do twice, and the sequences accomplish nothing other than provide us with nice scenery to look at. Her decision in episode 24 to burn the Psycho Buster in order to save Satoru from a chemical death is downright idiotic and illogical on every level. Not only does this keep the 'ogre' alive so it could potentially kill more people, but does nothing to save Satoru from her. Very fortunately for her, this pays off, but to make such a huge idiotic decision and not have the show comment on it one bit, aside from words of reassurance for Saki, which also makes no sense, detracts from her character immensely. If she were both self-preserving and logical she could have created a wall in front of Satoru whilst the 'ogre' suffered a chemical death, which would have ended the conflict immediately and saved Satoru's life. It is worth noting that Saki's character, although the story spanned almost 15 years of time, never changed or developed as a character. She stayed the same until the very end, where she was ruined. She also talks to the deceased Shun 10 years after he died to figure out plot details which would otherwise have been very difficult to know.\
Squealer and Kiroumaru stand out as characters in the wrong show because they are charismatic, intelligent, and honourable in their own ways. Squealer progresses from a slimy servant to a glorious military leader rivalling Kiroumaru himself. Kiroumaru is the embodiment of honour, but it is revealed late in the series that he plotted a rebellion against the humans because they could have been destroyed by them at any moment. Squealer's motivations are very justifiable; fighting for the liberation of monster rats and equality of rats and humans. His experiences in the first arc of the series shape his strategy and actions in the 3rd arc where he declares war on the humans. Kiroumaru and Squealer stay true to their principles to the very end, and they do not waver in the face of death. Kiroumaru fights with the humans out of loyalty to them, even though his loyalty is not unconditional. Squealer fights for all rats in order to provide them with better lives. They are admirable characters, unlike everyone else in the show, who is either a redshirt or suffers from supreme stagnation. It is not difficult to see why these are characters are the best part of the show.\
Everyone else was mostly insignificant. We barely got any screentime of Shun, and so his purpose was to trigger an epiphany in Saki, however the memory wipe the episode after delays this for a very significant time, thus negating the consequences of his death for a few episodes. Mamoru and Maria were uninvolved with the plot to the point where their daughter, who has 0 lines that aren't screaming, is more relevant, more important, and drives the plot forward. Even she is not a character, though, she is a character-less enemy. Redshirts include Inui, Rijin, Kaburagi, the crazy monk dude, and countless other citizens. Tomiko is an interesting one because she does such evil things, like killing children and controlling every aspect of human life, out of fear that an apple with go bad and ruin everything. Her interests are in preservation of humans at the cost of freedom, progress, and humanity. This is contrasted well against Squealer, who is progressive and constantly advances his tribe even if it is highly dangerous for them all. Satoru is barely worth mentioning. When you see him in episode 5, that is his character and it never changes throughout the series. He makes rash decisions, and is still naive, especially during the hospital sequence where he doesn't want to realise what threat they are up against.\
Plot: \
The plot was the best thing about this show, though it wasn't anything better than 'good'. The first arc contains eough events, however, they are all placed at the end, leaving the first 4 episodes almost eventless. The first few episodes are used entirely to set the scene and infodump, rather than to develop the story. The introduction of the rat conflict and rat politics was a benefit, but having to watch humans play a large role in this detracted, especially since Satoru just killed everything. First arc has a decent conclusion, though in classic A1 fashion, there is unnecessary explanation to establish this conclusion. There are a lot of dropped plot elements, such as the characters who go missing who are given 1 sentence of information 10-15 episodes later.\
The second arc is bad. Almost nothing happens. They go looking for people for at least 4 episodes. Episode 10 contained Shun's death and some infodumping, and provided conclusion to his part of the story, which wasn't much, albeit good, transitioning the show into the next segment. The infodumps during Shun's death episode provided enough information for his issue, but didn't particularly affect the main plot in any significant way. Then the plot convolutes and starts to introduce plot holes, such as memory wipes. Use of such memory wipes in addition to sealing of power would allow the Ethics Committee to solve basically every problem that arises with children, thus rendering cats unnecessary unless they become really bad. There's a once-off character whose role was to replace Shun but he had no relevance to anything and was forgotten immediately after. The Mamoru search showed some snowy scenery, but ultimately meant little. The Maria search showed the same scenery, and also added little apart from setting up the next arc and leaving Satoru and Saki on their own.\
The third arc is better, but spends far too much time focusing on the humans who have not changed since the beginning, and nowhere near enough time on rat conflict and rat politics. There are a decent few episodes where Squealer is effectively likened to the Tywin Lannister of the show, and his battle strategy against the humans appears to be quite effective, but the actual damages are never shown or mentioned at all. The lack of shown consequences makes the attacks on human settlement feel insignificant when they shouldn't. The 'ogre' was a good introduction, but instead of utilising existing characters, a new one was created specifically for the role, and for the zero lines they say, they have more of an impact on the story than Shun, Mamoru and Maria combined. A seemingly unbeatable threat upped the stakes, which was good for tension, and it remained this way until they introduced the cop-out that is the Psycho Buster: a magic solution that will solve all of their problems. This undermines the abilities of the humans and instead of letting them fight and win on their own merits, acts as a way for the plot to grant an out the the losing faction. The Tokyo exploration episodes could have had good scenery, but it was just desert and caves, which was a missed opportunity. Yet again, Shinsekai Yori becomes a searching simulator as they look for the Psycho Plot Convenience. This isn't as bad as the previous searches, though, because it is their goal they are pursuing, not insignificant side characters that don't do anything useful. The intentional sabotage of the Psycho Buster by Saki when they could have won may have ruined Saki's character, but it served the plot by allowing the humans to come up with a solution of their own merits. The actual solution is given to Saki by Shun, who died 14 episodes prior, and even though is a figment of Saki's madness, reveals important details to Saki that she either should have known herself (thus strengthening her character) or should have figured out. Being told how to beat the 'ogre' reflected poorly on her character and the plot. Kiroumaru's sacrifice was well executed (pun intended) and served as a consequence for Saki's actions. \
The final episode concluded on a low note. The bad guys won, oppression and tyranny would continue, freedom was crushed. But instead of being solemn, the show maintains a neutral stance. This neutrality does serve to let the viewers decide who they feel was righteous, but it was so obviously the rats, that this could almost be considered a negative point (it isn't, though). The decision of the human council to punish Squealer made sense, and his eventual release from torment was a good conclusion to his story, however, the show mostly ended off as it began; with an oppressive and tyrannical society that controls every aspect of human life. There were few hints at any change to this system, save the treatment of some (not all) rats. \
Sound and art/animation: \
Voice acting was of standard quality, with standout performance by Squealer's VA. The OST was mostly forgettable, though not bad, with only one track being good. It set the scene on most occasions, but sometimes ruined the atmosphere, like during the confrontation with an imprisoned Squealer. Really not notable. It suffered from a lack of diversity in tracks and used the same ones over and over even if they didn't fit the mood of the scene.\
The art style was quite pretty, especially the scenery of some of the towns that were visited, but the directing was inconsistent, especially camera angles that often focused on Saki's rear when it was inappropriate for the scene. Episodes 4 and 10 were directed very poorly, but the floating bars of soap in Shun's area were quite amusing to look at. Animation quality was inconsistent. Sometimes it was high quality, usually was mediocre, rarely bad. Lighting was good most of the time.\
Overall: \
This is basically just Psycho Pass with a better plot, significantly lower production values, and a meaningful conflict with the antagonist.\
5/10, was watchable, but nothing I would recommend proactively.\

    Shinsekai Yori: From The New World of Great Anime\
I have no qualms in coming out and saying Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) was not only one of the best anime of 2012, but it was one of the best anime I have ever seen. Very rarely does a series come along and floor me with its overall quality. The story, art, music, voice actors and characters were all downright fantastic. I still can't get over much this anime consumed my attention, so much so that I finished all 25 episodes in less than 12 hours. I can honestly say that this series was an\
          \
        emotional roller coaster that left me depressed and moved at the same time. It takes a powerful writer and a great production staff to pull that off.\
For those of you unfamiliar with Shinsekai Yori, it is a story about a group of 5 children with psychic powers growing up in a Utopian society in the far future. In this society, only people with psychic powers exist and strict laws govern what the children can and can't do. While out on a school excursion, these children come across a strange creature that is actually a robotic device considered to be a \"library\" that provides them information and insight on the past and what had happened to humanity over the past several hundred years. After learning this information that had been kept secret, their world is turned upside down and their lives will be at stake as they have to learn to live in a world that is not as it seems. I'm aware that's a very vague description, but it's difficult to explain this anime's plot without going into heavy spoilers. This series is extremely dialogue heavy and takes several twists and turns, with each line providing a crucial piece of information toward the story.\
I could go on-and-on about the strengths of this series because it does everything right. I loved it's cast of characters with a lead character that is a bit out of the ordinary from your typical series. Saki Watanabe is a girl with not a great intellect and she's not a powerful psychic user, but her pursuit for the truth and her emotional resolve make her an interesting character to follow. The rest of the group is made up of Satoru Asahina, a fiery boy that likes to pick on Saki, Shun Aonuma, a cheerful boy that is talented with psychic powers, Maria Akizuki, Saki's closest childhood friend, and Mamoru Itou, a quiet, cowardly boy that keeps to himself but has a deep affection for Maria. I really loved how this series explored each character's personalities and feelings, also going into the realm of how their feelings change for each other as the series progresses. \
The plot and story is one of the best I've ever seen in a series. The way everything played out, the way it was able to tell such an immense story in just a 25 episode series was amazing. It took many twists and turns along the way and really played at your emotions with the way it unfolded. One thing I have to come out and say about this series' storytelling is that I was amazed at how brilliant the foreshadowing was. I am not a big fan of foreshadowing in anime but this series did such a brilliant job of implementing it without completely giving away what was going to happen in future episodes. On top of the foreshadowing, I was also quite impressed with the subliminal messages and social commentary that was portrayed in this series. There are several different messages I felt could've been taken out of the series. The securities of mankind, blocking education, inhumane treatment, racism/biggotry, and manipulation are just a few of the subjects this series delves into, with the main topic being basic human principles and society. I found the messages that this series portrayed were wonderful lessons for people in general to learn and understand how a society should work (P.S. that's not a statement supporting the society from this series).\
The artwork was downright gorgeous. While I wouldn't say the character designs were great, I absolutely loved the shading, the artistic expressions, as well as the human emotions and facial expressions, especially eye contact. I was especially a fan of how well eyes were drawn in this for particular situations when you could feel the characters were in a dramatically tense situation. I will admit though, this is perhaps the first full length anime series I've ever watched that actually doesn't have an OP...but man, oh man, the EDs sure make up for it. The first ED was so beautiful and breathtaking that I'm almost speechless from it. I could watch it a million times and still appreciate something from its artistic splendor.\
The music was downright gorgeous and fit the tone of the series extremely well. While I will admit that it doesn't have an overwhelming variety with its soundtrack (be prepared to hear repetition with the BGM), the way it sets the mood makes it incredible. Going back to the ED, I found the song Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda to be a remarkably captivating song. How it went with the visuals made for a pleasant viewing experience. While I didn't quite like the 2nd ED, Yuki ni Saku Hana by Kana Hanazawa to be quite as good, it was still a gorgeous ED regardless with a pretty good song to boot. I'll give Kana some props for being the lead seiyuu and singing a series ED as well. Speaking of the seiyuu, what remarkable work. This series had a top notch cast that sold me with each and every one of their performances.\
While I can't say there are many negatives I can take away from this series, I will note a few minor complaints. The first actually isn't so much a complaint, but rather a warning. If you're watching this series, pay attention to EVERY piece of dialogue, no matter how mundane it seems. It's amazing at how much every detail plays an important role and sometimes ends up being a major plot point. I will note that the time jumps were pretty alarming and abrupt at times. There are two major time jumps in this series and how things \"change\" right off the bat might catch you off-guard. I know it did for me, but at least it was easy to adjust to the time jumps. I will also say the \"sexuality\" that is explored in this series can be a bit off-putting for a few, but I will implore you to stick with it because there are reasons for it and it doesn't last particularly long throughout the series. However, I will warn that it does sort of jump out at you out of nowhere.\
All-in-all, Shinsekai Yori is one of A-1's best. While I am not the biggest fan of A-1, they somehow manage to produce exquisite gems for anime series from time-to-time and Shinsekai Yori was definitely one of them. If you're a fan of futuristic Utopian type anime or stories, I would give this a strong recommendation. Hell, I would recommend this series to anyone that's looking for an excellent story with great characters. I will warn that the mood for this series is extremely heavy and if you get easily depressed, be weary of this series because it gets quite depressing at times. However, despite that, it's still a very emotional series that is quite moving with its messages. Again, I have to say, in my opinion, Shinsekai Yori was the best anime from 2012.\

    Shin Sekai Yori is a striking anime; a superb supernatural drama that excels in crafting and executing a captivating story. It’s mystifying, futuristic world is riddled with dark and disturbing secrets just waiting to be uncovered. It is very unfortunate that some people will drop this anime due to its almost painfully slow pacing. But stick around with SSY and you’ll be in for a real treat. \
The story and world are where this anime truly shines. SSY takes place in a gorgeous utopia, 1000 years in the future. Each human being possesses psychic powers, ruling the entire world at the very top of the\
          \
        food chain. The story follows Saki Watanabe as she recounts her haunting journey toward finding out the truth behind her seemingly perfect world. It’s an all too familiar formula, yet Shin Sekai Yori manages to spin a brand new tale that still feels refreshing and interesting. \
Noticing the various themes, subtleties, and intricate details stuck into the overall plot is almost necessary to fully appreciate the story. One of the joys of the show is slowly uncovering the rich and sometimes disturbing history of the world. It’s clear that care was put into crafting the world and the story. The first two episodes fool the viewer into thinking this is going to be a happy go lucky tale about some innocent school kids and their magic. But the third episode changes all that, giving the main characters and the viewer their first peek into the truth about their nasty world. In the first few episodes, Saki, who serves as the narrator, also hints that this seemingly average tale is about to get much darker. In fact, there are quite a few clever instances of foreshadowing scattered throughout the show. SSY promises that it’s going to deliver, and it doesn’t disappoint. \
The first half is paced quite slowly, yet it serves a purpose. During the anime, three time skips happen, so the slow pacing was a nice way of not making the anime feel like it jumped around abruptly for no reason. In the beginning, Saki and her friends are but babes; twelve years old and naïve about the world they live in. This time serves to establish the relationship between the five friends, as well as introduce the Monster rats and their role in the world. The anime then skips ahead two years, and this is where things began to pick up. More of the truth about their world is uncovered, prompting some troubling events that end up driving the five friends apart. \
One other interesting tidbit about the story and world is its use of sexuality. It’s a bit of a surprise when you first see how relationships and sexuality are explored in this futuristic world of theirs. Fortunately, it’s just one small aspect of the show that is mentioned in the beginning episodes and then briefly viewed after the first time skip. It’s not overblown or used as a distracting means to titillate the audience. It’s just one more aspect of their world that sticks out as particularly unusual.\
The second time skip is where things really start to pick up for the better. The first two arcs mostly served to introduce the characters and the different aspects of the world. From episode 17 and on, SSY takes an abrupt turn to the dark and horrifying. Shocking secrets unlike any of the ones revealed before are thrown out into the opening. The atmosphere is intense and terrifying, leaving the viewer with feelings of anticipation, awe, and unease. And I of course mean that in a positive way. In its essence SSY is one those “mindfuck animes.” But here’s the catch. There’s subtlety in its delivery. While some anime will be intent on showing you horrific and shocking scenes of intense violence simply for shock value or shoehorned in plot twists (that usually end up creating plot holes) to “mindfuck” the viewer, SSY does this with a little class and intelligence.\
Of course, there’s no denying that this anime has its share of violence. But it’s intent to crawl into the viewer’s brain and under their skin doesn’t come from its instances of intense violence. While those are horrifying in their own right, the real horror comes from finding out the truth about the human society. The real horror is finding out the sheer ugliness of the things they tried so hard to cover up. The big reveal at the end is the icing on the cake. The story and world are the real horrific parts of this anime. The atmosphere and the violence merely complement them.\
Now for the characters. Unfortunately, they play second banana to the story. They are very good characters of course, but compared to the story, not quite as much detail or development were given to them, aside from maybe Saki. Saki, the main lead and the narrator, serves as a sort of proxy for the viewer. Through her eyes, we too uncover the ugly secrets of her world. Interestingly enough, most of the other main characters, aside from Satoru, are mostly used to  reveal some secret of the world. The side characters are mostly people presented to give the viewer some much needed info. None of them particularly shine. The Monster Rats also made for some surprisingly interesting characters. Though this doesn’t really come to light until the later episodes. \
Studio A-1 pictures has once again outdone themselves with the art and animation. They’ve crafted a beautiful and vibrant world that is a joy to look at. Some of the shots of the world might as well be classified as scenery porn. In contrast, when the story calls for it, dark and chilling backdrops are also presented, slathered with dark tones and heavy shadows. The soundtrack gets the same treatment, filled with slow, haunting tracks. The characters aren’t neglected either. Each of them is given a unique and aesthetically pleasing appearance. A small noticeable detail would also be the funky clothes they’re given throughout the series. They’re very interesting, looking like a cross between modern clothing and traditional Japanese clothing. \
Overall, Shin Sekai Yori is an excellent anime. It’s a chilling tale that will leave you impressed long after you’ve finished it. It slow paced and subtle story actually end up working in the anime’s favor. It’s detailed and intricate story as well as its themes will leave the viewer immensely satisfied in the end. Some of the best kinds of stories are the one that make you feel emotion, and boy will this anime invoke plenty of that. It’s a spectacular show that shouldn’t be missed by anyone. ",

    Stop reading reviews. Don't add this to your Plan To Watch. Open a new tab and go watch this show right now.\
Usually when I see someone write a review where every aspect of the show receives a perfect score, I disregard their opinion, but in the case of Shinsekai Yori, there is not a single aspect of the show that could be done better. Shinsekai Yori is one of the few anime I have watched that I would dare label as FLAWLESS. There are some anime that you can say are perfect for their time, or perfect for their genre, or at least achieve their\
          \
        goals. Shinsekai Yori is not one of them--it is simply perfect.\
The art is more beautiful than any anime I have ever watched up until now. It is not a similar style to Miyazaki/Ghibli films, but it is of equivalent quality. The attention to detail is unparalleled. Characters have unique eye colors, eye shapes, face structures. There are few plain landscape shots, but the setting is an edenic place, and you will not forget that for a moment.\
The music and the sounds are both great. Not overdone, but simply true to life. At times, I forgot that I was watching animation. The characters' emotions felt real and raw. I am not a crier, and this show did not make me one... But even though I do not speak Japanese, I could hear the emotion from the voice actors. \
The characters are again, realistic. They have flaws, they have doubts, and sometimes you want to claw at the screen so you can tell them what to do, but they inspire a sympathy in me that I think will stay with me for a long time. \
Another note, this series plays like a movie. I watched it in a few days, and I think that is the way that it is meant to be watched. If you are going to take a break between episodes, I would recommend that you stop after episode seven and then after sixteen. There are no annoying recaps between episodes, there is only one OP/EP (per episode, only one song plays, to be completely clear), so the episodes easily flow together. Of course, you are free to watch it as you wish, but it really FEELS like a movie, and I don't think waiting a long time between episodes will add to the experience. Note that this show is based off of a novel, not a series, but a singular novel. \
This is not a feel-good show. You will feel good at parts, you will feel good at the end... But like a movie, there are extremely high points and extremely low points. That is another reason to watch it in a short period of time. \
Overall, as I said, this series is perfect. I would not recommend it to someone who has just begun watching anime, or has not seen any other non-mainstream anime (Paranoia Agent, School Days, and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni would be good preparation). In order to appreciate this anime, you have to see what has come before it and every small imperfection those other shows contain. If you think your palette is broad enough, if you think that there is no anime left to surprise you, if you feel like you can predict what will happen, then watch this show, and be prepared to be proven wrong. \
If I watch something better, I will edit this review to reflect my change of opinion. As of now, there is nothing better than this. It deserves to be #1 on MAL. I would willingly pay to own this show on DVD because I want to support the creator/producer that much. Stop reading reviews. Don't add this to your Plan To Watch.

    For two days in a row now, I start writing another review with no ideas of what score to give to an anime that I've finished. This time, the show happens to be Shinsekai Yori, or From the New World.\
Before we begin. I must stress that this show is not for everyone. If you absolutely can't watch an anime with the following characteristics, you might not want to watch this show.\
*Spoilers\
1) No comic relief\
2) Slow-Paced in the narration of its story, with the only exception at a few high points of the story\
3) Homosexual theme, being relevant to the story (light shounen-ai and light shoujo-ai\
          \
        only happen in 1 episode)\
Now, let's begin.\
- - - Story - - -\
With minimal fan-service and without any comic relief, audiences are left with no choice but to take the show very seriously. In that sense, SY (Shinsekai Yori) does not disappoint. Overall, it has a fascinating and remarkably solid story line, one that examines the irregularities of human society in details, from various perspectives. Everything that occurs in earlier episodes happens in order to set up for the conclusion. \
It might be shocking to say this, for such a convoluted fantasy, psychological story, it has virtually no plot hole. \
However, the slow-paced, no-comic-relief nature of SY might put a lot of people (including me) off. I am serious. There are points in this anime that I almost considered on dropping, but narrowly avoided that by a conviction to finish this anime. Fortunately, I was rewarded with a dramatic and immensely satisfying ending.\
9/10 (not perfect score because of pacing)\
- - - Art - - -\
Character design for main characters is decent, but there are severe distortion of characters' faces at different moments. The background is beautiful, but often repetitively used. The weakest link is the animation, which is average at best. \
7.5/10\
- - - Sound - - -\
There is no OP in this anime, and there are 2 EDs for 25 eps. I don't mind the fact that there is no OP, and the EDs are enjoyable to listen to.\
Nevertheless, it must be mentioned that the soundtracks used, while appropriate, is endlessly repetitive. There were times when I wished that they would add more soundtracks, but in the end, they were adequate and appropriate for the story being told. \
8/10\
- - - Character - - -\
While characters are praised for being \"realistic\", viewers can't really attach to them on an emotional level. Also, characters are not memorable either.\
That being said, a huge plus is that this anime tells different stories throughout main characters life from 12 to 26 years old. I was relieved when our main characters don't always \"stay a child\", as with most other anime. \
7/10\
- - - Enjoyment - - -\
Slow-pacing, lack of comic relief, and not-the-best-characters on the negative side.\
Great story, fascinating social commentary, and extraordinary ending on the plus side.\

I can understand why this anime is ranked so high on MAL. This is a very dark, mature work that stands defiantly against popular trends in anime.\

    Harsh, perfection, desperate, flawless, dark, superstitious, mystery, provoking, thrilling, soul-crushing, depressing. Those are the word I will use to describe Shinsekai yori. This anime is really heavy. It evokes a lot of uncomfortable and uneasy topics, and puts a spotlight on the depravity of mankind and humanity. It sheds a light on the various attitudes of humans toward different kind of issue and their need to dictate everything. \
The problem that arises during the anime is always a food for thought and question to ponder. This anime doesn’t paint anyone as a bad guy or a good guy. The line between evil and justice, good\
          \
        and bad is so blurred. There is no bad guy in the story, and even the characters that seem to be a bad guy are well rounded, interesting characters, executed in ways you would NEVER expect. It utilizes the world to create a moral ambiguity where everyone is justified with their actions. When I am watching Shinsekai yori, I often have a feeling that I am watching Death Note with no mind game. Both anime is awesome at how it questions the very nature of humans. On what standards that we define and judge ourselves or other are evil or justice?\
Does possess superpower will make our life merrier and happier? Not necessary.  In this show, everyone in the village have psychokinesis(PK) when they reach a certain age. A bless (or rather a curse) comes to the particular individuals indicate they have the cursed power. I love the way the story setting in a society based with the cursed power. Nah, this is not a boring shonen anime that “We got superpower so we go out and kill some evil guys, getting praised by the head chief and repeat”. This anime does take logical and realistic assumption into its plot which is generally praised by the critics. Having a superpower not necessary lead you to the gateway of happiness, isn’t it?\
Shin Sekai Yori tells the tale of a group of children born in this “strange” society (you will know why after you watch the first 15 episodes), and how they grow up with this world and they get ample character development throughout the story. You're in with them for the ride, starting from a clean slate, trying to curiously stumble through this new unknown world. Seeing these characters challenge the status quo of the world and handle with the situations the story throws at them is quite engaging, and the way it’s done is believable and reasonable. The story is dynamic to it where every aspect of the show serves to either develop the world or the characters.\
Let’s get to the heart of this gem. What exactly is it that makes Shinsekai yori a masterpiece? I would say that it’s a combination of gradually built-up atmosphere, tension, fantastic storytelling and music. Even in the first few episodes, you can probably feel how dreary and dark situations are. When I am watching episode 1 it already give me quite a blow as I do not expect some blood in the beginning. The setting is definitely something that assists in creating the feeling of being suppressed by a mystery force that screams dystopia (an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad). However, as the story progresses, there is many hint and symbolism if you are attention to the detail. This anime WILL force you begin to question almost everything. This leads to the major point that Shinsekai yori excels at, storytelling.\
Its outstanding storytelling is the things that make me keep watching until its very end. The cliffhanger at the end of most episodes had successfully evokes the burning desire inside my heart to continue watch Shinsekai yori. The horror and tensive atmosphere make my heart beat run wild at most times. The atmosphere gets me hooked into the story, to experience this weird world with this unique tone with qualities I can't describe. It's so immerse, and it's so well done that everything blends in together and makes for this believable and cohesive experience. It's damn good. The pacing is phenomenal as its started off tense, moved into hopeless, desperate problems and then converted all those problems into hope for the future. This anime is NOT filled with cheesy melodrama but however, it maybe predictable if you have sat down and have a deep thought about the story-line.\
Let us talk about the character development. The character in the anime is unique and interesting. As the story advances, the characters have made some incredible transformation as well. The 5 main characters do enhance the overall story. Their conflicting personalities and reaction to various situations made some events in the anime intriguing to watch. My personal favorite character is Saki. As the anime progresses, the bonds between the characters are tested and their lives are focused as they on a journey of discovering certain truths they aren’t supposed to know (It will blow your mind).The history in this show is well-crafted and it enable you to understand more about the present world.  \
Side character does have an imperative role too. I personally like one of the “villain” in this anime (whether he is a villain or not, it remain arguable since I had written that there is no clear line of bad and good in this show). He is cunning and intelligence. He is also willingly to sacrifice and manipulate some individual to achieve his goal. This makes him a little bit similar to Yagami Light (the main character in Death Note). On his early appearance, he appeared to be weak, but the anime does show its noticeable body language which hinted his true character. He is ambitious and does give bring a hell in the most majestic way. He has his own reason to justify his own cruel action and in my opinions, it does not have right and wrong as I probably will do the same thing if I am in his shoes.\
The character and art design is simple yet beautiful. It is not really impressive at a first glance but it is clearly presented. The characters have really expressive eyes and some nice body types to them. I love the ethnic tribal clothes that the characters wear and this is enough to make the characters look good. The environment and background is also very amazing. There are a lot of scenic moments in the anime and I love how they all come to live. The nice angles of the scenes and the mood they set, is always a plus. There is no much of action scene in this anime and is most likely not needed.\
There is no OP in Shinsekai yori. isn’t it strange? There is only one in episode 16 if I am not mistaken. A core part of Shinsekai yori is amazing brilliant music, which is absolutely amazing with great violin that helps supplant the tone into a point of prominence. It supports the story in ways that words could not and amplifying the emotion (still remembers Angel Beats?). At the right times, the right soundtrack is played and the right emotions are conveyed. I had a love with the second ED which is “Yuki ni Saku Hana”. Whenever I hear this song, I will always have a urge to cry as it brings the memories of somebody’s death.\
The ending is quite satisfying. It warp up everything and does explain stuff that you like to know. It ends in a way that shows really should end, and I appreciated it. There is no second season, I guess.\
I will recommend Shinsekai Yori to all dark anime fans. However, let me give a early warning first: watch it with an open mind. There is some unexpected scene which I don’t want to spoil, but please expect the unexpected. Be aware that Shinsekai Yori is not made to entertain you, it is here to make the best of what it did in quality and writing which it did a great job with. Shinsekai Yori is a very deep and emotional show. Go watch it and be sucked into its world. I was completely attracted to the world it built and I ended up marathon the whole show in 2 days. This is the kind of anime which will worth your time to watch. Shinsekai Yori is my new favorite anime now.\

    Author's note: I got some...less than positive feedback and comments from my first review and people felt I really needed to better back up my claims. I have taken care this time to better explain what I mean when I say this mindblowing masterpiece is both a little less than original and probably a wee bit overrated. Ok! On with the review!\
We often see anime adapted from manga, but we rarely see an anime adapted from a young adult novel. This much lauded anime is adapted from a Japanese young adult novel, that itself is basically an adaptation/remake of 2 classic dystopian novels from the\
          \
        early 20th century. Shinsekai Yori translates as \"From the New World\", which is appropriate since it borrows heavily from both the novel \" Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley and especially from a lesser known 1924 novel called \"We\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Shinsekai also seems to take some inspiration from Harry Potter with one of the major conflicts being between wizard supremacists and non-magic users, whom I will simply call \"muggles\" for the rest of this review.\
WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! \
Story: 7/10\
In the year 2011, ex-Soviet mad scientists in Azerbaijan created a mutagen turning humans into magic users. The mutagen spread until 0.5 percent of the population were wizards. The wizards then wiped out 99% of the muggles in a few years and formed brutal dictatorships with the most powerful wizards serving as dictators. The muggles were forced to be slaves of course. For the first 600 years there were 19 Wizard dictatorships with muggle slaves that lived under an uneasy truce. There were also a few groups of muggle hunter gatherers, and small groups of wizard scientists, who built the last biotic computers since nearly all books had been destroyed. Japan alone contained 4 of the Wizard empires because Japanese wizards were rather quarrelsome. A problem arose when the Cherry Blossum Empire’s last ruler was a complete madman who killed half its population. In order to create order and peace, Japanese Wizard scientists through brain washing and genetic engineering were able to make it so killing another human resulted in your own death. However, this meant wizards couldn’t kill muggles either. To correct this and put down the muggles once and for all, the surviving muggles were rounded up and mutated into mole-men with inferior intelligence and a different enough genetic code that wizards could still kill them. The mole-men then became the new slaves of the more peaceful wizard societies. However, some mole-men continued to foster dreams of rebellion. Any humans born to Wizard families that don’t have magic powers (Squibs) are sacrificed in the tradition of ancient Sparta, only with giant cat monsters instead of leaving the infants out to die. Those who cheat at mandatory wizard school are also killed by the Government’s cat monsters. In addition to heavy brainwashing, the Wizard police state in which our characters live is able to pacify the population by promoting LOTS of casual sex both heterosexual and homosexual. \
The mechanism that kills Wizards who commit murder, works by hypnosis shutting down the murderer’s liver once the murderer is aware they killed someone (hypnosis can’t actually do that BTW) and this causes high potassium levels (liver failure actually causes LOW potassium levels) and the high K levels cause a heart attack. However, there are 2 types of mutants that can still kill people. The first are “fiends” who can slaughter people without suffering death feedback. The second are “Karma Demons” who can’t control their powers and kill people unintentionally and thusly avoid triggering the hypnosis. The reason the government kills anyone not in full control of their magic, or who cheats, or who doesn't develop magic early enough, is presumably to prevent “fiends” and Karma Demons” from appearing. In the current year of 3,000 AD, there is a global population of 70 million wizards and an unknown number of Mole-men, but we know not nearly as many as wizards. Wizard communities are surrounded by powerful barriers that citizens believe were built to keep them safe, but were actually built to keep them in, and stop their magic from warping the environment any more than it already has.\
Pretty impressive background world huh? A true masterpiece! Here is why I was less impressed than most of my fellow MAL users. I read obscure classic novels that aren't on the summer reading list...because I'm a nerd. Let's look at the similarities with \"We\". \
1. dystopian Police State taking place exactly 1,000 years in the future. 2. Government rules though brain washing, genetic engineering, and brutal force used by secret police at the behest of a shady government council. 3. LOTS of casual sex both heterosexual and homosexual is encouraged to keep citizens passive. 4. A wall is built around the nation that people think is protecting them, but is actually keeping them in. 5. Anyone who dissents and is not executed has their memories wiped. 6. Outside the wall are hairy \"beast men\" that are the mutant descendants of those not conquered by the Police State. 7. The hairy beast men lead a revolt against the government and do major damage to it. 8. The novel ends open ended with some optimism towards a better future. \
The line between homage and complete ripoff is thin. However, if a great story is forgotten and young readers refuse to give it a chance, is it a sin to make a reboot that better captures the hearts of young readers? I actually don't think so. That is most of the reason I rated Shinsekai as highly as I did. Now that background is out of the way, we will proceed to look at the actual plot itself.\
We follow a group of 5 young magic users who must uncover the brutal secrets of their society and unearth the brutal history that led them to this point. At the same time they must go to Wizard school and perfect their magic...or else. The major conflict occurs when a highly charismatic yet extremely treacherous member of the mole-men attempts to raise an army to wipe out the wizards and become the dominant species on Earth. His name is \"Squeaker\", but I will refer to him as Mole-neto. We the audience learn more about the society in each episode, but unfortunately our heroes keep getting their memories erased by the wizard government, so we have to hear things repeated again and again! However, the wizard government doesn't want to kill our leading lady Saki, because she has amazing leadership skills and has been handpicked to be the next ruler of the most powerful organization of the Wizard Police State called the Ethics Committee, who are basically like the Wizard KGB. Eventually Mole-neto is defeated and our MC ends the show wishing to gradually make her society suck less!\
Characters: 6/10\
We have 5 main characters, but unfortunately most of them aren't very interesting or well developed. The character that gets the VAST majority of the character building and development is Saki Watanabe, our MC girl. Saki is a brilliant strategist, intelligent, kindhearted, yet logical and highly pragmatic. She is sort of like if you combined Inspector Akane from Psychopass with Legolas from LOTR. Her only flaw is that she doesn't have any god damn flaws! William Faulkner wrote that only flawed characters in deep conflict with themselves are worth reading about. It is true that when we think of the greatest characters of all time we're thinking: Hamlet, Raskolnikov, Pierre Bezukhov, not fucking Full Paragon Commander Shepard! I was even beginning to read her subtitles in Shepard's voice by the end! The anime gives at least a little effort trying to generate sympathy for Mole-neto, but he quickly undermines that by being a complete asshole with no redeeming qualities. He isn't generous to his own people, he doesn't have a code of honor, he doesn't have ANY of the anti-hero traits that made other villains like his namesake Magneto interesting. He's a fucking asshole! My favorite character BY FAR is Kiroumaru the Samurai Mole! He's a mole-man, who is also a samurai! That's fucking awesome! He also is honorable to a fault, and has disdain for humans, yet knows that the mole-men must co-exist with the wizards if they are to survive. He doesn't get NEARLY enough screen time!\
Music: 5/10\
The only really good music in this anime is Dvorak's \"New World Symphony\" which it plays the same short segment of...over....and over...and over. The best use was in the opening scene depicting the outbreak of the Wizard/Muggle war. A wizard kid with an ascot like Fred in Scooby Doo is splattering muggles to the calming sounds of Dvorak, creating unintentional hilarity! I'm not sure if it is how unfitting the music is, or the fact that you just CAN'T look threatening wearing an ascot!\
Art: 8/10\
The art is pretty damn good. It isn't Mushishi good or anything, but it is well above average.\
\
Bonus Section: Plot Holes! Oh dear God the plot holes!\
The anime spends a LOT of time trying to convince the viewer to have some sympathy for the utilitarian principals of the dystopian government, but much of their killing is actually pointless. They have Wizards that can seal off the power of any wizard and the seal can only be broken if someone else recites that wizard's personal incantation. The Wizard government are MASTERS of erasing memories as we learn over and over. Why not seal the problem child's powers, then erase problem child's special incantation from the minds of any close relatives or friends that happen to know it? Nope! Cat monsters! The novel may actually explain why this wouldn't work, but the anime leaves us with the impression that the Wizard government honestly never thought of it and are just a bunch of complete idiots! Our heroes get their powers sealed, but the government allows them to recite each other's mantras and restore each other's powers, even though this is supposed to be highly illegal. Hell, it even results in a character becoming a Karma Demon and destroying an entire city! Yet the government couldn't give less of a fuck! They just MIB everyone's memory for the upteenth time! You would think with all the genetic engineering and brainwashing they would have created an instant death trigger for someone who without authority reactivates a wizard's power that has been sealed by the police! Nope! They just have insta-death triggers for nearly every other illegal activity. Here is another HUGE problem with the plot. The Wizards won their war with the Muggles WAY too easily. It is clearly stated that the first wizards during the war didn't have training from wizard schools and magic had evolved to be FAR more powerful by the year 3,000. This is a problem because Satoru is an A class wizard from the year 3,000 AD, who has been training his entire life, yet gets tired fighting hoards of mole-men using primitive bows and arrows! Yet the vastly weaker and untrained wizards of the past shit stomped muggle armies with tanks, machine guns, and jet fighters and were able to each rack up a 200-1 kill ratio. It also turns out for some poorly explained reason that magic is much more effective as an offensive than defensive weapon. Even an S class wizard/Ninja gets killed easily by fucking Mole-men when he has to go on defense. You can't win outnumbered 200 to 1 with no defense! The muggles would have taken that war with sheer attrition. It isn't like the wizards had H-bomb level attacks! Even the most powerful wizards from 3,000 AD couldn't do that!\
\
Overall: 7/10\
Shinsekai Yori wasn't the perfect series that so many MAL critics seem to think it is. However, it was a pretty solid series and a decent adaptation of old dystopian novels that this generation might actually enjoy...unlike Brave New World which literally every student HATES having to read in school. Were the characters great? Not really. Did the series have a lot of plot holes? Yes it did. However, Shinsekai also made young viewers have to think about government abuse of power, utilitarianism vs. humanism, the dangers of nationalism and discrimination, and how far one should go to protect your own freedom against tyranny. Is Shinsekai as good as \"We\" ? FUCK no it isn't! However, if you  have a little brat that won't eat his healthy vegetables and only wants to eat ice cream and Hershey's bars, wouldn't you settle for seeing him eat yogurt with a bit of fruit? It isn't broccoli, but it is a HUGE improvement over Hershey's and ice cream. For being at least a decent, modern adaptation of something legitimately great, Shinsekai does deserve some praise! ",

    I recently re-watched Shinsekai Yori, and let me say, I gave it a 10/10 the first time I watched it. I could summarize the plot like many others have done, but honestly, it really doesn't do the show justice until you watch it. \
It begins extremely slowly, and everything seems like filler, which makes it very easy to pass over. Around the middle of the show, a series of events happen that make you reconsider everything that happened thus far, and you realize all the seemingly random events are connected. From this point on, it gets darker and more and more mysterious. \
Arguably the best\
          \
        selling point is the fact that the ending is just so clean.  Most animes nowadays leave gaping holes in the plot that require obsessive fans to explain, or they just don't ever really end, or feel like they did (Shounen shit is the epitome of this). Shinsekai Yori answers every question you dared to ask, and then blows your mind with things you hadn't even considered, like basic human constructs such as morality and humanity. The ending alone makes it worth watching.\
Having re-watched it, I can honestly say it actually gets better, some how. You notice things you didn't the first time you watched it, and the detail to which they go to add these things is absolutely amazing, even small things like their classes just have so much symbolism, foreshadowing and detail. \
In an era, of increasingly shitty anime, like SAO, Naruto, and the various harems and moe-blobs, Shinsekai Yori defies everything you expect out of an anime, and leaves you desperately wanting more like it.\

    Shinsekai yori/From the New World 9/10\
Writing a review about this anime is a bit difficult for me, because I can't possible describe in words, what I felt watching this. I'm also afraid you won't understand what I'm talking about, you will have to watch this great anime yourself ;)\
1000 years from now in Japan. Every 'human' has mantra and can use telekinesis (imagining things and then make those things happen). For example they look at white paper and paint a motive without using paint, or break a bottle and then put the broken shards back together, without touching anything. It's all done with imagination -\
          \
        which is an important message during the whole anime - anything is possible if you can imagine it.\
(Spoilers ahead) \
The story involves 6 friends, (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, Shun, Reiko) who were born and raised in a tranquil town, Kamisu's 66th district, they go to school together and are one group. We learn quickly that the school system is pretty cruel, all the weak and dangerous kids get killed, everyone in town (students, parents, teachers) know about it and find what they do is acceptable and necessary to protect their utopia world from collapsing. It kind of reminds us how our society works and treats outcasts. No one cares about the weak ones among us, and at the same time we are scared that somebody else could become stronger than us, and they could do us harm (terrorists). That's also an important theme in Shinsekai yori - FEAR.\
So we follow this 6 friends, watch them grow and experience all the pretty and all the dangerous things of life, we learn about creatures other than humans - queerats (we find out more about them as the story goes on), and why humans now can use telekinesis also called \"cursed power\" or the \"gods' power\".\
Later what everyone is afraid of happens, one of this group's weakest gets killed by impure cats (humans don't kill humans, because it would cause them to die as well, death feedback), then another one becomes a Karmic Demon, a fiend, how the residents of district 66 call people, who lose control of their telekinesis power and kill everyone that is in sight. Those demons are exactly what humans are most scared of, so the \"government\" decided it would be best to kill the boy and erase everyones memories about him, also the remaining 4 friends can't seem to remember what his name was, what he looked like and so on, but they know something is very fishy about this situation and want to find out the truth, which brings them into more trouble. Now the government is after friend 4, Mamoru, and sends cats after him, but he's able to flee. The others of his group go look for him and find him. Maria decides to leave the town (that all of them started to hate) with the runaway, which later turned out to be a big mistake. Again many similarities happen between our world and theirs.\
We see a lot of time skips, things seem to happen rash, I wish they would take some more time to explain and explore, but everything makes sense in the end, so be patient. We get very attached to the characters, after seeing them grow up with those cruel rules, and how desperate they are, because they can't find another way to deal with their dangerous supernatural powers (they don't have enough knowledge, because so much is forbidden to talk about). Technically all of them could become Karmic Demons and erase humanity, that's why they 'the government/residents of the town' have to be careful and take care of the problem kids early on. And at the same time, it's such a cruel thing to do, simply killing your own children, because they could potentially become Karmic Demons, although they are still normal kids/average students, there's no mercy. \
Big time skip - To be honest I don't want to explain what happens next, if I write more I will REALLY ruin the show for you guys. All I'm going to say is, shit gets real and the queerats history gets explained. Please give Shinsekai Yori a try, it's a show that demands all of your attention, you will be surprised by the twists, I enjoyed this much more then I expected!\
The animation actually can be breath taking at times, but at other times the characters look like scribblings, it has a funny effect though and fits well in the story. There's no opening for this anime (I don' know if I have ever seen that before lol) but there are two different endings. The soundtracks we hear are mostly by an orchestra or a children's choir, that give you goosebumps like crazy! Again it fits perfectly to the story, no Japanese pop music to be expected here ;)\
The characters are...awesome and thankfully realistic. The girls kick ass, the parents aren't preaching, the boys make out with each other and that's perfectly normal, the government sucks, like in real life, and the queerats have balls! I was so happy that this anime didn't turn out to be one of those, that have a good plot, but terribly stereotypical acting characters! Like I said before there are a lot of time skips so the characters grow and change after every few episodes, but that is what's so awesome about this show. This could have gone really bad, rushing through important steps of life, but Shinsekai yori doesn't miss the important steps, no, everything you see matters, even those small things you wouldn't even dream of to be the slightest relevant, are relevant for the story, big props to the writer of the novel 'Shinsekai Yori' (in the U.S. also knowns as 'From the New World') that this anime was adapted from, Yusuke Kishi. Great message that makes you think about our society, and all the things, we could do better. It's pretty depressing actually...humans are cruel animals, but we can change. Yeah, that's my conclusion. \

    I watched Shinsekai Yori based on an MAL recommendation. I went in with an open mind, not entirely sure what to expect. Any descriptions of the series that I read were highly ambiguous and revealed little about the series' content.\
Boy, did I get more than I bargained for.\
Story: 10 - Shinsekai Yori utilizes gradual pacing and multiple time skips to tell one of the most thought-provoking stories I've ever encountered. I'm going to refrain from mentioning any specific plot details because the less you know going into this series, the better it is. The series is split into three distinct acts: childhood, teenage years, and\
          \
        adulthood. The first two acts are paced rather slowly and often I found myself questioning whether or not the plot would ever actually go anywhere. However, in reality these first two acts are incredibly important and serve as buildup, as it is in these episodes that we slowly realize that something is very wrong in this world. Everything that happens in the first two acts comes to a head in a brilliant final act that doesn't hold back. The genius of this series is that there is never an objectively good or bad side; all sides remain ambiguous. Thus, the story is not presented as a clash between good and evil; rather, it is more like watching events unfold with the ultimate outcome left to chance. \
Art: 9 - Shinsekai Yori is a visual masterpiece. The villages emanate a quaint and peaceful feel while the landscapes are both beautiful yet unsettling. There are numerous psychedelic-like sequences that not only unsettle the viewer, but also evoke a sense of curiosity about the inner workings of the world and the people who inhabit it. The only reason I didn't give a 10 is because the CG sequences look rather off most of the time, but in the grand scheme of things this is a minor detail.\
Sound: 8 - The soundtrack serves its purpose well. The music complements the current scenario and the show's main theme is grand and ethereal. In a way, the music is almost as unsettling as the plot. The music can stand on its own; however, the series could not sustain itself without the music.\
Character: 9 - At the show's start we are introduced to the main cast of characters while they are still children. As the show progresses through multiple time skips we see them grow up and change to try to adapt to a world that is not what it seems. The growth that each of the children undergo and the conflicts that they must face as a result ultimately lead to each of their respective fates. The final destinations of every character couldn't be more appropriate--for better or worse.\
Enjoyment: 9 - At first I was expecting a sudden, Madoka Magica-style plot twist early on that would dramatically change the atmosphere of the show for the rest of its duration. Instead I got a gradual plot development that raised numerous questions in my head, and the answers to them were violently thrown at me at breakneck speed over the course of the final act. Although I certainly loved almost every aspect of this series (as I've showered it in praise since the beginning of this review) the slow pacing of the first two acts was at times too much for me. I can only take so much ambiguous buildup. For that reason I gave this category a 9 instead of a 10. If you don't mind slow pacing, then there is nothing not to love here.\
Overall: 10 - Shinsekai Yori raises profound moral and philosophical questions that you won't even realize you were asking until the end of the finale. And believe me, it is a brilliant finale, perfect for a brilliant series. The ambiguity of the plot makes the viewing experience that much more enjoyable, as the viewer is left to come up with their own conclusion about the events of the series. If you liked Death Note or Psycho-Pass, trust me: you haven't seen anything yet.\

I began watching Shinsekai Yori because of the frequent urging of my friend. I dropped it at 3 episodes (because it failed to instill any sort of interest in me as to the outcome of the plot), then picked it up again a few months later because I saw it recommended by a fairly large amount of people who claimed that it was a \"classic\" and \"the best story ever\". I felt that I should at least watch the entire 25 episodes before passing judgement on what was seemingly a masterpiece. I did not make it. At 18/25 episodes, the series\

        has so far failed to impress me with any sort of shocking revelation, and I would rather not waste a further 2 hours of my life to watch the rest. \
Edit: I have since watched the complete series.\
Story [5/10]\
Ah, the story. Where to begin with this. The story was quite creative. A dystopian society set in the future with psychokinesis users and subhuman creatures. Cool.  However, I consider pacing to be vital to the enjoyment of the overall story, and boy I have a lot of shit to say about it. The pacing was, without a doubt, the most atrociously inconsistent I have encountered so far. I was sorely tempted numerous times to drop this anime at ep. 3, 11, and 16. \
The first three minutes of the first episode were probably the highlight of my viewing experience. After that began an inconsistent downward spiral into mediocrity. There is a definite lack of subtlety in the way the anime presents the issues it wishes to discuss. It is forced at the viewer, as if the producers were trying to make us to feel a certain way. Terror, I suppose. Each emotion Saki experiences is overdramatic to the point of absurdity. Certain scenes are revealed, then seemingly discarded or forgotten, leaving the viewer to wonder about the point behind it, or whether it mattered at all. It seems that for each arc (I'm guessing one every timeskip), the protagonists seek the answer to the current arc's mystery:\
Arc 1: Civilization\
Arc 2: Fiends/Cantus\
Arc 3: Queerats\
This division would be perfectly fine if not for the way the answers were revealed. The arc drags its dead body slowly and painfully across the storyline for about 4-5 episodes before an all knowing person decides to bestow their wisdom upon them. Examples: false minoshiro, Shun, Head of Ethics, Squealer. It's done in such an obvious and convenient fashion that the few episodes before the end of an arc seem pointless. The producers' failure to create a decently cohesive adaptation of the manga makes the story seem like a dumb animal spasming erratically as it tries to reach the finish line. If you've ever tried to played Clop, this was what watching this anime felt like.\
A particular episode I had qualms with was ep. 8. No, it was not because of the homosexuality. I was fine with that. Saki x Maria forever. The problem was with the abrupt development of these relationships as well as the adults' obliviousness to these 14-year olds' overly sexual acts. Added to that was the fact that the anime didn't even attempt to explain it. \
Again, I must point out the terrible pacing of the story. I'd venture that the episodes before the last arc were completely unbearable to watch. Sure, things were revealed, but they were revealed in such a vague and disconnected way that it honestly didn't matter until the final arc. \
\
Art [6/10]\
The art was nice, with a few absolutely disgusting lapses here and there.\
Sound [9/10]\
The music was the one redeeming factor of this anime. It was the perfect tone for the solemn and tense mood that dominated the story. \
Character [3/10]\
The characters were bland and uninteresting, with the exception of perhaps Shun and Squealer. The main character, Saki, was extremely hard to sympathize with. Her overreaction to everything was forced and off-putting. She had moments of revelation and even more moments of terrible stupidity (again, for the convenience of the plot, I suppose). The necessity of some characters other than plot devices is rather dubious.\
Overall, Shinsekai Yori is an anime that tries too hard to be something that it's not. The political drama and philosophical issues it tries to bring up are embarassingly and painfully forced. It tries to juggle four different topics at once. Throughout the series, it's hard to tell what it actually wants to focus on. Is it the development of the current utopia? Is it Fiends/Karma Demons and the effects of Cantus? Is it the political factions between Queerats? Is it the weirdly depicted racism towards Queerats?\
I judged this anime quite harshly because in my mind, I'd already condemned it as an overrated series. Therefore, I would not recommend this anime to anyone coming in with high expectations.",

    Shinsekai Yori (“From the New World”) is a dystopian-esque anime that offers a unique outlook on the world after the almost complete destruction of mankind.  It was a series I was skeptical of initially with but grew to enjoy more as it went on.  I literally picked this anime blind from my collection to give it a go and was quite pleased with my decision in the end.  As you dive deeper into this vivid, complex world, you will soon see how realistic and intricate this series really is.    \
I’ll be the first to admit I was kind of\
          \
        overwhelmed during the first 10 or so episodes of Shinsekai Yori.  You’re dropped into this vast and beautiful world, in a matter-of-fact fashion, where humans have powers called “psychokinesis” in which they can control tangible objects and light fires at will.  In was in no way outlandish for an anime environment.  But, the reason for humans having this power was initially unclear.  Was there a nuclear accident?  Was it discovered through scientific research?  Or perhaps these powers had always existed within humans, just waiting to be tapped of their potential?  I knew at this point, there was a lot to get my head around in the show, and it would take an open mind and excessive creativity to keep watching.  Giant cats lurking in the shadows, ready to eradicate children who don’t live up to their potential, memory-altering events, exploding dogs and naked mole rats who exhibit human-like characteristics just scratch the surface of this anime’s peculiar elements.\
The only things I have an issue with in this series are these “false-minoshrios”.  Magically, right after you seem to learn about them, the main group of kids you follow in the story come across one while on a class field trip.  Conveniently enough, these minoshiros are walking libraries that contain literally every piece of information on the history of mankind, and divulge answers to any question asked by the children.  This struck me in an odd way, I call it the “convenience effect” you see in some animes.  The kids wind up in a precarious scenario and may have dug a tad too deep into things they shouldn’t know.  The episode right after they return home from the field trip is two years in the future, where hormone-crazed teen girls are sexually involved with girls, boys with boys… it was all a bit too sudden I felt.     I understand these episodes were necessary to plot development, but they were not as well put together as they could’ve been.\
After about 8-10 episodes, Shinsekai Yori kicks it into high gear with a nonstop thrill ride of action, betrayal, loss and emotion.   You uncover more information about the memory altering, a tactic used so well throughout this world, and mankind becomes threatened yet again due to some unforeseen circumstances.  Unlike the beginning of the series, the latter 2/3 is brilliantly paced.  No dialogue is wasted between characters, and each interaction is purposeful in nature.  I understood the fear the humans had for their tight-knit world and how fragile it really was.  The fact that humans were “programmed” not to be able to kill or they would suffer from “death feedback” was a very original concept I appreciated quite a lot.  The queerats, though initially seeming to be nothing other than a being that existed in this land, proved to be quite cunning and devious in nature.  I had my own theories about their origination, and was pleased to see everything with them come full circle at the end of the anime.\
The way the story was told was also quite interesting.  The protagonist, Saki Watanabe served more as a vessel for the viewers to uncover the story of this new world.  Sometimes I feel like I’m just following that specific character’s place in the setting, but with this anime it felt more overarching.  I also enjoyed the human’s interaction with the queerats.  The queerats understood their relative insignificance in the pecking order, and I originally thought they were used almost as an experiment for the humans to survey.  They worshipped the humans as “gods”, but still made attempts at furthering their technology which became apparent as the series went on.  It was a clever relationship that was remarkably described through the series.\
To be honest, I actually felt like the characters were one of the weaker areas of the show.  The main character Saki, is a strong willed girl who obtains her powers relatively late in her childhood and loves the companionship of her school group.  The narration elements of the anime are sometimes made with an adult version of her voice, evident that the story is being told in past tense as more of a recollection.  She’s not necessarily a weak character, and maybe I was a little distracted by the complexity of the world around her, but something felt off for me.  The other major character Saturo, served as a loyal backbone and aide to Saki when the going got tough.  He put on a stone veil but deep down was torn up about the world he lived in and the many questions he had.  He was a good addition to the series and balanced out Saki decently enough.\
The other supporting characters, most notably in Saki and Saturo’s school group, were relatively ordinary.  I never really grew attached to any of them, and could’ve been substituted with alternate personalities with little or no notice.  The characters were not what kept me watching the anime as binge-like as I did, so I wasn’t necessarily upset that they were sort of bland.\
I really loved the artwork in Shinsekai Yori.  As previously noted, the unique take on the post-apocalyptic environment made me look at the genre in a new light.  The land was colorful and beating with life, an interesting contrast to the outlook the humans had on life.  The character models were also well constructed, although sometimes looked sloppy during action scenes.  I also valued the level of detail that was involved drawing the various creatures of this world.  The cats were all differently designed, and the queerats had subtle humanoid characteristics.  \
I was surprised to see that the anime’s opening was not always present.  I kind of got used to it not being there, though it wasn’t bad.  The ending theme was quite good and left me with a sense of fulfillment at the end of each episode.  The music present during the show was nothing noteworthy, but it did add to the overall vibe quite well.  Voice acting was average, for some reason I really liked Mamoru and Saturo’s voice actors though.  They were very distinctive in nature.\
All in all, Shinsekai Yori is a beautiful rendition of shows we are used to seeing in a different light.  It’s a rare opportunity to see a series stick its head out for originality, and this anime earns full honors for it.  It is not without its flaws… but it is definitely a must see for any anime fan!

    Shin Sekai Yori (SSY) is an incredibly ambitious anime that fails to deliver. The initial premise for the series involves a society desperate to control its citizens due to the fear that any one of them could become a mass murderer due to misusing their cantus (magical powers) or simply losing control. In a similar manner, the creators of SSY managed to lose control of their own narrative.\
It only takes four episodes before the show veers off course from its original premise. The first two episodes introduce the village and the cantus school where kids disappear frequently. This gets forgotten for episode 3 where an\
          \
        exposition dump tells us the dark history of the world, and that nothing has changed over the past few centuries; humans still murder anyone they are suspicious of. All of this information is forgotten the very next episode as Satoru and Saki begin mass murdering Queerats. Finally, when the kids return to the village where there's a possibility for them to act on the information that they just learned, there's a time skip and they've been brainwashed to forget everything. \
The show continues like this until the finale. Every development doesn't change how the characters behave because it's forgotten the next episode. Saki is completely incompetent with everything she does all the way through, even though the show tries to tell us how intelligent and capable she is. The other characters are just as incompetent with almost no personality. What this leaves us with is a show with bland characters making terrible decisions. The emotional parts of the story fall flat, and the climax of the story is completely ridiculous due to how easily it could have been avoided if any of the characters had any intelligence. The ending itself was insulting, trying to get us to empathise with a mass murderer who brainwashes his own people. \
The elements were there to make this one of my favourites. The soundtrack was great, and the haunting atmosphere and sense of mystery were enough to keep me hooked. However, once the show was over, I was disappointed. The series introduces many concepts that could be important to our future and are worth discussing, but the show never goes into any depth and usually uses these ideas as a means for plot conveniences (especially death feedback). Unlike other anime that explore similar concepts, there are no lessons to learn from SSY. The biggest praise I can give to SSY is how well it manages to masquerade itself as an intellectual anime.\
I would not recommend anyone watch SSY. \

    This was the first time I gave a 10 to a series so I thought it would be fitting to write a review (it will be spoiler-free).\
Story: 10/10\
The anime is set in a future society, after we - the humans of today - have messed up, and been followed by more humans who messed up. It's a plot that's been done before, but I don't think it detracts from the quality of it.\
The story flows well - even when the anime feels a bit jumpy, it actually goes with the mood, and there are no plot holes, despite the plot being complicated. Everything is tied\
          \
        in together sooner or later, and I must also compliment them on the way they carried this out. It tends to bother me when an anime piles up all of the mysteries for the very end, so it felt refreshing to see many secrets explained right away, while only some were left for later (though enough to keep the audience interested).\
The story itself is extremely interesting as well, even though it's made up of very classic elements. It kept me drawn in throughout, and I didn't feel like I was losing interest or concentration at any point.\
Art: 8/10\
The animation is very pretty, and flows well. I personally did not like certain scenes, and the size of the characters' eyes, but those are very subjective reasons so I'm not going to elaborate on this bit.\
Sound: 9/10\
The music is fitting, especially at certain scenes, and maintains the atmosphere extremely well. The ending songs were very good too.\
Characters: 9.5/10\
None of the characters are bland, even the less important ones. Character development is very evident throughout, and most importantly - it's never static at all. I know some would suggest that certain scenes related to character relationships were not necessary, but I think they were important for getting to know the characters and their dynamics.\
While the difference between 'good guys' and 'bad guys' (behavior-wise) is a bit obvious for my taste, I think the way the characters act and think (and how those ways (do not) change) was realistic and well carried out.\
Enjoyment and Overall: 10/10\
I would definitely recommend Shinsekai Yori to everyone. Even if you're not a SciFi fan (I personally don't usually like it), it's an outstanding watch that is sure to keep you glued to your seat.\

The first 3 episodes were pretty fantastic actually. Slow moving, but the world building was top notch, the animation quality was excellent, the characters were interesting, the setting was pretty fascinating and weird, and the music was good. The pacing was slow but good. I was really, really damn happy for this show.\
Then, everything after episode 3 has been absolutely terrible. There was apparently a change of director, and everything just went downhill. Pacing is awful and doesn't make sense, animation quality is absolutely shocking, camera angle rules are constantly being broken, the music is still okay but it's\

    My goal in writing this review is convincing you to watch this anime, I believe it is something everyone should see. I do not however want you to know anything about it beforehand.\
This is unfortunately an unsolvable problem since you are reading this in order to find out what sort of story this is. Despite it being a futile effort I want to give you one last chance to watch this without any prior knowledge of the story or the setting.\
If you keep reading from this point you probably won't be any the wiser but I hope I can still spark some interest.\
The story takes\
          \
        place 1000 years in the future. Mankind has evolved and now has psychic abilities. The protagonist is a young girl and this is the story of her youth or rather her upbringing.\
I don't want to give away any details in the story but if I were to describe it in broad strokes I'd say that it makes you question your ethics by blurring the line of what it is to be human. I'd also say that by the end of it you will need to seriously question how you judge people. I don't know how to explain it properly but the reason I say so is that at multiple points in the story I would be surprised just because I was judging a scenario based on how it looked rather than just what was happening. Basically the book & cover thing on another level. I have a really hard time putting this thought into words, sorry.\
Nothing I have said so far would make the average person want to watch this anime but the appeal of it is in the morals it questions and the \"feels\" you get through watching it.\
In my pathetic attempt to describe this anime I have realized that I'm really just trying to describe an atmosphere so I guess that if you are looking for an immersive story look no further.\
Everything contributes to the eerie atmosphere, the soundtrack is great although at some point in the middle of the series you will probably be a bit tired of the most used songs.\
The animation is in my opinion outstanding it fits the story perfectly and since I am not the sort of person who can watch something just because it looks pretty I won't say more than that it looks pretty and I don't see any room for improvement really. There have however been complaints of fluctuating production quality, that is as far as I'm concerned nitpicking. I atleast did not notice any change in the production value of either the story or the art through the series.\
The character development is in my opinion rather unique for reasons I won't disclose. However it is also pretty typical so there really isn't much to say about it.\
Finally I'd like to stress that this is a whole story - you do not drop something like this halfway through, it may have two or three slow episodes somewhere but that is no excuse.\
---\
If you only looked at my ratings you won't read this but I'd like you to know that I have a minor pet peeve with the presentation of one character and that at some point I remembered being tired of some of the soundtrack which is why those two get a 9 instead of 10. I couldn't give it a 10 for enjoyment because of how fucking scary the world is and I'm not a psychopath who enjoys suffering. \

tl;dr\
Don't read the review, watch the anime. That is all.\

    The way I write a review is different. Rather than starting out which pros and cons of the anime I write out what I understood from the anime and the messages of the author first.\
This anime, is the most interesting out of all I've ever watched. The author takes a really idealistic environment trying to show a realistic meaning. It made me think a lot about it. Basically this anime indirectly focus on philosophy and values of our existence.\
Character development was done very well but most end up dying right as it is fully developed which isn't negative but the characters that die do have\
          \
        an important role later especially Shun. I'll end it short since if I continue 90% of this review will be of each individual character lol.\
The first 3/4 story reminds me of a book called \"The Giver\" where the MC thinks she's living in a Utopia but many things she encounters will make her doubt the society she lives in. The last quarter of the story involves how 2 intellectual societies clashes and who has the right to remain dominant. This made me thought if we ever met an alien or if one species somehow mutated to an intellectual one, who would have the right to be dominant. The obvious (cliche) answer would be, we would negotiate and eventually live together, but this answer is also the most idealistic one that probably might not happen for a very long time.\
I felt sorry for the Queerats, not because they were once human but because the things they did were not wrong, it was a simple revolution that humans done before as well (especially French and American revolution) to throw out the monarchy for democracy. Yakomura did deserve to die but 90% of his purpose was correct just the 10% he wanted to become the superior of the Queerats. It was a good thing the anime ended with giving justice to the Queerats but most of the colonies are dead anyways.\
Now how the anime was paced was interesting too. I felt that it went very slow but the speed makes sense for a 24 episode anime. Even with so many stuff happening, way more than Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, it felt like it was a 64 episode anime. Basically it is weird that I thought it went slow when it makes more sense that I would say it went fast because too much things happen at the same time. I think this is what perfect pacing feels like. It's been a really long time since I 've watched an anime with good pacing.\
Finally, the message of the author to modern time. The suspicion of the Cantus' society would be similar to our suspicion of our government and that we are way too skeptic. Cantus' society was actually doing the right thing to keep a Utopia even though they had to control everyone's memories. The lost of freedom for perfect protection hmm seems like it is definately a real world modern problem. The second message is in Humans & Queerats. I believe the author is trying to say something about our racism. I find racism fights way too cliche so I don't want to talk about it here since I bet there is absolutely nothing new about racism right now. But another message might also be \"who has the right to be dominant in the ecosystem\". That question is interesting but it doesn't matter until we find some alien or a species  having something close to human intelligence. In the end, that means the author has his/her own theories and questions but don't dare to give an answers.\
The flaws in this anime was how it confuses the audience by skipping some important parts and using those parts as flashbacks. It would also be a lot better if they show how did Saki led the village. The tainted cats are still alive and still being used. But did Saki stopped the program to control the village's  mind and memories? The thing I was looking the most foward how that society can be changed to become a more of a true Utopia rather than the current. But that was never shown sadly. Once again that means the author does not know how an Utopia would work, but it's natural not to know lol.\

    Shin Sekai Yori is the most tragic tale of wasted potential I have ever seen.\
The setting is I think not only the most interesting setting in anime, but the most interesting idea.  It has taken one simple concept : 'people can change the world with their psychic powers', and done all sorts of things with it, from the effects it's had on society to balloon dogs to Tokyo.  \
In the end, though, the setting serves as a backdrop.  It's somewhat relevant throughout the first half of the anime, and the parts where they learn about the setting are the best parts of\
          \
        the anime despite a heavy reliance on infodumps.  After all, it wouldn't have been easy to get the history of humanity across without infodumping.\
But from there the story goes off in other directions, focusing on the theme of fantasy racism rather than any of the incredibly interesting questions that arise from the premise.  There are some twists, but fundamentally it tells a simple story which uses the fascinating setting's elements as plot devices but does not really explore them, and the 'terrifying villain' is no scarier and has no more impact than a simple 'monster too powerful for anyone to fight' would have in any other series.\
None of these problems are helped by the frankly awful cast of characters.  Squealer is alright; he's interesting but his status as not-a-viewpoint-character limits how much of his depth can be shown, which would be fine if the rest of the characters held up.  But they don't.  Shun is competent.  Maria is sorta outgoing.  Mamoru is shy and weak-willed.  If other people hadn't made statements about them, I would not even be able to describe a single trait that either Saki or Satoru had; occasionally someone says that 'Saki is inquisitive' but that is hardly demonstrated in the show.\
The art can be interesting sometimes but is very variable in quality.  One of the early episodes - I think episode 3, but I'm not sure - had a noticeable dip in overall art quality, and the character designs and art style in which the characters were drawn just weren't great overall.  The backgrounds were frequently good, though.\
The first ending was awesome, the second was good.  I don't exactly recall the OST, but I remember liking it.  Music is one of the strong points of Shin Sekai Yori.\

    Hello everyone this are Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and welcome too my next MVM Entertainment review.\
For this one we are taking a look at Shineseki Yori/ From the New World.\
With that out the way let us begin.\
Story.\
The story of Shineskai Yori are set in a version of japan around the thousand years in the future. Overtime humans have evolved and now they contained the power of some form of telekinesis.  The people are living theyre peacefully in there utopia society. Theyre using humanoid brad known as muster rats too do they labor for them.\
Shineseki Yori inderdous five children Maria Mamarou, Saki, Shun and Satrou they\
          \
        befall them as they grow up discovering more and more about there seemingly perfect society and learning more about themselves in the process.\
I can’t say anything more about the story because it will give away major spoilers because this are one of those animes that you don’t want too be spoiled at any cost. That are because Shineseki Yori are a masterpiece at foreshadowing.\
Now before I dive into the characters of Shinsekai Yori am going too address the world building.\
You see world building are very important in fictional because not only it makes the live of the characters feel alive and interesting but it makes youre world have a theme and purpose of existing.\
In anime form theyre should be least decent too great world building in anime genres such as fantasy, steampunk, mecha, history, game, adventure, senien, shouens, post-apocalyptic and action.\
How does this relate too Shinsekai Yori?\
Shinsekai Yori has the best world building I have seen in anime fiction.\
Not only the world are very well explored from the monster races, showing the atmosphere of each location in perfect detail how the games works when using the power telekinesis, but even minor things such a fallen leafs, objects and scenery have a purpose and theme that makes the world of Shinsekai yori believable.\
Everything you see in Shinsekai Yori has a purpose and a theme behind it.\
One of more thing that I want too mention in the story and world-building part of Shinsekai yori are episode 4 for Shinsekai Yori because not only it has great use of heavy dialogue but it combines the world building and heavy dialogue together in a visual format meaning you will see the world being explored visually while the heavy dialogue are explaining the world in great detail. You may not understand everything the first time but after you watch the same episode two too three times you will finally understand it.\
Overall the story of Shinsekai Yori are such a masterpiece in the terms of its content, foreshadowing and world-building\
10/10\
Characters.\
\
If you guys don’t know I prefer a character driven narrative over a story because how can youre story function without good or decent character. Unfortunately, Shinsekai Yori main characters are kinda of a mix bag.\
First up we have Saki whom are our main female lead in this entire story. She’s one of the better characters in the story and she has great character development not too mention a well written one\
Next up are Satrou whom are my favorite character in Shinsekai Yori.\
Am not going too spoiler progression for this characters but seeing how he changes as he grows older are very interesting too watch. He starts off as youre everyday joker that likes too mess around with people than greatly evolves into someone whom takes his morals and opinions seriously as he becomes an adult.\
Overall I really liked his character growth in the series that makes him my favourite character in the series.\
Next we have Shun.\
In my opinion he was one of the weaker characters in the show because he was kinda underdeveloped. I will admit he has a great role in the story which I won’t spoil and has decent enough character development. But the end of the day he was still kinda of an underdeveloped character despite him being a likeable character on screen.\
Next up are Maria.\
Am personally mixed with her because while she are a very important in the story but her characterization was rather weak at some points but unlike our next character am going too mention she are a likeable and enjoyable character too watch on screen.\
Lastly we have Mamoaru whom are easily me least favourite character of Shinsekai Yori.\
Too be honest he was an annoying character in general. Like Shun he has an important role in the story but like with Saki he’s characterization was not that good. On top of that he’s whiny personalty really made this character annoying too watch.\
Overall Mamoaru are an annoying character that I don’t like and he was the second weakest thing of Shinsekai Yori besides the visuals which I will get in too an it.\
The side characters are fine for what they were but theyre was one standout character that I can’t talk about due too spoiler’s but all I can say he are a very interesting multi dimension villain that I ended up sympathising which are something a villain hasn’t been able too do in quite some time.\
Overall while the characters of Shinsekai Yori are not worthless it was honestly hard too sympathies with few of the characters due too the bland and annoying personalities. Least the most characters of Shinsekai Yori were likeable and enjoyable too some degree.\

Ah Shinsekai Yori why do you have inconstant visuals. Done by A1 Pictures the same studio that gave Fairy Tail, Black Butler, Erased, Shigatsu and Sword Art Online and it’s really sad too say this but the visuals were kinda poor in some areas.\
I may heavily dislike Sword Art Online for having terrible arcs, bad world building, awful characterisation too the characters but something that I cannot delay that it was animated pretty well. In fact, the second half of SAO airing at the same as the first half of Shinsekai Yori and trust me it tells. Back too the visually the character designs have a lack of shadow and they look really flat. Also, the lack of colouring on the character designs made them look rather dull.\
The background design look decent with some detail on the atmosphere but theyre nothing too write home about. The lighting for the most part are really good and it makes some scenes look great.  Episodes 5 and 10 in my opinion have some of the worst animation I have ever seen in modern anime period. The textures were weird the character designs were changed for the worst and the cinematography are just really bad. Theyre were too, many close-up shots too the point where you can’t even tell what are happening.\
Overall the visuals were decent at best and terrible at worst. 6/10.\
Sound.\
The soundtrack for Shinsekai Yori are great. I adore how it manages too make everything sound throw and ominous using a great variety of instruments that creepy child choir. Not too mention ever track from this show really fits the tone and world building that this show has too offer.\
Surprisingly Shinsekai Yori doesn’t have an opening but it has two ending themes. The first ending theme it’s a really calm catchy piece that I adore not too mention the animation are beautiful. The second ending are fine and a good listen but the first ending theme are superior in every way.\
Now for dub or sub and too be honest I found the dub for the decent. Sure, some of the voices were rather bland but for the most part they did a pretty decent job with the roles.\
This are kinda surprising because most Sentai Flimworks dubs I seen are either mediocre or bad. Theyre were a few exceptions every now and then but those chances are very slim.\
In general, Shinsekai Yori has a decent dub but the sub are much better for this case.\
9/10\
Final Thoughts.\
Despite me bring kinda harsh at points during the review I love this anime.\
Yes, it has major flaws in the terms of characterization for some charters and the visuals not very inconstant. The story of Shinsekai Yori are just amazing that some of the best foreshadowing I have ever seen in anime and the world-building of Shinsekai Yori are just wonderful. Not too mention the soundtrack are amazing and well thought out.\
Overall I really love this anime despite with flaws.\
I give Shinsekai Yori/ From the New World a 8.5/10\

    It is without a doubt that Shinsekai Yori leaves you in a state of relief. It takes a path astray and fearlessly tackles human nature/values.\
I feel that people are not giving this anime a chance. The first half of Shinsekai Yori has a notably slow start and because of this, a number of people have dropped the series. I too, make up a portion of the people who were not too fond of the sedate start. Do note, however, that most of the scenes played in the early episodes has some sort of significance in the latter half of the series. Despite the snail-paced start,\
          \
        I pulled through, finished the series, and Shinsekai Yori is now my favourite anime. Also it’s better than if it had a remarkably good start but having the rest of the series drenched in a pile of shit.\
Shinsekai Yori definitely packs a punch in terms of arousing your emotions. You’re guaranteed to direct your anger at certain individuals due to their unjustifiable actions. There are also moments of pleasure in which the anime takes an intermission from the dark and serious atmosphere. Lastly, you just can’t help but sympathize towards some of the characters due to a predicament of some sort. Although were given the perspective and focus of only the main protagonist, Saki, you’ll find yourself captivated by some of the other characters.\
What makes this anime so great is the plot, which truly is mind-boggling. Shinsekai Yori's take on the future is really creative. It seems unrealistic in a sense (villages and such), but it makes sense as to how everything came to be. Again, after the slow start, were given back-to-back episodes in which the plot just continues to develop and buildup for the climax. \
Shinsekai Yori is a series that delivers a deep and meaningful message. It has one of the most well done finales that wraps everything ever so nicely; the way it concluded could not have been any better. Shinsekai Yori is arguably the best anime of 2012 and can be considered a masterpiece to some extent.\

    Shinsekai Yori (From the New World in English) was recommended to me with the words \"Psychic pansexuals in a dystopian future with rat people and good music and you will cry,\" which ended up describing the series far better than I thought it would. This anime was definitely one that pulled me in from the get-go, and kept me interested the whole way through.\
Story: 9/10\
Though this show starts off with a vague beginning, things don't take long to pick up and get good. This story centers around five characters and spans many years, so we get to see the characters grow from mere children to\
          \
        independent adults.\
Shinsekai Yori features an interesting tale of people who have psychic powers as well as the strange rat people that worship them as gods. Though this show takes place in Japan, the worldbuilding is astounding. This takes place far in the future, yet we get to see exactly how we ended up in this isolated country where utopian/dystopian governments reign. We also get to see the organization of the simpler-minded monster rats (I watched the dub, so I know them as monster rats, but in the Japanese they're called queerats). Though they lead a simple life, the inner workings of their government system impressed me. They're not quite as dumb as the characters think they are.\
This show heads along at a fair pace: not too fast and not too slow. It also feels as if it's holding its breath for something larger to happen later on (and happen it does, but I'll avoid talking about it because of spoilers).\
One of the things this show really excelled in was the foreshadowing. Early on, it gives you all the keys you need to unlock the plot twists coming later, yet you never notice it until it happens. This show takes on the nature of a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. It's definitely worth a rewatch (though I haven't rewatched it myself yet), just to see exactly how well the show foretold its own ending.\
Another really amazing thing about the show was the suspense factor. This show creates a really interesting atmosphere that draws you into the story and characters, to the point where you almost feel like you're there with them. One especially notable suspense part was when two characters are hiding from something unknown. At this point, all music stops and it goes completely silent, where all the characters can do is simply hold their breath. I found myself holding my breath too, and staring wide-eyed at the screen until the moment passed.\
At the end, the show finally releases the suspense it's been holding you in since the beginning and throws out a plot twist that makes the rest of the story pieces suddenly click into place. Once it's revealed, you wonder how you didn't think of this before, since as I said, it was foreshadowed right from the start.\
There were some negative aspects of the story, though. It's not perfect by any means, but it's still really darn good. \
One of the main things that bothered me was sometimes the show would create suspense for things but not really capitalize on them, or resolve them in a completely different way than what they seemed to be doing.\
For example, there was the dystopian government, which I guess didn't really turn out to be dystopian at all. There was talk of punishment, but that didn't really ever happen in a definitive way. There was also one part which made me say \"Oh shit\" out loud, but didn't end up resulting in anything.\
In addition to that, the show has an infodump at one point that didn't result in what they hinted it would, but it was a creatively done infodump, so I'll let it slide.\
I felt like the problems were caused by the show getting too involved in other things to properly resolve some confusion in the beginning, but the positives of the story overwhelmingly outshine the negatives.\
Shinsekai Yori definitely has a subtle note about the darker side of humanity, and is a fairly simple, linear tale about five kids learning the truth of their world. And one by one, they start to disappear.\
Art: 7/10\
This show was airing at around the same time as Sword Art Online, another A-1 production, so it missed out on the spotlight and the budget for the most part. The characters lack shading and the eyes are mostly one color, so it may take some time to get used to the flat-color look. In terms of animation, it's above average but not anything spectacular. However, it gets a 7 rather than a 6 because some of the scenery shots were simply gorgeous. A couple that stood out to me were a sky full of stars in one of the early episodes and a sunset backdrop in the second ED, but there were a lot of good background pictures. Sometimes the backgrounds looked a little sloppy and too obviously hastily painted in, but for the most part they were very colorful and detailed.\
I also liked the look of the monster rats, who were grotesque creatures with bulging eyes and clawed hands. Even though they weren't pretty to look at, I have to give the show props for creating these ugly creatures because they do look a lot like mutated naked mole rats, the creatures they're based off of.\
Sound: 8/10\
An interesting thing about Shinsekai Yori is that it doesn't have an opening. The show simply jumps right into the episode and places the opening credits alongside the action. It may be weird to get used to, but I think it suits this anime since I can't really imagine it with a peppy J-rock number as per the norm.\
This show does have ending songs though, both of which were good but not legendary.\
The OST of this show was good. It wasn't anything super amazing or unique, but in terms of using it effectively, the show rose above and beyond. They also knew when less is more, stopping the music at key parts to let the scene carry itself. \
This OST doesn't demand to be noticed. It's there and compliments the scene from behind, adding to the mood and effect without overshadowing the other aspects.\
As I mentioned earlier, I watched the dub of this show. This show was dubbed by ADV, and I have a strong dislike for ADV dubs in general, since they range from mediocre to just plain bad (other ADV dubs include Angel Beats, No. 6, and Penguindrum). For this show, I thought the voice acting in general was good and improved later, but I was not a fan of some of the casting choices (though I don't think ADV has a huge range of voice actors to pick anyway, which is why they end up reusing so many).\
I think the standout dub voice for me is Squealer, the ambiguous monster rat that keeps appearing throughout the story. He has a nasal, unpleasant-sounding voice that I think perfectly suits the character. It may not be the nicest on the ears, but it's definitely a realistic voice (in my opinion) for this type of creature.\
I haven't seen any of the original Japanese of this show, but I'm sure it's better than the dub. I'd recommend watching this show subbed, unless you really, really want to watch it dubbed.\
Characters: 8/10\
The story revolves around five kids who grow into adults. These five kids all have their own personalities and are interesting in their own ways, but we don't really get to see much of what happened to them before the show started. I would have liked to see a little more of their childhood, since it seems like they've known each other for a while.\
There's also the pansexuals aspect, which I didn't have a problem with, though some people may be turned off by it (There's a reason for that, I promise. It doesn't turn into a yaoi/yuri anime and it's not shown in a fetishized way). In the beginning, there's some hinted (boy/girl) relationships between characters, but nothing for certain. Then there's a timeskip, and we suddenly see a lot of boy/boy and girl/girl. That was a rather sudden change for me, but as I said it has a specific reason.\
The reason the characters category is getting an 8 out of 10 rather than a 9 is because there wasn't much character development, aside from the main character Saki. She grew and changed a lot during the show, while her four friends were rather sidelined until important things happened to them. Overall though, the characters were very well done and I really enjoyed seeing the growth Saki and her friends underwent.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
My enjoyment score is partially based on how quickly I watch a show, and I think I broke some kind of record with this one. The first day I watched the first 14 episodes, and watched the remaining 11 the day after. The show was so addictive that I wanted to know more and more, and before I knew it I was halfway through.\
Besides how quickly I watched it, I thoroughly enjoyed the simple, linear, yet unique story, the effective background music, and the genius use of foreshadowing. This was definitely one that captured my interest the whole way through and did not get boring at all.\
Overall: 9/10\
As I said, some things that the show fell flat on, but by and large an interesting and unique tale about where humanity would go if given a certain power. I definitely recommend watching/rewatching this show, since I loved it, and I think most people will too.\
I've said enough now. It's time for you to watch an anime about psychic pansexuals in a dystopian future with rat people and good music and crying.\

    Tens, tens all across the boards, I was quite excited to see this anime especially with its popularity on MAL and its popularity in the reviews, aside from this review that I am currently writing, all of them consisted of a positive review. I was impressed, not even one person gave Shinsekai Yori a low score...I guess that I am going to have to be that person. \
Shinsekai Yori is an anime adapted from its novel counterpart that released in 2012, after seeing its positive praise I decided to pick it up, so here are my thoughts on the anime. \
Story \
If you're reading this\
          \
        and you've also read the synopsis here my suggestion is to read this or on some wiki because the synopsis IS NO WHERE NEAR THE ACTUAL PLOT, I am serious. From reading it you'd assume it's probably some mystery  or something at least I did but nope the anime is doesn't revolve around that 'rumour' that is mentioned. \
Shinsekai Yori is set 1000 years into the future where humans have developed psychic abilities known as cantus. Due to this nature society has evolved and would seem perfect at least so it seems but of course there is more than meets the eye.  The anime then progresses over the lives of our characters and explore many themes that surround it. Its execution is more arc based as the story progresses in small plot elements that will later progress throughout the show. While I don't think is not a bad idea the general execution is well tiresome. Shinsekai Yori is a heavy exposition anime it requires a lot of attention to every detail so it may not exactly be your cup tea if you're not into heavy talking and while you're reading this thinking that I am incompetent to fully engage, I really did try with this anime. I wanted to love it but it was incredibly difficult. One of the problems was essentially the plot points in the show, a lot of them and I mean a lot are only brought up due to convenience when instead these plot points should've been brought up often. Another reason why I couldn't fully enjoy the story is because it develops on arcs where I just wasn't fully interested mainly because some arcs tend to fall astray from the main synopsis of the show or into characters which I never fully cared for. While the anime does explore themes it's only really the tip of the iceberg for example the ever so popular topic of same-sex relationships is explored and what I mean is essentially that people are just gay. The relationships or the themes is not deepening or explored fully it just happens, not that it's entirely a problem but with people praising it's use of theme-ing I couldn't really see it because what Shinsekai Yori is showing me makes it no different from any other relationship.  Also more personally but the plot twists to me in this show were incredibly predictable. \
Characters \
In terms of characters not many of them are interesting to begin with. The story revolves around a group of characters with Saki Watanabe being the main character, one of the major problems I had with her is essentially how much praise she got...for being normal. Everyone and I mean everyone in the show comments on how much potential she has or how amazing she is but all she does is just stands there, there are times where she is somewhat useful but she doesn't do many things interesting. The rest of the characters aren't exactly gold either, most of them don't hold much interest or exactly deepen the plot. There's very little care for characters in the show not until the later parts of the show but it's only briefly, it's quite the shame because with Shinsekai Yori deepening towards its society you could do some good character building but unfortunately the characters are just there, you could replace the characters with anyone and it wouldn't impact the show in the slightest. \
Presentation\
The art style is pretty good except for one design of characters that I don't particularly like, that being the queerats. They can die but the rest of the animation and art is pretty good to look at, I didn't mind it. The soundtrack of the anime is pretty good, I quite liked it one of the few anime osts that I have indeed noticed and thought it was pretty good and despite this anime not having an opening the ending theme for it is pretty awesome. \
Conclusion \
Personally Shinsekai Yori is an overrated anime to me. Its plot is all over the place and is pretentious by attempting to explore many themes present in our society today but it's not a good attempt to me especially with its bland characters. Maybe there's just something wrong with me because a lot of people love this anime but personally I just couldn't enjoy it which leaves me with my final rating of this anime being 6. ",

    What are humans? What are monsters? What do we really fear? What puts us above other forms of life? What makes us right and others wrong? To what extent should we defend humanity, or protect the fundamentals of our society? What should we do if one poses as a grave threat, but no crime has yet been committed? But what if the person is an innocent child and the threat is the extinction of humans? How should we judge indications that may lead to such a fate? Were humans even meant to possess such power?...\
These are the kinds of questions asked in series such as\
          \
        Monster, Ergo Proxy, Texhnolyze Psycho-Pass, and several others. But none of these go as far this series. Shinsekai yori poses question after question after question constantly in nearly every episode.\
But don't worry, it isn't something that is difficult to get through! This isn't one of those series that requires a PhD and intense concentration to fully understand. Shinsekai yori is easy to sit back and watch. Things are well explained, but there is still plenty of room for you to contemplate the ideas presented to you.\
The title of this anime is shared with Antonín Dvořák's 9th Symphony: \"From the New World,\" a recurring motif in the series. There is no \"OP\" in this series, but most episodes play the same song during the opening credits scenes. This makes for the perfect mood setting that fits the series. The artwork is very well done. The outdoor scenes are always beautiful. The lighting is perfect to fit the mood of every scene.\
The story follows the life of the main character, Saki, from age 12 to 26. Saki's friends mentioned in the synopsis make up a delightful cast. All their personalities fit well with the overall mood and story. The characters, including some supporting characters, are very well developed and are easy to get attached to.\
Sometimes the story can be quite brisk, but it is not difficult to keep up. For the most part, the series is very appropriately paced. This is one of those series that you have to wait until the very end for all your questions to be answered. Actually, it is quite surprising how early some secrets were revealed. But with that, many secrets were kept, and more and more questions were asked.\
This is why MAL needs to allow a limited number of 11/10 ratings. Shiksekai yori instantly became my 2nd favorite anime series. I got watery eyes several times. But about 5 seconds after the final episode ended was the first time I cried watching anime.\

    Wow, am I glad that they finally changed the picture for this anime. The one they had previously was so misleading! I honestly thought this anime would be a cutesy school life kind of anime (mostly only because of the picture) and was I wrong. I'm glad I was though!\
Story (10): I would say the story is complex, but in a good way. It's definitely interesting for sure. It's bizarre, dark, and thought compelling. I loved the unique take on the Utopian society that revolves around this story. There were times I was touched, there were moments I cried, most of all, there were moments\
          \
        I found myself saying \"What the f***!\" It was nothing at all like what I expected it to be, it was so much better! \
Art (10): The art was fantastic. I loved the colors, how fluid it was and how beautiful (or in certain cases grotesque) things were. \
Sound (10): I have to say, the voice actors did fantastic jobs with their characters. The sound effects were also great. The biggest thing I have to commend is the music, it was absolutely lovely. I especially loved the first ending, such a great song. \
Character (10): Probably my most favorite thing about this anime were the characters, human and non human. Since the story goes in stages of the main heroine Saki's life, it's amazing to see how everything develops among them. There's so much unexpected twists and turns, and it was great seeing how each of the characters progressed. It's funny to me that Saki wasn't my favorite character, but to be honest, I love that it was all told in her perspective. I feel that the characters really do a great job with drawing you into the whole plot.\
I enjoyed this series significantly. Right after I finished watching it, I went and recommended it to my friends who also enjoyed it as well. I even went on to read the novel version. \
Overall, this anime is great. I'm probably going to rewatch it in the future. I know all I did was praise it, but I honestly did not have anything bad to say about this anime. I won't go as far as saying it was perfect, I'm sure it had it's flaws, but to me I didn't find any worth giving bad criticisms. I will admit that I did not review this right after watching it, I actually watched it quite some time ago, but to this day, the impression it left on me was a great one. So definitely give this anime a chance if you haven't already!\

    A community filled with perfection or merely hiding the flaws. That's simply the main story. Simple yet smart. It's those little ideas you see in the anime that will actually change your perspective of the anime.\
During the season Shinsekai Yori came out, I wasn't really enticed by its story the first time I saw it with all the other flashy animes coming together such as Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and Zetsuen no Tempest -- so in the end, I overlooked Shinsekai Yori.. Oh man was I stupid.\
Story: 10\
There are a lot of new words that were flashed in Shinsekai Yori and missing out the meaning of\
          \
        these things -- you'll probably get lost in the story line. The level of the anime's climax starts real slow and by 3/4 of the anime the anime starts to evolve into a much serious anime. That 1/4 of the anime, which is nearly at the end, -- it may be small -- but that small portion did escalate my rating for the anime and I'm telling you, my starting rating for the anime wasn't that all too good. The story of the anime was the main attraction of the anime. It may start to confuse you at first (like I experienced) but if you are patient and would like to see the end of it -- the anime starts to create an excitement that is a hundred times more as to what the first episode gave. Oh and the cliff hangers of Shinsekai Yori was the best kind of cliff hangers I've ever watched. From a village who seeks for perfection to something that is actually just a distraction of the truth. Saki with her group of friends are then determined to know more of the truth. Sounds really normal but then the execution of the story is flawless.\
There's always something unique about those stories you could relate or you could see as something real. Stories like Shinsekai Yori would always feel special or more connected. Shinsekai Yori is unique in terms of the generic anime story lines and that's probably what made me love about the anime.\
Art: 7\
The art is the most talked about in Shinsekai Yori I would guess. The first time I saw episode 1 of Shinsekai Yori it was pure stunning and beautiful that I was even thinking this was beautiful to be edited. Episode 1's art was amazing that it wasn't the story of the anime that kept me want to watch the next episode but it was the art. The first episodes were damn beautiful. I was so enticed by the art -- I was even thinking this could be much better than Guilty Crown's animation.. Then, episode 5 came out.\
I did stop watching Shinsekai Yori because of the animation. I couldn't help it. I didn't like it one bit. I always remembered episode 5 -- \"the start of the weird animation\". I couldn't help myself continue watching Shinsekai Yori because it was difficult with all the weird angles, the horrible focus, the unmatched emotions to the character's' dialogues and the proportions were awkward. It took me months till I started to watch Shinsekai Yori again and once I started to continue watching it -- the art wasn't much likely to bother anymore. Yes, the art was weird but I did see the importance of the story and how the story pushed this anime to the top without the help of any other element but the plot in itself.\
Sound: 9\
I guess the low cut budget of the anime made also low use of sounds and little flashy OSTs but the sound effects and the music were dead on amazing, epic and very grand -- it gives me goosebumps. Little music was perfect for this anime. I can't help but feel that the serious music was making this anime such of high class. The dubbing though was flawless most especially squealer's and the queerats'.\
Character: 9\
Not much of any character development but if you're a Shinsekai Yori fan like me -- you'll feel so attached to each of the characters. I know I did. When the anime ended, I was so lost. I wanted the characters all to myself. I felt like something was missing in me. The characters had all different personalities -- strong ones, calm ones and even paranoid ones so the characters were pretty much helping to ease the complicated story.\
Enjoyment: 10\
\"Very complex.\" That was what I thought. I wasn't enjoying the first episodes to be honest because there were so much information that were coming and not much anything to do with the present episodes. I was really struggling to get the hype of the anime and the urge to finish it. But later on, when the episodes were nearing to its episode 20s, the story gets more flashy and those unwanted information I got during the first episodes suddenly turned into something useful and I was able to enjoy the whole series that easily. I don't even know why I enjoyed the anime so much when I was nearly confused with its first episodes but as I go on the climax of the anime made this anime really exciting and stunning.\
Over-all: 10\
With all the flaws, I still say the story made such great influence in the anime that those animation flaws didn't matter anymore. It was creative in every other way. Shinsekai Yori gives more than what a usual anime can present.\
My only tip for you for this anime is to watch it all throughout the end and just keep on understanding the situation from the first episode till the last. It's amazing how you'll get by with it.\

    let's see. to be completely honest, i was very disappointed in this. although in this animes defense i went into watching it expecting to see something that this anime is not.\
a friend recommended this anime to me a while back, and the only thing he told me about it was \"its about telekinetics\" witch i absolutely love. i adore telekinesis in just about anything, especially anime. now, that is probably why i didn't enjoy this anime as much as other people. i went into it expecting to see what i wanted to see instead of watching the anime for what it is. what made me\
          \
        watch the series in the first place was the first episode. as a mater of fact. the first few minutes of the first episode entranced me. it was perfect to say the least. the visuals, the sound, everything about those first few minutes caught my attention, sadly though, that same intro ruined this anime. that intro set my expectations pretty high, making the rest of Shinsekai yori a huge disappointment.\
Story: 5/10\
in many review of this anime people usually put 10/10 or 9/10 etc... but i just don't see it. like i was talking about the intro set a standard the rest of the anime failed to reach. in the first episode of shinsekai yori, it stars off with very mellow dramatic music and a boy. in the intro this boy is going around the neighborhood absolutely wrecking the place using his TK (telekinesis) killing people left and right, kicking the army's ass without a care in the world. so i assume the rest of this anime will be about TK users VS the world. WRONG! this anime is about TK users VS giant mutant cats and giant mutated naked mole rats. thats right, the main antagonistic force throughout the entirety of this anime, are a bunch of over sized talking giant naked mole rats. i found this, to say the least, horribly disappointing to the point where it was almost laughable. now, this aside, the over all story in itself is pretty \"meh\" it is hard to descripe without giving away spoilers. so for now the only way i could possibly describe the story of this anime is \"meh\"  \
art: 9/10 \
the art style used in this anime is pretty interesting. they use a mix of very subtle gradients and an interesting blend of color. although there is one odd episode where the art changes to a more \"cashern sins\" style and then goes back to normal in the next episode.\
sound: 9/10 \
the soundtrack used in this anime caught me off guard. in a good way. although there is no one track i feel like listening to outside of the anime itself. the music used flowed flawlessly with what was going on in the anime and enveloped you into the universe itself.\
character: 8/10\
characters in this anime are all very unique in their own way. each character has a defining personality, using a similar structure as any other anime but with enough originality that they become their own. there is a slight lack in character development and on occasion some characters will just vanish (pun :D)\
enjoyment: 5/10\
like i have said. the first episode set a standard the rest of this anime never met. i watched each episode hoping that maybe one of them will have the same feel as the intro did. sadly i finished the anime without once seeing the episode i had been weighting for. i was left disappointed, on top of that the paramount ending made me more upset with this series. \
overall: 5/10\
although every other aspect of this anime was brilliant, i felt the plot fell short after the first 2 minutes of the first episode and left me horribly disappointed. i would only recommend this to people who enjoy watching people who have TK waste it away snow boarding, boating and fighting giant naked mole rats.  \

    “Shinsekai Yori” which translates to “From the New World.”\
There is something ominous about this anime. One can’t help but wonder, if what was shown there might actually become a reality in the distant future. It has a powerful vibe and I can’t help but feel Wells, Orwell and Huxley having a combined influence on the story structure; as far as utopia with mind-control, behavior control, and superiority among humans with huge potential differences are considered.\
You just sit there and let the anime sweep you alongside it, everything in the anime are perfectly blended, and at one point you’d feel whether the mangaka is actually from\
          \
        the future, writing out a story according to his experiences. Not only is the story deep, thought-provoking and frightening, it also shows a much darker side of humanity; what are the consequences of absolute law? What are consequences of secrecy in a society at large? How much of truth is there in the old saying “curiosity killed the cat?” How far are we willing to go to protect humanity? Why are we the only beings with sentient minds?\
So, what makes this anime such a grand piece, or put more aptly, an unappreciated gem.\
Animation – 9/10\
The animation is done by A-1 Pictures, and well, they outdid themselves again. There is always a forbearing dread that something is lurking in the corner, the animation is brilliant, it shows the darkness with color, yet the scenery with vivid energy, the villages with tranquil, and the new creatures evolved in a thousand years so realistically, one would actually be inclined to believe that they might someday come around. The color achieves so much.\
Characters – 9/10\
Hail redheads!\
One of the things that I loved about this anime was the characters. The characters were just…..beautiful. For such an ominous story to flow one needs characters, and the characters here do justice to the story. They are shown in three points of their lives; childhood, teenage and adulthood. One might remain skeptical about whether character development through three stages of growth is possible in a 25-episode anime, but trust me, Shinsekai Yori pulls it off magnificently, this can be seen clearly with characters like Saki and Satoru, with Saki being the narrator, and the main character of the series. You feel at one with them; there was a time when I was actually saying to myself; “Please let these two survive.” And not only the main characters, even despicable characters like Squealer show magnificent character development. But then again, who am I to call Squealer despicable?\
Did I mention I’m completely biased towards Maria?\
Music – 9/10\
Oh. My. God.\
The music can be called something that is truly “beautiful.” You can’t help but fall in love with the haunting melody, chilling composition and how effortlessly, the music complements the story. It’s like two very dark components kiss.\
Story – 9/10\
A millennium from now, in Japan, exists a utopia. The protagonist, Saki Watanabe, lives in an idyllic village barred from the outside world. Her world is ruled by the people who possess the \"gods' power\" of psychokinesis. After finally obtaining her own powers, Saki enters the Zenjin Academy to train along with five other children: Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano.\
Not all is as it seems, however. In this utopian village, strange rumors about a monstrous cat that abducts children circulate, and students are said to disappear from the academy. The world and its history are much darker than they appear and humanity is on the verge of collapse.\
Well, that’s how the synopsis is described, and telling anything further would be spoilers.\
Entertainment – 9.5/10\
I binge-watched, in a hospital room, overnight, while munching on spice-less hospital food; that is how much I enjoyed this show. This is not for a casual watch, or for people who’re easily bored or looking for cheap laughs or easy sexual gratification. If you’re looking for a paced thought-provoking story, driving characters and won’t compromise on sound and visuals, this one is for you.\
In short, Shinsekai Yori is a beautiful yet underappreciated gem in the current anime scene, where people are more focused on anime with food for the body rather than food for the mind.\

    Shinsekai Yori is a great intelligent, psychological anime which starts out somewhat confusing but still interesting right from the beginning though it doesn’t really get going until about episode 3 or 4. This is the story of civilization in Japan about 1000 years ahead of the present day and in the same universe as the one we live in (aside from the whole “anime” thing). In the future, everyone can use “Cantus,” an ability (one of my favorite anime powers ever) that can do everything from repairing glass jars to levitating people to setting things on fire to killing things, though there are many limitations\
          \
        on that last part. It follows 5 kids who you get to see grow up, mature, and fight battles to protect humanity while at the same time suffering many tragedies. This show is much heavier on drama than comedy, so be warned that while it isn’t exactly an After Story or AnoHana it is still a very emotional show that delves into many psychological aspects of the characters as well as our whole outlook on humanity and what we all are. One thing you may have heard about this show is the one yaoi scene and the three or four yuri scenes (none of which have anything more than kissing). These actually have a purpose in the show and the reason is explained several episodes prior to any of these scenes. I didn’t find them distracting in the least while watching this show.\
Before I get started I’ll just say that I give Shinsekai Yori (From the New World in English) a 10/10 in every category because I just can’t think of a reason to give it a 9/10 or anything lower. I would definitely say this show is the best anime of 2012 (at least of what I’ve seen).\
Story: I really can’t say much about the story, since almost anything I say would give away spoilers. Let me just say though that Shinsekai Yori keeps you guessing about what will come next. It has many clever and surprising plot twists and at the beginning of this series you will have no idea how this show is going to end. The ending, I think, is well done though I have heard some people say they thought it was rushed a little.\
Art: The art is interesting. At first I wasn’t so sure it was worthy of a perfect score, but after watching the whole series I believe this is the best rating. The landscape, the character designs, and some of the more psychological scenes are well animated and nice to look at. With the characters growing up during the show, it’s nice to see that at each age they still look just as good as they did when they were younger.\
Sound: The soundtrack is one of the best I’ve ever heard. Despite not having any opening themes, there are two good ending themes with the first being my favorite of the two. While Squealer’s voice did annoy me at first, I got used to it as the show went on. The rest of the voice actors do a great job portraying the emotion of their characters.\
Characters: The five main characters are Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun. Unfortunately, like the story, I can’t really tell you much about them so I’ll just give my thoughts on them instead. Watanabe Saki is the protagonist and the story is told from her POV. Saki is a fantastic protagonist and probably my favorite female protagonist. Satoru is the main male character and along with Saki tends to act as the leader. Maria acts as the motherly character while Mamoru is the weakest of the characters emotionally and is often scared (for good reason) of getting involved in the trouble the other characters get into. Shun is a very skilled boy who is in line to take over one of the highest positions in the settlement that the characters live in. Aside from these characters there are also two important Queerats (I also saw them called goblin Rats in the subs), Squealer and Kiroumaru. The Queerats look up to the humans as gods and live under them. They come in many different forms but usually they look like short, human-shape naked mole rats. I found Squealer very annoying at first, but towards the end of the series I felt just as many feelings from him as the main characters and I actually grew to like him a lot due to just a couple scenes. Kiroumaru is a taller Queerat from a different tribe than Squealer. In addition to these characters there are many humans that play relatively important roles, but I found most of them more forgettable for the most part since they get less screen time and blend into the crowd more than the above characters though that’s not to say they were boring. Mostly it was just because they were not included in the series until over halfway through it.\
Shinsekai Yori has easily become one of my favorite anime series. One warning I should give is that, this show does have a decent amount of gore especially in the latter half. I also found some scenes were bordering on the horror genre through the use of suspense (again mostly in the latter half). Still I would recommend this to anyone who likes intelligent anime like Death Note or shows that delve into the “are we in the right or wrong” psychological look at humanity like Shiki.\
One final note, I’ll just mention one of my favorite aspects of this show which is how the human race is compared to a colony of bonobos (you'll get it if you watch the show).\

    Where to begin... First of all, I saw this from someone else's recommendation and I got to say: anyone who did not watch this anime definitely should. This anime is one of the few that affected me in real life (another one is Psycho-pass). I chose Shinsekai yori as my first anime review because that is simply how good this anime is. It isn't mainstream and action packed with blazing fights. This anime is on a whole different level than most of the other ones I watched and its unorthodox elements captivated and drew me in the anime even more. It makes you do a\
          \
        lot of thinking and can change what your beliefs are if it is that influential. Once you have seen it, you can't brush it off as another anime that you've watched. It will stick with you and you will ponder about it for a long time. (Some spoilers, but not too much)\
The beginning of the anime started out as creepy and dark, but it did well to build up the suspense and the story later on. It might be a little confusing to understand the plot and the setting of the story but after a few episodes you understand when the story is taking place, how the people get there, and what they are talking about. The story is filled with elements of an utopia, dystopia, murder, adventure, ESP, horror, romance, and others. However, the things that struck me most were the horror parts of the story. The thriller suspense made me shiver and cold sweats were beading down my face. It also made me want to skip some parts of the episodes. \
The story has some time slips with the focus on the protagonist, Saki, and with her, we can see the growth of a child and how she grew up from this world that is beginning to seem twisted in her mind. We can see the influence of the world it has on Saki and her group of friends, as they all begin to change and develop into significant characters. Saki, above all, is the greatest protagonist as you see her growth into an adult and mature mindset. You would assume that this is a world with only humans but you later realize that there is another sentient foreign species that revere the humans as gods. It is also quite interesting that this story introduces the policies and treatment of foreign species, and we can easily reflect that to real life events. As a result, this anime isn't simply superficial but the author of the novel tried to incorporate aspects of the real world to the anime.\
All in all, the art was great, the story fantastic, the music adding to the suspense and thriller, the characters were outstanding (even the nonhumans), and I really, really enjoyed it. 10/10.\
Hope you had fun reading my first review and ultimately see this amazing anime. Shinsekai yori FTW.\

    Topics such as the future of human civilization have been explored many times throughout different mediums, be it novels, scientific textbooks or movies; anime is no exception. Each of these mediums portray different hypothesis and ideas, be it the more predominant option the technologically advanced civilization or a decaying and/or primitive one. Shinsekai Yori defies the first option and focuses on a regressive, primitive civilization centered around a simple lifestyle as villagers.\
~Story~\
The story of Shinsekai Yori is well developed and presented. It takes place in a village barred from the outside world in Japan, a millenia after the current civilization. Humanity is known to posses\
          \
        the power of psychokinesis, also known as the power of the \"Gods\" for coexisting, intelligent species in this underdeveloped world. The narrative follows the main protagonist Saki Watanabe and her close friends, who after obtaining their powers, attend to the Sage Academy to train it. Shinsekai's story starts subtle with exhibiting the daily life of the protagonists, but with mysteries such as abduction and disappearance of children by monstrous cats. Together with the mysteries that surround this village, the audience will begin to appreciate and understand how the world is shaped as the narrative progresses. It is nothing pleasant, in fact, it's dark and obscure.\
As the story develops, the spectator observes Saki's growth from 12 to 26 years of age. Throughout the different incidents that happen in that period, the narrative portrays human nature well: paranoia, isolation, fear of the unknown, egoism, resentment and brain washing, which ultimately shows how humanity didn't evolve at all in the last millenia. Even with experimentation and psychokinesis, humans are still frail and weak. To narrate the story with a good pacing, time skips are introduced to focus on the important parts of the story. This leads to a lack of certain gradual character development I personally like to see. \
Other strong point of Shinsekai Yori is how at every question/mystery that rises, the story hints at the solutions leaving the audience to ponder about it, while ultimately explaining it in detail later on. All is clarified with convincing and realistic facts, such as the coexisting species or different memory wipes the protagonist undergo. This enhances the overall experience and credibility of the story. Nevertheless, some things remained unexplained such the sudden homosexual attraction between the same gender or the origin of psychokinesis; this was however a small drawback.\
~Characters~\
The cast of characters are by no means big; this doesn't mean it's necessary. Some of the main characters are emotionally unstable, with sudden drastic changes in emotion: from being out of control to suddenly calm, or from crying to laughing. This is specially in Saki's case, though being considered strong willed and stable, she sways from one action/emotion to another. Throughout her growth she becomes more mature, but often acts childish later on. Nevertheless, some of her actions represent well the egoistic and doubtful nature humanity tends to have. As the protagonists interact and learn about the mysteries and their environment, the spectator can observe how they develop.\
The supporting cast of Shinsekai Yori fulfilled their purpose very well. There is good variation and development of the coexisting species known as \"Querats\", the so-called \"Karma Demons\", as well as the other humans of the village who provide insight into the history and mysteries behind this new world. Distrust and paranoia is well presented through these.\
~Animation and sound~\
The animation fulfills it purpose, though it is rather lacking in some aspects. The different characters presented are simple in design, and at times were drawn rather lackluster. Other thing to note are that the facials expressions of the characters often didn't match with the emotional state of the characters, leading to a less enjoyable experience. The different species shown are creatively drawn, but again, maybe more detail would be favorable. Nevertheless, the different scenes and backgrounds are well displayed throughout the use of different colours and animation techniques which matches well with the story.\
The voice actors certainly fulfilled their role well, though because of the faulty animation of the character's emotions, didn't fully reach their potential. The soundtracks used are very favourable and matches with the narrative of the story, used to further transmit the atmosphere of the anime and catch the spectators full attention.\
~Enjoyment~\
Shinsekai Yori was overall a fantastic journey representing a primitive and dystopian civilization with a wonderful story and representation of it, while leaving the spectator pondering about the current civilization and beliefs. I personally disliked the main character, which kept me from fully enjoying the anime. Though it has a slow start, the pacing improves to match the events that take place. I'd fully recommend Shinsekai Yori to anyone with an interest in the dystopian or mystery genre, or want an other perspective on the future of humanity, as done with titles such as Texhonolyze or Psycho-Pass.\

    Shinsekai Yori is one of those unique works .\
It is divided into 3 parts , childhood, adolescence and adulthood of the characters.\
Shinsekai Yori tells us about the war , is like a history lesson. Teaches us about the innocence of when we are children , sexuality and its discovery in adolescence and the responsibility we have in adulthood. That human beings can be provided with a pure love beyond the barriers of time and life. But it may also be able to conduct such acts of perversity ...\
I think that one of the focus that makes Shinsekai Yori a masterpiece is the question: what makes\
          \
        us human? Why human when have so much power in his own hands only search for chaos? Why can we just love each other with that pure love just when we were only little childs? Why the world can be so cruel and beautiful at the same time? Why?\
If you think about love, about life, about the world itself, go and watch it. \
The only problem with this anime, is that there aren't any like this.\

    Shinsekai Yori presents a startling commentary on humanity and the structure of society. Its countless warnings, the cautionary tale of what our power means, and the juxtaposition of a futuristic and slightly fantastical world with our own are aspects that I would never have put within the ability of anime to convey. The intricacies of the plot left me in awe; though it seems incredibly confusing at first, it’s when the pieces of the puzzle start to come together that Shinsekai Yori attains its greatest effect. The realization of the truths that are very much, and very frighteningly, applicable to our own world left me\
          \
        in awe. \
It looks innocent, but it’s extremely dark and psychological, and gives you a lot to think about. After watching this anime, I had to take a week to gather my thoughts coherently enough to write this review. It challenges not simply society, but what makes us human. I never thought I would be saying this about an anime, but Shinsekai Yori completely changed my outlook on the world. And it was amazing. \
If you’ve read some of my reviews, you know that the path diverges here. A bit like a choose-your-own-adventure, perhaps? If you like flowing text, keep reading; if you prefer numbers, scroll down further. Or read both, if you like, but information can and will be repeated between categories. Without further ado, here’s my attempt at reviewing an anime that I will never completely understand. \
-\
A short synopsis for you all. Six children - Saki, Maria, Mamoru, Satoru, Reiko, and Shun, are the best of friends, living in a utopian society with others who possess the power of psychokinesis ( which will be referred to, for the sake of brevity, as PK ). The society that they live is disturbingly peaceful. Everything seems to go perfectly; too perfectly, in fact. People remain as long as they are willing to adhere to the rules and are not abnormal, whether that means with some strange personality or lagging behind in abilities. The reason for this elimination is revealed later on. Yet in the beginning of Shinsekai Yori, all is well. It is revealed that they live in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world; the reason for the apocalypse and the lack of technology is unknown. The infrastructure of the community is built on the labor of Monster Rats, which believe the PK users to be gods and address them with a respect that seems exaggerated, and eerily so. \
After a watershed incident, the children discover that there is much more to the past of their society than they imagined. The story gets progressively darker as more truths become evident. Many of the aspects of the series are confusing and may cause people to abandon the show, yet everything has its own place. Chekhov’s gun plays a major role in this series. Everything, even little snippets from the very beginning of the show, are crucial to how the story plays out. I can remember the point where all facts that had seemed, initially, unrelated, began to come together. That moment was astonishing. I had no words. It made sense and I understood the truth, and the truth was terrifying. \
Shinsekai Yori draws most of its impact from the concept that almost everything in this anime is paralleled in the world we live in. PK? Weird balloon-dogs? Magic, in general? None of that exists in our world, perhaps, but upon further examination, our world has equivalents of the colorful array of abilities, ideas, and characters in the anime. There are countless themes interwoven in this anime, all of which find a place in our world. How far can we go before our actions can be termed ‘abusing our power’? When, if ever, is it right to kill somebody? What makes us human? Indeed, Shinsekai Yori is filled with haunting questions that will make those who pay attention doubt even their very existence. The story is complex. It’s quite difficult to follow, admittedly, which is why I recommend trying to watch it all at once instead of leaving it off and watching it sporadically. Yet I believe that of all the anime I have watched, even Miyazaki films, Shinsekai Yori is one with messages that need to be heard. Nothing is as it seems in this anime. \
What I believe is one of the best aspects of Shinsekai Yori’s character portrayal is that nobody is good or evil. Even the main antagonists are justified in their beliefs. The protagonists make questionable decisions. Yet, as becomes evident throughout the anime, it is those who are willing to bend the rules and take risks that have the most impact, whether they are ‘good’ or ‘bad’. I do not feel as though there is much character development in this anime as there is a greater realization of the truth. The main character, Saki, for example, retains much of the same personality and beliefs that she had at the beginning of the anime, but it is her growing knowledge that makes her significantly different from her childhood self. \
I guess I should stop being loquacious and talk about other parts of Shinsekai Yori, so, let’s begin with the art. The characters themselves are simply drawn, with features that are there simply to distinguish themselves from each other. They have no outstanding characteristics in terms of appearance, in contrast with the Monster Rats, who have a wide variety of forms and may not even be associated with each other if not for being explicitly termed all of the same species. Even so, it’s necessary to understand that anyone with a particularly unique appearance might be eliminated under the extremely conformist society. In addition, the simple character designs remind you that this anime is not about the appearances. It is about the plot, about analyzing even the smallest details and realizing what they mean. The background art is amazing and detailed, in contrast with the human character designs. The world of Shinsekai Yori looks at once familiar and surreal. There’s just enough use of foreign aspects to indicate that this is a fantasy land. Lastly, I’d like to mention the use of dark and light shadowing. Much of this anime is shown in a dark setting, which makes the scenes that are extremely bright that much more significant. It greatly aids in emphasizing the importance of various parts of the story.\
Many, including me, were probably surprised to find that there was no outstanding OP for this anime. The episodes start immediately. There is, however, a recurring theme that plays in the background, a kind of ethereal melody that matches the somewhat futuristic, somewhat mysterious tone of Shinsekai Yori, and a wonderfully presented ending. In a significantly different animating style from the anime, it’s definitely one of the most impressive endings I’ve seen in an anime, even though it’s quite simple. \
It’s pretty evident by now, I think, that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this anime. But I suppose I should give some consideration as to why you might choose not to watch this anime. It is an investment of time and brainpower, since you really have to think and rethink about many parts of Shinsekai Yori before you can reach somewhat of an understanding of what’s going on and what everything means. Heh, I feel like I’m writing a warning label here. But you might not really want to watch Shinsekai Yori if you can’t stand homosexuality- it’s not a major feature of the anime and its reasons are fully explained well before it actually appears, you’re looking for a lighthearted anime, you’re not really interested in paying a lot of attention to it, or you’re the type that prefers everything resolved, no questions unanswered, and all parts of the show making complete sense. I’m sure that I missed a lot of messages in this anime. Even small details have significance. \

Thanks for waiting, to those of you who prefer numbers. \
Story - 10\
And a well-deserved 10 at that. Shinsekai Yori starts off simple, gets rather confusing, and then, suddenly, everything starts to come together and make sense. The innumerable themes presented in this anime were astounding. I actually have no idea how the author managed to tie everything together while also making some rather poignant statements and, at times, sardonic criticism, about our present-day society. Every little detail has significance to the plot...would you call it the butterfly effect, perhaps, in that even the seemingly smallest actions have massive effects? Emerson wrote that society regresses just as fast as it advances, and I think this is quite evident in Shinsekai Yori, in which a utopian world exists...but at what price? To understand Shinsekai Yori, you have to be willing to analyze everything until you think all of the meanings have been completely exhausted, and then look at them from a different perspective and realize how much you’ve missed. The anime does a lot in terms of story, but there’s also a necessity for the watcher to have their own thoughts for Shinsekai Yori to make its full impact.\
Art - 8\
Character designs are simple and definitely not flamboyant or exotic in any way. They are easily distinguished from each other, but have no significant features. A greater diversity is present in the Monster Rats ( I believe this has some rather interesting implications, but you’ll figure that out when you watch the anime ). The animation gets a little bit strange in some of the episodes, but most of the anime is well-drawn. The background art is well-done, and the careful manipulation of dark and light helps set the mood of the anime. \
Sound - 7\
The music is definitely unconventional, with just a hint of surreal and a dose of eerie to finish it off. There is no consistent OP ( as I recall, a song appeared in the beginning in just, perhaps, two of the episodes? ), but there are two EDs, both of which I enjoyed; Wareta Ringo is incredibly catchy. They are well-animated and may seem incredibly bewildering initially but make a lot more sense as the anime progresses. \
Character - 9\
The characters do not develop so much as their greater knowledge of the truths- or shall I say lies?- that their world is built on changes their outlook on everything that they learned as children. I appreciate how not even the antagonists are portrayed as necessarily evil. Everyone is equally justified in their beliefs and if you’re willing to look at Shinsekai Yori from each character’s point of view, none of the motives seem inherently evil. Sacrifices must be made in one aspect to gain in another. \
Enjoyment - 10\
This anime proved to me that what many may deem children’s cartoons can have surprisingly meaningful messages. Though I expected to enjoy this anime, it almost completely consumed my thoughts for about a week afterward as I tried to puzzle out, well, first of all, why I enjoyed it so much, and secondly, what did everything that I had just watched mean not only in a proverbial sense but also in an applicable-to-society sense? I was completely hooked on Shinsekai Yori from the beginning, which is something I’ve never really experienced with an anime before. It was indeed interesting solving the countless mysteries of the Shinsekai Yori world alongside the characters.\

    Shinsekai Yori as an adaptation of a novel is terrific.  Many adaptations tend to skip over significant amount of background information presented in the original source but not Shinsekai Yori.  The plot stays true to the original source and it manages to provide a great amount of background information regarding the events that led to the dystopian place the anime is set in.  But just as in the original source the plot suffers greatly due to its unsatisfactory resolution to many of the intriguing mysteries that were presented in the beginning.  What begins as a captivating story of as village young\
          \
        teenagers uncovering the hidden motives of their governing body ends with a cliche \"creations turning against the creator\" plot.  It suffers from an identity conflict.  It doesn't really know what it wants to be or rather wants to be encompass many themes but fails to pull it off.  The issues raised in the first few episodes are quickly resolved half way through in the series with disappointing conclusions that were either predictable or illogical.  Many time the series builds up a fascinating mystery which leaves the viewer pondering but the climax and \"the moment of truth\" for many of these mysteries are rushed and unsatisfactory.  Every mystery comes to a sudden end instead of a long and fulfilling conclusion.  \
The second half of the series turns into a more action-oriented character driven story.  Its about the revolt of creations against their creator.  Although this is not clear until the last ten minutes of the show.  It reveals a very cruicial plot point regarding the origns of the \"creations\" but it is revealed in an extremely rushed fashion.  The actions that were presented in the second half of the series were terribly choreographed.  The characters use their cantus power which is similar to telekinesis but utlizied in a brutal way.  Out of nowhere heads are exploded, people are cut into hallf and explosions occur in the city using these invisible power.  It is difficult to grasp what is going on during these action scenes.  Many powerful leaders of the village are simply cut down by the fiend, an individual whcih uses its power of hate to greatly amplify his/her powers.  The fiends are extremely powerful and the explanation associated with the reasoning of their immense power is rather nonsensical and illogical.  Many concepts introduced in the series are not explored thoroughly.  One of these concept is the \"death of shame\" which is an alteration to the genes of human beings to prevent them from killing another.  This concept is used as a Deus Ex Machina. This concept is used as a measure to put an end to the main threat of the series.   But its execution is from perfect.  While the concept was introduced early in the series, its application toward the end series comes out of nowhere.  The second half of the series is simply a mess when it comes to story telling.  \
Characters are usually well done even if they are a bit melodramatic.  This mostly applies to the main character of the series.  The side characters are well written.  Interaction between the characters is very natural and human.  There are no long philosophical dialouges.  Conversations are very human and natural.  The production values of the series is decent.  The art is terrific and uses a wide range of colors but the animation is inconsistent.  The fighting animations in particular are off-putting.  The character art is very simple.  Faces lack detail and features.  Its difficult for the characters to convey emotions which such simple face features.  The voice acting is well done.  VAs  both in english and japanese are comfortable with their roles and sound very natural.  The music is generally good but not memorable.  I can't think of any tracks which I want to go back and listen to.  \
Overall Shinsekai Yori is a decent series which suffers from the same problems of the original source.  The adaptation is great but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  I recommend this anime to anyone who wants to enjoy a unique dystopian anime.  \

    Shinsekai yori was an absolute delight to watch and reflect on. Not only is it a very intelligent anime, but it consistently keeps viewers enchanted by beautiful environment art, thrilling action, heart-pounding suspense, and sudden plot twists right to the final episode.\
Thought-provoking, insightful, and beautifully animated with an intriguing and original story arc, it's quite fantastic what the creators managed to pack into 25 episodes. It's simply brilliant. \
If you're looking for an anime with a completely different feel than what most animes bring to the table, you've found it. Shinsekai yori is a very intelligent anime when appreciated to its fullest. If you're looking\
          \
        for a rapid-fire, guts-and-glory, good-versus-evil kind of anime, you might not enjoy this series. It's unique style and melancholy, almost dark feel won't appeal to everybody, as it does not exist purely for mindless entertainment. It will challenge you. Excite you. Blow your mind in such a subtle way you won't really know what to do with yourself at times.\
 This anime's many conflicts occur within many gray areas; it is not always clear whether the antagonists are truly evil in nature. In other words, it comes off as quite strikingly real, even within a very surreal, dreamlike environment. Although it is, at its most basic, a story based on a group of friends' triumphs and failures, and ultimately a task to save the world from destruction, it brings a pensive, melancholy subtlety that really sets it apart.\
The character development is also subtle, but genius. Observing the differences and changes the children go through as they interact with each other into adolescence is very unique and tangible to observe. It's sort of a coming-of-age story with much darker notions. Shinsekai yori is not afraid to directly expose themes and ideas that many shy away from and avoid thinking about. Indeed, it can get quite dark at times. It brings angsty and dramatic undertones that really complement the overall feel that really makes this anime what it is.\
The story picks up speed quite suddenly, and action-packed episodes are layered with quieter, story-based episodes in such a way that neither gets tiring. The story's focus switches from topic to topic in a very realistic way: not always crystal-clear to look back on, but clear enough that the viewer doesn't wind up lost in the whimsical, surreality of it all. Shinsekai yori exists in a world based on what-ifs, and it makes for a rather personal experience that can vary greatly in meaning just varying on who's watching.\
I find that one of the factors that truly makes or breaks any anime is the complexity of idea it is based on. Shinsekai yori hit the nail on the head for me. Not only did this anime leave me pausing episodes quite frequently simply to take in certain themes and ideas, but it explores many societal norms and themes in a very insightful and original way. The world that it takes place in alone, both primal and complex in nature, leaves much to be pondered and appreciated. The sheer amount of detail put into this anime cannot be appreciated by simply watching episode after episode. It requires time to mull things over and digest what you've seen. \
 (Note: There is a LOT of backstory and world-explanation portrayed to the viewer rather quickly and frequently for the length of the anime. I find the creators did an excellent job with this medium, however, it is important that the viewer pays attention during explanations, as the story development can be quite complex and direct, and is vital to fully experience the depth of this anime.)\
The animation itself is also very beautiful. Stunning environment art, charming and gorgeous character design, and the sheer vastness of the world created in this anime rival any other I've seen to date. To put it simply, the aesthetics easily match the story quality in terms of absolute pleasure and enjoyment. \
So, all in all, this anime is a gem worth seeing, even if you've never watched this sort of anime before. I hadn't when I first saw it, and it was very refreshing to experience an anime that broke the mold in such a way. Please take my word for it-- it's amazing. Shinsekai yori gets tens across the board from me, and deserves it completely. \

    Shinsekai Yori is an anime I have somewhat neglected ever since it started airing in late 2012. Upon first watching it, I found it slightly interesting, but wound up pushing it off to the side, watching only a couple episodes every month. Instead, I took to watching things more comical; I took to watching more joyous things or shows that fell into a genre with any other  adjective that could not possibly be used to describe what was contained within this anime. Well, eventually I decided I would just sit down and finish it all at once, powering through a good fifteen episodes or\
          \
        so. \
And let me tell you this:\
Shinsekai Yori has, hands down, the most gripping story out of anything I've ever watched before. And though it seems rather slow-paced in the beginning, it possesses so many important themes that most anime today seem to skip out on. IE: Humanity and its sociological properties, the rising and falling of societies, mortality, etc.\
Based on the novel by Yusuke Kishi, Shinsekai Yori throws us into a world where human beings with psychic power called \"Cantus\" control the land. Normal humans have died out, but other sentient creatures are still wandering the earth. The psychics have created a society in which children are sent to school in order to maintain and strengthen their powers. They are sent to school so they don't wind up dying. However, with limited space in the school and the towns, only the ones that show true promise will wind up living a long life.\
But it doesn't end there. The humans are coexisting with an animal race called the \"Queerats.\" These creatures worship those with cantus as if they were gods, but what if the gods were to turn their backs on the queerats? What would happen then?\
It is quite hard to describe the complexity of this story. And, to be honest, it only gets harder as it goes on. But that doesn't mean you should put it down like I did. If you truly want to reevaluate what you think about life, what it means to be human, follow this show to the end.\
I have dissected the anime into a few key components to better illustrate the different aspects of it.\
Music: 8/10\
Though repetitive at first, the BGM will become extremely memorable as the series progresses. The music constantly riddles you with somber melodies in times of sorrow and does a fantastic job of taking your heart and squeezing it until it is barely able to beat.\
Characters: 9/10\
Character development is nothing short of extravagant. Each character is memorable and increasingly different from the rest. Some are meant to be hated, some are meant to be loved. And with the amount of time lapsed inside this anime, it becomes obvious how characters are changing and how said changes are impacting the people around them. You, in a sense, wind up growing with the characters. And that is truly mesmerizing.\
Art: 9/10\
Though slightly different from most anime today, there is something very alluring about the art of Shinsekai Yori. It's extremely interesting to see how ancient folk/fantasy can fit in with human beings. And the amount of emotion the characters are able to display with their facial expressions is beyond anything I have seen before.\
Story: 20/10\
Please just watch this and pay close attention to the world enclosed within. It is like nothing you have ever seen. It is so intricate and so horrifyingly dystopian that you will not be able to look away.\

                          \
    Shinsekai Yori has all the elements of a modern classic. Containing ethnical conundrums and indistinguishable villains, the sprawling story is set in a world both fantastical and believable. Multiple times will you feel uncomfortable watching it, the series' slow pace boring you or the depiction of homosexuality unsettling you. It doesn't immediately make sense nor explain itself, but that could be said to be part of the charm.\
This aforementioned charm comes from multiple facets of the series. \
Firstly, as was hinted to earlier, the story is grand and well made. Even from the beginning episodes a feeling of dread and wonder is bestowed onto the\
          \
        viewer. I found myself wanting to know more about the story, the characters and the mysteries unfolding before me, the series every alluding to something much grander. Although this world building within the first few episodes could be seen as trivial and boring, to me it was engaging and refreshing. It introduced the setting and story well and gave you a taste of what was to come; no filler or episodic dilemmas negating from the plot. This fascination stayed with me for the whole duration, the maturity of the plot growing with the episode count. In this way the series really builds upon itself, most details being important to the overall story. Although not fully noticeable until later on, this therefore allows Shinsekai Yori to tie everything together into a satisfying conclusion. Due to this, the story kept me engaged well and it's twists and turns (although predictable) served to create a daunting and sinister narrative throughout.\
Another aspect of the series which complements it's good story are the characters. This is done mainly through the way they grow and change throughout the story. This is seen not only visually with the passage of time, but also through the development of their morals and figure. As such, this serves to both privilege the grim themes of the central story and allow for further actions to take place. Therefore, most, if not all, characters get their deserved screen time and fully develop into something worth caring for. The reason this is a strength for the series is because it means all characters are interesting. No one cliché is truly seen in the cast and this adds to the previously mentioned want for information and knowledge. You are constantly hungering for that little bit of detail to each character and plough through the story to get it. The moral ambiguity and troubles in locating a main villain also help this. There is no defacto 'bad guy' nor knight in shining armour; everyone and everything is morally grey and you find yourself second guessing most interior motives. This, coupled with the little to no fan-service in the anime, helps to establish the central, mature themes. Ultimately, this aids the series and supports the rollercoaster that is the main story.\
My main gripes with Shinsekai Yori is the varying animation quality and pacing. \
Although the two ending songs and main themes of the series were well made, the same cannot be said for the visuals at times. Noticeable dips in quality can be seen scattered throughout Shinsekai Yori, the revaluation of characters being incredibly jarring for single episodes. Lazily animated cycles and poorly done poses were easily visible and did subtract from the main narrative, though thankfully this never occurred during essential moments. Additionally, the standard artwork of the series is nothing truly spectacular either. Yes, it does serve its purpose, and yes, the characters and backdrops do look beautiful at times, but it didn't quite have its own style or fidelity. However, it did suit the story well, the less generic characters and environment portraying a more adult world. In the same way this animation style suited the more surreal scenes well, the use of effects helping to create a spectacle. Due to this, the art of Shinsekai Yori is highly variable, though is nothing which could solely put off a viewer. \
Something which could drop viewers, however, is the initial pacing of the story. As was mentioned, I highly enjoyed the slow burn of the story and character development throughout. What I do not appreciate, however, is the stark change in tone found within the first action plot line. Although remedied after-the-fact with better execution in further arks, I cared very little for early episodes because of this. It seemed to me that the story cared less about building upon its previous mysteries and more about the plight and battles against Queerats. Additionally, coupled with poor animation throughout this section, the beginning segment has the possibility of turning away viewers from an otherwise fantastic series. Although purely subjective and biased, I find that this section is the worst example of pacing and goes against the grand story proposed in the episodes beforehand. As such, poor pacing is made apparent only in the starting section and highlights the flaws of the series. \
More than anything, Shinsekai Yori will be a different experience. It contains few of the tropes common in the anime and closely resembles it's novel roots. It is highly enjoyable if you can stomach it's themes, artwork and pacing and enjoy it for the experience it offers. Little can match the work on the quality of its story, and I suggest all people to give it a shot.\

    Can you imagine our world being a utopia a 1000 years into the future? No wars and just peace and love and tranquility? I doubt it. But, if you were to see such a utopia, you probably would have a gut feeling for it to be wrong. Shinsekai Yori tells us to remember that instinctive feeling...\
Shinsekai Yori documents the lives of humans 1000 years into the future who have gained the ability of using psychokinesis (commonly referred to as cantus). The story follows the life of Saki Watanabe and friends who go to Zenjin academy to hone their cantus skills, and their investigations about the\
          \
        mystery 'tainted cats'.\
Shinsekai Yori is seen as a fantasy thriller, trying to delicately weave in high suspense moments in an idyllic setting whilst using children to uncover the dark secrets of how the world has come about.  The clever juxtaposing techniques are what bring about the tension.  However, underneath this complex story, what we see is a slice of life.  Not an ordinary slice of life, but the 'slice' which is never really looked at in anime too often.  It's the negatives about our world which are expressed fully in the Shinsekai Yori, every flaw in our imperfect world are scrutinized in depth. There are so many parallels between our world and their world, from using 'unintelligent' creatures (in Shinsekai Yori these are named Queerats) as slaves, to the brainwashing of society or even forcing dictatorship and judgement on the weak, are well documented. Furthermore, it also looks at how those in control sanction such inhumane laws on those who could cause risk to society, going as far as brainwashing people to maintain control.  The show can almost been seen as consisting of 3 arcs which involves time skips to show life at different ages, mainly focusing on the problems with the children and the other focuses on the war at the end.  Atmospherically, the show oozes tense undertones in comparison to the cheery nature of the children and the lush scenery.  The show also features romance, but not the human conventional falling in love, it's more instinctive love, which gave for truly unique displaying of relationships.\
However, one of the biggest criticisms of the show was the radical changing of themes in terms of relationships. Quiet early into the show both yaoi and yuri themes were shown, which was a stark contrast to the possible relationship pairings previously established. Furthermore, the pacing was back and forth due flashbacks of the history in shinsekai yori, which made it slightly hard to follow, however this stops and the pacing becomes better, adding more tension.\
The animation for the show wasn't entirely fluid or sharp compared to many anime's in 2012, however the art isn't bad either. There is some bloody moments, all of which isn't censored. The scenery itself is done well, not necessarily picturesque but good nonetheless.\
The characters in shinsekai yori are fleshed out by showing their mental 'strength', this strength shown by the characters is how they manage to overcome problems which provide extremely stressful. When younger, the characters come across as a common cast of friends, such as the smart one (Shun) the quiet one (Mamarou) or the cocky one (Satoru). But as they grow you see the strength of these characters. The show does well in presenting difficult situations for the characters, and sympathy can only be given to see children so young deal with so much that they may not understand, such as political issues or certain laws. Also, the killing off of characters shows no one is safe at any point, and the characters are put under the stress of knowing this constantly.\
However, it could be seen that Saki, the main character and narrator of the show gets off lightly with some issues. Although she struggles and is able to cope well, she is known to be weak in terms of fighting, which could lead to big problems at times. But, she generally good for most of the show.\
Musically, Shinsekai Yori shines brightly. Although the shows opening isn't used much (if not at all) it's 2 choices of ending are definitely good for those who love more romantic J Pop. The OST is composed very well, with each terrifying moment made that bit more tense, and the more relaxing moments that bit more peaceful.\
To conclude, this genre within a genre anime is definitely worth watching for someone looking for anime which is slightly unique. It's one not to miss, as an anime like Shinsekai Yori doesn't come across too often.\

    Seldom does one obtain or discover an anime that is quite frankly a world apart from its contemporary contenders and kin alike, and Shinsekai is indubitably an excellent example. Literally every aspect within this quite bizarre and exotic series is rather elaborate and convoluted though not to the extent of being incomprehensible, and is executed in a very adroit and ingenious manner. A vast amount of viewers would most certainly be deterred by the eccentricity that’s abound throughout the entire story, and expediently dismiss its existence altogether.\
Fortunately for those of you who are tenacious, determined, and more open minded than the vast majority and that\
          \
        are desperately searching for an imaginative and compelling anime that’s striking in execution, you’ve just hit the jackpot.\
This anime is absolutely by no means a show you simply watch on a mere whim with a lax and laid-back mindset, Shinsekai will aspire to test your perspicacity and discernment, not to mention your overall intellect. The entire complex and esoteric universe as a whole is very deceiving, nothing is actually what it astutely presents itself to be on the surface.  Quite frankly the entire world within Shinsekai is brimming with a plethora of intricate and profound mysteries as well as secrets.\
Themes: 10\
The mystery aspects of Shinsekai is what gives this series its magnificently impressive complexity and sense of constant breathtaking suspense. One would irrefutably surmise though that having a constant sense of mystery would ultimately would merely achieve in creating an ambiance that’s repetitive and rather aggravating, thereby detracting the other aspects/themes as well as depreciating the plot itself. Fortunately the auxiliary themes efficiently and adequately counteract and even reinforce each other in a balanced manner so an individual theme isn’t the driving force with the others merely being dragged along.\
As for the horror, it delusively presents itself to be feeble and null, practically nugatory for being implemented in the plot in the first place. To wholly appreciate and comprehend the horror, it’s imperative for the viewer to understand it’s not intended, or for that matter even utilized for abrupt impulsive sentimental reactions to create anxiety. The foreboding and gradual intensifying eerie sense of horror is vital and crucial for addressing the important main points of the series itself, and does so flawlessly.\
The supernatural and sci-fi elements that are incorporated are ingenious and very inventive, conceivably the most eccentric and idiosyncratic I’ve ever seen in an anime yet. This is quite frankly the epitome of what true ingenuity and inventiveness can achieve if executed properly.\
Main Points/Messages:  10\
I was astonished and quite impressed by the plethora of allegories abound throughout Shinsekai, it’s certainly what makes this series memorable and distinguished as well. The most noticeable and noteworthy is that essentially by design, societies will indeed never be perfect no matter how much they desperately aspire to be.\
As Shinsekai judiciously portrays, human beings wistfully are unpredictable and rather unstable creatures, varying tremendously in character from one another. So it’s therefore ultimately no surprise society can’t maintain constant adequate authority and supervision. This is especially accurate for the human townships in Shinsekais universe, where everybody has psychokinesis that interacts with their conscious selves, as well as the uncontrollable subconscious. \
The human condition and other unique traits that pertain exclusively to Homo sapiens are also addressed in an intriguing and enthralling style, such as our everlasting sense of curiosity. Curiosity can basically be described as two sides of the same coin, as Shinsekai magnificently portrays. Once something manages to capture our curiosity, we’re stubbornly determined to find an answer regardless of what consequences may be forthcoming as a result. \
Unfortunately for our primary group of protagonists, after uncovering several shocking secrets long kept concealed by modern society, or just simply forgotten. They will all come to the calamitous revelation that this will drastically change the very world in which they have comfortably grown accustomed to, forever.\
Dolefully, power and corruption have always coincided with each other ever since mankind’s inception, and Shinsekai makes this basis abundantly evident, albeit in a rather sensational manner. Whether power is utilized with sinister intentions or merely for order and stability over a particular community, regardless there will perpetually be a percentage of people that exploit it and misuse it. The cogent and quite meritorious portrayal of this is seen by both the dwindling species of mankind and by their contemporary intellectual equivalent, the race known as the queerats(and no I didn’t make that up). \
Lastly there is our rather intangible sense of morals, such as right and wrong, that we’re so proud of and have strived greatly to maintain. Again, much as to humanity’s dismay, can be and frequently is abused and misemployed just like power, whether deliberately planned or just of out of blind, perhaps even irrational impulse. This aspect of human nature is depicted in the most phenomenal, outstanding, and creative manner I’ve have indubitably ever seen anywhere. \
With the conclusion you shockingly and rapidly realize that there is clearly no actual definitive antagonist or protagonist within Shinsekai’s ingenious and avant-garde plot. As the raging conflict between the queerats and humans arrives to a swift conclusion, you begin to fathom the genuine notion that morals essentially are fraudulent conjectures based on erroneous viewpoints and perception\
Background Info/Setting: 9\
Our setting takes place within a future japan that has been drastically as well as fundamentally altered. This outlandish and hostile new world is a result of a catastrophic global conflict that ensued between “normal” humans contending with the minority that obtained the seemingly divine gift of psychokinesis, or “Cantus” as it’s later known. \
Humanity is a mere fraction of what it used to be and queerats are now emerging as the dominant species and far outnumber humans. However mankind now wholly and thoroughly relies on Cantus abilities, which permits them to hold superiority and influence over the queerats and utilize them as a mass labor force for their own economy, not to mention survival. \
Story: 10\
I will certainly do my utmost to restrain from revealing an excess of information concerning the story so bear with me.\
The plot starts off with a notably different, almost utterly different tone and ambiance than what is experienced in the latter forthcoming majority of the series, it’s certainly very deceiving. You are exposed to a group childhood friends in elementary school living blissfully within their seemingly flawless world. The only notable and apparent distinctions are that the landscape is dominated by overgrown lush vegetation and that psychokinesis is an integral part of “contemporary” human society. Though as you and our primary protagonists will ultimately realize, the illusive utopia is shrouded in more grim and ghastly secrets than you could possibly envision. \
Characters: 10\
The characters are very contrasting and disparate, perhaps even more so than I previously realized, that’s frankly just how deep and immersive each individual really is, it’s incredible. \
Another admirable and exquisite trait concerning the characters is that they are much more adept and intellectual than you often find in the vast majority of anime, which consequently makes them very compelling to follow. In addition I feel obligated to note that the protagonists are very free willing, not designed or utilized toward a particular viewer type, since throughout the plot you will find them at times willfully engaging in homosexual relationships, then converting to heterosexual companionship instead (don’t be concerned or worried, there’s a substantial reason for this that applies directly to the story).\
Also I have to commend the utilization of dialogue for the script between the characters, as well as individual narrations. Since the most significant and vital portions of the story, which is a considerable majority is only addressed through the close knit dialogue. So make sure to pay special attention to long lengthy and prolonged dialogue orientated scenes, it’s imperative.\
Sound: 9\
The sound effects are quite wonderful and very remarkable in execution. In addition all the effects are uniform and balanced to near perfection. For any remaining sound effects that are utilized for aspects or creatures that obviously don’t exist in the real world, they sound very plausible and believable.\
The music was unexpectedly marvelous and vibrant, not to mention glamorous. Each individual BGM felt very distinct and was very instrumental and effective at setting the tone pertaining to its particular scene. \
Art: 8\
The art was unfortunately a little bland and lacking in detail, but an animation studio can only achieve so much with a tight budget. Though the art style is still praiseworthy and impressive to feast your eyes upon nonetheless. \
Enjoyment: 9\
As I have stated earlier in my review, Shinsekai Yori is the absolute epitome of pure originality, artistry, and inventiveness without a doubt. This series is very proficient and ingenious in regard that it manages to evoke an incredibly diverse variety of reactions from the viewer. You’ll feel just as sentimental as you will be thought provoked by a certain set of events within just a single episode, and be left eager for more. \
The anime does consist of a few drawbacks unfortunately though, the beginning is almost aggravatingly slow and lethargic in its pacing and progression, with little development and plenty of confusion. Though subsequent the first few episodes the series kicks off and starts showing its true colors, and man are they fabulous. If you’re intently searching for an anime that has an expansive as well as extensive universe that isn’t quite perplexing, with unique, immersive, and compelling characters and storyline, then I’m delighted to inform you that you just found it.\
I’d sincerely appreciate any feedback, will gladly and eagerly listen to any legitimate opinions and comments of my reviews as to better future reviews, these reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not merely to state my opinions of it just for fun, thanks!",

    I'm just gonna make this review quick. There is no much things that makes me feel it was a superb series.\
Art & Sound, 10 & 8.\
Not much I can say, as what you would expected from 2012 films it has an outstanding art, key animation, storyboard & sound.\
Characters, 5.\
Still, a few section there shown a non-realistic reaction for a 12 years old boys & girls. Lack of emotion & a bit overreact, overreact & well played emotion was two diferrent things. But characters starting a bit better & fit at it's finest when they are grown up.\
Story, 5.\
It start with a Sci-fi, & build the\
          \
        way it is. It was good, the complexity was what you would expected from a Sci-fi. But it start to get bored in the middle of the series. & starting their non-sense plot with lack of transition & so on with mediocre plot. Abselutely, I was seeing a lot of chance that this series is gonna be kicked, but unfortunately they throw away a lot of chance/possible outstanding plot & ending.\
Enjoyment, 1.\
Yes, it has a beautiful artistic art, good sound, & the director was abselutely doing a great job. But it's not enough to make the whole series enjoyable, honestly I feel disgusting when watch this. Found no enjoyment for me, & thinking about to drop it many times.\
But I'm keep going to know \"is this series good?\", because seeing the rating in here looks like a promising series, & keep digging 'till the last episode. But, I was wrong.\
Overall's 5 for the whole series with small detail appraisal, fairly I say this is one of the most overrated series, I ever watched.\
Last, english isn’t my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.\
Thank you.\

Is it how we deify ourselves as superior beings, believing in the fact that we were shaped in the images of god.\
Or is it the unending paranoia which we all possess, even in the modern age we humans have nearly drived the world into nuclear catastrophe with events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis.\
What is the answer?,you ask.\
The answer is all of the above and worse.\
Shinsekai yori is a masterpiece which encapsulates perfectly all the flaws present within humanity. If this intro was enough to intrigue you\
          \
        then read no further(Go watch the show XD), but for those who are still not convinced then allow me to try to explain why this hidden gem of an anime is worth your precious time.\
Plot:\
Shinsekai Yori is a tale set in a dystopian future, from the beginning its vibrant scenery and beautiful colors might suggest otherwise, however this is nothing more than a trap to trick the viewer. Shinsekai is masterful at being subtle, its expertise at giving you a false sense of security is so great that at the beginning this show almost seemed to be an alternative slice of life and nothing else. Unlike other shows of its kind such as psycho-pass, Shinsekai Yori has a slow but worthy build up. Through its multiple time skips you can slowly see how dark this universe and it's dark secrets slowly creeps out.\
This futuristic Japan is a brutal one, a world in which its government supports various deranged acts such as stripping the human rights of children until they reach the age of 17 or even worse how they act as if child murder is a necessity in order to prevent chaos. The government which is ironically known as the \"ethics committee\" is everything but ethical. However even with their monstrous acts you can't really hate them, as horrible as they act even as a observer you can sympathize with them. The adults themselves believe that their actions are righteous, being controlled by their fear of children turning into \" Karma demons\" and being able to defy the death feedback mechanism(mechanism which stops humans from killing each other) it seems that their actions are nothing but logical. As Edmund Burke said “Those who don't know history, are bound to repeat it.\" With this flawed belief system they do various atrocities basely on suspicion.\
But lastly the main conflict and best conflict is the one found within the mole rats and the humans. I'll not go into too much detail apart from saying that the ending of this show is one of the most demoralizing and bittersweet ending I have ever witnessed.\
ART:\
The Art is splendid, its vibrant and exciting colors help to set a mysterious atmosphere to this future world. One of the best things about the art is that it remains vivid and colorful even within moments of great despair, it almost seem incongruous the moment, however I believe this is great as it keep the observer such as myself in confusion.\
I could go on and on about its unique beauty but to keep it short let's just say that it's nothing short than amazing.\
SOUND:\
Not to many tracks are found within its OST, but shinsekai yori helps us to remember the simple saying that it's quality over quantity. The tracks that it does have to offer are simply amazing. By now you must be thinking that I sound like a crazed fan boy but trust me this anime is just this good. It's tracks can range from calming to ominous and strange, the use of a choir in one said track is amazing.\
In Other Words, nearly damn flawless.\
Characters:\
I have some issues but nothing major. Due to a lot of characters being present not all of them are fleshed out but this isn’t a major issue. \
The main characters of Saki, Satorou and Squealer are more than enough to bring depth into this story.\
But the one that truly steals the show is Squealer, in the beginning you will hate him, but at the end of this show you'll ask yourself this one question.\
- \" Was Squealer really all that bad\"-\
I haven't seem an antagonist this good for a while, I mean most antagonist in this day and age seem to follow that certain stereotype of being all evil but even though it seems that squealer follows that same archetype by the very end I can assure you that just like myself you will sympathize with him. Once again showing how good this show is at the art of subtlety.\
Enjoyment\
It has a slow build up as I said before but it's worth it \
P.S- It has a few yaoi and yuri scenes but that’s nothing to get worked up over as it doesn’t take away from it's magnificent plot.\

    ~ Is it not natural to want to escape such a fate? ~ \
There are many things that the evolution of humanity can tell us.\
From the fact that power exists to be corrupted...\
To the fact that war is a self-inflicted bitter end...\
To watch Shinsekai yori means to have a vividly depicted world of secrecy and deception built up, and broken down before your eyes. In spite of the significant supernatural influence of the show, this \"New World\" is essentially a model of our own. It's a highly politically and morality engaged mystery series that exposes the tragedy behind a social infrastructure striving for power. Indeed\
          \
        a great deal more could be read into the way that humans are presented in Shinsekai, but I'm not here to ramble; i'm here to review.\
1000 years down the line, and yet: this is a very different reality to the one crammed down our throats by 90's Sci-Fi movies. Devoid of technology, and instead solving our problems with telekinetic-like powers: Shinsekai takes place in a notably disconnected and eerie feeling village. Ridden with mystery, and plagued by a dark history of covert operations: we're certainly oblivious to everything initially, and this is what really invokes curiosity. Not in the cheap confusion-tactic way either: as it's a genuinely thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind initiation. From the first episode, the subtle integration of supernatural elements, set the tone well for the journey to come. While the myths and mystery elements added a tasteful sense of darkness; pertaining to the fact that some form of escalation or \"happening\" was imminent.\
Enticed by the mysterious setting; I had to delve deeper...\
It is a powerful and thorough documentation of a dark and morally questionable history.\
A history of deception. A history of oppression. A history of conflict. A reflection of our thirst for power, and our \"perfect\" society. In essence, Shinsekai yori is nothing less than the animated representation of the renowned \"War and Peace\" article. While a little slow to begin, the story meticulously detailed. And while initializing with nothing more than a nagging sense of injustice, this story line evolves and blossoms into life beautifully. From an awkward \"bud\" to rose of the deepest crimson red: Shinsekai yori is a highly philosophical, eye-opening, and yet gripping tale of evolution itself. Its difficult to comprehend even the scale of its implications.\
While a little reliant of the viewer's ability to pay attention, it's not a preachy story, made with the aim to confuse; as it would never sacrifice the clarity of the overriding message. If it's even possible, the story makes even the grayest lines of morality: clear as day. \
Now I know what you're thinking: \"How can something you described as \"philosophical\" engage me at all? (sounds boring)\".\
Well, not that I can believe it myself really either, but Shinsekai manages to create a perfect harmony of intensity and depth. Particularly near the beginning, it incorporates a lot of horror elements to promote suspense and draw you in, while we see ample engaging action sequences throughout as well.\
\"Drawing you in. Closer and closer\", seems like a perfect quote to elaborate upon HOW you will experience the show. Opening with the aforementioned element of supernatural mystery and horror (though admittedly rather slowly), more questions are posed, as EVERYTHING escalates. Continually: the action intensifies (as conflicts grow larger), drama heightens (as we near answers), the element of morality becomes overwhelming (as countless philosophical concepts and reflections of society are made more prominent). From the beginning, I had no idea that that things would escalate and culminate in the way that they did by the final episode.\
The show takes many turns, and indeed has many levels. There is a genuine sense of enthrallment to note about the action sequences if you have doubts. From start to finish, it feels like you're going against a larger, invisible force. It's ceaselessly  engaging: a story of corruption and forbidden knowledge told from a dangerous first had perspective, while incorporating elements of morality and such, in a way that does not dry out one's \"lake of interest\". Know that i'm not exaggerating, but somehow the show managed to become both a thrill ride, and on top of that: a completely perspective-shifting lesson of morality.\
What struck me most at the particularly impactful conclusion, was the way that every little detail was relevant, and ended up being integrated into a very well-rounded and unexpected (to say the least) turn of events - comparing to the comparative tranquility of the first few episodes.\
On top of this almost inconceivably ideal and engaging storytelling, we do also get an insight into the perspectives most prominently, of our main characters. They mature (literally) as the show persists; making the anime a worthwhile \"bildungsroman\". With the most notable protagonists being Saki and Satoru, (Saki the main heroine): we see them evolve subtly from a relatively clueless perspective, to one that ends up shaping the story's conclusion. Particularly with Saki, we get a very intimate insight into her thought processes, which works very well in allowing us to associate ourselves with her given situations. Shinsekai allows you to forge this sort of connection with Saki in particular, while Satoru is somewhat more straightforward. The integrity of this emotional connection is by no means especially extensive, but nevertheless: enough to make you fear when she fears, and root for her protection to the bitter end. The development on this front is very personal, and somewhat reliant upon sentiment from prior episodes.\
The main point of praise in the character department is the effortless and almost unnoticeable evolution of our protagonists, as they become strengthened in the face of the countless injustices, conflicts, and trials to come - as is expected of course, of those who obtain forbidden knowledge of their village's dark history.\
Audiovisuals now...\
The animation is frustratingly fought by two sides.\
On the one hand, the scenery is immaculately detailed and artistic. The show isn't afraid to be quite abstract, at times with a somewhat dream-like, and Utopian feel. It's impossible not to be somewhat enthralled by the depth and detail of the beautifully crafted landscapes - as they do prove to be particularly immersive and \"real\".\
On the other hand, the animation of the characters themselves is simplistic, and utterly contradicts the detail of the scenery. The characters blatantly walk like overlays between the foreground and background, and the quality of their movements (such as mouth movement) is jepordised heavily by this conflicting simplicity, and notable choppiness even of the animation.\
I have no qualms about the finished, animated product (as it still looks great): as pros still significantly outweigh the cons. At times I remember remarking that the landscapes are simply breathtaking, but I simply can't say that the animation is without fault, given the choppiness of the characters.\
The sound aspect is incredibly appropriate. Filling silences with atmospheric audio, and conveying the impact of even the most minute of audible details. The soundtrack too, is very immersive. It greatly enhances the otherworldly sense of wonderment of the landscapes, and the ever-increasing scale of events is helped by this often operatic and moody BGM.\
Admittedly, I did tire from the overused \"operatic choir boy\" music especially nearer the start; as it became annoying more than anything else.\
In every other sub department though, the audio was of a very high standard, and it really added to the sense of scale of the story line as it took form. While a little short of \"perfect\", The sense of wonderment in the audiovisual department is simply unending...\
I may be getting blood out of a stone here, but perhaps my watching experience would have been even more enjoyable if there was a more extensive and personal background development of more of the protagonists. I could however say this about any anime, so ultimately: Shinsekai yori is nothing short of a masterpiece.\
The evolution of the characters, unexpectedly dramatic, deception-oriented story line, stellar storytelling and great pacing... undoubtedly equates to a brilliantly gripping show of substance and depth. It incorporates a wide spectrum of genres, and so I don't believe that anyone is exempt from my suggestion to you, the reader... to check it out :)\

Oh man! That was one hell of a roller coaster ride. Heck I got to say that watching this show was more thrilling than a trip to 6 FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN and that means quite something. When I watched episode 1, I could already feel that I may be watching something special. Holding back my urge to marathon the show (I hate doing it on a great show), I managed to prolong my viewing over a month.\
I clenched my fist, pulled my bedsheets, screamed at the TV,\

            THE REVIEW\
=================\
The great thing about this show is how it tells its story and how you get an understanding of its world and its inhabitants with each passing episode. This might be because its adapted from an award winning novel but a friend of mine said that the animation staff made a fantastic job of adapting it. \
From the first episode, there seems to be a lot of confusing things that the viewer might get lost and lose interest (There are still some unanswered questions by the end of the show). But if you stick with it, you are treated with a show unlike other.\
The story is told through the experiences of 5 psychic kids living in a post apocalyptic world ruled  by psychics. You will experience their lives as children through adulthood. As far as personality goes, the author did a good job of straying away from making a typical character archetype. For the world, it is a great mesh of old civilization with somehow modern technologies. The amazing thing here is how the author made a pretty realistic society that fits in that world and create bizarre things/creatures that live in it.\
The art/animation team did a fantastic job of creating a theme/palette that suits shinsekai's world. It is cryptic, bizarre, beautiful, and nostalgic. There are a couple of episodes with huge animation dips but it does not detract from my enjoyment (I event thought that it was intended at first lol). The sound did an amazing job in pulling you and immersing you in the world. I'm not a good critic when it comes to music but if I have to summarize my thoughts regarding this department it is: Intense, serene, and mystifying.\
\
=================\
              VERDICT\
=================\
From the new world is one of those animes/adaptations that comes around once in several years. It tackles human behavior, shunned social practices, and a lot disturbing scenes.  It comes with a couple of faults but such is expected in a daring and thought provoking show like this.\
So, to finally wrap things up and as a thanks to anyone who has read my longest review yet, I will now be giving a final score which comprises the built-in scoring system coupled with my personal bias and a fairly complicated process of mustering up my imaginary cantus and drawing the energy from the environment so that I can ask my homophobic future self for a fairly reasonable score that is not influenced, in any way, by teens making out and having a smexy time with the same gender and as I get lost in my own write up my future self finally told me the score of..\
9.2/10!\
A great show that makes the viewer feel like they also live in its world. Fans of video entertainment regardless of their genre/type preferences are advised to watch it and I'm strongly recommending to buy this show rather than stream it.\
 Homophobes will surely despise the series though lol.\

    Were you looking for another hilarious romcom about kids in school? Well, then you should leave. From the cover/poster picture, that's what this series had me thinking at first. But boy was I wrong, what I got was a dark, clever, and very suspensful anime. Towards the end of this series, the episodes started to feel like they were only 2 minutes long. I was wanting to give this a 9 out of 10 for a while, but I couldn't bring myself to it. Nothing was at all bad about Shin Sekai Yori.\
Story:\
Definitely the high point of the series. With most series nowadays, the story\
          \
        is pretty predictable, but with this one, I had absolutely no idea what was coming during several events, even when I tried to make an inference, most of the time, I was wrong. It was both original and intriguing. I was sucked into the story and kept wanting more. I swear that not a single line of dialogue was wasted, it felt like every line was related to something that would happen in the future. There were a few moments that I thought were a little... strange though. You'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen/are gonna watch this series. \
Art/Animation:\
There was just something about the art style that was different, I can't quite say what it is, maybe the characters? I'm not sure, it was quite unique though. One thing about the art that really got me was the backgrounds and settings. There was a noticeable amount of detail put into the backgrounds. I also really love the designs of the different creatures that were in the series. Animation wise, holy crap it was awesome! Words cannot describe it. The more \"actiony\" scenes were stunning to say the least. The animation during the ED never got old. I never felt the need to skip it.\
Sound:\
The OST was pretty amazing. Music wasn't always present, but when the time was right, adding the music in definitely made the scene have a much bigger impact. There were a few tracks that stood out more than the rest though, one particular one that stood out to me was when they first show the main characters of the series. There wasn't an OP, but that wasn't a problem. The ED however had a beautiful song with it. Again, I never wanted to skip it.\
Characters:\
At first, you could probably say that the characters were the stereotypical anime character cast. Shun: Cool headed leader. Satoru: Reckless, troublemaker. Maria: kind, main character's go-to friend. Mamoru: Whiny, scared kid. But soon enough, they all (well, most of them) develop into something else. I don't feel that the characters were static, especially not the main character: Saki. In most series, the main character usually isn't the favorite because of some flaws that show, but it wasn't the case for me in this series. As Saki developed, I liked her character more rather than less. Having the character development really shows how living in a community like that would affect them. I didn't have any complaints about the supporting cast either, they did their job as supporting characters.\
By the end of the series, I felt like standing up and clapping. Again, I cannot give this series anything less than a 10/10. I would recommend this series to anyone who doesn't absolutely hate anime without a second thought. I suggest that you guys give Shin Sekai Yori a shot too.\

    It's difficult to tell or judge what the show was intended to be, probably there was a good idea of some kind behind it. But it resulted in very poor execution. The authors failed to establish characters, they failed to establish intrigue, they failed to establish setting or atmosphere. The result looks very dumb and boring. Dropped afer three episodes, most of which face-less characters were engaged in sense-less activity. It looked completely unpromising.\

    The Bitter Truth\
(please note that it's a spoiler-free review)\
We love fantasizing about the future of humanity. We shake our fists at the stars and anticipate amazing discoveries. Through oceans of blood and suffering, we keep pushing forward, always so hopeful about better tomorrow. The faith we have in ourselves is in fact justified, as we can easily trace the progress made throughout history. Humanity has become more civilized, open-minded, peaceful. And even though there's still room for improvement, our achievements to date give us a firm conviction that we're on the right track... but really, are we? What if it's all just a lie we\
          \
        keep repeating, a convenient lie that keeps us going? What if deep down in your heart, nothing has changed, ever?\
We all have gone through that kind of story at least once in our lives. A story that you get hooked  on with time rather than from the get go, one that you don't necessarily enjoy as much as some more accessible ones. And still it leaves a mark on your soul that won't disappear even long after you finished it. Shinsekai Yori is definitely one of those. Set one thousand years in the future, the story of this anime bears no resemblance to any sci-fi futuristic predictions I have ever encountered. Some would expect a highly developed, space-faring civilization, others would settle for a singularity-based vision of human evolution or even a post-apocalyptic dystopia. That's where the series has already broken with convention. There's almost no technology there whatsoever, except for electricity(very scarce) and some rudimentary accessories. The closest reference for the world depicted in Shinsekai Yori would be the pre-medieval Japan, actually. If I were to classify the setting in some way, I'd say it's a modern psychological fantasy, as it doesn't dabble in hard science and instead draws on an elegant yet improbable concept of cantus. Telekinesis (on the molecular level), as this is what the term refers to, is handled with much care and insight in Shinsekai Yori. It's not just a superpower, it's a potent yet dangerous ability that can lead its user to almost godlike achievements... but also to unspeakable atrocities.\
The aura of mystery and menace pervades the story long before it unveils any of its dark secrets. The animation, even though technically inferior to some high-profile productions, boasts a stunningly beautiful artistic design. Accompanied by equally effective soundtrack, as eclectic as the anime itself, Shinsekai Yori is a thrilling and unsettling ride through a bitter-sweet utopia. It's all the more effective due to profoundly allegoric character of the series. It is an elegant and painful critique not only of the caste-based society, government and blind faith in it, but also of the unspeakable evil that lies dormant in all of us. If only for the unprecedented setting and concept, the anime is worth watching. If, however, you keep a lookout for ambitious productions that aren't afraid to venture where no one else does, Shinsekai Yori is a must-see.\

    Warning: spoilers ahead\
Shinsekai Yori is hands down the best anime I have ever seen. I wish there was a score higher than 10/10 I could rate this. The only thing I found disappointing was the ending, simply because it didn’t do what I wanted it to do (aka it was more sad than I had hoped). \
Story: 11/10\
This is one of those stories that covers a long period of time. If I remember correctly, it covers ~24 years, from when the characters are 12 to when they’re 36. It starts out kind of slow with hints and foreshadowing, but nothing too dark or dramatic. In\
          \
        fact, it’s almost slice of life for the first two or three episodes, but then you realize that everything ties into the bigger story. The story’s pace gets faster with each timeskip until finally you get to the queerat rebellion. This is the part of the show that made it hard to keep watching. There’s so much death and despair and sadness that it became hard to watch after a while, although that’s not a problem with the show. I’d rather watch a depressing as fuck realistic anime than a fairy-tale version of war. But watching all the characters you’ve grown to love dying off one by one was just flat out hard to watch. However, the complexity of the plot, the twists, the pacing, the realism, everything was just beautifully done. I could not have asked for more from this anime. \
Another thing I really liked about this anime was the fact that almost every character came back. In the very beginning of the series we introduce a lot of characters. In most stories, these characters would serve their purpose and then exit the plot. But in Shinsekai Yori, they don’t. For example, Squealer. At first it seems his only purpose is to guide the kids out of the caves and back to safety. After that we have a timeskip and focus on the kids and the school. Squealer exits the plot. But then, after you’ve forgotten about him, he comes back and leads the queerat rebellion. It almost felt like I was reading a Clive Barker novel. That’s why Maria disappearing and never coming back was so disappointing. Also I wanted Saki to be happy and get her lover back. This show is so cruel. \
One more thing I’d like to address: queerats are humans. This completely blew me away. I thought all the surprises were over, but then Satoru comes in and he’s like “yeah Saki, queerats are actually humans”. It was so nicely done, especially since it was done at a time when you didn’t see any more surprises coming. Looking back on it, there were hints here and there about it, but I wasn’t paying enough attention.  \
Characters 9/10\
All of the characters in this show were interesting. We have a group of 5 kids, all of whom are different. Admittedly, some of them were kind of annoying (*cough* Mamoru *cough*), but none of them were dislikable enough to ruin the show for me. Even Squealer, despicable evil queerat though he was, became sympathetic in the end. Slightly. I mean, come on, nobody deserves what he went through. Our main character, Saki, is one of my favorite characters. She feels like an actual human being. She isn’t invulnerable to hardships, but is strong enough to bounce back and be almost the same. All of the characters felt real. They all had flaws, but they were all strong in their own way as well. Except Mamoru. I’m glad he exited the plot. The way the characters change and develop over the course of the story is extraordinary as well. Satoru seems to be that kid in school who’s always looking for attention, gets bad grades, and seems to never mature. However, by the third timeskip, he’s grown into a fully mature adult capable of making rational decisions. The writer of Shinsekai Yori has the ability to wrote both convincing children, adolescents, and adults, which is not an easy skill to master. Admittedly, some of the adolescent kids seemed to have the sex drive of 20 year old adults, but that wasn’t enough to break my suspension of disbelief. \
Art: 10/10\
Not much to say here. The character designs were very nice and I loved the simple art style. The characters themselves were drawn simply and colored simply, but they had a charm to them that made them not appear boring. The way the artist draws plant life and the outdoors was also really amazing, although that might just be me. \
Sound: 10/10\
This show has an extremely wide variety of music. Sometimes it reminds me of Yuuki Yuuna (the choral tracks in particular), but other times it doesn’t sound like anything else I’ve heard before. All of the music fits the mood perfectly, serving to enhance the feelings of the characters and the atmosphere. It’s the kind of music you could play for me and I’d be like “oh hey, that’s Shinsekai Yori music!” The voice acting was good, and I can imagine how much fun it must have been for the voice actors who were cast as queerats (especially Squealer xD). This anime also knew when NOT to use music, or indeed sound of any kind. For example, in episode 24 when Saki and the other guy are going to find the Psychobuster and one of those sea monsters comes and eats him. During that whole scene there is no sound at all, and rather than taking away from the intensity of the scene, it serves to heighten it.\
Yuri: 10/10\
Because who doesn’t ship MariSaki? \
There are very few times I feel comfortable using the word “masterpiece”. However, Shinsekai Yori is one of those anime that I feel deserves that title. I have never watched an anime that was as good as this one was in terms of complexity, atmosphere, characters, and of course, the twists. Madoka is the only one that comes close. I’m still upset that Saki didn’t get her Maria back, but it seems she managed to get over it. Poor Saki... I recommend this anime to everybody (unless you can’t handle exploding body parts and every character you love and cherish dying). ",

    Full disclosure: in describing some elements of the series I necessarily make use of specific examples from the series, and therefore the reader should be forewarned of spoilers.\
\"[People are] forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate...inequalities under a mistaken notion of expediency, the correction of which would make that which they approve seem quite as monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn.\" - John Stuart Mill\
Shinsekai Yori is an engrossing tale that merges the intimacies of a coming-of-age story with the grander narrative of a future society molded by the necessities of humanity’s new powers.\
In the future, every member of society is telekinetic.\
          \
         It is more than being able to move large objects with their minds: humans are able to affect the subtle structure of the world around them with subconscious desire.  It is a level of control over our surroundings that far surpasses anything humanity has ever experienced.  On the surface this sounds like a utopia, for humans no longer need fear the world around them.  However, this immense Power has brought forth a terrifying reality: humanity’s greatest threat is now itself.\
The strange truth is that the description I gave above is surprisingly close to the current state of affairs for humans in developed nations.  Almost all of our stress and want come from the actions of other human beings, not the environment.  If we lack it is not because of the inability to provide, and more than ever our fate is in our own hands.  This verisimilitude to our current state is what allows SSY to surpass being a simple supernatural-themed series about telekinetic children and cut to the heart of what makes society tick when it moves beyond the subsistence level. \
The Good:\
The strongest parts, if it was not already made clear, are the setting and exploration of themes using this futuristic society as a model.  It is world building at its finest, taking real principles and exploring their implications in a novel setting.\
Foremost, there is the moral logic behind their community.  Killing children is generally considered wrong.  Yet early on we are presented with a situation in which this society watches them so closely, and judges their actions so harshly, that they can be disposed of on the basis of seemingly minor transgressions.  How is it that this “advanced” society can see this as justifiable in any way?\
To understand, we must take a step back and examine morality in light of human society.  In biology, cooperation is a delicate balance between self-interest and group wellbeing.  Humans are no exception to this.  We give up some of the autonomy of living singly for the benefits of living socially.  Our moral structure reflects this, with a mixture of individual and group values that are often in conflict with one another.  Our modern concept of “rights” is an attempt to formalize the line which societies cannot cross; rules of thumb rather than laws of nature. \
In our 21st century democracies we have come to prize individualism more than any other group of humans in history.  We have this luxury due to the immense improvements science and technology have wrought; there is little need for any of us to sacrifice to ensure the whole survives.  But this was not always the case.  In tribal cultures, infanticide is commonplace.  This isn’t due to callousness or misguided superstition.  It is a response to necessity: if the tribe cannot support more people, then it risks starvation by supporting too many mouths that cannot feed themselves.  The needs of the whole must outweigh those of a single life, regardless of what “rights” they have.\
The world of SSY bears a greater resemblance to the tribal condition than our own.  In this situation a single child with dubious qualities may result in a catastrophe.  Even a single failure can result in the annihilation of their society.  It is a risk that their own history has shown is not worth taking.  As repugnant as their behaviors seem to us, there is a strong justification for why it must be the way it is.  It is we, as 21st century viewers, who are misguided by our long acquaintance with individualism.  For the elders to pursue a sort of hopeful carelessness, praying that the worst does not happen, is far more inexcusable than the policies they pursue.\
The presentation of this moral structure is another of SSY’s strengths.  The narrative pursues a purposeful misrepresentation of the situation through the eyes of the children.  We are so easy to trick, falling into the trap that surely the children must be the ones in the right.  After all, who doesn’t assume the little trip up the river, beyond the barrier, was nothing more than harmless fun?  Or that when the censorship of the past is discovered, that it was clearly unnecessary and malign?  And of course, we are all hoping that Maria and Mamoru escape the town and live happily, away from the vile clutches of the Education Committee.\
Yet as it becomes clear later: these events are what directly led to Shun’s mental disintegration, the Monster Rat rebellion, and the Messiah fiend.  The adolescents, rather than seeing things in a clearer fashion, were dangerously ignorant of their world.  Their well-intentioned fumbling was the catalyst for disaster.  It was a testament to the quality of the series that it causes us to sympathize with the protagonists while having them in the wrong.  However, blended with the true faults of the society (its dehumanization of the Monster Rats, the miscalculations on the part of the committee) it is not a simple message about trusting authority, but a more nuanced insight into what drives them to do what they do.\
Finally, I want to end this section with a tribute to my favorite character of the series: Squealer.  Squealer is not a likable character.  His appearance is unattractive.  His behaviors are a mixture of servile groveling, cowardice, and vindictive anger.  Even his name is pejorative.  Clearly he is inferior, we think.  And yet, just like how we are misled about the nature of the society, so are we placated easily by our assured superiority.\
Squealer is both intelligent and cunning.  He is not a brave warrior like Kiroumaru, but a driven and idealistic rebel who cares deeply about his cause.  More disturbing to us, his beliefs are not without merit: he and his race are subject to gross inequalities, both under their own queens and the lordly “true” humans.  Seizing the opportunity presented to him, Squealer hoped to better the lot of all Monster Rats.\
I do not seek to justify his terror tactics.  Like many revolutionaries before him, he views the potential good of his cause outweighing any evil done in its name.  However, the desperation of his situation and the power of his arguments cannot be ignored.  In one of the best scenes of the series, Saki asks him to apologize for all the deaths he was responsible for.  His retort is simple: he will happily apologize, if only she will apologize first for treating his kin like chaff.  The scene ends with no response.\
The Bad:\
As excellent as Shinsekai Yori is, it has a couple noteworthy flaws.  The first is the overall quality of the animation, which noticeably dips on several occasions (the backgrounds remain striking, however).  Episode 5 in particular looks to be done by a different studio, and is frustratingly incongruous with the rest of the series.  However, I don’t wish to spend too much time haranguing on this; it simply makes me a little sad that SSY wasn’t given a better treatment.\
There are also plot points that feel slightly forced for the sake of the overall story.  Many of these occur in the early episodes of the series while the children are stuck in the wilderness.  I was incredulous about the ease with which they gained access to the wandering library, bypassing all regulations by the simplest of threats.  The explanation as to how the children got all their powers back was equally convenient.  Finally, the odd menagerie of mutants and technology (gas pumps) that the Monster Rats had access to seemed out of place.\
The Tokyo segment also has a distinct sense of being unnecessary.  While it does give an opportunity to become more acquainted with Kiroumaru, the series could have resolved just as effectively by remaining in Kamisu 66.  Overall it felt like more of a detour than a natural progression of the plot.  This and other parts don’t individually sink the series, but it does make it feel flimsy at certain points.\
However, despite these shortcomings SSY is a marvelous piece that seamlessly links intriguing concepts of social morality with a harrowing story of children growing up in this brave new world.\

    Humans always dreamed. We dream all the time. We have dreams we all want to fulfill. Thanks to our imagination, those dreams can be endless. Everybody has imagination and anybody can have any kind of thoughts at any time. But what can happen if what we imagine, even what we dream (awake or sleep), at least just a piece of it, can become real? Great? Just remember than some people have nightmares, some people are evil, and some others are completely rotten.\
\
Shinsekai Yori really gives credits to its title, a fantasy new world in Japan 1000, years ahead in the future, where people have Cantus:\
          \
        A complex kind of telekinesis, like an extension of the body for those who use it. But we will see that Cantus is much more than that.\
Shinsekai Yori will show us a beatiful but complex world, filled with weird but interesting creatures, societies that hide lots and lots of secrets, and the story of Saki and her group of friends and how they are dragged to figure out what's is behind all the darkness and mysteries. An outstanding tale where the years go and go, and we will get to see how much each character change and get stronger or weaker. We will see how much Saki grows up and start to face her fears.\
This anime doesn't care of genres or beliefs: with a precious style of animation, a fluid motion, watching all the exciting plot twist this anime has to offer, and a gem of soundtrack, Shinsekai Yori can break any expectation. You will see beatiful settings; both endings will let you feel all the story going throught your thoughts and your body and the final episodes will let you with a sensation of \"Damn!\".\
Because nothing is perfect, it has some flaws: A slow begining where you can feel a bit bored, and some few episodes just in the middle of the story where you can feel that again; but the story will always snowball out of control, hit you in the face, and you will feel it hard. Each arc is really interesting and will end with a surprise.\
My conclusion: Shinsekai Yori is a master piece of anime. It is the anime that nobody knows about but everybody should watch. I really want more people to watch it and appreciate it as much as I do.\

    A classic example of curiosity killing the cat, Shinsekai Yori, follows the lives of a pair of five young children: Saki Watanabe, Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, and Shun Aonuma.  A millennium later, Japan has become a self-proclaimed utopia. However, the children see it, the parents know it, and the community hides it: there is something horrendously wrong with their society. Rumors circulate about problematic children disappearing, and questions are not only highly discouraged, but also risky. It’s immediately apparent that this community was never intended to be a utopia; rather the community was meant to emphasize the value of philanthropy, at the\
          \
        cost of “unfit” individuals. The fear “random chance” eradicated the possibility of a utopia; outliers—defective people—cannot be prevented but they can be removed. \
Shinsekai Yori borrows from the science fiction genre to provide both innovation and explanation. People in the small society have all been subject to genetic modification—specifically altercations in sexuality—and they follow a strict “PK” system, where if they kill or attack another human they shall self-destruct. In addition to the “PK” system, humans have mental blockages which prevent them from considering harming each other. Furthermore, individuals are given special powers known as “Cantus”, otherwise known as telekinesis. The powers are unique to each character, and there is a certain code of ethics that each individual with cantus is expected to follow. \
There is also another major species in the series called “Queerats” or “monster rats”. \
They’re grotesque looking rat-like creatures with human speech and thought. Although, some of the Queerats are considerably intelligent, a majority of the Queerats throughout the series are depicted as animalistic and more instinct orientated. Their main purpose is to provide slave labor for the humans—much to their dismay of course. \
Sexuality is an important aspect to the show. The characters will be shown from ages 12-26. As you watch, you’ll notice most characters are bisexual, but there are some characters which can be considered primary heterosexual. Don’t mistake sexuality and romance for fan-service, there’s relatively none of that. At times, the PDA levels can be a little discomforting for some—regardless of sexual orientation—but it’s all with good purpose. Romance isn’t a primary focus, but it is essential to the overall plot. Alongside romance, there is platonic love, otherwise known as friendship. Shinsekai Yori develops relationships beyond sexual desire, but there’s actually more “extrospection” than introspection. Most of the characters learn and grow through their environment, rather than going through self-revelations. \
Since sexuality is so lenient, the anime effortlessly—or maybe inadvertently—distances itself from gender-roles. The reason the deconstruction of gender roles succeeds is because nothing is shoved into the viewer’s face. You won’t even notice that gender-roles aren’t prominent, because it’s not something you’d really look for.  For instance, not all females are strong-willed, but neither are all males, that’s because the focus is character, not gender. That’s what real life is like, gender stereotypes exist, but cannot represent each individual—which many forms of media seem not to get. Many shows have the mistake of simply switching gender-roles, as if they’re trying to claim “hey our show isn’t sexist!”; Shinsekai Yori does not do that. One of the perks of shifting away from stereotypes, is that the characters are much more interesting and relatable.  \
Also, it should be understood that Shinsekai Yori is very plot intensive, therefore, you have to pay attention each episode, as even the tiniest incidents often serve as explanation for future events. There are some unexplained plot-holes in the anime, but many viewers claim “plot-hole!” too quickly. Often times, the so-called “plot-hole” has actually already been explained in previous episodes, or will be explained in the following scenes. \
One of the most vocal critiques of the anime concerns its characters, as some find them plain or underdeveloped; I disagree on both accounts. Although each character is certainly unique, they each steer clear of excess. Often times, characters receive an excess of stereotypes, the loud out-spoken boy is limited to loud and vocal actions, or the most intelligent girl never makes mistakes. I would argue that Shinsekai Yori maintains a well-rounded main cast, which facilitates character attachment. For examples sake, I’ll highlight two characters in the story, first is the most important one, Saki, the narrator. The story is told in her perspective as an adult—boy does she have a beautiful voice—and she remains the central perspective throughout the anime. There’s no reason to dislike her, she isn’t overtly shy, nor is she stupidly outgoing; she best be described as “balanced”. This doesn’t mean that there’s not reasons to like her though. Saki is curious, and compassionate, she’s not remarkably intelligent, but she is undoubtedly smart and capable of independence. Faced with various obstacles, she manages to display vulnerability, without appearing pathetic. \
Satoru is a unique case though, a few times he comes to questionable conclusions regarding morality. His decision making process and bold statements come off as odd to the audience, and although he undoubtedly talented and book-smart, he often times has controversial opinions. What’s crucial about his character to the story, is that he demonstrates how easy it is to be limited by perspective. Throughout multiple events, he makes subtle developments in character that can be seen through his opinions, and is perhaps one of the most growing characters in the story. \
I found the animation above satisfactory in color, movement, and character design. There were definitely times the animation had significant quality declines—specifically one or two episodes—and at times certain events the animations became inconsistent. The animation utilized bold colors, to create an atmosphere that emitted tension and combined with sound to create fitting tones, and dramatic scenes. Bone-chilling OSTS played during climatic moments keeping viewers on edge at all times. The ED song “Wareta Ringo” is one of my favorites, definitely worth not skipping, especially because the animation is worth watching too. \
Shinsekai Yori doesn’t overwhelm viewers with overly complex themes, instead the anime introduces simple ambiguous concepts, and highlights human hypocrisies. Watching Shinsekai Yori is a cinematic experience, you’ll find yourself completely immersed in the plot, and even when it’s over the anime will resonate with you. It’s been a few years since I’ve last watched the anime, but it’s still my favorite anime to date. Thanks for reading this review! ",

    I don't even care if I get slayed for this, I'm just going to say it, this anime is a big mess and just extremely sloppy...\
I've read reviews where people were saying how the anime was deep and took a lot of analysis or that it is realistic.... Personally, I think the writers for the anime was trying very hard to be deep and artistic... They honestly should have just followed the manga a bit more closely.\
The story was simply poorly executed, intriguing at first but then the characters themselves just kind of throw that out of the dust with their irrational thinking, and no,\
          \
        just because they are children and they are from a closed off utopia does not automatically excuse them of their stupidity.\
We start off with a sort of mystery about the world outside and the world in their little village and our main characters are given the \"truth\" from this weird... jelly.... thing... that was really unnecessary design in my point of view. The children are shocked about what they hear and before they can find out more they are discovered and immediately in trouble... If they were to go back to the village and just have their eyes opened to have fucked up their village is and they fight to survive or change it, that would have been a lot better!!! But no, instead we are put on a spot where they forcibly put the characters in an awkward and random almost sex scene which was just... what the flying fuck? Then a war between the queerats which literally came from nowhere. Since when could queerats actually SPEAK human language, I knew they had their own language but apparently they can speak like humans too? Fine, fine, I will accept that... we move on...\
Satoru gets his abilities back and instead of getting back to the village for safety... he claims they have to fight them so that they aren't in danger anymore. Uhm, why not just hurry back to the village and ohh... I don't know.. GET HELP? Apparently killing and stuff is only bad when you do it to humans but the writers and director DOES realize that killing and cruelty to animals is one of the signs of becoming a killer or serial killer, right? And these weren't just animals, they had human intelligence. But oh well~ I guess that doesn't matter, despite the fact that they are in the future and that study is and was an easily known fact!! Pfft, not at all, no big deal if you destroy and entire colony of the species. As you can tell, this is when I really started to dislike the anime.\
There's still a lot of reasons why I dislike the anime, I didn't completely finish it but I got pretty darn far and I decided I didn't have to put up with its stupidity any longer. The people who wrote the anime did not consider many things, they'd take one part of the extreme and just blow it up but then completely ignore the other. Stopping humans with powers from killing with it? In a society where having powers is the norm, it'd be like how we are living now, basically it's like everyone going through puberty, it's not a big deal. But the way they were saying things was like saying just because someone has a gun, they'd go out and kill people with it. It's not true. There's a lot of factors that go into someone actually killing another and just because a kid is causing trouble or is going through some angst doesn't make them a killer or that they will become one. The characters dismiss a lot of things really easily and it's not because they are brainwashed but rather that's how the writers wanted them to be. That scene where they were running away from that bad ass queerat because they were afraid the people would order it to kill them.... but instead of trying to run away from it all, they run back to the village that they thought wanted to kill them??? Why run away at all then? Where's the logic in that? Am I the only one who is seeing this?\
As much as I would love to go on about it, I think this is enough to prove my point of my opinion. I was extremely disappointed by the series, I read some of the manga as well and I'm wondering if it's just the case of bad source material as well. \

    The artwork and music are well done, and help contribute to the spooky/dark/depressing atmosphere. But as far as characters go, arrogant, noisy, and overly-prideful main characters just aren't my cup of tea. With Shinsekai Yori, I just can't find any of the characters likeable. What has kept my attention is the plot. As someone who has not read the novel, I'm interested in finding out if the village has some sort of dark secret/if they're founded upon a lie. \
All in all, it's passed my \"three episode trial\", and I will continue watching. \

    Shinsekai yori .. I must say that one of the things that i'm proud of, is having Shinsekai Yori on my \"Completed anime\".. this anime worth so much .. the reward at the end made me praise this anime .. \
\
If I had to chose a word to describe this anime? Masterpiece. It managed to drag my attention since the beginning until the end and it managed to blow my mind with almost everything it has to show. Clear your mind of all clichês you already saw in psychological anime.. forget everything you know about dystopia anime.. this one will amaze you. \
Unlike 99,9% of\
          \
        the anime that take place in the future where we have robots or huge machines or a planet destroyed by pollution or whatever the fuck it is, Shinsekai yori has.. a different thing. A new way of living, thinking and act. \
I think you already know what this anime is about .. human behaviour. But don´t think you will watch something like Psycho-pass or anything like that .. again and I repeat: Shinsekai yori has something new to show. \
Shinsekai Yori is about a utopia created 1000 years from now.. it talks about the human nature and how can we control it and take advantage of it. It explores the possibily of \"what if\" instead of just presenting us with something that we already know about. Let's get started. \
Story: 9/10. If there is one tiny problem with this series is tiny mistakes that we can think off while watching the anime. They creat an amazing story, a well crafted one but still I think there are some things that just could be different and don´t make a lot of sense to me even though being a totally different world. \"Why they didn´t had anyway to stop that if they kew how devastating it would be ..\" is the question that was left behind and I think it could have an answer but it doesn´t. \
Plus towards the end, I don´t know why but the anime speeds up a lot and tries to make some action or anything like that and it just looked terribly bad. This is the main reason for not having 10/10 on the story. \
The rest is just amazing .. great story, great world, great fantasy, great plot twists .. what else could you ask? \
Art: 7/10. Well let me tell you something : I loved the art okay .. but I can´t deny that it is bad. Especially when it comes to action scenes. We can notice the mistakes in the animation, it looks bad for the most part. \
But .. the pallet used, the design of each character, especially our main character, Watanabe Saki, it looks so natural and fluent. It fits so well with the themes and with the plot that it seems that it was intended to (who knows maybe it was ..). \
Do you wanna know a funny fact? Many companies didn´t took Shinsekai yori because and i quote : \" It was too hard to draw scenary retreated in the book\". I think this only proves how awesome this anime is. \
Another great point about the art is how it manages to creat amazing environments and how it manages to retreat the feelings of some character. Often we see metaphorical meaning atached to the anime that only could exist with the right art so .. they did an excelent job. But again, in technical terms the anime is not fluid nor well made, unfortunately. \
Sound: 8/10. .. no words. Just listen to the OST that I have on my profile and you will understand the greatness of this anime. Amazing OST that is often used as a opening(this anime doesn´t have an opening theme). The only problem with that? They kinda screwed up. At the beginning that track is only used to finish some scene and start the episode. It usually was used after some mind blowing scene or so .. and the impact was huge ! But after some eps they abuse of that track , they start using it everywhere and it ends up looking bad. \
The first ending is fucking amazing as well. Every single episode hearing those first seconds of the ending was a pleasure to my brain. What a magnificient way of ending an episode. But it ends up being changed and the second ending wasn´t that great. The rest of the tracks used are fine, nothing like the first ending and that track that I talked about but still good enough. \
Character: 9/10. Watanabe Saki was one of the best protagonist i've ever seen so far. I loved her. The voice acting was delightful to hear. Great personality, great density. She can be considered as a bi-dimmensional character since she has two sides. Watch the anime to explore each one of them ;) I won´t spoil a thing. \
The other characters are likeable but .. well they are just normal characters. The only thing that they all have in commun is the unpredictable choices. We can´t really tell what will they do because we never know what's going on on their minds. \
Enjoyment: 8/10. Well this is the weakest point. The Achilles tendon of this anime. In order to present us such an amazing story and characters, this anime needs a lot of develop, which means a lot of dialogues and explanations, in other words, boring stuff. The first 10 eps are really hard to watch. Mainly based on plot develop and character develop, the first 10 eps are essencial to the anime but that doesn´t mean that they are good. Don´t get me wrong, I still liked them but I couldn´t watch more than 2 eps at a time. \
After 10 eps we really get to the good stuff, the good material which is their adolescence. Oh did I forget to tell you? This anime follows an entire life, since the young age of 6 years old to the adult age, 30 years. Another great point of this anime. By doing this, we experience how is it living in such utopia by hearing our witnesses. And that is really such an amazing feeling. It makes us wonder how it would be like. \
After the 10th ep, this anime just gets better and better until the very last moment of the last episode. I was amazed .. with a huge smile on my face saying \"It ended\" ! And this is a rare feeling though. Not often I say this because normally is always something missing or something that could be better. This time .. it didn´t. \
Overall: 8.5/10. I can not forgive the lack of enjoyment at the beginning and the flaws that it has but still this anime is really worth to watch. It has my seal of approval and I reccomend it to everyone! Even if you find it really boring just give it a try, don´t give up in the first eps.. \

    This will be my review for 'Shinsekai Yori' (SSY for short). I want to start by making a few statements to give you an idea of where I am coming from. First, I finished this anime within 24 hours of this review. I was told that this show was unlike any other and that the ending is outstanding. Lastly, I hate this anime with a deep passion, but I think this is an incredible anime without a doubt. Now I will try to convey my feelings towards this show and why I don't think it deserves the right to be called anything near a \"masterpiece\".\
          \
        This review will include minor spoilers. \
Prelude - 10 (Outstanding)\
The setting SSY takes place in is Japan 1000 years from the time that we live in, so roughly assuming it takes place in 3000AD, but it doesn't look like what most people would expect. Small villages, no technology, a lot of greenery, and the people live off the land. There is only one twist, the people of that time are able to use a type of telekinesis they refer to as 'Cantus', which they learn to begin to master at a very young age. Those who can not keep up with the teaching of school, or break the \"Code of Ethics\" they disappear from school. They learn while young that the world outside away from the villages is a very dangerous and when the 5 protagonists venture out too far from the village everything goes downhill from there. \"What are humans?\" \"What are fiends\" \"What are Karma Demons\" \"What happen to the kids who leave the school.\" \"Why can't I remember?\" All questions that the 5 young protagonists start to ask themselves. \
Art - 10 (Outstanding)\
SSY does an incredible job when it comes to the animation, the way each character is drawn is remarkable and beautifully done as they tend to stick to natural hair colors. The scenery is great, the rivers and trees all give off the proper atmosphere of how they live in their small villages and how every day life is handled. SSY has done an incredible job, I'll say it again, with the art. I look forward to new series with the same art style.\
Sound - 10 (Outstanding)\
Just as the art SSY did a fantastic job with the sound, the opening music played at the beginning of each episode was a soothing start to any episode, it never failed my expectations when it came to this. I am truly impressed by the sound.\
Characters - 7 (Good)\
Now, this is a very tough subject for me. The lead Saki is a fantastic but not perfect character, she's just an average girl that wants to know the truth. She gets scared easily, but always is able to snap out of it and keep moving forward. Shun is a great \"older brother\" type character that seems to take care of the group in general, Satoru is your general goofball that grows up into an incredible man who is willing to protect his friends with his life. Maria as the supporting character to mainly Saki and the 'weak link' of the group Mamoru who is typically the only one who thinks rationally about the consequences of their actions. It's a great cast but as the story progresses the importance of some of these characters seem to fade to the sidelines near the end.  Which deeply saddens me.\
Development of the Plot - 6 (Fair)\
I had problems with the development of the story. They occasionally, from time to time, repeated facts that were stated before. Now, this is sometimes due to the circumstances of the protagonists as to sometimes they lose their memories, but these 'reminders' take a bit too long. Not to mention the actions of one of the protagonists and what he/she has gone through doesn't even matter in the long run. In the end he/she is only used to give us a physical example of knowledge we already had, once again that doesn't matter in the overall plot. Now, I am not saying that the overall and final plot of SSY was horrible or even bad. I am talking about the development, I watched this series in roughly 4 days and often found myself saying \"I know this already\" as the show wasted 12 minutes to flashback to an example. \
Story - 7 (Good)\
Now, majority of what we learned the previous 17 episodes was simply information to understand this world. The final plot takes bits and pieces of the information we have learned and creates a great finale that I myself didn't expect from this show. It gives you the most unexpected finale that will make you watch the last 8 episodes without moving. \
This was a great way to end the anime, but was it the best way? \
Lets talk about this below.\
Enjoyment - 6 (Fair)\
 I have a wide range of genres when it comes to anime. I might give a show like Yuru Yuri a 9 and give Ergo Proxy a 9 (Hypothetically) but does that mean they were equal in terms of quality? In their genre yes! Probably so. I try to ask myself a question while watching a series \"What is the author trying to show me?\" Does he want to make me laugh, does he want me to understand how valuable family is, does he want me to ponder the way I've lived my life? What did he want to tell me by showing me these 25 episodes of this anime? And I had a very had time figuring it out while watching SSY, and I came to a conclusion. One that made sense considering the development of the plot and the resolution, and what I think the author was trying to say is \"Survive, no matter how tough life gets Survive there is an end to your suffering\" With the way the plot develops the trauma the protagonists go through and all the hardships, even though the story seems to repeat information, \"Survive\" remains a realistic reason to the entire story. \"Saki, Shun, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, YOU. Survive, there is an end to your suffering.\" \
Overall -  8 (Very Good)\
I believe personally, that this show is far from being a masterpiece like the other reviews, but I will not hesitate to recommend this series to every single person that shares any type of interest in Anime. Regardless of the score you give it, although I can't personally being rated lower than a 6, I am sure that everyone could say \"I don't regret watching SSY.\" \"SSY was a great anime.\" \"I'd rewatch this series.\"\
Thanks for taking the time to read this review. \"Survive\"\

    This is just my opinion on the series. Before going full butthurt at your favorite animu I suggest to think about my points.\
Story - 6\
I didn't generally like the setting, however that doesn't mean it's a very unique setting, the story is very simple, and gets explained around episode 4, anyway, the progression is incredibly predictable, it's so easy to understand which character is going to die, there's barely any mystery after a few episodes.\
Art - 7: The animation isn't something you can really complain about, if you can overlook the off-models. It's not the best animation I ever watched but neither the worst\
Sound -\
          \
        6: How many times did I have to hear the same overused song in almost every episode (I mean the one that plays at the beginning of episode 1)? It's really a drag, and the fact that it's bloody overused makes it even worse. Apart from the first ending song, I can't remember any remarkable song from this anime.\
Character - 3:\
I detest the main character, she's basically the princess in distress which I hate to death. But why not add some romance to it? I dislike romance, but it's so bad in this show that it didn't give me even enough time to whine about it. Furthermore, even if it's later explained, they act like sluts, they're in love with somebody from their same gender and play hugs and kisses, while later they fall in love with someone from the opposite gender, both male and females. I can't really tell which character is the most irritating for this.\
Enjoyment - 2: If you're here to \"enjoy\" the show, you're just delusional, honestly, there's nothing to enjoy except the slowest development ever and the never ending many dialogues which sometimes take whole episodes to finish, I can explain the enjoyment with one word: BORING, I almost fell asleep while watching this show, it became a real torture to watch it, and I didn't get satisfied in the end either because it was so predictable I might have even saved time by not watching the final episodes.\
Overall - 6\
I expected a wonderful work of mystery and psychology from this show. It's not the worst anime I have ever saw, but it didn't hold my breath even once as people make it look like. The development is so boring that watching Peppa Pig would honestly be less boring than this show. If you're looking for a fast paced anime, forget about ever watching or enjoying this. If you wish to watch something slow, sluggish, and overly boring or you want to waste your time on a mediocre show, go ahead and watch it, but don't expect anything new from this show. I'm truly glad it sold so poorly. There are plenty of novels/manga which deserve to have an anime adaption, why did they even make this one?",

    I watched Shinsekai Yori long, long ago. The reason I never really reviewed it is from the fear of being too biased towards the show since I instantly graded it 10 and labeled it my all-time favorite anime. You must be asking: \"But --- but, it's still graded 10 and still your all-time favorite anime! What's up with that?\" - now that I've re-watched the show, knowing the ending and all of the twists basically, I was able to catch a few to several inconsistencies in story, world, art, characters etc. - but did it really take away anything from the show? Not really. \
Shinsekai\
          \
        Yori tells a story that spans over the fourteen years in total, with two time-shifts in its entirety. Both time-shifts occur after some meaningful events so to keep this review spoiler-less I'll try avoiding the talk about them. The story is told from the perspective of Saki, a young girl with friends and family like any other. It basically starts with their little group having a camping trip and learning something they should have not - as well for us to being exposed to acts of foreplay between two twelve year old kids. Oh well. In essence, if they had never learned what they did that day, they would have never really been caught up into story THAT much - we'd still have some conflicts which had affected the world, but the story this way is quite personal. \
Since the story in itself has numerous twists I cannot go into detail, so I'll try and go roundabout. In a sense it's a fantastical story but extremely realistic at the same time. It's put a thousand years into the future of today, with humans living seemingly peaceful lives full of love and care. The story consists of several twists and turns - some expected, others not as much - with some certain \"hey, what about that? That's not the way you said it was!\" moments. These moments, albeit rare, do somewhat take away from that episode - but not from the entire series. It is a story more turned towards mature than kid side, having several twists which are extremely thought-provoking all through to the end and beyond. It starts as extremely slow-paced establishment and basically nothing happens until episode 10 or so - only world building. For some, like me, who really appreciate world building this has come as a breath of fresh air. Before the story essentially kicks off, you're pretty much familiar with world - its origin and its present, which helps a lot when trying to accumulate thoughts as to why certain things are happening. Extremely well done and crafted story - that's all I've got to say.  \
The first thing you'll most-likely notice is imaginative art. While it may not be spectacular and ever-evolving, it is certainly different. It's extremely well done and oftentimes it shifts as the mood of the scene changes - gradient hues take over, coloring the world green/purple or any other dimming color. It has it's bright moments of course, but most of the major events occur in dark spaces. Another thing I must praise this show for are the backgrounds - they are absolutely breathtaking. I'd take a bet that in each episode you can extract at least 4-5 beautiful, completely different wallpapers for your desktop. While animation may be lacking sometimes, some scenes are extremely well done (like Saki falling through the sky, or Saki and Satoru running through the tunnels etc.) and worth a praise. Characters are all unique when it comes to art department, each having its own distinguishing trait but also quite some symbolism in the very character department - Saki, throughout the entire series, remains as one character (out of main ones, to be precise) who is most-likely to be present in real life. For instance Maria has extremely long, red hair and blue eyes, Shun and Satoru have hard-to-make hairstyles as well as that kid no one really remembers. In that sense it helps us to relate to Saki from whose perspective this story is told. \
On the other side of production team we have sound. I've got to say - if the soundtrack of \"The Fountain\" is my all-time favorite movie OST, this Shinsekai Yori wins in anime department. \"Kage no Denshouka Dainibu\" to list one of many is simply shiver-worth soundtrack which befits each scene it's placed into. It's quite grappling and, even when listened outside the context of series, is extremely beautiful - to an extent where I'd put it among my favorite themes ever (probably just after \"Death is the Road to Awe\" from Clint Mansel). Voice actors (and actresses) put up an virtuous effort in delivering their characters. I especially must give credit to Namikawa Daisuke, a man who gave a voice to the character of Squealer - probably the most amazing performance among amazing performances. So yeah ... production ... much wow. \
Now we come to the character department. It's really hard to label these characters - not because they're not developed or anything but because they're just simply ... humans. All of them (oops). They all deal with certain issues in their own ways, each tackling a certain problem the best way they see fit. That's what makes each of them unique and fun to observe and even relate to. For instance, Saki has qualms about dealing with at-the-moment perilous situation, but she has easier way of moving on. Satoru on the other hand handles the present situation which requires quick answer easily but has a harder time of moving on. And so on and so forth. All these things make each character you see in the series developed and ... relate-able. Regardless of whether you like them or not, when their story comes to fruit, you can feel for them all the same. That's one of the greatest strengths of Shinsekai Yori - characters are not badass stereotypes who go round spouting badass one-liners. They're all humans - they can act though, but that's all there is to it - an act. \
This has been my longest review since ... well, ever. The reason being is that I tried to deliver Shinsekai Yori to those who hadn't watched it the best way possible without spoiling anything - which is actually extremely difficult. All the juice of Shinsekai Yori lies in the spoilers. But oh well. I managed to slip one or two in there. I'm a monster. \
I quickly understood that Shinsekai Yori won't be for everyone. Aside from two frame yaoi and yuri moments we have in the 8th episode (man did a lot of people drop the show because of it. Why? Beats me.), Shinsekai Yori starts extremely slowly. And the pace never really goes over-the-top-full-of-action. It always takes its time to establish things and characters, without simply rushing head-on to the conclusion (well, aside from first 4 minutes of last episode ... BADASS MOMENT!) . At times it has weird art-style and the story is simply sometimes hard to follow. It's quite thought-provoking and I can see why some people would simply get bored of it. All I'm asking of you is to give it a chance. Watch an episode per day if you find it boring and if you keep tackling the issues the show is, I promise you you'll have a great time.\
Now, do I recommend Shinsekai Yori? Well ... isn't that kind of obvious? I do. I may still seem biased (probably because I am?) but that does not take away anything from the show - if anything, it should help you decide whether to pick it up or not. Pick it up. It actually just might surprise you. \

    Initially I thought this was going to suck.  I'm almost positive that I audibly groaned the first time I watched an episode thinking to myself \"wow, this looks insanely childish.\"  The art grew on me.  Just about everything with this anime grew on me and I'm pretty sure that's why I like it so much today.  I know there are people out there who watched this show when it premiered in 2012, but I feel like a lot of us overlooked it entirely and that's kind of a shame.\
The story creeps.  It sticks with you.  It could just be\

    In this world, we often have to question ourselves \"Is this TRULY the right thing to do?\" What is right or wrong, who makes those rules?\
In Shinsekai Yori, five kids will try to seek the truth of their Utopian community. \
Story: Shinsekai Yori's strong point is the strong and powerful plot that keeps growing after each episode. The first few episodes you watch will give you the impression that the show is only about the adolescence of 5 kids. Before you know it, a more serious and dark plot will start to unveil itself as you watch. Without a doubt, Shinsekai Yori's intriguing and unique\
          \
        plot deserves a lot of praise and will surprise you along the way.\
Art: The first few episodes will have pretty normal art, one that isn't exactly bad yet not extremely beautiful either. I do remember however, there was one episode where the art was completely messed up. Other than that, in my opinion, as the story went on, the art changed. For better or for worse, I think that it really matched the mood and setting of the story.\
Sound: Shinsekai Yori never really had a real opening, but it's first ending was extremely well done. In fact, it was one of my favorite song of Fall 2012 anime songs. The second ending was not bad as well, but just not as good as the first one. There was one OST that played throughout the beginning of the episodes that I really liked. It gave a kinda creepy mood and matched the story.\
Character: Saki's character development throughout the show was amazing. Slowly discovering the truth of the world and adapting to it. I thought her character was well portrayed. Each and every character had an important role that they played in the story. Yakomaru aka \"Squealer\", was a significant character as well. Without revealing too much, I'll say that his character is much more than who you'll think he is. \
Enjoyment: This easily became my favorite anime of Fall 2012. The surprises, the heartbreaking moments, and the final truth all contribute to make what this anime is. I would look forward to watching this every week. I truly amazing anime in my eyes.\
Overall: What more do I need to say? The truth that lies within this story will be one that not only chills you to the bone, but will also cause you to question yourself the truth of this world. This is the story of 5 kids \"From the New World\".\

    The fall of 2012 is remembered by most as the fallen age of sword art online, and it is remembered by some as the beginning of psycho-pass. Some remember it as the year of love, releasing four sensational anime containing or immersed in romance. The following season may be remembered as the restart of gintama. Perhaps some remember the rise of love live.\
However, to me, save a single season, the entire year of 2013 will be remembered as the year Shinsekai Yori was introduced to me.\
Shinsekai Yori, also known as From the New World, a well-known name given to the second movement of Dvorak's 9th\
          \
        Symphony, is, simply said without bias or of personal lenience, a masterpiece. It is the reason I immediately denounced Tomino Yoshiyuki's claim, father of Gundam, when he suggested in an interview that the former masterpieces such as Evangelion, Grave of the Fireflies, Ideon or Gundam will never appear again. He was wrong; it has appeared, and no one noticed. Not even the father of Gundam.\
Shinsekai Yori's premise is simple; it's a retrospective future Japan, and it is the closest description to a utopia...on the outside. A world where the entire human species is capable of wielding PK, aka psychokinesis, referred to in the anime as cantus. It is a power only restricted by one's imagination, and as long as the user's imagery supports, anything is possible. It's a world devoid of worries of food or water or other necessities. It's a world without poverty or personal differences. It's a world neglect of crime. It's a perfect world......\
Or so you'd think.\
The entirety of the anime is dedicated to revealing the facade of this make-believe utopia, with the message \"from the new world\" echoing to the past clearly and loudly:\
What would you do?\
A simple, short message that no one in the generation of people\"s\" could answer. Politicians tried and failed. Lawmakers tried and failed. Religions tried and failed. Kingdoms tried and failed. Democracies tried and failed. Civilizations tried and failed. Scientists tried and failed eternally.\
The beauty of Shinsekai Yori is this: perfect depiction of reality. Generations have tried and tried and tried, utilizing every bit of emotional and practical resources throughout the ages with different civilizations and governance, and the result is a world engulfed in fire and ashes. The forefathers died at the hands of a tyrant for us to send more generations of youth into hell bent monstrosities. Our ancestors worked tirelessly for education, and in the end we were able to secure a worldwide system of brainwashing schools and parents. The firsts of us invented ungodly technological advances so that we may find the quickest and easiest methods in which we could ruin strangers' lives at the tip of our fingertips and convince the better part of our generation to buy items of \"priceless\" worth.\
The future is bright and unknown. This has been true for every part of every generation. Future always holds the answers, the treasures and values unparalleled. Future is a rainbow; full of color, waiting for us in the roads ahead. It is, therefore, too late when we realize the terrible truth;\
There is no rainbow. There is only ever the reflection of the past lights, past greatness, and basking in its brilliance is beyond our physical capabilities. We will continue to seek the future, longing for its brilliance, and it will be just a little beyond our reach, and it always will be.\
The bright future will never reach us.\
As for its demerits, the art is of no brilliance. It is certainly acceptable, as it won't be eye-cringing enough to stagger the storytelling process, but it is worth no praise either. It is one of those animes where the sole greatness of an anime is wholly contained in the story and not in art or sound or anything else.\
in discussion of sound, there is no noteworthy need to mention soundtracks, but it is without its flaws. The overall theme of mystery and terror is kept steady throughout the anime thanks to the wonderful compositions of three different artists, and the two character songs by the voice actresses Taneda Risa and Hanazawa Kana are of superb quality and of similar theme to the story. The art and sound are of no great quality, admittedly, but they do a wonderful job of adding onto the surreal, mysterious and screeching mood of the story.\
In conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece. It is a perfect parallel of the real by the introduction of the surreal. It incorporates the complexions of the society without unreasonable claims. It was an unparalleled experience to watch this anime, and it is not a suggestion but a necessity.\
Go on and feel the reflection of our world, \"from the new world\".\

    Minimal spoilers here:\
Overall, I enjoyed this show because it sought to ask tough questions and explore dark themes. For example, what is it that makes us human? How natural is the order humans have established? To what extent is sacrificing humanity necessary for stability? Who holds truly holds power, and is that rule just? How does age impact perception of the world and its evils?\
Additionally, I felt that it incorporated elements that make it unique from its other dystopian-world anime counterparts. Shinsekai Yori aims to introduce ideas like evolution into its main plot, something we don't typically see shows like Psycho-Pass. \
Even though the anime\
          \
        starts off with the protagonists as children, I thought it did a great job of blending in darker themes into the kids' adventures. IN fact, I think the show introduced its dark elements best because the protagonists were kids. The show definitely makes you feel like you're growing up alongside the characters, and there will be heart wrenching moments along the journey. Furthermore, I thought the relationship between the two main characters was beautifully developed as well.\
Now, my qualms.\
One problem with shows that aim to provoke too many deep questions at once (with a limited budget and episode count) is that not all of these questions are answered and not all of these ideas are addressed as deeply as they need to be. My main issue with the show is that some of the themes from season 1 (e.g. proper perception of children, dangers of the subconscious) don't seem to get the justice they deserve in season 2 and the ending. Some of these themes were very prominently featured in season 1, but I felt as if they weren't fleshed out enough in season 2.Maybe it's because season 2's emphasis on an existential threat and the characters' maturation has changed their perception of the follies of society introduced at the beginning of the show. Still, it just doesn't feel like all the loose ends were tied. Season 2 introduced some thought-provoking, disturbing ideas too, but it felt mostly plot-driven to me. I could see that the creators were trying to show society's internal issues through the manifestation of the existential threat introduced in season 2, but it could've been better incorporated. Supposedly, humanity's supposed to make progress, but I don't see concrete evidence of how. I expect grand reform, but the reform feels so much more subtle and not grand enough at the end.\
My other qualm, more minor, is the relationship between the supporting characters. Although they are featured prominently at times, they tend to fade out during others. Some of these characters appear so much that they end up acting like motifs, but I don't feel like the explanation of their continued appearance and role (long after they're gone) is explained well enough.\
\
Welp, those were my thoughts. To sum it up, I enjoyed watching it overall, but I definitely felt like the ending wasn't quite satisfying for me. The anime aims to explore deep themes, but not all of them were fleshed out well enough towards the end. The shift between seasons both made sense to me and felt inappropriate at the same time. I could understand where the creators were going with the plot, but I wasn't quite satisfied with how season 2 ended.\

     It's been a long time I wanted to write a review about Shinsekai Yori, an anime that give a lot to think that is even hard to pull out this in words, what makes review quite difficult.\
 Shinsekai Yori is with no doubt one of the best animes out there, with well developed characters, an attractive narrative and a realism rare in any other anime. It has the depth that other animes lack. For the very same reason it is not to everyone, it is not fast pace, neither focused on action. It is however a very well developed psychological drama, that gives you\
          \
        a very interesting lore and background to what it really wants to show: a discussion about social relations, human nature and ethics.\
 The story is very well told, with the beginning of the initial episodes showing intriguing moments of the past, which motivates the viewer to keep watching and find the answers to how civilization achieve that state, instead of quitting due to the somewhat (although necessary) boring beginning. After that the anime is very well developed, deluding the viewer, at the same time that put the answer in front of him. It permits great moments of climax full of plot twists, where the episode ends and you stand still looking at the monitor, or want to watch the next episode and see how Saki and his friends will react.\
 The characters are very very well developed, at the point they seem real, especially Saki, Satoru, Shun, Maria, Kiroumaru and my dear Squealer. Watch them from childhood till grown up, and the changes and the relationship between, and how the worlds grows in complexity as they grow too is... contemplative, it's like watching an artistry painting over an outline, and when they're teenagers is the time it seems more beautiful, is the moment the series reaches its peak.\
 Although the main characters being the most well developed, they're not in a paper world, the characters around them plays a great role, besides a greater role, since the mains characters, seems to being nothing but used by them. The history behind that world and the creatures the inhabit them are too very well detailed, the queerats especially. The more you dive into that world the better you can see its true colors. All theses characteristics are so overwhelming  that I forgot to say: they have powers!\
 I recommend Shinsekai Yori to anyone who want a deep anime. The influence and the consequences of power instead of the show of power, enlightenment instead of entertainment, and wish to see realistic humans behaviors and relations,  full of philosophical nuances. Shinsekai Yori is a lesson about power structures and how things are not exactly how they are, and how the world is more twisted, complex and gray than we think, instead of simple and black and white.\

    Shinsekai Yori contains the most powerful story anime has ever told.\
This review will be less about what facets of the anime I feel are excellent or flawed, and more about how my lifetime has led me to interact with the human process of storytelling.\
I have been watching anime since I was a child, from sneaking out of bed to catch each week's Detective Conan on Adult Swim, the mature and shonen animes on old Toonami, to having a computer of my own in my teenage years and relentlessly consuming all kinds of anime. At 21, I have invested in thousands of stories, shows, and books.\
          \
        I understand when I enjoy an anime for being a guilty pleasure, for being overpopular but underrated in quality, I've had my phases of Death Note and Code Geass and arthouse projects like Genius Party and Serial Experiments Lain. I appreciated NGE, I've appreciated a lot of stories.\
For music, for anime, for anything, I have never been a person to have a favorite. It seems impossible for my mind to weigh the emotional reactions stories have gotten out of me and rank them. I can accept that I had a stronger connection to characters but noticed flaws in screenplay or motivations. I can accept many of the flaws in every show and suspend disbelief to enjoy or analyze the message that is being communicated to me by a work. I have not discriminated against any anime that used fluff to hook viewers while trying to tell an incredible story. I have not favored greatly any anime that had a poor or rehashed story but still drew me, particularly, in. I have seen nearly everything, so even shows that surprise me even still do not qualify as remarkable qualities for a favorite, because I will be surprised again, and surprises by nature do not mean much.\
I did not know what kind of show I would be getting with Shinsekai Yori, but I did eventually realize I was following a dystopian setting and its characters along. I noticed along the way that these characters were being portrayed very honestly, and the story was being told in such a way that I would have to appreciate worldbuilding, I would have to appreciate character growth, and I would get to enjoy a few twists and reveals. All elements that capture attention.\
On the path to all this, it is hard to put an anime on a pedestal simply for following what are good steps for a great story. It is hard to justify putting an anime on a pedestal for going beyond that and reaching me emotionally with its great story. But something here, about the entirety of this show is remarkably praiseworthy. I can't say that on almost everything it was executed perfectly, and I can't guarantee that the experience I had watching it was the same powerful experience everyone will have, given the context of their lives or what things they may notice in the show that will tug at the ego and create a critical frown. \
I can only tell you that for someone who has lived a life swallowed up in stories that I do not live and never will, who enjoys being drawn into fantasy and being consumed whole by it, Shinsekai Yori is the most incredible thing that this medium has ever delivered. I look at Cowboy Bebop, I look at the Studio Ghibli classics, any other top title you may have seen and after having watched this decide that was better, I understand. Many shows have an irreplaceable, unique charm, and a fresh take that may resonate strongly with people. I cannot pick a favorite, I will tell you that Shinsekai Yori has its own unique charm. It has created its own fresh take, it has not managed to disillusion me with any of its characters or its storytelling devices.\
I do not feel as if Shinsekai Yori is pushing agenda or narcissism onto me, in a very innocent way it is simply delivering many messages that are up to you to prioritize. It does not seem to come from an imagination that has motives or takes sides. It possesses the honest delivery of people, places, and events that are required to tell a story. It is unfailingly impressive at provoking deep emotions, and it is uniquely impressive at provoking questions that can be very hurtful, circumstances that can be so gruesomely true when translated into philosophical questions that you may desire to think on it quickly and move on to watching the following events on screen out of fear that these questions will penetrate too deeply. It has that ability.\
This anime will be my favorite anime from now until the end of the medium. I was not planning on deciding anything like this before I watched it or even getting close to the climax. But when I thought of what I liked and what I did not like, it was so muddled to me how to rank this show that I think if there is anything that can be called a favorite it must be the most unique thing you have ever encountered. \
Following that philosophy, I might run into another problem that I have absolutely ran into before when trying and failing to pick a favorite. There are many unique shows out there. But often I cannot convince myself that the show, although breaking new ground, will not just inspire another show of a similar genre with more honest characters, or a more vibrant story, or even with just better production. With Shinsekai Yori, for some reason, I cannot imagine a case where this show is simply the flagship for a new lineage of story. It fits into these genres - sci-fi, dystopian, horror, drama, but these labels seem to me for once as only attempts to model or explain what I've just experienced after the fact, rather than a mold for what I should expect or what lines this story has to follow along to be included in these categories.\
At many moments the show had the opportunity to pull a punch, and it didn't. At many moments it should have, and it did. At many moments it set the stage for development, but it took its time or it assumed on the part of its viewer that these developments were part of the all-encompassing world built within the show, and that because I acknowledged them, they were there, and it proceeded to deliver its messages with cool disregard for leaving me behind or catching me up.\
On every single level Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece, not of one genre, but a masterpiece in the sense that intelligent human life on this planet is a rare miracle. Stories are the species' way of celebrating that miracle, a species lonely that they are the only ones who will care to appreciate what their own lives meant in this humming corner of the empty universe. Stories are a celebration of us, people who live for a handful of generations and die to the indifference of all matter around us except those who remember us, who will too have their stories forgotten. Shinsekai Yori cries out to that lonely instinct to appreciate human sacrifice, desires, and growth, hoping that others will carry on even a whisper of who you were and what you dreamed hundreds of years after you are gone.\

    Well to start things off let me just get one thing off my chest….. DAMN UTOPIAS YOU SCARY( cant we have one that works for once?). Now that that is out of the way; the review.  The dystopian sub-genera of science fiction is not anything new. We’ve had literature, Hollywood, and even other anime do it. It generally presents on the surface a “perfect” society, with no bloodshed and all inhabitants with apparent happiness. Then what we discover about the society is much more sinister. Shinsekai Yori is no different in that regard. Yet, it does have things that make it stand out amongst\
          \
        other shows of similar type. One, the society itself is very interesting and unique in its organization. Its “methods” are different that most other dystopian shows. Let me explain, the society of Shinsekai Yori is a society of psychics a millennia in our future. Which has come into being from reasons that will be revealed (No spoilers).  Why it came together though is a different matter. It was in order to preserver absolute peace. This because psychic’s, even kids can kill tons of other people with a mere thought.  This is the reason for this society, its in order to protect them, form themselves. Certain “methods” are used in the show. Which you and the characters will slowly figure out. These “things” are done in order to preserve this peace. What is interesting is that the people doing the “methods” really do not wish to do them. This is different than most others in this genre. There is simply irrefutable logic on what they do based on the past experiences of the Psychic race. They simply are afraid, and must do “things” to preserve the now 60,000 people living in Japan. Shinsekai Yori is known for its amazing world building. You will learn all the reasons for the society and the uniquely organized world they live in. In appearance it looks and feels like one giant Buddhist temple town. The plot is organized to build the world and set the tone (which is creepy and mysterious mostly); the plot truly is to build the world. It’s the discovery of each truth through our characters that you also discover with them. This is what makes the show. You will be shown, what is in my opinion one of the most disturbing dystopias ever. What makes it so disturbing, is its brutality, and its general irrefutable reasoning behind the “methods”. You wish to argue against it, but simply cannot from what you learn about the past. With a plot to build one of the most complete, interestingly toned, and well presented worlds in modern media, Shinsekai Yori receives a very high (10/10) for story.\

\9Animation was handled by A-1 pictures. Shinsekai Yori is by no means is a perfect show. It had a low budget for a modern anime, and this low budget shows at multiple times.  The details on animation where not complete, backgrounds were plain, especially when nothing with regards to action was happening.  I am not going to lie it made me cringe at times.  It has a redeeming factor, they saved portions of its budget for the most important fights and surreal moments. Shinsekai Yori uses very stylized visuals which I personally loved. Its stylized art does sometimes show the flaws of animation much more clearly. The show also has large amounts surreal moments which are where a good portions of the budget was used( I mean a Psychic Dystopia… not going to be a mind F*** at all). Overall the good and bad kind of cancel out in animation with a final score of … (7/10)\
\9The sound I’m going to say right up front is divine. Composition was handled by Motoyama, Satoshi.  He handled nothing really of note before this show. His sound direction though was spot on. He used Choirs of children along side haunting melodies which set the tone perfectly. My Ost Choice in the Main theme:  Kage No Denshouka Daiichibu; which is a choir of children signing hauntingly with slow drums and guitar in the background. It sounds like a haunting melody of the world which we are shown.  Where it’s hurt slightly on Osts is in general volume; most amines have about 2 hours of songs. Shinsekai Yori on the other hand has about 40 min of songs for 25 episode series. Albeit they are gorgeous, but it is still is a problem as they repeat allot. The show also does not have openings, only ending themes.  Both of which are great and a good tune for the end of each episode. I personally like the second ending better. With a haunting sound track of quality over quantity that sets the mood for this unique world.  Shinsekai Yori receives for sound: (9/10) \
\9Possibly where the show is hit hardest is its characters. Which generally are flat and don’t really have a stand out. This true amongst the humans.  The Rat Monster tribes (species subservient to humans) do have a couple semi-interesting individuals. Squealer, and Kirormaru are leaders of two large tribes.  Both of which have their own agendas.  The Humans though are flat and do not stand out much. There are some great moments, but the basic personality of the main cast kills the mood at times. For a story with a large amount of growing up themes, it hurts it.  This lack of good standout character hinders it from being truly a masterpiece beyond words. (7/10) (Did I mention the entire society is Bisexual with a reason? There are some Yuri and Yaoi parings, so here is a warning)\
\9Shinsekai Yori is a mind bending, stylized adventure, with an amazing world containing well thought out reasons and lore. It’s hurt by flat characters, which are neither bad nor well represented.  Its low budget is also shown in the number of songs, and the lack of general detail in its art at many points. Yet, for its plot Shinsekai Yori is an anime that should not be missed, especially if you enjoy psychological and dramatic shows. It’s a dystopian world of unknown horror and wonder that will shock you to your core. This truly is the highlight of the show and has made it one of my favorite anime of all time, despite its obvious flaws. Shinsekai Yori receives and overall of (8.85/10)",

Full Review:\
Did you ever imagine how humanity would deal with supernatural powers? This anime is an adaptation of a sci-fi novel set in a distant future where humans have acquired telekinetic capabilities. This new world seems almost utopian at first, but something doesn’t feel quite right. That unsettling feeling is shared by a group of five childhood friends, whose adventures form the core of the storyline. What makes Shinsekai Yori special is that it addresses disturbing themes while also providing an entertaining tale of battle and mystery.\
          \
\
Story: 10\
The story is extremely well crafted, as you would expect from something based on a novel. At first, it bears similarities to A Brave New World and The Hunger Games, but it gets completely different in unpredictable ways. The world the children live in holds many secrets, and you won’t get to the bottom of the mystery until the very end. The first part of the series focuses on the relationships between the characters. Then the story picks up, and we understand that what is happening is on a much larger scale. Everything is successfully wrapped up with purpose and sense in the end.\
Characters: 9\
You get five different characters, well fleshed out, and each of them undergo stellar character development. Saki makes an ideal protagonist because she is level-headed and has good judgment. She takes action when she needs to. Then you have a gifted boy, an intrepid one, a caring girl and a sensitive boy, which might sound cliché, but all of them are memorable. All I can say without spoiling is that they are brave and smart, looking out for each other. Indeed, what really shines is the relationship between them.\
Sound: 9\
I think the music is excellent. I can still hear the sunset tune in my head. It is hauntingly beautiful and creates the perfect atmosphere. The songs are a little repetitive, but very fitting to the overly controlled society, giving it a bit of an artificial feel. The voice acting is impressive too, especially considering the characters age throughout the series.\
Art: 10\
Beautiful art and fluid animation. You’ll find spectacular scenery, lovely character design, creative clothing, interesting backgrounds, soft colors, but beware of super ugly creatures. I think art and music work together wonderfully to create powerful atmospheres, most of the time somewhat scary. It is, afterall, a dystopian universe, so even the enchanting landscapes hide a sour truth.\
Enjoyment: 8\
Although the anime did great in every other aspect, I felt the pacing was uneven. Some parts felt like they had been stretched too much, while other episodes were packed with events. That being said, it felt like the anime went through a variety of genres, from slice of life to action to horror. Accordingly, it made me go through many emotions, including disgust, sadness and fear. I thoroughly enjoyed the second half of the series because the conflict takes epic proportions.\
I found this anime smart, unpredictable and moving. Koodos to the creators for staying clear of overused anime formulas. They didn’t talk down to the viewers by explaining everything through dialogue and they actually made good use of flashbacks. I highly recommend to watch this anime till the end. It might not be for everyone, because it is serious and weird, but it is definitely an original piece of work that will have you reflect on various social themes. \

         This is the most terrifying anime I have ever seen. The last time I've felt something like this was when I first read H. P. Lovecraft.\
The terror comes not from vast amount of gore or violence on the screen - because there's almost none. There's violence, but it's all behind the frame, we never see even a single disfigured human body. The terror comes from a pure concepts that this anime explores.\
Story:\
     It's a thriller, it grips you and tightens it's hands around you. You feel horrible, but keep watching and it only lets go at\
          \
        the very end. It's been a long time since I've seen such a good crafted story, with the right hints planted for you to figure out things before they unfold before you, yet with mysteries so clever, that there's a very small of you succeeding.\
Art:\
    I would understand if someone doesn't likes it. It's not \"unique\" it's just that they used flat colors for everything. No shading, no gradient. And I liked it. It looks surrealistic, but it doesn't throw you off at first like Katanagatari or Kaiba did.\
Sound:\
    The tunes kick in the right time and deliver the right kind of emotional push for the given situations. Enhances the story in every way.\
Character:\
     It's always hard for me with characters, usually I end up hating them for doing something obviously stupid and not seeing the situation clearly, or by being too perfect, or some other reason. It's rare that I find characters appealing for what they are in the story, rather for what they are. Characters felt good, I don't know what I can add without spoilers.\
Enjoyment:\
     Enjoyment... There was a lot of it, but at the same time - there was none. I felt terrible. The terror of what's going to happen, the pain in the chest from the sorrow after realising what actually happened. I couldn't say I enjoyed watching it. I definitely liked it, but it was not enjoyment that I felt in the process.\
     Overall it was the best \"horror\" anime I've ever watched. This was a pure terror. And although it already says \"Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity)\", I want to clear up something. There's little to nothing violence on the screen. You never see more than a blood. There is some violence to animals, but very little. And neither is there profanity in any way.\
Yet this anime is not for children. It's too dark and terrifying for them. And for people who don't like seeing gore - don't worry, you're not going to, it's there, but not on the screen.\

    Shin Sekai Yori is a very atmospheric show, largely due to the brilliant OST that dances on in the background, alternating between calm and tempest in the most seamless fashion. I have therefore given the sound a 10, and this is well deserved.\
I think the background art adds to the atmosphere as well but the character art is incredibly dull and boring. While arguably some characters end up looking decent the style itself is bland, as bland as the characters themselves, and that brings us to my main gripe with this show, the lack of interesting or inspiring characters. \
What we have here is a\
          \
        strange dystopia where everyone has been brainwashed and conditioned. While this is a great plot device it also makes for a boring show with flat characters. \
The plot takes time to build up and frequent time skips are used as a device to bring the plot forward and give some depth to otherwise boring characters. I cannot help but feel that this device is abused - as it is used too many times in the space of such a short series. \
While the plot does raise some deep questions about humanity, the questions this show raises are largely ignored by the cast and left to the viewer to consider. The plot itself is incredibly predictable. I already knew how the show would end by the half way mark, and was able to predict the following events quite accurately if not completely so. \
I'll leave it to you guys to judge for yourselves, but I for one was not impressed. ",

    Thank you MAL community for suggesting this EXCELLENT anime. I was like a crack fiend, jonezing for the next SSY fix. Finished the series in 2 days. If you every find yourself confused while watching an episode, or perhaps want an intellectual and insightful commentary, please do yourself a favor and read Tenderfoot's recap at angryanimebitches.com.  I read every single blog post of hers (his?) and found each one to be a particularly helpful guide through the bramble bush of a plot line called Shinsekai Yori. Now on to the review!\
Story: 10. A memorable and abiding story. Hold on to your butts because the\
          \
        story's got so many twists and turns, you'd swear SYY be twerking it (j/k!). We got twists for dayzz! Not many anime's have staying power, and I foresee that SYY will sustain in my conscious, perhaps even engraved for some time. As Tenderfoot mentions repeatedly in her commentary (but not ad nauseam), almost every sequence is intentionally imbued with significance. You probably can bet the barn a prior sequence of events will be referenced to in the future of the story. What a rarity it is to see this level of literary intentionality and craftsmanship in an anime, where a sequence in the beginning of the season would be referenced to in a later episode to provide that \"epiphany,\" making you say OH!!!! Part of the story involves multiple tribes/clans that go to war. While it isn't terribly confusing (a la Tolkien's Two Tower's), it does get a bit confusing when you add Japanese names to the mix. Again, thank you angryanimebitches.com (the name cracks me up) for being true north and giving me the lay of the land.\
Art: 9. I'm so tempted to give the animation a 10. I am no artist. I draw stick figures. Bad stick figures. But even I could appreciate the beautiful colors, seasonal changes, and superimposed characters upon lush static backdrops. 1 point was docked because there were some episodes where there were clear signs of \"budget constraints.\" Otherwise, a beautiful anime.\
Sound: 8. What I appreciated GREATLY was there was no OP. Meaning, no cheesy song in the beginning where the characters stare at you awkwardly, or strike some unnatural pose, or show some bouncing boobies for that fan-swag. THANK YOU FOR NO OP! However, the ending song, and music within the anime was just okay.\
Characters: 8. I don't want to write a spoiler, but there really were only a handful of characters that ever got the full development treatment. The ones that did develop were crafted beautifully. Bad guys were despicable. The good guys were wise and noble. Just wish a few more people were \"alive\" to develop.\
Enjoyment: 9. I bore easily with media consumption. I rarely watch shows, movies, or read books 2x. I watched True Detective 2x. I may watch SYY again. That's saying a lot.\
Do yourself a favor and watch this anime. And someone, for the love of all things holy, please make better SSY T-shirts and fan paraphernalia or us non-otaku fans to buy! The SSY merch is deplorable on google and amazon.\

    Before I say anything I will mention that this is no kitty Anime, It's an anime with deep meaning and is very serious. It starts off slow but if you get pass 5-7 episodes i can guarantee satisfaction, i considered dropping in episode 3 but that would of been a grave mistake. No one regrets watching this anime.\
This anime is enriched with quality characters and a thoughtful storyline, it cover concepts and elements such as: Extinction, Survival of the fittest,human race, superpower (forces), the common good,superior species, and government. read the description for a better insight on the plot itself cause I could possible spoil\
          \
        it and it'll be a waste of space for me on this summary. Thanks.\
I love this anime because of the way it'll make you feel, it isn't an anime with any cheesy endings where it's completely one sided instead it leaves us with our own opinions which means the ending isn't so direct and simple. This anime has many smart concepts which only people that is in highschool or older would understand because it covers biological facts which is very helpful to understand this anime. It's amazing how this anime made you feel emotionally, these are the emotions i felt throughout the anime:\
-Sadness\
-Anger\
-Pity\
-Fear\
-Faithful\
-Happiness (it's not suppose to be a happy anime FYI)\
This anime follows characters throughout a timeline, it doesn't just show the character in one age state, instead the story takes place in a 20ish year interval which I love because we get to see how the characters develop and how the situation progresses throught many years instead of a simple situation dealt with in 7 days.\
With this review I think those who watched it will agree and will encourage people who havent seen it to watch it which is my primary goal at this point because it's sooo good that i don't want anybody missing out\
Thinks we can take from this anime:\
-Whatever the situation we will always have friends to rely on\
-Self sacrafice can be good in some situations but not all\
-Trust in our friends and our society\
-Do anything for your friends as they will do the same back\
-Treat others the way you would want to be treated\
-What is our society? and is it really that good?\
-What can we change in our society for it to be better?\
-Persevere\
\
And always stay true to yourself and to your friends. \

    WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\
I have to admit, I heard a lot about Shinsekai Yori.\
I heard that it was a seemingly slow anime with massive plot twists in the last few episodes; given the show's high rating, I was prepared to have my mind blown. But the show's big revelation wasn't really that big, and I came out feeling very underwhelmed.\
The \"big moment\" of the show, learning that the queerats were in fact descendants of the non-Cantus-using humans, was hinted at in the show ever since the capture of the false minoshiro. Ever since we heard about the Cantus users and non-Cantus users, I suspected that the\
          \
        queerats were the twisted descendants of non-Cantus users. I figured that the big plot twist at the end had to be something else, because queerats being genetically altered humans was a well-hinted twist that most people should be able to figure out. Up until the last few seconds of Episode 25, I kept waiting for something...more out of this hyped-up anime. But it never delivered.\
The twist also matters little; so what if the queerats are descended from humans? This doesn't affect any of the characters, and the only purpose of the twist is to garner sympathy for the queerats and their crimes. It didn't even do that for me; in fact, it did the opposite. If this twist was necessary to make the queerats not solely antagonists, doesn't this mean that the only reason we should feel sympathy for the queerats is because they were once human? This goes against the anti-racist theme the show was trying to create here, showing that hatred against the queerats was horrible as they were the same as humans. Had the queerats been just intelligently evolved naked mole rats, we wouldn't feel sympathy for them; they would just be the creatures who killed everyone. \
tl;dr: The show is alright if you don't go into it with very high expectations; the twist isn't that big and the show isn't that deep.\

    While looking up the description of Shinsekai Yori, we see that it is considered to be in the horror genre. Normally, the first things that pop up in your mind might be: blood, ghost, lack of storyline and that it might be not scary at all! Except, the moment you first watch an episode of this anime, you can sense a unique vibe that guides you to watch another episode. From the New World (in english) depicts a dystopia as if you were a true member of its unique society based on the power given by the “gods”\
Story- 10/10\
The story if a one of a\
          \
        kind. Sure, the subject of a said \"Utopic society\" has been used ten thousand times in our life not only in animes/mangas/light novels, but also in occidental literature, movies and TV shows. So, of course things might get repetitive: a young person finding out that he/she lives in a futuristic place that looks and sounds marvelous, but turns out to be horrific, we all get it. The difference here is that, yes, it takes place in the future, but the fact that we see a group of young people (around 12) finding out that their divine powers have destructed an ulterior society and that their own community based its rules on horrible and terrifying principles is pretty uncommon. Even though some scenes of it might be tough to understand because of their paces, the thoughts given to the storyline are brilliant. A masterpiece to keep you in suspense from beginning to the end.\
Art- 10/10\
My oh my, what beautiful graphics have they used here. The vivid colours and the outstanding vibrancy in pretty much everything is just fantastic. These things put an extra plus to this anime series because not only are they here to put the viewers in a trance (which is kind of what you want in this anime) but to put a \"je ne sais quoi\". Think of it as a mood. I'd personally say that without the art used in this series, my opinion would absolutely be different! \
Sound/music- 9/10\
A creepy mood combined with classical music and choirs? Who would’ve thought that something like this would be that effective? Something interesting that we do not encounter that often in the anime world is the non-existence of an opening. Yup, you heard me well, so don’t think that at some random point they’ll put one… But the fact is that they replaced this almost mandatory factor by some scenes and that just puts the mood to a high standard. Although, the creators have added endings (which, don’t get me wrong, are very beautiful in an artistic way), but from my opinion… they were not that great... But still, the mood the soundtracks put during the multiple troubling scenes was a necessity.\
Characters- 9/10\
The personalities given to each and every characters that we’ve seen in this unique work of art are very important elements since it’s kind of a psychological anime. Although the characterizations were a little vague during the multiple arcs, we cannot deny that the creators did put a lot of efforts so that the numerous main and supportive characters have a significant nature which could change the whole plot of the story. \
Enjoyment 10/10\
Pretty much during the entire time I was watching this anime, I kept wondering what would, could and will happen. There was no particular time I said to myself “it will obviously be this” or “Of course, they are SOOOOO going to do this” and that was something that was very interesting. The fun in this is it kept triggering your mind. Plus, maybe lying and saying to yourself “just another episode” 15 times in a row can also pretty much depict my level of enjoyment while watching it… so, no need to add more words… \
Overall- 10/10\
Finally, I highly recommend you to watch AT LEAST one episode of it during your spare-time even if horror is not your thing. I personally really liked it and all of the little details they put up together was pretty much the main aspect that I noticed and enjoyed… I really do not have anything else to say since everything you need in written just above… :-)",

    Well, this is my first review, I'm sure its going to be a complete shit but I'll do my best. Also english isn't my natal language so be patient, and try to get the idea of my review if you can. I will procced to review this incredible masterpiece of anime.\
In some seasons there are animes that are blessed with the gift of attention, but there are those incredible ones that get eclipsed by their brothers glory (even if its an obnoxious ecchi/moe show). This is one of those hidden gems. \
Story (10):\
What can I say about the story? Its just plain amazing, and even\
          \
        in the first chapters when the action and suspense isn't that heavy, it makes you totally interested in the show and the characters. I don't wanna give spoilers, but if you are one of those thoughtful guys that loves deep stuff, plot twists and phylosophical inner struggles, then sir, you have found what you've been looking for.\
Art (9):\
The art here is very smooth but also easy-to-watch. It suits perfect to the characters and the show in general terms. Very peaceful and chill style.\
Sound (10):\
Since the first episode, \"Kage no Denshouka Daiichibu\" has been the soundtrack of all my emotions through the development of the story.\
But ALL the OST is amazing, it has that mystical and ancient feeling, although the story has place in an \"utopic\" future. Totally recommended.\
Character (10):\
Ok, if you are a intolerant homophobic, in Episode 8 you're probably going to dropped your ass out of this show. But please, don't be like that. The characters are one of the best that I've ever seen. They triggered in me a very high grade of empaty, a thing that very few series in my life truly accomplished to do. *KINDA SPOILER* Satoru and Saki are just great, just perfect for each other, and also both have a high sense of strategy, decision taking and logical resolution.\
Enjoyment (10):\
If you like anime, and you haven't watched this show, watch it.\
It doesn't matter what genres are you into, this has everything in it,\
but in an amalgam that will leave you totally satisfied, but also with a \
feeling of disconfort (in a social and moral way). \

    Note: it’s been quite some time since I actually saw this anime so bear with me with this one, but my feelings towards it have always been quite specific and have never changed so hopefully it’ll work out. This will be done from a mostly critical perspective for once as those are the emotions that stand out the most for me, but please don’t misinterpret this as me hating the show, because that is definitely not the case. Feedback’s always appreciated.\
\
Shinsekai Yori is a show that falls into the category of “misused potential”. It is a series that could, and perhaps should have been one\
          \
        of the best anime in quite some time, but it rather frustratingly stumbles and trips upon itself for completely unnecessary reasons.\
If you take a look at this show from the outside in a general sense, then you’re almost guaranteed to be looking at a masterpiece. The beautiful setting, the original concept along with its darker undertones and the actual sense of realism itself is enough to leave anyone in awe. However if you take a step closer and crack open the shell in order to take a look at the creamy filling of the show, what you’re going to find is sadly not as flawless as first impressions might have made it seem.\
Shinsekai Yori (henceforth abbreviated as SSY) is what I would like to call an ambitious experiment in anime. It is a series that tries to go above and beyond the normal limitations in order to stand out from the crowd. SSY tries to do so much at the same time, and in all honesty succeeds with that fairly well; however it does so at the price of forgetting some of the very basics of what makes an anime great in the first place.\
-- Story – 9/10 --\
Starting with the good parts though, SSY has a rather unique take on how to lead a story onwards. Rather than focusing on its characters directly or even some sort of object or location being the center of attention, SSY’s story is about the world itself. What is this world? How did it end up the way it did, and why? What does the future have in store for it and its inhabitants? How does humanity manage to co-exist with the other intelligent life forms in this world? These are the kind of questions that the story tackles which deviates from the normal a bit, and it does so in a quite interesting and captivating way, as there are a lot of questions to be answered on the grander scale. It also deals with issues such as diplomacy, politics and simply management of a faction in itself.\
From a purely objective standpoint, this is all fine and dandy and all, however it also comes at a price…\
-- Characters – 5/10 --\
…and that is the complete lack of character development. Focusing on the story of the world rather than the story of the characters is interesting and all, but in the end what it did above all was render the main cast of the show into a group of people that would have been better placed as background characters rather than on the front lines.\
Well okay; to revise my initial statement, there *is* character development in this show, a fair bit of it actually, however effectively the entire MC cast of the show is so ridiculously bland and boring from the very start that no matter what kind of dramatic, perilous or supposedly tragic situation they ended up in, I simply couldn’t help but not care about what happened to them. After all, even if someone would end up spontaneously killed along the way, if you don’t even have an opinion about the person in question in the first place, the intended emotional impact just misses its mark. It was most likely that the first thought to come to my mind at such a time would be “good riddance” more than anything.\
-- Art – 7/10 --\
Now this part sends me some quite conflicting signals to be honest. The world of SSY is quite simply beautiful. The vast natural environments and locations which feel like they could have been taken straight out of some MMORPG all have a feeling of reality to them, and it was the kind of setting where you’d like to have a world map available at all times and keep exploring what else it had to offer.\
At the same time however, the actual animations themselves are in all honesty extremely average if you take the fact that this anime came out during the winter of 2012/2013 into account. Above all though, the actual attention to detail regarding the characters’ facial expressions and similar is just simply awkward most of the time, almost as if they were intentionally adding insult to injury for what was already by far the biggest weakness of the show.\
-- Sound – 8/10 --\
SSY uses mainly atmospheric background music for its BGM which fits very well for the theme of the show, and it was a very good OST in general I’d say. There is no one track that stands out though, perhaps with the exception of the ED which was interestingly enough a rehashed version of “Going Home” from Dvořák’s Symphony No. 9.\
The seiyuu cast has some heavy-hitter names in it, which you might argue is a bit sad since their performances had to be wasted on such boring characters, but on the other hand it’d have been even worse without them. Hanazawa Kana stands out from the crowd (as usual you could say) and really tries to bring life to the role she has, but even so a human being can only do so much when you have so little to work with in the first place.\
Regarding the opening theme of the show… it quite simply: Does. Not. Exist.\
Now, I can’t help but ask, was there any reason not to have one? I mean I usually skip the opening of an anime once I’ve heard it once or twice (unless it’s really damn good), but even so was there any actual point of not even having one? Well whatever…\
-- Enjoyment – 8/10 --\
This category is in all honesty really hard to rate and/or comment on. Why? Because SSY does not really feel like an anime to me. Now that can be either a good thing or a bad thing, but the fact of the matter is that it feels more like a documentary mixed together with a historical textbook rather than a show meant for actual entertainment. There are neither any charismatic characters nor any real plot development of the sort that will get your adrenaline running. It is a quite slow story about a utopian world, and spanning a vast timespan while doing so. It gave me the feeling that it was a concept intended to leave you in awe rather than being meant to entertain the viewers, however if it’s not directly entertaining, it won’t leave you in awe in the first place, so it has its own little paradox to work with.\
That being said though, SSY still manages to tease your sense of curiosity concerning what is actually going on behind the scenes of this world, and for that alone I found it pretty interesting so marathoning it over at least not too many sessions wasn’t that bad.\
-- Overall – 8/10 --\
Shinsekai Yori is what I would like to call a blueprint. A theory yet to be perfected about what you can do when you start thinking outside the box. It is a blueprint where all kinds of ideas were added on constantly while its creators were chuckling maniacally to themselves at their own geniuses. However when the invention was all said and done, they suddenly realized that they had forgotten some crucial nuts and bolts in their contraption’s very core; something that was now out of reach and could never be fixed.\
It is a classic case of “what could have been”. SSY leaves me rather annoyed with itself because, while it still in the end was a very good show, it could, and in my opinion, *should* have been so much more. While I don’t think it could ever have reached the top 20 of the MAL rankings as some people seem to claim it should, I’m quite sure it would’ve been top 50 at least if the production hadn’t been so damn sloppy with its very basics.\
That being said though, these kind of experiments need to exist, because humans learn from their mistakes, and maybe next time the 2.0 version of the blueprint will have been patched up and the next true masterpiece will be born.\
All we can do is cross our fingers and hope.\

    \"Maria was born two weeks after me.  She was also premature, and her condition after birth was even worse than mine. I think if Maria had never been born unto this world, then untold numbers could have been spared.\" - Saki, Shinsekai Yori\
The word \"Masterpiece\" is a loan-translation of the dutch word meesterstuk, meaning the work by which a craftsman attains the rank of legend in the eyes of history. It's not a word a true critic such as myself would toss around lightly. (and I will probably receive a lot of down-votes for the bold statement I am about to make) In fact,\
          \
        of the nearly one hundred series I've seen over the years, there are only 3 animes I would consider true masterpieces. In an effort to abstain from angering the masses, I'll keep that bit of unnecessary information to myself. However, Shinsekai Yori (\"From the New World\") is undeniably, unforgettably, and unapologetically a true masterpiece of its time, the most recent of my memory. That's right. This is the diamond in the rough you've all been looking for. Don't let its severely underappreciated rank on myanimelist deceive you, Shinsekai Yori is undoubtedly one of the three greatest animes ever made. This visionary work of art will shake you to the bone, break your heart, and electrify your conscience as it engulfs you in the wonders and horrors of the New World.\
Story: 10/10\
Shinsekai Yori takes place on Earth far into the future, in a post-apocalyptic world after mankind develops the ability to use PK, or psychokinesis, the ability to manipulate kinetic energy and reconstruct matter. The vehicle for the story is a group of five friends from the town of Kamisu 66, who find themselves in the same Class Group on their first day of school, after manifestation of their powers upon reaching puberty. The viewers are given insight into the day to day lives of these children, such as attending school, eating dinner, and going on camping trips. The starting point allows us to grow with them and experience what they experience as a child would, gradually unravelling the mysteries of the world around them. Mystery, of course, is the name of the game. For this New World is not quite like the one we know. For despite their grandiose powers and way of life, the humans live under a shroud of fear for both the dangers that haunt the night, and the darkness that steadily creeps within their own society. \
From there, we watch the children grow up, as they develop relationships, make discoveries, and find themselves in a perpetual midst of peril, sometimes as a product of their own trouble-making, and other times as a product of their fated circumstances. The beauty of this story is that all of these components are seemlessly and simultaneously integrated into the story, like a triple helix. There are so many parts moving all at once, but it's not overly complicated as to lose the viewers interest. As the story progresses, we dive deeper and deeper into the web of the world that the author weaves for us, picking up bread crumbs along the way, all while the characters endear themselves to us along a journey of discovery. It's all very realistic, and beautifully done. The story is not just about discovery and friendship of course. For there is a looming danger beyond the horizon. This of course, is the main plot of the story, and it takes a culmination of the entire series to realize and resolve. Without giving too much away, it's completely unpredictable yet brilliantly obvious and will hit you like a train. \
As I mentioned earlier, this story begins with our heroes after reaching puberty at age 12, but the plot actually time-jumps later on to their lives at ages 14 and 26, eventually concluding with our main character as she turns 36. Each of these main time frames (age 12, 14, and 26) corresponds with one of the three mythical creatures that's introduced to us early in the story, namely the Trickster Cat, the Karmic Demon, and the Ogre. These three myths act as a sort of theme and bookmark for each of the main chapters of the story, which can be further broken down into 5 separate arcs, if you include the False Minishiro and the Monster Rats. Confused? Good, you don't need to know any of that to truly appreciate this piece, for unlike similar stories in this genre, all of the mysteries of the future will be explained in due time in the most satisfying of ways. In other words, you don't need me to explain everything to you. Just be prepared to have your mind blown.\
What doesn't get fully explained, however, is what became of some of some of the characters (Shun, Maria and Mamoru), relationships (Satoru and Shun, Satoru and Saki), and plot elements (Saki's ability to reconstruct telomeres). A lot of that is sort of left unresolved or half-baked, perhaps out of necessity for time. The society's resolution and any potential move for change toward the end wasn't really explained either. But this does little to take away from the main point of the story. What does take away from the story however, is one particular episode (episode 22) that wasn't really up to par with the rest of the series. It was just sort of out of place in terms of quality because of some minor uses of deux ex machina (which was completely non-existent up to this point), lack of research (such as mistating how some well-known chemical compounds work), and just lackluster storytelling in general (in that it was kind of boring despite it's premise for action). It caused me to momentarily snap out of the world they had immersed me in for 21 episodes and back to reality. This one episode even caused me to question whether the producers had the talent to bring the story full circle (they did). But in essence, episode 22 is a great illustration of Shinsekai Yori's greatest challenge - it's own extremely ambitious expectations. But it's a good testament as to the strength of the series as a whole to say that out of this entire 25 episode series, there was only one episode that I found to be imperfect. \
Art: 10/10\
A-1 Pictures did the animation for this series. You might remember them from animes such as Ao Exorcist, SAO, and most recently Aldnoah Zero. However, the art in Shinsekai Yori seems more akin to that of Princess Mononoke, except enhanced to a modern HD quality. The action and animation does remind me a bit of Ao Exorcist, however. In case you're unfamiliar, both references were major compliments. The scenery of the world is beautifully drawn. The characters, even moreso. The designs of the other creatures that inhabit the world were terrifying, but in a good way. The only thing I found a little strange about the artwork was that I felt that when the characters grew older, their necks got a little too long. But that's something that's hardly noticeable, without someone pointing it out to you. Oops. Regardless, the art is of a very high quality, and the design is spectacularly creative. The directoral contributions also deserves a shoutout. What more is there to say.\
Sound: 10/10\
Let's start by noting there's no opening song to this anime. That's mainly because the creators were focused on immersion into the world they created, and having an intro song would have come off a bit tacky for a work of art like this. It did have a closing song though, three actually, and they worked well. The first closing, Wareta Ringo by Risa Taneda was easily the best. It was very catchy, fit well with the story, and was maybe even Ipod worthy. The other two aren't very noteworthy since they weren't on the show very long, nor were they very memorable. The sound effects, and background music was all very well put-together, and was crucial to creating the air of tension and suspense upon which the story was set. The voice acting was also very good, although I've only seen the dub for this anime. I noticed that the male lead character for the english dub sounded a lot like the guy who played Sunohara in Clannad, which I thought was hilarious for some reason. The characters actually aren't very similar. I think they did a good job of changing the voice acting slightly as the characters aged while retaining their unique speaking styles, particularly with the deepening of tones. Although, they might have gone a little overboard with the female lead character's narrator voice (supposedly at age 36), which was way lower than the cutesy voice she spoke with for the vast majority of the story (between ages 12-26). It's not really that big of a deal though. In short, it might be worthwhile to note that this is one of those animes where you can literally identify each and every character by their voice alone. Pretty impressive if you asked me. \
Characters: 10/10\
The thing that struck me as special about this anime was that none of the characters were driven by plot devices - the fate that typically moves stories along. In other words, characters didn't do things inexplicably merely to move the plot along. Rather, each character stayed true to who they were, and made realistic decisions based on their past experiences. They asked the same questions we would have asked, were we in their shoes, and made the same decisions we would have made. This all added to the sense of realism to the whole experience.\
Shinsekai Yori really pulled away from the pack in terms of character development. While at the start of the series, there's a slight hint of cliche anime archetypes - the loud obnoxious wild child, the cute and quiet tsundere girl, the beautiful and outgoing best friend, the handsome genius, the random guy that doesn't talk. But as the story progresses, these archetypes are quickly dispelled as we discover something deeper within them at the core of who they are. They're all clever, lovable, and beautiful children. But they're also all unique individuals, causing us to miss each of them when they're gone. For example, with the main character, Saki, I couldn't help but find there was something about her that drew me as a viewer to her. The story strangely mischaracterizes this trait as \"strength.\" But by the time I reach the final scenes, I realized that what made her special wasn't strength or tenacity, but rather her endless capacity to love even the greatest of her enemies.  Even the antagonists were sympathetic, as they were acting in accordance with their own circumstances for survival. The lines of good and evil were blurred in a sense. There weren't any \"bad guys\" per se. It's much more complex than that. \
Speaking of complexity, I'm sure most of you have heard of the term Love Triangle. Well, the relationship web in this anime is more like a Gyroelongated Triangular Bipyramid than any Triangle I've ever seen. Basically Girl A falls in love with Boy B, who's dating Boy A, who's in love with Boy B, who's actually in love with Girl A, who's dating Girl B, who's in love with Girl A, who sleeps with Boy A, who if you remember, was her love rival for the affections of Boy B. Girl A also sleeps with Girl B, and Boy A also sleeps with Boy B. Girl B also sleeps with Boy C, who's in love with her, even though she's in love with Girl A. \
Strange as it may sound, it all actually makes a lot of sense when you see it all play out, and the ones you hope will end up together strangely do so. Despite all this love tangling, there really isn't a whole lot of jealous infighting going around because the five friends all support and love each other very much, and for good reason. Plus, they have bigger things to worry about. It's all rather genuine. None of the relationships seem forced, which only makes each goodbye that much more heart-breaking. The dialogue is also fantastic, with one particular monologue in episode 16 being the best monologue I've ever heard from an anime.\
One thing you may have noticed is that pretty much all of the characters are bisexual. One important thing to keep in mind though is that their world and social norms are completely different from our own, so it would be silly to judge them by our standards today. In particular, sex in their society serves a function beyond mere reproduction that's explained briefly early on and will make more sense if you've been paying attention up to the final arc. As such, sexual conduct is encouraged, regardless of gender or even age really. It's an interesting look at a society indifferent to modern groupthink notions of love and sex. There's no porn though, so don't worry, and you don't have to be bisexual to enjoy the show, obviously. But it's probably not for children under 13. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Visionary, Immersive, Thought-provoking are the words that best describe this work of art. And at its core, it is simply that - a work of art. For this reason, the only category where this piece fails to receive a Perfect 10 is in the Enjoyment department. While I would easily rate this series above well-regarded heavyweight contenders such as Code Geass and Steins Gate, I didn't really enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed the aforementioned shows.  That's not to say Shinsekai Yori is not enjoyable. The art and action were fantastic, the characters are likeable, and the story is one of the most thrilling and memorable I've seen in a long time. What I mean is that the show, in general, doesn't really seem all that concerned with entertaining you for the duration of its 25 episodes. There's no fan service or clever quips, there's very little humor, and the episodes only end with a cliffhanger every once in a while. This piece was more focused on story-telling and realism, like a true work of art.\
Another thing that hurts its score as far as enjoyment goes is that it is extremely thought-provoking, which sounds like a good thing, right? Well, not for the average viewer who's looking to relax on his coach and kill some brain cells. This show will force you to take a good long hard look at who we are as a society, where we come from, and where we are headed, even going as far as to call into question what it means to be human. For that reason, it is not a lazy watch by any means. Those are some things to keep in mind when deciding whether and when to give this anime a shot. In my opinion, this is one that's best left for a rainy day when you've seen it all, but just want to have your mind blown one last time.\
Overall: 10/10\
All in all, Shinsekai Yori is one of the most memorable series you'll ever watch, and rewatch. It is a staple of hidden gem animes. Give it a chance, and if you have questions or want to discuss, feel free to message me. Until next time, Cheers!\

    Well, Shinsekai Yori for me is great anime! One of the best I've seen! However this anime might not be for everyone as there are a lot of concepts to understand and get the gist of which makes this quite a mature anime. For this anime, it required A LOT of patience so I wasn't exactly very fond of this anime. But in the end, it was definitely worth it. So if you want to try and give this anime a chance, try to watch it up to episode 4 as it's a pretty slow start at the beginning. What I like about this anime\
          \
        is that it's very realistic and gives you a lot to think about, there are absolutely no cliche bits which is something that I see in a lot of anime but Shinsekai Yori doesn't. On the other hand... This anime doesn't give any thought for your feelings and reveals the harsh truth. (Like I said, this anime isn't exactly for everyone but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it for mature audiences unlike myself. A 13 year old and my big brother was pretty surprised that I understood and liked it)\

    I hated this anime after the first few episodes. It comes back to life a few times then sucks again but ultimately the end was satisfying and EVERYTHING is explained. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone honestly I kind of wanted to die watching it because the story is all over the fucking place and nothing is explained until later... :)\
Art is beautiful (the reason why I was drawn to it).\
The synopsis for this anime doesn't sum up the entire anime AT ALL be warned there's two separate story lines (In the town VS. outside of town with the Queerats) going on for most of\
          \
        the anime, they get connected later on. The Queerat stuff was definitely what made me hate this anime and want to stop watching it multiple times. It never goes away but it does get slightly easier to bear watching as you go along.\
The music is alright but there isn't much variety. If you like chorus you'll be okay.\
Characters don't have much of a personality. One emotion from beginning to end. There were only a few times in the last few episodes where I could relate to the main character Saki.\

    There are those stories that get made into films, that don’t offer anything of visual value. Then there are those that use the visual way of storytelling to its extent and accomplish something that wouldn’t be possible without a screen to display it on.\
I think Shinsekai Yori, or From the New World, is one of the latter.\
Story\
Every anime has its strongest point. Shinsekai Yori isn’t an exception. The story and the amazingly fleshed out world are by far the best part of this series. Everything is thought through, and the dystopian world is unique.\
Many stories that are about our dystopian future, tend to be focusing\
          \
        on the way our world as we know it has ‘ended’ and the people that live in that future are still struggling with this fact. Shinsekai Yori is different in that it turns this around, and the inhabitants of this new world are mostly unaware of their history and have gone back to living in small settlements, separated from the outside world. With twists and tricks of its own, the story contains more mystery than you would think on first glance. The further we travel along our companions, the more we get to unravel the history of this new world and the more we get sucked into the plausible world that has come of it. I think that is the true beauty of this anime, the way we travel along with its characters and come to know things they didn’t know either.\
Shinsekai Yori gets a lot of praise for its ending, which isn’t surprising as it’s a great one, but I think it’s truly noteworthy how the story develops and how its themes are shown in a way that makes the story flow and how the art and the music support this.\
Characters\
As every anime has its strongest point, there has to be a weak one too. With Shinsekai Yori, this weak one are the characters.\
It’s not that the characters are awful by any means, they are, for the most part, a likable cast of characters that gets some good moments and that means something for the story. But that doesn’t make up for the things that lack in the character department. As the beginning of this anime focuses more on the world and its setting than anything else. This isn’t something that makes the start bad, but as the story gets a really good start and sparks the interest, something else has to pay for it. In this case, the characters have to pay. With the lack of development for most of the characters in the beginning of the series, this results in a second arc that’s mostly about characters we don’t really care about. \
The first arc focuses on Saki and Satoru, while the other members of the group get little to no development at all. When the second arc comes around and focuses more on the other members, the whole thing starts to come down. This arc is the worst in this series, as we get some ‘emotional’ scenes that we don’t really care about because of the characters that are engaged in these scenes. Because of this, my enjoyment of the series went downwards and that is something that shouldn’t happen with a story this good.\
Animation\
When movies or series are based on novels, their greatest challenge lies in transferring the words and descriptions of the world into visual counterparts that stand strong in their presentation. I think the art itself is beautiful and creates a world that is believable. I think it’s really great that the environment is made to look pretty and peaceful, especially in the beginning, to connect with the peaceful atmosphere, as we’re meant to believe that the world is peaceful and righteous. But when things get gloomy, the art gets more gloomy too, which is something you can’t obtain with a novel.\
On the other hand, the animation is really disappointing and lacklustre. In my opinion, the animation isn’t as important as the art, so I still gave the overall section a 7,5. But I have to admit that it did strike me that the animation wasn’t handled well and that it was really sloppy at times.\
Sound\
The soundtrack of this anime sends shivers down my spine every time I hear those songs. They really fit the anime and help create an atmosphere that is necessary for such a mystery fantasy. I especially loved the  OST called the Traditional Song of Shadows. It set a tone to start every episode. The lack of an opening surprised me, but to me it was something unique I actually liked. I liked getting into the story, with this OST in the beginning of each episode to still have an opening feel.\
The first ED was really nice. It’s probably one of my favourites, although I can’t really explain why. It fitted the anime in a way I can’t explain.\
Enjoyment\
For me, it’s really important for an anime series to be able to entertain me. That doesn’t mean it has to have lots of comedy or fights all over the place. In this case, I enjoyed the atmosphere Shinsekai Yori created. I was curious how the story would deliver, but I didn’t have to worry. The history that got revealed, really intrigued me in a way I wasn’t expecting.\
Summary\
This isn’t an anime for everyone, so I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone. But if you enjoy fantasies and stories of dystopian futures, I think you’d like this one. I think this is one of a handful of fantasy series that delivers such an amazingly developed and fleshed out story.\
To be a masterpiece, I thought an anime had to deliver on all levels. But Shinsekai Yori convinced me that this isn’t necessarily true. It isn’t perfect, but nothing is. I think a series that intrigued me in a way like this deserves to be called a masterpiece.\

    This series seems to have received a lot of good ratings and while it was quite good at keeping you at the edge of your seat I have to say that it failed in a lot of aspects.\
Art:\
Maybe this is just my opinion but I thought the character design was not be suitable for the theme of the series. There are shows like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica that also have this but the character design in Madoka was quite unique and it stood out making you guess. In Shinsekai Yori the character design is really common and it reminded me of some shoujo anime like\
          \
        Yumeiro Patissiere. This is the reason I say it does not seem very fitting. The eyes were huge, even for an anime and it seemed out of place considering the world they were in. I also noticed an inconsistency in one of the characters as they aged. Other than that I think I preferred some of the episodes where the art changed even though it was really strange and by the end it was a bit better. I really liked the backgrounds and the color palettes were really nice at times. Also, the character designs for the queerats were really good.\
Story:\
I think this is were I had a major problem with the show. First, it begins with one story arc and then it jumps into another one without having given a conclusion or resolution to the first one. In the end the first one is given a sort of vague resolution. The world that was being built in the very beginning lead us to believe something and then near the half of the series everything changed. It challenged certain views and morals only to throw them out of the window later on for the sake of a plot twist. I don't think it was bad but it was quite abrupt and it completely changed the theme of the story. In short the narrative didn't follow a clear pattern.\
Sound:\
I thought the first ending was really good and I really liked listening to it and there was also a track that I noticed and really made me excited so I would say there sound was very good.\
Characters:\
The characters were not developed enough in my opinion and there was a lot more room for their relationships to grow. Some things seemed abrupt again there were a lot of \"love triangles\" or something of that sort. Saki, the protagonist didn't have anything outstanding about her other than something that is mentioned later on. However that broke the rule of \"show, don't tell\" because I don't think it was depicted really well in the show that she had this sort of personality. Another of the main characters kind of seemed like a plot device to add into the angst rather than anything else which was a shame.\
Overall it was a good series but I was quite disappointed as it showed interesting theme which were explored poorly.\

    This is a story where the antagonists are the main characters. Either that, or it flips up the romanticized notion of revolution. Wouldn’t it be awesome to just go guns ablazing into Washington DC? Wouldn’t it be fun to kill all the powerful people that dehumanize us, make us work in low wages and study in their jails called schools? Only we forget powerful people also bleed. Beautiful people suffer from rape, and famous actors develop anorexia.\
If only we could change.\
Our relationship with beauty is odd. Although political bands make money off hating rich people, beautiful people may have more power. That’s thanks to the\
          \
        Halo Effect. If we perceive a good quality in a person, it makes all other qualities look better and the bad qualities look a little worse. Throughout the anime, we see a bunch of pretty kids/teenagers do their stuff. They fall in love, they have a lot of sex and they have fun out in nature.\
Compare them to the queerats. It’s not that they don’t look human. They look ugly. They’re desexualized, have rough voices and do manual work. Surely, such stupid and ugly creatures deserve their place. When hundreds of people die, we can’t help but despise them. It’s not like the people of the villages are evil. They’re perfect, stick-thin intelligent people who care for the order of society.\
“but they all forget somebody’s gotta scrub the toilets” – BioShock.\
The anime is, at its heart, about power imbalance. Its way of exploring this idea is by deliberately making the powerful people sympathetic and appealing. There are two reasons for this. Evil people don’t really exist. There’s a coherent theory behind the oppression of the queerats. Also that often we won’t rise up against powerful people because we love them. It’s easy to hate the rich fat dude, but what if it was a beautiful women who enslaved people or send them to the gas chambers?\
The faction you side with tells a lot about your preferences. The story is the basic old tale of the oppressed rising against their oppressors. If you’re siding with the villages, then maybe justice isn’t in your priorities. The villages are more appealing, more like how we want to be. If you side with them, you just might be a victim of the Halo Effect.\
If you hate the humans and relish all the death and destruction, then you also missed another point. There’s no difference between dehumanizing people for being powerful and dehumanizing them for being ugly. The anime makes the villains appealing both to reveal how the Halo Effect can make forgive terrible things, but also how people who do terrible things have their reasons for doing so.\
Underneath all these philosophies of power there’s also an emotionally engrossing sci-fi story. Shinsekai Yori is a great argument for how sci-fi can be about human relationships and drama, not just showing off about possible technologies. Sci-Fi isn’t about predicting possible technologies – how a car works isn’t a story. It’s about how our society might look like if a certain technology emerges.\
It’s about what would happen if we’d become too powerful for our own good. If I were an expert in Japanese culture, I’d say there are parallels to the atomic bomb. The Cantus is a genetic mutation that gives human beings ridiculous amounts of power, but you can replace it with any possible mutations – super-strength, super-intelligence – that will cause a power imbalance.\
Every human in the villages is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Despite the peaceful exterior, danger is ever-present. It can coming from inside – one of us loses their mind and goes berserk. It can also come from above. The masters can take you away because they consider you a danger.\
We humans have a hard time building an honest society. We feed our children a lot of things they later have to unlearn – there’s no tooth fairy, the people in TV aren’t your friends and schools don’t teach you anything. The ‘growing up’ the kids do is realizing that the world isn’t peaceful and cannot be. The Cantus is part of human nature. Reality is hostile from every direction – your servants can rise up, one of you can go berserk and someone from above can erase you from reality. You learn similar lessons when you grow up – the job market is cruel and being a programmer isn’t enough, rapists can be sexy and you might get sent off to war.\
Like any other organism, we’re constantly trying to remake the environment in our own image. By constructing a peaceful environment, we could ensure our survival. Utopian fiction often portrays these environments as a jungle of machinery and wires. So the main lesson we learn is that technology is evil, savages are noble and we all should be one with nature. The villages are ‘one with nature’. Technology hardly exists there yet the world is still hostile. Cantus isn’t just a genetic mutations. It’s a physical manifestation of the power we hold over each other. Organisms by nature are dangerous. No amount of sex or being one with nature or creating a class of ugly people can solve it.\
Shinsekai Yori is so good that talking about the technical side is pointless. It’s fantastic in how it explores its themes and anime like this are why I put so much effort into writing reviews in the first place. Every year a thousand works of fiction come out, and books or live-action movies may seem more mature but I doubt many come close to the lows of this anime. It’s at once simple, emotionally engrossing and explores its themes to the fullest. There isn’t a reason for anyone to skip this.\
If only we could change.\

    IF there was ever a flawed masterpiece, it was Shinsekai Yori. This show man. This haunting sci-fi dystopia will stay with you long after you finish it. Without any further delay, lets get on with the review.\
Story- 10\
The story of SSY is by far its strongest part, as it is one of the most interesting dystopian stories ever made in my opinion. This is the aspect that will keep you coming back for more. Very basically put, it follows Saki Watanabe, a 12 year old middle schooler, and her life as she realizes the world around her is not as perfect as it seems. I\
          \
        can't go much past that without getting into spoilers, but it eventually gets into much darker topics like genocide, what it means to be human, and slavery. The pacing is pretty bad to be honest, as there are info dumps all over the place and the story doesn't kick into its top gear until the last 8 episodes, but when it does oh boy does it get good. Overall, the story is one that should not be missed by anyone, it starts off slow but by the time it gets to the last arc the story has picked up greatly and is honestly insane.\
Character- 8\
The characters were... interesting. The best way for me to put it is that most of the characters were rather one dimensional and didn't get much screen time. This, however, is completely forgiven for having an amazing lead female character, Saki, and an amazing villain who I can't spoil. The stoy follows Saki's entire life and her growth from a girl to a woman, and while she is a flawed individual, she is human and you feel for her. Her character is over-emotional, and its a great lead to this show. The main villain who I won't spoil is my personal favorite villain in any anime, and just a brilliant character with motives arguably better than our main characters. So yea. Good MC and Villain, a couple good supporting characters (Satoru, Kiroumaru, and Shun) and everyone else was kinda underdeveloped.\
Sound- 10\
This is one of my personal favorite OSTs in anime. The songs may be overused and the OST is small, but this is all made up for by how well it complements the show itself and sets the mood perfectly. This is exemplified by a song by the name of Traditional Song of Shadows, which you just have to listen to because it is beautiful. Finally, there is no OP but the ED is the single greatest in anime history. Watch it now.\
Art/Animation- 7\
Ok this is by far the show's weak point. The art style was done by A1 Pictures, and is a weird, not bad, but weird style. It could've be done right, but there were just too many faults to consider the animation more than just \"good\". Not much else to say.\
Enjoyment- 10\
This is controversial, because I enjoyed this show so much but I can see how many people could consider it boring. There is a lot of information to keep track of and the pacing, as mentioned, is incredibly slow and will bore a lot of people. But for me, the plot was just so interesting and I just couldn't drop it and kept watching episode after episode, and it was well worth it.\
Overall- 10\
Lots of people will get bored of this show and drop it, but for those who stick it out you are in for one of the greatest pieces of fiction I've ever seen with a top-tier story, and I highly reccomend it to anyone who likes shows with good stories and great plot twists.\

The synopsis got me intrigued. This should have been right up my alley but for some reason, it just felt boring. The concept of the show itself is quite interesting, but the pacing is slow at times and even though things started to pick up around episode 5, it was not enough for me to keep watching it. I'm all for slow-burner type of shows but this one didn't work out for me.\

    This is my first time writing a review for an anime I watched. I just want this out of my chest. I feel it’s imperative to share what I thought of Shinsekai Yori so I’d give it a try.\
This will contain some spoiler, sorry. xD\
It started slowly, with bits and pieces of information. From past to present. Back and forth. Giving clues without revealing anything. The premise? Six children, a special friendship, an unspoken love and a twisted town. People have this ability called cantus, the power of telekinesis which is awakened once a child reached ten years of age.\
Saki, Satoru, Shun, Maria, Mamoru and\
          \
        Rei were classmates and friends. However, due to some event, Rei disappeared, leaving no trace in the memories of the remaining children.\
The turning point of the story happened in their summer camp when they were twelve years old. Five of them accidentally stumbled upon information that shouldn’t be available to them, thus, their bloody and painful adventure begin.\
We live in a cruel world, indeed. Shinsekai Yori is a mirror of our world. From standpoint of society and norm, the concept of right and wrong, safe and dangerous, of what is acceptable and what is not. It made me see myself as part of society in a different light. Society always justifies its deed saying it’s for the greater good. Sacrifice a few to save many. Surely it works. Even I cannot deny that. *sigh*\
When I started watching Shinsekai Yori, I had no expectation, whatsoever. Although I read the plot beforehand, I didn’t remember it much (since, as I said utopian and dystopian world aren’t new nowadays). First few episodes didn’t impress me, if I were to describe what I thought of it, I’d say it was strange, so strange. Surprisingly, as strange as it was, it kept me looking forward to the next episode. While I was trying to figure out the story, I was hooked beyond recovery. No words can explain how strange it was and how I was captivated by its beauty.\
The story was mesmerizing. It challenges your belief, questions your sanity, confronts your inner self, and dare you to be free from what is accepted by norm and society. Wanting to change but unable to change. And because there will be always fear of the unknown, we tend to stay in our comfort zone.\
I’ve always known that Satoru and Saki will end up with each other. I just knew it in my heart. But I also knew that there is something between Saki and Shun, a deeper bond that no one could break (even when Shun is gone, their soul is still connected). It was a red string of fate that transcends even afterlife. But I must admit I NEVER ever for once did see it coming for Satoru and Shun, Saki and Maria. It shocked the hell out me. Happiness, indeed (hahaha.  Please excuse the yaoi fangirl in me). I was lost in that brief moment. It’s like I died and reborn again. I feel twisted, happy and satisfied. Why? Because it tackles love in the most indiscriminate way. It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl, or what gender you prefer your partner to be. You just love a person regardless of gender. It’s really liberating. Almost refreshing.\
Satoru loved Shun, Shun also loved Satoru but he also loved Saki and Saki loved him, too. Saki loved Maria, Maria loved Saki too but she also loved Mamoru, that’s why she cannot abandon him when she needed her most. And after everything that happened, Satoru and Saki grew to love each other too. It was a slow but sure love. I believed that the love the five of them have for each other is beyond comprehension. But somehow, I understood. In the end, I realized that maybe, just maybe it’s really true that we will end up with the person that we’re meant to be. No matter how painful the road we would take. \
I’m sure Satoru and Saki will name their child Shun if it’s a boy and Maria if it’s a girl. Because deep in their hearts they still long for them but still they are happy with each other and that the heart is really capable of loving more than one person…\
So I say it was the most beautiful love triangle in the world.\
Will I recommend it? Of course. Although, I think it isn’t for everyone. But if you would want something with a different touch, you must watch it. Dystopian world always has this mood that is melancholy. There were moments I needed to take a deep breath to control the emotions that was building up in me. Guess you really have to take the good with the bad, so they say. I couldn’t agree more.\

    *to those who are too lazy to read and just want a quick summary, skip to the final paragraph*\
Wordy, confusing, dark, yet strangely compelling.  These are the words which perfectly describe the experience I had from watching this anime. Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World , is an anime adaptation of a visual novel of the same name. To tell you frankly, this review has taken quite some time to write, simply because I found it hard to put into words as to why it is good. Either way, I will still do my best to write this review, and to start off\
          \
        let me provide you with a simple overview of the plot.\
 Shisekai Yori is an anime set a millennium into the future, in a seemingly utopian society where the remaining humans have finally unlocked the power of mind over matter, which they refer to as Cantus. During a field trip, Saki, the main protagonist of the story, along with her four friends discovers an ancient recording device left behind by the past civilization. With the revelations they found, their adventure begins as they are captured by Queerats, another race of beings which resembles humanoid molerats.\
So, what exactly is good with Shinsekai Yori? Well, to start off, let us discuss the plot. If you read the summary carefully, you might notice that it actually resembles an adventure type anime. However, that is not the case. Shinsekai Yori is a psychological anime that focuses on the philosophical aspects of the story (which I will be discussing later), despite the fact that it is tagged under horror, which I think it is not. Shinsekai Yori is an anime where you really have to put some time into it to enjoy it. The anime is quite slow; it only gets interesting at episode 3 and the plot only picks up at episode 9 or so. So yes, it does have quite a slow start, but once it gets rolling, it really hooks you in with its wonderfully executed and spontaneous plot. It’s the type of anime where when things get serious, they really get serious, And just as you’re breathing your first sigh of relief after the end of an intense plot arc, things kick into high gear again making it a thrill to watch until the very end.\
But despite the plot being spontaneous, it was complicated enough to give off a sense of mystery. There are times when you just have no idea of what’s happening until it hits you in the face. Personally, I found this to be quite refreshing: To not be able to tell what will happen next and just watch plot unfold and reveal the answers to your questions.\
 Though even with all those things, the best thing about Shinsekai Yori’s plot still lies in its philosophical undertones. It portrays to us in a serious manner sensitive topics such as racism, slavery, human sexuality, and even democracy. These philosophical undertones are what  makes Shinsekai Yori shine; It can make you think about the implications of those things in real life just like any decent and self-respecting Sci-fi title has. And what’s more, it shows us circumstances where we can’t help but feel pity to the oppressed and hate for the oppressors. Shinsekai Yori is the type of anime that makes the viewer empathize with the characters despite us viewers never having really been in that situation. This alone makes such a great anime, as it leaves a huge impact on whoever watches it, making it a memorable experience to all those who’ve watched it.\
As for the characters, I’d say that they are nothing less than wonderful. The main characters were truly unique and fleshed out, and had good personalities to boot. Now, what really made the characters so interesting is that you can see how they changed over time. You can see them turning from flat and boring characters into interesting people each with their own uniqueness in terms of their philosophies. Speaking of uniqueness, well the characters themselves weren’t all too unique in a sense that they could possibly still be fitted into some character archetypes. Take Shun for example. He’s the silent type who speaks only when needed and when he does, he speaks in an intelligent manner that you would expect from the seemingly smartest person in their group. Does that sound familiar to you? But despite that, the characters do change into unique characters as I’ve mentioned before, and that’s what counts.\
And also, I would like to give a special mention to the antagonist of this anime. As to not spoil the plot, I won’t tell who it is but I for one think that he is one of the greatest antagonists ever created. Now, one of the things that really caught my attention about him was his personality. He was what you would call a trickster, the type of character who you have a very bad feeling about and yet he seems to be unlikely an enemy.  He made use of the protagonists and played them for fools, while being so seemingly friendly and down to earth which made him so interesting. Also, despite being the antagonist, the reason as to why he was fighting was very reasonable that at times I found myself even supporting him. It wasn’t like in other anime where the antagonists are being asses for the sake of being an ass, in Shinsekai Yori the antagonist was being an ass for a very reasonable reason. Kind of like how Yagami was such an ass despite having good intentions.\
And to top it all off, Shinsekai Yori also has a pretty decent animation. It was animated by A1 pictures, which also animated SAO (which despite having a bad plot, you gotta admit it had great animation) as well as other famous anime as well like Magi, Fairy Tail, Kuroshitsuji II, and Ao no Exorcist. The music was also great. The BGMs were the type of foreboding music that sounds like people chanting and gives a wonderful atmosphere when needed. Also, the first ending song, Wareta Ringo, was just addicting and has been stuck in my head for a couple of weeks now. Sadly, they don’t have an opening sequence, and just start off with something like a 30 sec recap of the last episode.\
Now one last thing, and this one is the thing that has sparked a bit of controversy among people (or at least, between me and my friends), and that is the presence of Yaoi and Yuri in the series. If you are the type of person who cannot handle seeing tongue action between two men, despite the fact that it isn’t done for the sake of fanservice, or even better, girls kissing each other, well, watch it anyway. These things are not detrimental to the plot (though it was mentioned why this happens in the first three episodes if you read carefully) and therefore would not affect the overall experience of watching this anime.\
So with all that said, what is the verdict for Shinsekai Yori? For me, I found it to be quite heck of a ride. The plot was well-written and executed, the undertones were mind boggling and the characters were a joy to watch. Despite that though, it is far from perfect and there are some bad in it like how it had a slow start, a complicated story, and Yaoi. Personally, I found it to be one of the more interesting anime of this past year. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological anime that revolves more on philosophical themes rather than gore. \
To provide a quick summary of this review, here are the pros and cons of this anime:\
+Plot was well-written, well executed and spontaneous.\
+The philosophical undertones of the story were very interesting to say the least.\
+The characters were fleshed out pretty well and the character development aspect of this anime was superb\
+The antagonist was very noteworthy and had a great impact because of his goal.\
+The animation and music were decent.\
+Yuri  XD\
-The first few episodes had a slow start to the point that it seemed like nothing was happening\
-The plot was hard to understand and pretty complicated at first.\
-Some of the characters can be fitted into character archetypes.\
-Yaoi (?)\

    “Shinsekai yori” also known as ”From the New World” is dark story set in a utopia, or maybe depending on what person you are, a dystopia. Many dark and horrible secrets are kept from the children in an attempt to integrate them into to the utopic world that they are born in. I have only seen two episodes so this review is based on those two episodes. \
If I am not mistaken the story is narrated by the future main character, who the watcher through the anime very smoothly and well. The first two episodes the anime manages to be lighthearted and at first glance\
          \
        it might look like a “slice of life”, but there are some clear signs that the peace won’t last. These signs and symbolic stories, that can be related to propaganda, that appear are very smartly placed and through this achievement, the mood that the created is something on par with many other great animes. A flaw could be that telling the story of a dystopia through 12 year old kids probably isn’t the most fitting and realistic thing to do. \
As for the art, I can’t give the same praise as for the story. Yes, it is good, but it isn’t the best. The only thing that I find good is the parts when the stories are being told and I do find the disproportional eyes sometimes disturbing, but otherwise there is nothing special about that. \
The sound is just like the art, something that doesn’t stand out. The soundtrack is doing its job, creating the desired mood for the different scenes, but no tracks that is especially memorable or good enough to listen on the bus ride home. \
The characters in the anime are just like the other things, well done but not supreme. There aren’t an enormous amount of characters to remember, and they don’t over complicate them. So far there are no unrealistic characters/personalities that wouldn’t exist in the real world. The main characters are though surprisingly mature and wise for their age, but otherwise they are easy to recognize, and they are all different from each other. They all seem to have a kind of deeper thoughts going on in their small heads, thinking about the world and the system, unlike most kids in their age. \
This is a very story driven anime, and it will leave cliffhangers after many episodes, and if you are prepared of that this is an anime I would highly recommend to people to start to watch. After watching an episode it leaves a lot of questions in your head, not about the anime, but about the world itself. If it is good to create a twisted utopia or is it better to leave the world like it is right now?\
Summary time:\
Story 8/10 or possibly 9/10 the story seems promising and is very appealing to me\
Art: 7/10 nothing special but still good\
Sound: 7/10 nothing special, but succeeds to create desired mood for the anime\
Characters: 7/10 again nothing special, realistic and deep to a certain degree\
Enjoyment: 9/10 I personally really like dystopia/utopia stories like 1984 and The Giver\
Overall so far (2 episodes seen): an easy 8/10\

    Shinsekai Yori is an amazing anime that questions the human condition without sympathy or bias and builds a world so convincing and complete that you almost feel like an expert on it by the time you finish the series. Watching the anime, an ominous air is apparent even from the start when the main characters are still children. The art style is truly unique among the anime I've watched. Landscapes, buildings and outfits are realistic and detailed while the characters wear versatile anime archetype faces. The mood of the show is set by its use of bright color palletes to create familiarity and a sense\
          \
        of comfort while surrealist, almost nightmarish artstyles here and there remind you that this is an anime that deals with the dark recesses of the human mind and the unnerving unknown out there in the world. The story might seem slow at first but imagine being flung into a future where society and life on earth itself are completely unlike anything we can relate to. To get our bearings we have to take baby steps to understand world that Shinsekai Yori is set in, so it was a natural choice that our worldview is built side-by-side with the main characters as they grow and begin to understand the reality they live in - and the questions the anime poses about what it means to be human, how it feels to love, lose and live on, and how to best organize society are just as applicable to us in the present as they are important to the characters. We watch the main cast of group one through the innocence of their idyllic childhood, the drama of their teenage years and their development into adults who still bear the marks of their youth but still soldier on. I feel blessed that this anime (and the novel which preceded it) was made, and that I had the chance to watch it and talk about it over the internet. To any of you who are doubting the veracity of this anime, don't. This is a masterpiece that has left me with many questions, and a lingering sense of hope. A feeling so rare that I'm here writing my first anime review. \

Story - 9\
 This anime is situated 1000 years from now, and the protagonists as well as many other characters you encounter are telekinesis (PK) users(since there is an actual summary I won't bother about summarizing the story too much).To me the story is quite original. Although there are many takes on animes that about societies and government, I believe this anime has one of the best concept and story line.The\
          \
        art, suspense, mystery, and darkness are masterfully woven to keep you on the edge of your seat. The themes and story of this anime is dark and depressing. There were a few episodes in the middle that have made me lose partial interest, but that interest is gained back almost instantly with the following episodes. Most of the time while watching this, you would find yourself confused and lost, however, as you start watching more you begin to gain understanding on it. I would describe this as when you watch an episode you are confused,then as you watch another, you think you have found the pieces in the puzzle until the anime throws in yet another mystery. This process continues to repeat until you finish the anime. Yes, what a troll (: \
Art + Sound- 9\
I absolutely love the animation and art of this anime. It fits the theme and story well . There is just something unique about it. As you get to certain episodes you might find the art/animation to be different, the reason is because some episodes were made with another director. The sound was perfect for this anime, the music was deep and invoke thoughts as well as emotions. Even though I finished it, I can hear the song playing in my head, haha.\

 Despite the usual cliche line telling that this story is \"about a group of friends\", I must tell you now it is much more than that, It is certainly not some children anime that you might imagine it to be. Shinsekai yori is an incredibly powerful anime, and honestly if you decide not to watch this anime, you are missing out! While this anime might be on the dark and depressing side, it is something entertaining and interesting to watch. I found this show while searching for something to watch and to be honest, it would not be exaggerating to say I found a gem. A friend told me that he started watching at 9 pm and by 6  am,he was still watching. It is one of those compelling animes that will keep you pressing the next button again and again. To those who like bright and funny anime, this might not be the anime for you. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this anime, you never know until you try!!\

    If you look at the various 2013 anime that sparked your interest, or made you watch it through the end, Shin Sekai Yori probably wasn't on that list. But it definitely deserved to be. I for sure, didn't even hear of it until this year, and I wish I could have enjoyed it while it was airing\
The story surrounds our main female protagonist, Saki, and her adventures in a sort of utopia established after the creation  of humans with psychic powers. So far, the story doesn't seem all too great. We've heard of dystopian or utopian story lines before, and psychic powers is nothing\
          \
        new to the anime world. What is interesting is the way this society runs; it is different then anything I've seen before. I can't really reveal anything without spoiling the plot line, so you will have to see for yourself the intricacy, and even morbidness, of this utopia. \
The story progression is quite interesting too, we start the show when Saki is twelve, a few episodes later we time skip to when she is twelve, and finally, twenty-six. A couple of shows have tried this method before, but none of them had flowed like SSY had. Even the multiple flashbacks that occurred were woven brilliantly into the animation.\
Speaking of which, the animation was spectacular. Don't be fooled by the characters flat colors, the scenery is breathtaking. The only way to define this style is sharp and clean. It worked very well with the overall mood. The only criticism I had  was that sometimes, the background was too dark for me to see. It wasn't necessarily off-putting, because the characters were highlighted nicely, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was a bit brighter in those parts.\
The music was also very nice. There is one in particular I like (which I unfortunately do not recall the name for) which includes a sort of humming/singing obviously by children. Each song was played in exactly the right time and place, and some played with heartstrings so much, it drove me to tears. But I do wish there was more variety. I could only distinguish about 4-6 different songs, not that I'm complaining! As I said, they were all amazing and I was surprised I didn't get sick of the songs repeatedly playing. Which sparks a thought, could they have done this so that it would invoke emotions brought in another scene, where the same song played? Something to think about while watching the show...\
Oh boy, the characters. I could go on for days about the characters. The main characters are Saki, our lead, Satoru, a laid back but mischievous boy, Shun, a more mature and intelligent boy, Maria, Saki's childhood friend and lover, and Mamoru, a shy and introverted boy with a love for art. I honestly did not care for Saki or Maria, and here is why. Saki sometimes seemed like the useless female trope, when I was expecting a strong female lead. She always volunteered to help, but was put down and didn't think much of it. Maria just didn't gel with me. Although the story places a lot of emphasis on her character ( as the story is from Saki's point of view), I didn't like her because I never felt for her. I did really like Mamoru and Satoru though, and Shun was definitely a personal favorite.\
I will warn potential watchers there is some shounen ai/yaoi(if you would even consider it yaoi) in the first couple of episodes, but please don't drop it just because of that! It is a great watch that deserves a larger fan base, but unfortunately not many people can look past the sexual themes.\
I highly, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone seeking something apart from the traditional anime, or even just someone who can enjoy a deep,rich story line. This show reduced me to tears, which is an amazing feat not even the saddest movies can accomplish. Even if you don't think it's for you, give it a shot. \

    Honestly, I’m not sure exactly what it was that got me interested in watching From the New World (Shinsekai yori). Maybe it was the artwork, or the interesting plot synopsis. Maybe it was the high praise it had received from several different sights, or the positive fan reviews. I don’t know, but, I guess, it doesn’t really matter because for some reason I did end up watching this series. The question is, did it live up to all of the praise surrounding it, or is it just another overhyped series? \
Story:\
The story takes place in Japan one thousand years from now, in a world where\
          \
        humanity has discovered, and developed, supernatural telekinetic abilities. People have used this ability to form a utopian society where all humans live together in harmony. But all is not as it seems. There are rumors about mysterious cats that abduct children, and, even though several children start disappearing, no one seems to notice or care all that much about it. Something is definitely not right in village of Kamisu 66. What’s really going on in this supposed utopia? That is the question that starts the long, and incredible journey of our main characters. \
The story is told from the perspective of five characters. All of the characters attend the same school and are apart of the same class group, group one. As well as the story being told primary from her point of view, the main character, Saki, also doubles as the narrator for the series. The story takes place over several years, and information is slowly revealed to you each episode. From the New World uses a lot of flashbacks to provide background information on the characters and the world itself. This makes the amount of time that the story covers even larger and will help keep you engaged in the story. The show is constantly progressing and is purposely vague, and you’ll have to continue to watch the series in order to fully understand what’s going on. The story is continuously building upon itself by using great writing and foreshadowing to build tension and suspense. \
From the New World also does a great job of building the world that characters are living in. While initially, and purposefully, vague you will come to understand why the world is like it is. The story provides a detailed history of how the world became the way it is, and what it was like before. This provides essential context to the events that are currently occurring, and it was all explained really well. Even though there are several flashbacks and time skips, the story never felt rushed. Everything was built up and explained really well. There are also other things that will be mentioned or subtly alluded to, and you’ll have to be paying attention to understand what’s being referenced and shown to you. \
There is a lot more to the story but it would be hard to talk about a lot of it without spoiling it, and that’s the last thing I want to do. The story is really well done, and it concludes with a fantastic ending that wraps almost everything up. And the thing that is left open is where the ending really shines. The world is messed up and they know that it is, but the beauty of the ending is the hope for a better world in the future. \
I had no major issues with the story, but there was one small thing that I wished was explained a little better. That thing is the psychic powers of humans in this series. Not their origin or exactly what causes it, because it’s said that even the characters in the series aren’t totally sure of that, but the limits of those abilities. While there are definitely people in the series who are better at using their powers than others, I never got a sense of what they could or couldn’t do with their abilities, other than the parameters explained at the beginning of the series. I just wonder if there really wasn’t away to deal with some of the problems that the characters in the series run into. But, that is a very minor issue. \
Animation:\
From the New World has a unique animation style, and it’s pretty fantastic. The characters are all animated really well, and have distinct features that separate them from one another. The series places these unique character models on top of great looking background scenery, which is varied and pleasing to look at. And, at times, the background scenery looked fantastic all by itself. The backgrounds usually have an almost painted look to them, which helps it to create beautiful scenes. \
From the New World also uses different types of animation throughout the series. During some flashbacks and fight scenes you’ll see a totally different style of animation. Sometimes, the entire scene uses this style, but in others it’s mixed in with the original style. It’s done in a way that doesn’t make it feel out of place, but in a way that actually blends in perfectly with the other style of animation. \
As mentioned earlier, this series does have some fight scenes, which are all animated really well. It does a good job at showing the audience how a lot of the invisible actions of the character’s psychic abilities affect the people that they are fighting, and the objects that they are using. \
Other than a couple of times when it looked like the characters lacked a little detail, the animation was great throughout the entire series.\
Sound:\
If you couldn’t already tell From the New World is a pretty dark series and, for the most part, its soundtrack (OST) reflects that. The OST is large, and showcases several different tracks that can fit the tone of any scene that the series portrays. While the series leans a lot more towards the dark side, there are light hearted, and heartfelt, moments in the series. There are plenty of slow, sad songs, and up-tempo, upbeat songs to fit those moments as well. \
The OST also features several different ways of presenting its music. While there are plenty of dark and thrilling tracks they present them to the audience in different ways. The OST uses several different genres of music, from rock, to hip-hop and even a little bit of trance. This adds even more variety to the music that the series uses. \
While From the New World doesn’t have an opening, other than the second ending that the used as an opening for episode 16, the OST is complimented by two great endings. The second ending is particularly good because it is debuted during a critical character moment in the series, and every time you hear it it’ll make you think back to those events. \
Characters:\
From the New World stars five main characters: Maria Akizuki, Shun Aonuma, Satoru Asahina, Mamoru Itou, and Saki Watanabe. All of the characters in this series have their own distinct personalities and ways of doing things. They are a fun group to watch because of the interactions between all of the characters. \
Some people might say that this series doesn’t have a lot of character development, and, in away, they’re right. None of the characters in this series change very much in terms of their individual personalities, but you can definitely see the characters change significantly in other ways. \
As I just mentioned, the characters in From the New World don’t change who they are at their core, and I think that that’s something that makes these characters different from a lot of other characters. The story takes place over several years, and we get to see how the characters change during that time period. While who they are as characters doesn’t change, their view of the world they live in and the relationships they have with one another do. \
There are several great side characters in this series. Even though they weren’t given the most detailed background story, or even developed to a great degree, they were excellent characters that each added something meaningful to the story. Without spoiling exactly who it is, I also have to mention the amazing antagonist. The character was fantastic, and will get you thinking about the characters motivations and if they are in fact justified. \
The characters are all likable and enjoyable to watch. \
Enjoyment:\
I really enjoyed watching From the New World. This is probably the only anime that I’ve re-watched that I can say I enjoyed watching just as much as when I watched it the first time, if not more. This series was great on all fronts, and it’s a shame it hasn’t gotten the publicity that it deserves. \
This isn’t a series that you can just watch the first couple of episodes of, and get an understanding of what’s going to happen next or even what’s going on. Information is given to you throughout the entire series, and even when you think you know what’s going on, there will be another twist that will yank you right back into the story. \
Verdict and Breakdown: \
Story: 4.8/5\
Animation: 4.4/5\
Sound: 4.6/5\
Characters: 4.4/5\
Enjoyment: 4.6/5\
Verdict: 4.6/5\
From the New World is a brilliant story that will keep you thoroughly entertained, as well as make you think. There are some philosophical questions that this series proposes that are definitely interesting, and tough to answer. But, that’s part of the reason this series is so good and why I highly recommend this series",

    Every season airs an anime that is just far above the rest that are being aired at the same time. Every few years there are shows that turn out to become defining series for each period of time, usually every 5 years. However, only every 10 years can an anime be called a classic. What is the definition of a \"classic\"?  A classic is something that is outstanding, something glorious and considered held in high standards amongst a large group of people, but the most important aspect, is that the subject at hand usually defines something, rather than redefining something that already exists. Now,\
          \
        having just ended only a few months ago, it may be overconfident of me to state this, but Shinsekai yori is one of those animes that will progress onward and become a classic itself.\
Story: 10/10\
Sometimes you have animes that try hard to look like  sophisticated works of art, but in reality they are nothing more than shallow, hollow stories that work in mechanics such as clichés, overused themes, and attempt to cater to everyone, and I mean everyone that watches it. Shinsekai yori is an anime that does not do any of the above, it caters to no single audience, nor does it include clichés that are commonly used in every other show. The most important reason why I mention this, is because Shinsekai's story contains a lot of controversial themes that make the viewer think, and it does not go easy on the viewer, the story will twist and turn your brain inside out, and just when you think it's over, it's not. It will do it again, and again, and again, but all the while it's a kind of mind bomb that you will thoroughly enjoy. It is a very deep show that if you do not pay close attention the whole time, you will miss out on a lot. The story makes you think a lot about reality and humanity itself, despite being based 1000 years in the future. Not only this, but the show uses real life history foils to base the characters off of. A lot of the characters are heavily influenced by our own world's history, think pre- and post- WW2, and even during WW2. You will not be disappointed in this show.\
Art: 8/10\
I have to admit, every anime has a downside to it. This particular show's downside is probably the artwork, there are a lot of scenes that often times look distorted and badly drawn. Characters will sometimes look a little off, and the art style gives the anime a sort of 2006 look instead of a 2012-2013 feel. However, because the story was so good to me, I really never noticed until I rewatched the show (I've watched it twice now).\
Sound: 10/10\
This show has among the most amazing soundtracks that I've ever heard for a TV show. That is because each piece greatly adds to each scene, and fits in so well. This show doesn't have an opening, but it does have two endings, that when both of them started to play, just gave you chills because of how intense the closing scenes were. Even at night, it would be 4 A.M. in the morning, but I always felt compelled to watch more and more because of how chillingly suspenseful it ended, and I craved more.\
Characters: 10/10\
This show has characters that feel real, they feel like their right there in front of you, alive and breathing. Everything that happens to them, you will treat it as if it really just happened, you'll want to do something for them, but all you can do is sit back either in your seat or on your bed and watch. Every character has a unique personality that defines them from the rest. It's one of those shows, that the viewer finds out everything about the character when they find out, you're never told anything but you watch and listen and you'll come to know them. Every anime has characters that you both hate and love. However, I found that with this show, even the ones I hated at some point, I eventually came to love them later on. Each character is important to the story, no matter how big or small of a role they play.\
Overall: 10/10\
I have given out very few 10s, because very few animes have deserved the title of masterpiece. This is definitely a must see show, and even if the beginning seems boring to you, keep watching, because this show isn't something that is supposed to make sense every episode, you'll only come to understand it when it's all said and done. \
As a side note, there is a couple of episodes in which yaoi and yuri are themes, however these themes are only one or two episodes out of the 25, and they are very small in terms of being important, so it is skippable if it bothers you. Most viewers have turned this show away and rated it very low simply because of it, which is ridiculous. Just a fair warning, it is skippable. \

    Ok I am going to start this by saying this is spoiler free, so if you are looking for reasons to watch this anime without having any problems, this is the place to be. Also hands down this is the best dystopian story I have seen, whether it be through movies or tv shows.\
Story:10- First i would like to say i will not give you a synopsis (just bare bones of what you are getting yourself into) you can find that somewhere else. This show is very complicated and you are thrown a vast amount of information in one of the first few episodes. This\
          \
        may make you believe that this is a strong example of a plot hole filled anime, but man you would be wrong. All the questions that you ask throughout this anime are answered by the end with mouth dropping results. Another thing about this plot is that it keeps you guessing, trying to predict what happens next but you wont find it. This show is anything but predictable and takes you on a long journey over 25 good episodes.\
Characters:10- Ok so here i will not give you the entire cast of amazing characters, but i will give you the best of the main five you will meet in the beginning.  Out of the main five the only ones that i found interesting was Saki who is the protagonist who you follow throughout the story. she is not generic but at the same time not very compelling. Next you have Satoru who seems to be the more bull headed and could be seen as the tactician. But where the characters really shine is with Squealer and Kiroumaru; i cant tell you why without spoiling, but they are the best part of the show when it comes to the character section.\
Art and Animation:8-  When it comes to this section i think that the art cant be judged because that is just your personal preference whether you enjoy it or not. For animation though i would say this was above average but definitely not the best i have seen. Their is good animation thoughout and i never saw a weak point in the series.\
Enjoyment: In my opinion this show was a high 9 but after you get all the questions answered you cant help to give it a 10. you get a great resolution that brings you a great understanding on how they got to this Utopian society. This show will keep you guessing and you will be 100% happy you watched it. But in the end i am a true believer that nothing is perfect and the place that i believe this show lacks is its pacing. at some points it can be a little slow but that is the only negative that i believe this show has.\
Pros:\
-Story is compelling\
-Fantastic ending\
-All questions are answered(no plot holes)\
-Great character and lore behind the universe.\
Cons:\
-alittle slow paced\
Overall: Overall this show is a probably the best Utopian story out there that has fantastic characters, a story that is compelling, and a great resolve in the end to let you know how they got to where they are in the end. So basically what im saying is that i dont care who you are this is a must watch. So what are you still doing here go watch it.\
Also thank you to everyone who took the time to read this review and have a great day!!\

    Let me begin this review by stating that my intent is to gloss over the perfections that make this outstanding piece the epitome of great story telling. Without revealing any plots, it is my goal to coerce you into watching one of the greatest epics imagined with a few indisputable points.\
It is my belief that Shinsekai Yori is incomparable to even the greats, the very treasures of anime jewels; this is a sparkling diamond hidden in the ruff and you will not find another like it. This fact alone should prompt anybody with critical taste and the desire to expand their mental, to watch. If\
          \
        you take the time to complete it, you will not be sorry for doing so and will walk away feeling fulfilled in your finalization.\
The story is broken into three parts. From the beginning, we come to understand the personalities and beliefs of our main protagonists as young men and women, and through the series, as they grow and prosper, those traits glue us to them, making their struggles a thrilling treat to consume. Their ideals, their outlooks and their differing placements in this universe is the pedestal that lifts these characters to heights difficult to reach. To say that Shinsekai Yori has compelling individuals would only be an injustice to their very product. These girls and boys are strong and beautiful, exciting and easy to relate to; by the conclusion of the epic, you’ve felt like you’ve walked through a lifetime with them which solidifies any dispute that the character development in this series is almost otherworldly.\
Another point I’d like to touch on is the voice acting. Usually one for subtitles only, upon first viewing, I wasn’t caught. However, when switching to the English dub, I was rewarded with some of the most beautiful and passionate acting I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Even our main enemy, a monster that goes by the name Squealer, has the gumption to outweigh most; with a creepy slight and hostile undertones, we’re allowed to realize, from the start, that this monster is somebody who we can’t trust. Each role perfectly embodies their characters personalities and projects them through verbalization, drawing us in and catching us on fluid words and a seamless script.\
Animation wise, Shinsekai Yori is as breathtaking as it gets. Each scene oozes artistic prowess, making even more light-hearted and “dull” moments exciting to watch. At times, my breath was stolen away from stills alone. With fantastic color coordination, lighting and a sharp style, this piece isn’t anything less than a crowning jewel.\
Adapted from a novel, the series has a very book-like, poetic flow in both script-writing and the events which take place. It works more like a three-part film than an episodic series. Each episode’s conclusion leaves you clinging to the edge of your seat, eager to consume the next bout of detail. Working in the show’s favor when you begin the next episode, it places you exactly where you left off so that there’s no confusion or fishing for detail on what happened last. Because this was a novel first, the series is packed with incredible detail and the ability to flesh out points that might otherwise be murky.\
Though some moments are lighthearted, the series as a whole is rather conceptually disturbing. There’s not much gore to speak of, but rather compelling, psychological concepts that will leave your mind and stomach churning. Spooky and dark, Shinsekai Yori was able to keep me alert and hungry for more. Less dramatic with imagery, it leans on its viewer being a quick and smart intellectual so that it can grab you with evil intent rather than brutalizing you with scenes of characters being torn at their limbs. Perfectly used to more gory anime, Shinsekai Yori struck me in a different way, twisting my mental and breaking my heart for the characters who must endure such sadistic intent.\
The soundtrack is another gorgeous element. Both eerie and jazzy, all songs seem to capture each scene, drawing you in and fixing your emotions to coincide with what the characters are experiencing in that moment. There’s this one song, marking the point of day in which each villager must return home, and simply thinking about it gives me chills. The Way Home is soft and warm, but captures the idea that something deeper is working underneath its calming chimes and warm tones.\
Concluding this review, I will state that Shinsekai Yori has been my favorite anime experience. And for reasons strictly due to the surprise and horror you feel watching, I refuse to spoil anything. From the animation to the script to the character development, twisting plots, fleshed out universe and magical voice acting, this series is one in a million and I would press anybody to embark on this epic.\

    Shinsekai Yori isn't 'typical' anime, which includes some stupid scenes and stereotyped or cocky cahracters. It will give you very different and unforgettable experience, something you won't find in other anime. \
 - Story - 10\
One of the best, mindthrilling and outstanding story I've seen. I won't start writing synopsis, but tell you what this anime can give you. Shinsekai Yori has some psychological, philosophical, political discussions and ideas, which are flawlessly represented. The world is unrealistic and realistic at the same times, you will be thrilled for how author manages to make such close parallels between our world and wrold of shinsekai Yori. \
          \
        It has horrific, dramatic and very mystic moments, so you must listen carefully to dialogues to make final judgement and understand the plot.  First episodes may not catch you and you might find some middle series frustrating as well, but still, I suggest you to not drop it, because every episode has connection to actual story and is smartly written. There were some scenes which pulled me in deeply and got me so excited, my mind was blown (especially last episodes are very powerful). Author represents us humankind viciousness and flaws, lies, hope and makes final conlcusion: That we must change. We must change our worldview...\
- Art - 9\
Maybe the art isn't that grealy detailed and good enough, but it gives us real Shinsekai Yori. It brings you in unforgettable atmosphere, full of horrific and dark tone, scares adn entertains you. So art is some crucial component of Shinsekai Yori.\
- Sound - 9\
It has some outstanging soundtracks, which greatly fits overall environment. \"Traditional Song of Shadows\" (which's played often) greatly influenced on me and makes many scenes perfect. However \"Sad Separation\" has some dramatic sounds in it and touches your heart deeply and lefts you bewildered. Sound is another strongest side of Shinsekai Yori.\
- Characters - 10\
Perferct. You won't meet silly speculations and thoughts from characters, or any kind of stereotypical judgements. Characters are very realistic, weak and strong, smart and confident. Story seems much more amazing with such characters, with unpredictable pacing and result. Strategic worldview and strong rationalism are the key points. \
- Enjoyment - 10\
Overall shinsekai Yori was absolutely brilliant and I enjoyed it so much. It made me think of many events and dragged me into very deep discussions. I'm feeling bad that it's not that popular anim, and some typical shounen craps outshine such Masterpiece. If you're seeking for something different, something big and mystic, I strongly suggest you Shinsekai Yori! \

    Let me start by saying that Shinsekai Yori is not an anime that everyone will enjoy, but it is without a doubt a storytelling masterpiece. After my second watch, it became clear to me that I had to write a review to help guide potential viewers.\
First off, it is important to understand exactly what kind of anime you are getting into. Shinsekai Yori is a story of mysteries, each being introduced in succession at the beginning of the anime. What appears to be a story about six curious children quickly turns dark, depressing, and confusing as each mystery is unveiled to both the characters and\
          \
        the viewers. To get the most out of Shinsekai Yori, you need to be ready to watch with a keen literary eye and a conscience braced for a heavy story.\
STORY:\
It is difficult to review the story without spoiling any of the show's numerous secrets, so I will try not to delve too deeply. Shinsekai Yori has a beautifully constructed plot that follows a group of children across several different stages in their life, starting at age 12 and ending when they are 26.\
Many of the strengths of Shinsekai Yori lie in its characters, but it is how these characters interact with the mysterious world around them that makes it so special. Everything in this world has a secret, and the main cast is simply trying to understand how their society came to be, and why certain events are coming to pass. \
Shinsekai Yori is a crescendo of mysteries. Thought-provoking questions are posed in the first half of the show, and their answers are brilliantly foreshadowed throughout. The second half reveals unexpected answers to these questions, building upon each secret and bringing the viewer to realize just how interconnected everything is, from the history of the village to the relationship between humans and the intelligent monsters who live just outside. Each answer builds upon the last, leading up to a staggering conclusion that flips the entire story on its head.\
Shinsekai Yori will put you deep in thought, and the story's secret hero will force you to face difficult themes such as the nature of greed, power, democracy, sacrifice, and humanity itself. It will leave you with a pit in your stomach, so be braced for what you are about to see.\
\
CHARACTERS:\
As with any masterpiece, the characters are an important contributor to this anime's brilliance. The relationships feel real, particularly between Saki and Satoru. This sets Shinsekai Yori apart from other anime, in the sense that you can relate to and empathize with these characters at a deeper level. They all have unique personalities and feel REAL. The way they talk, make fun of each other, play outside, and interact in school simply makes sense.\
I give characters a 9/10 for one simple but important reason. This is, in my opinion, the single greatest flaw in Shinsekai Yori: there is an important character (to the two leads) that is drastically underdeveloped considering the role he/she plays in the decisions, emotions, and motivations of the two lead characters. While it is not enough to distract the viewer from the better components of the anime, it is a shame that such a strong story has such an obvious flaw.\
\
PRESENTATION:\
One of the story's incredible strengths is how it's characters interact with the setting in which Shinsekai Yori is based. The time at which the show takes place is futuristic, but the world these children live in is not the polluted, dirty landscape we imagine when we think of the actual future of our planet. Nature is abundant, and technology is sparse, only being used where absolutely necessary. The children play outside and the village has a rural medieval feel.\
The art in this anime is incredible, and while I did not like a couple of the stylistic choices for character expressions during the middle of the show, the sheer beauty of every backdrop in the entire production makes up for it. Animation remained clean throughout, and only ever added to the brilliance of Shinsekai Yori.\
There is also some incredible music. The main theme plays at some point during every episode, and its a song sang by a children's choir that will give you the chills. There are other good tracks throughout, but some of the darker themes and action music is a little distracting. It won't impact your enjoyment of the show overall, but considering the music has such incredible high points, its a shame it was not well rounded throughout.\
I should also add that voice acting gets top marks in my book (subbed, haven't watched dubbed).\
\
CONCLUSION:\
If you skipped to this point, read my intro as well; its important.\
Shinsekai Yori is a brilliant anime, whose story watches a cast of wonderful characters unveil a crescendo of mysteries. It will leave you deep in thought when you finish, and the story demands a second watch. The sound and art are phenomenal, and the setting is unique and beautiful. If you decide to pick up Shinsekai Yori, bear these things in mind:\
1. Do not drop this anime because of some of its controversial sexual themes. They are brief and play an important role in the story.\
2. Watch this anime within a week's time. There is too much info to remember over a longer period.\
3. There is a lull when they begin telling the story at age 26. Keep watching. It becomes very climactic, and you will rediscover your love for the two lead characters.\
4. Watch with a literary eye. Infer as you go. Watching Shinsekai Yori will not be a passive experience!\
With all this in mind, enjoy one of the most brilliantly crafted stories ever written!\

    From the New World is set in a post-apocalyptic future where there is an apparent utopian society with psychics until a group of children come to learn that things aren't as they seem on the surface with their so-called utopia. The series delves into corrupt elements of the human condition in regards to the measures that the society in this series go through to maintain their so-called perfect society that involve questionable elements such as genetic manipulation, brainwashing and \"purging\" children who don't conform to the standards laid out by the village. The series takes its time to unveil more elements to its history and\
          \
        world that lead Saki and her friends to continue further questioning the ethical and moral ramifications in regards to how things came about in their present time through a period of twenty-plus years as events escalate throughout the series. It is effective at building up events and creating suspenseful moments whenever Saki and others get into any dangerous situations involving mutants or other psychics.\
While having a nice amount of plot buildup and world exploration, it does have its issues that keep me from wanting to rate it higher. A number of points in the series rely fairly heavily on exposition in order to reveal more about the true nature of elements to its world and history, which often take up a decent chunk of episode time. While necessary in understanding more about the title's plot and world, it can be taxing to less attentive viewers who hate this style of storytelling and want more \"show, not tell\" with their anime. Character depth and development is rather limited in the series as it is more focused on its plot and world exploration meaning much of the cast doesn't have much dimension to their personalities nor do we get enough focus at many points on character relationships to connect with them, especially with any romantic developments that Saki gets entangled with during the different time skips in the show. If you're expecting solid character depth with your anime, you might be disappointed with that particular aspect for From the New World.\
Visually, From the New World's animation is.... avant-garde, as one way of putting it. The series makes use of different visual styles during tense points in its storytelling to enhance the haunting and dark aspects of its storyline, particularly in exploring the events that led to its present time and a number of the grotesque, horrific creatures that are encountered. During these points, the animation can be at its best showing unique designs with the mentioned creatures and seeing Saki and other psychics show off their powers during heated moments. However, there are points where the animation quality can take a hit with jerky animation and drawing errors in character designs.\
While a decent series, I do think From the New World may be a bit overhyped in folks laying claim to it as one of the best titles that came out for 2012 and 2013. The plot buildup and world building are solid in execution, though character focus is limited and there are points where the series can get a little too heavy on exposition from its cast to reveal more to its story. Still, it does do well enough in sticking out from many recent anime offerings with what it has to offer. \

    Shinsekai Yori Reveiw:\
Story: Shinsekai Yori has one of the best plot lines I have watched so far. This story, from the very beginning, hints that there is something not right with the world around them like the rumors of the monster cats and the disappearing children as mentioned in the synopsis. From this point on the five main characters proceed to slowly find out about the darker side that plagues their town. This story will have you watching the next episode as soon at the first ends. Just a warning though, this is a very dark anime and It may make you sad at times.\
          \
I gave the story a 10.\
Sound: The sound was good, I guess. Most of the time you will be too engrossed in the story to even notice that there is actually music in the background. As for the opening and closing songs, well how do I put this, there was no opening song and just goes straight into the anime. I am definitely not complaining though since this gave more time to the story and a couple of cut scenes that show what happen in the past. The ending song, I didn't really listen to because I was already to the next episode, but from what I heard of the first few seconds of it, It was most likely pretty good. \
I gave the sound an 8 \
Art: The art of Shinsekai Yori is in one work amazing. The scenery of the Japan of the future can only be described as a rural country with all the beauty that comes from nature, these scenes usually happen when the story takes a break an gives the viewer a moment to catch their breath. Other than that the artwork is fitting with the story, dark. One other mention on the artwork would be the eyes of the characters in the story, while there is not much detail in the facial expressions of the characters, the eyes do a great job of showing the emotions of the characters. \
I gave the Art a 9 \
Characters: The characters are the best part of Shinsekai Yori. You get to see how the characters develop during the course of this story, how they interact with each other, and the decisions that they make along the way. Not only that but every decision that they make is something the the viewer can understand because who doesn't have a burning sense of curiosity, well besides that dead cat over there.  The actors also did a great job of getting the emotions of all the characters spot on and this made this show even more incredible. Its hard to describe the characters besides saying that the main characters are a great match and that you have to watch this show to understand how great they are.\
I gave the Characters a 10\
Enjoyment: Well in my opinion if the characters and the story line are amazing I will pretty much love the show. Shinsekai Yori had both of these and the other aspects of this anime is great as well. I would have watched this anime in one day if I did not have other things I had to do, that alone says that I enjoyed this anime quite a bit.\
I gave the Enjoyment a 10\
Overall: Lets start with the score this time, I gave Shinsekai Yori a 10 overall. The story and the characters have a lot of pull with me when it comes to watching an anime and when a story has these aspects I can overlook other fault that an anime has, amazingly this anime didn't have many faults to begin with and I enjoyed this anime immensely. I must say that this is a dark anime and the characters have to make tough decisions along the way, and in some places this anime becomes depressing. This is not an anime for children.\

    Ever since humans have taken their steps out of the mud, they have been the dominant species on this planet. We have advanced ourselves mentally and physically beyond imagination. However, at the same time we retain a child like nature for destruction and self preservation that will some day be our un-doing.\
I have to admit this series was the biggest surprise, for it was a title I had no expectations for. I felt like Shinsekai Yori was a title that wouldn't leave much of an impression on me, but it ended up becoming an addiction. It may have tested me at times but in the\
          \
        end it was very good.\
I've never been a particular fan of the post apocalyptic type plots. If anything, that would have been the major factor of my slight distaste for the story. The media portrays these type of stories as the cause of our own self destruction.\
Thats not to say that Shinsekai Yori followed the same model, for it didn't follow that same model. The story was engaging, it kept me coming back for more, and I feel Mr.Ishihama did a fantastic job writing the storyboard. I like the idea of humans forming mental powers, called cantus, that allow them to control their environment, but at the same time it feels like I'm watching a less technological version of Star Wars. As the plot built up from our main characters misadventures to complete all out war between sub species, I felt on edge a majority of the time. The alternate society starts out children out in various levels of schooling, but it is really only to control their cantus rather than educate them. The story itself revolves around the main cast as they move up and part ways, and how the school's committee finds ways to cast them out. After multiple failures by the committee, our main troupe is slowly split apart one by one through other circumstances. Like I said before, Mr. Ishihama did a fantastic job implementing a linear perspective. \
However, some episodes felt un-needed and it slowed the pace down at multiple points. In retrospect they seemed to serve a greater purpose. In the last few episodes everything stuck together quite nicely, and a lot of unclear histories were cleared up.\
I liked how the voice actors and characters seemed to fit their roles. The characters themselves, particularly the main cast, are thrown into a world and  are expected to fit into molds. The main cast is a particular group of interest to this society, and the society being various groups such as various organizations, elders and so forth. The society structure to me was particularly interesting because it's not all that different from modern structures. Rather than controlling children, we send them off to schools to socialize them. The real contrast here in Shinsekai Yori is controlling the children's abilities rather than educating them. I liked how each character had their own issues to work through; some of these issues were lacking in ability or possessing too much ability. If I had to pick a favorite character it would have to be Shun. It was interesting to see how his transformation was not noticeable by friends, but it was noticed early on by elders and his teachers. He was referred to as \"Karma Demon\" which twists and corrupts all around them.\
On the other hand, one major character aspect that threw me off were the same sex relationships that occurred in the story. It was really distracting to me because there isn't a clear explanation of the same sex relationships. It seems like it's something their schools implemented solely for bonding exercises, but it ultimately distracted me and felt like it didn't belong.\
On the topic of characters, I wasn't very fond of the character animations. One point of distraction would be the oddly drawn faces. I didn't like the eye styles or the face structures very much. It took me some time to adjust, but in the end I became used to it.\
The animation itself was good, not great, but good. combined with eerie instrumentals it made it a supernatural experience. However, the animation seemed very low budget. I've always liked the high end budget animation, but it didn't bother me at all. At some points it didn't flow very well, and you might have been able to see how stretched the animation budget was. \
The music compositions that were chosen fit very well, and I liked them. It gave chilled feelings at some perfect moments. I loved the ending theme that was performed by Taneda, Risa. It felt like the first theme was designed to lift of tension, and the second was made to build up even more tension. Some of the voice actors were new, but they did a good job in their respective roles. I look forward to hearing from some of these first time voice actors in the future.\
Shinsekai Yori is definitely a title that brings you a surreal, supernatural experience. It is a series you shouldn't judge until it is finished.\

    This anime is one of those that build up from the start, and It keeps piling on more and more and still succeeds.\
The world that they live in is so strange, so bizzare, and so dangerous. \
The starting episodes are focused questioning how shady the village really is. This show has heavy emphasis on mystery: They keep throwing things at you and makes you keep questioning why. They will keep making you whisper WTF under your breath, lol I know I did. No worries, they start explaining what you need to know after they throw you in a ride for a bit.\
Characters aren't safe in\
          \
        this anime. It may seem like they are at first, but this show isn't afraid to kill anyone off. You don't need me to tell you because the story feels so eerie throughout, you just feel an impending doom. \
What makes this anime so cool is their unique worldly setting. The have deep lore and sometimes tell little horror stories on the side that always come true. In fact, a lot of this show has the horror aspect. \
The culture in the show is a lot different from ours. It was very interesting how everyone is Bi, and there isn't a problem with this to them.\
The characters are awesome, because you literally grow up with them. You go on a long journey with them, a 25 episode journey. They are believable when it comes to their actions, and they are constantly fighting over what is wrong or what is right. Sometimes the children are smarter than the adults in these cases. \
Like I said, their world is DANGEROUS. It is filled with monsters that do WTF IS THAT THING things and one of the main plots of focusing on the monster rats. Every time they leave the damn village, you know shits about to go down, and they leave it a lot.\
With the horror aspect, they do it well. When they have to hide, you know they will die if they get caught. The suspense in the show is intense, and there is always a trust issue with everyone too.\
The music is awesome as always, they play this harmony voice music that goes well with the weird mystic power theme they were going for.\
The animation is great, they do a lot of running/sliding/flying as well as showing action.\
I feel like the major reason why this anime did so well is the build up. The build up was amazing, you go from staying in town as a kid, leaving town, growing up, adventuring to waste lands, EVERYWHERE. You get to see different villages, creatures, culture... Everything.\
The best part of the build up is towards the last few episodes. It all ties together, there aren't any loose strings, it ends well (bad or good).\
Overall, I give this show 8.7 or 9 out of 10 monster rats.\

    [NO SPOLIERS DON'T WORRY]\
This anime is a masterpiece in many ways and kind of hints at our past in a way to get you to think who the villain really is. The reason i rated this so highly was mainly for the art, character personality, and the story. In the beginning you will learn about the past of the village. A lot of back story is given so make sure to pay attention. Towards the middle events will start to pick up with many antagonists and a rise in tension between characters and a loop that you might have not seen coming. And finally in\
          \
        the end which is really what made me enjoy this anime so much was how you were left to sort of piece the history together and try to see everything from the antagonists point of view. Who was the real villain this whole time? That's for you to decide with your opinion on whats right and whats wrong.\
Hope you enjoy!!!\

    First, I'm warning you already. If you can't hold out your patience, then don't watch it. It had a slow pace and I can feel others not wanting to watch it every week when it was released. It lacked the first strike for viewers to want to watch it but it's like a treasure buried deep. Not all anime can do it.\
I just finished watching it and I say that I watched it out of whim just because I'm curious. I'm not disappointed with the story, in fact I'm amazed enough to consider this a gem. It was really refreshing to watch an anime like\
          \
        this, not every one would like to see one though. The utopia/dystopia approach played a big role in the anime that would make you think and question things as you watch it. I wouldn't say anything as how the animations worked because it was supposed to be subjective as some of the episodes looked like it came out of nowhere but it added to the spice of the anime.\
I wouldn't consider this horror as one of the genre but a psychological one. That's all and enjoy watching.\

    Criticizing the aspects of the show (with little-to-no spoilers!):\
-   Slow burning plot line is a strong point, but also feels like the show drags unnecessarily long at times. Climaxes are great culminations of the information provided to the viewer and end on very satisfying notes. Some weak moments include the beginning of the show, which feels slow and mundane, and the ending feels somewhat week. Nonetheless, the overall plot is very much enjoyable.\
-   World-building in this show is amazing. Almost every detail that the show hands out whilst describing this world further ties into the plot and becomes relevant.\
-  \
          \
        The info-dumps are real. There's a few moments, not too many, but they are prominent. This is both an important, strong aspect of world-building in the show and a possible weak point, as I can see this being a issue for some people. The viewer can end up questioning whether these info-dumps are important or relevant, or if this was really the best way for a topic to be explained.\
-   Character development is minimal and feels flat. In retrospect, the show capitalizes more on interactions between characters and focusing on building the plot from an established cast and their personalities.\
-   Music, sounds, and art are all absolutely beautiful. Suspense and unsettling moments are key in this show - they are wonderfully illustrated and backed by great atmospheric music.\
-   Multiple themes in the show. Nice.\
-   Perspective is everything. Villains can be truly sympathized with and their reasons are both realistic in nature and thought-provoking.\
\
My overall score wasn't simply taking an average of each component (that MAL gives you to rate), but rather a personal score (if that makes sense? haha), after thinking really hard about it and trying to take it all in. There's some gripes I have with the show, and I would LOVE to rate this higher as this has been an incredible experience viewing the show, but I truly feel happy with a 7 here. The show was enjoyable. I see myself re-watching this show in the future and I look forward to seeing what more I can take out of the show, once I see and understand all the small details! \
P.S. Now to regular MAL viewers/raters, this might come off as an is an 'average' score , but I really try to take 5/10 as the average here and 7 is a good score to me.\
P.S. (2) I wonder if anyone's even going to read this. This is quite an old anime by now (Nov 2017) - like 4 years old by now, to final airing date - and gosh, if you're here reading this and have read all of the above, thank you so much. This is my first posted review (summary kinda) and I've had fun writing it! I actually had a really big essay I typed as a draft, but I left it in the Tags section on the MAL entry page, instead of Comments, and 90% of it went unsaved fml. So I resorted to just doing a shorter, dot-point formatted review. Thanks again for reading!\

    This is honestly one of the best animes I've seen. It may start off a bit slow but the world created is an intriguing one. It's a real shame that many are put off by the art style at times (I personally mainly enjoyed it) or the slow start because this is SERIOUSLY worth watching. The plot is incredibly interesting in the way that as the stories goes on, more truths about the dystopian world in which the characters live are revealed as the characters themselves discover them. The large time span adds to the kind of immensity of the story, as the characters lives\

        are followed from childhood to adulthood. \
The real thing that makes this a masterpiece though is the ending. Holy shit. Nothing prepares you for it. I would say it's probably one of the best endings to an anime I've seen and to be honest it made me stay up pretty late recovering from the aftermath. If you enjoy plots that blow your mind but also kinda fuck you up a lil bit, definitely watch this because holy shit it is amazing and criminally underrated. \

I would recommend this anime to any true hard core anime fan whom appreciates character development and plot.\
I honestly believe EVERY anime could learn from this series whether it be a school, thriller, romance, psychological, or even a sci fi anime, because of how perfectly done each of core aspects in an anime is explored (Such as character development), all anime should be like this one.\
I will try to keep this review short and simple.\
Character Development 10/10 \
Shinseki Yori is a complete masterpiece in regards to deep character development and regression, with an even deeper plot. Each character is beautifully developed and memorable.\
          \
        And they will stick to you.\
We start off the anime where we see our young Saki join a school with some of her classmates from before. By the end of the show we've seen them progress through their life into adulthood. Whilst comparing their behaviours and ideologies at the start with the end, you can see that Saki and Satoru for example, have changed into much more responsible and less naive people, especially when it comes to discrimination and abuse of power. This is what ended up sticking to me the most, how each character is unique and the fact that they changed their ideals by the end becoming better people. The ending was above all touching and memorable, yet somewhat sad.\
Story 10/10\
The plot twists. The plot twist oh my god. And the eerie sensation, the dark and the light hearted parts of the anime are so beautifully executed. \
Story wise, in my opinion he who watches Shinseki Yori has to view it with a mature mind, this is no simple anime, it takes some thought. This story combats racism, discrimination and persecution on an entirely whole other level and executes it beautifully which is one of the beautiful aspects which I love about it, where humans with powers are so called gods, and beings with a similar human structure are discriminated because they don't contain these powers. The story drastically and exponentially becomes deep each episode, I once had a dream, which plot-wise, was very similar to Shinseki Yori. The story is post apocalyptic based, based in Japan a dystopian world in the future. Usually instead of technological advancements which many post apocalyptical stories contain, this has a certain twist, where humans have supernatural abilities. And other beings walk among them which serve the humans as so called \"gods\". The story also revolves around romance and same sex romance, which is why a more mature audience should watch this. But I highly recommend this anime to any deep anime fan. \
\
Art 9/10\
Where do I even start. The art in Shinseki Yori is somewhat unique which really draws you in, its something I love so much, each character is unique and beautifully drawn. At some parts, very few, there could be improvements with some 2d/3d models, but its a very minor and non problematic part of the anime.\
Sound 10/10\
I have downloaded all of the OST's, they are amazing, can't say anything else other than beautifully amazing and intriguing. What is strange though is that there is no intro, which honestly I can't imagine this anime with an opening, its perfect. The ending is really nostalgic and one of my favourite endings. Also the voice acting was on point.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
What I enjoyed the most was the character development and the suspense after each episode especially after episode 3. The plot, the plot twists, and the characters are unforgettable and amazing. You're ships will be answered and when you want a fitting end for a certain character it ends up coming true, but at some points the anime becomes sad, in no means is this a negative issue though.\
\
Overall 10/10\
To sum up the anime in a few words. Its surely in my top 3, It is somewhat slow, but in no means at all boring or irritating to get through, its a beautiful anime. And at times eerie... I recommend this to anyone who wants an actual good anime, with character development, an amazing plot with twists and something that will stick with you forever. The plot and story is honestly unique and you will find NO other anime like this.\

         Now this is my very first review. I do not feel as though I have much say in whether or not my opinion should have an affect in watching this show or not. So please, I advise you, take my opinions of this show as nothing more than what it is. An opinion. So without further ado, my review.\
Story:\
      The story that this show provides you with definitely provides some social commentary on society as a whole. It carefully puts together this world that Yusuke Kishi has made. You slowly learn of this world's customs\
          \
        and this world's traditions. You go in the show as a foreigner of this world and come out of it as a native. And I think that is the best way to describe this show.\
     When you start watching, there is a lot that you just don't understand, and some things may come off to you as weird. That is because you are a foreigner of this world, and depending on whether or not you wish to stay in this world, you will have to grow used to some thing that are different. So in world building and storytelling, I definitely will give an A. \
Art & Sound: \
     As for the art of this show, I'd say there are some problems I had. The art itself leaves something to be aspired for. It is not hard to watch by any means, and it even has some beautiful moments, but as a whole I felt like it could have been handled better. The character designs felt very plain. It looks as if they all the main characters share the same face and body types, and the art style was not easy to get used to for me. It was different, and although that is not always a bad thing, it was in the case of this show.\
     The soundtrack itself was amazing. I found it absolutely fitting for the show, and it pushes certain emotions out of you. The ED itself, is one that I will go back to listen to time and time again. The music is really the best fit for the show. And for the voice acting, I'd say most of the voices were fitting except in maybe the later part of the show. The voice actor changes do affect the character somewhat, but the quality of the voice acting does not waver. The voice of the main antagonist is really fitting too. (By the way, I watched the sub only.)\
Characters:\
     The characters in this show are definitely well written. The situations that they are put through, are also situations that the viewer goes through and because of that, you grow to care for them more. You can tell what emotions are between which characters, and because of that you understand the importance of each character. Although the characters all live in a different world than you do, you can still relate to them because they are humans and they still show the emotions that we all have.\
Overall:\
     Although I feel this show fell short with some of the art that was portrayed, it really excelled in just about everything else. It may not have been entirely perfect, but to me I felt it gave me something that I just can't get from any other anime ever. And that is really saying something. Each episode has a way of making me want to watch the next and that is just what I look for in a show. (Not to say that cliffhangers are the best, but when they are pulled off right, they really are great.) So yes, I can see this as one of my favorite shows, but I think rewatching it is something that I would have to think about. It's not really a show that you can experience twice. It was really great as it is though and I would suggest it to anybody who loves, not only anime, but stories in general.\

    I can imagine in my head the saying \"Do not judge a book by its cover\". While A1 Pictures raised crazy money with Sword Art Online and just started the second arc, they also initiated a new project. From the animation quality, you can see how much more effort was put in SAO than this project. The review will be on the anime series of the novel \"From The New World\" (aka Shinsekai Yori), a hidden gem during the Fall 2012 season. The saying I initially quoted can be shown from these two series. On the one hand, you have the worldwide hit, SAO, which\

        the grand majority claimed it as \"masterpiece\" and shipped Kirito X Asuna. However, past the pretty art and the first two episodes which were flawed but were good (if the show remained in that track it would have gotten a 7), the music becomes repetitive and it is very generic if you know the composer, the story is bad and asphyxiated with plot armor and deus ex machinas coming out from Jesus-kun and the characters are plain atrocious. Thankfully, Shinsekai Yori, despite its ok to meh art, shines in everything else.\
Positives (+):\
-Beautiful, memorable music\
-First ED is just gorgeous. Second is very good but not to the extent of the first one.\
-Some clever directing here and there.\
-Characters that have actually a good development and seem realistic. \
-Great world-building and a very interesting story. (If you get past the weirdness of Episode 8 and just keep the main story elements from it,  you are gonna have the time of your life).\
-An enjoyable ride from beginning to end.\
Negatives (-):\
-Art looks weird at some occasions.\
-Episode 8\
Overall: 8.78/10      FID\
Recommendations:\
-Spirited Away for its imaginative world building and the realistic qualities of characters with a far superior art style than that of Shinsekai Yori.\
-Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood since both stories are great and have a well done world-building and you can relate to the characters.",

    Shinsekai Yori is a very interesting anime that follows the lives of a group kids as they grow up and learn more about their world.\
TL:DR \
To me this anime had a ton of potential, but only managed to live up to it in some areas of the plot. The story is really awkwardly paced, and a lot could be done to improve how it was presented. However, the characters and world building are done extremely well, and kept me going to the end of the series.\
Story (6)\
The story follows a group of friends as they grow up and learn about the world around them. They\
          \
        have interesting experiences, suffer losses, and find love. The world these characters live in is set in the future, in which mutant rats roam the country side and humanity has been reduced to small villages. Going off of this alone, you can definitely see that there is a lot of potential! However, to me personally the pacing and presentation of how events unfolded killed a large part of the series for me. For the most part the story flows well, but 2 times in the series it completely gets flipped over by unexpected time skips. They sort of pull you out of the show by advancing the story 12 years between episodes. That's forgivable, but for both cases i wish i had another episode before hand to wrap up the current arc more cleanly. The other major problem i had with the plot was how it presented crucial moments. To avoid spoilers i wont go into specifics, but many things which are incredibly important to the plot are presented subtly and casually, when they absolutely shouldn't be. This led to there being almost 0 suspense for me at the time of the climax, which was rather disappointing because there were many times in the series where i was really eager to watch another episode instead of just waiting for the series to end.\
Art (7)\
The art was pretty good, nothing too impressive, but definitely pretty at times.\
Sound (7)\
Definitely an interesting sound track that fits the story well.\
Character (9)\
This anime does not boast a giant cast, but the characters it focuses on are done incredibly well. This leads to a lot of emotional moments for the viewer, and creates excellent drama between them at parts.\
Enjoyment (6)\
The first half the series had me on the hook, and because of that momentum i was able to finish the second half.",

    Story:\
The quality of the storytelling is excellent, yet bobs and weaves at some points during the plot. The story is competently told, almost expertly at times, but some episodes just don't fit with the flow of the series, and other episodes have their story stretched over multiple episodes in a lengthy and completely out of place manner. Most of the issues with storytelling occur as the series is wrapping up. The last few episodes take up an inappropriate amount of time to unfold the plot and the storytelling at this point gets a little clumsy. This occurs once or twice before in individual episodes. The\
          \
        overall plot of the show is unique, complex, and thought provoking, and thankfully does not fatigue the watcher by the end. The show takes some interesting looks at complex issues in a mature manner that very few anime, or pieces of media in general, succeed in doing. The ending is satisfying, while leaving a few questions annoyingly unanswered, and the journey there is great.\
There was one plot element in the story that felt out of place which has to do with the sexuality of the characters and how sexuality is handled in their society. This element attracted some controversy with some saying that it was included for fan service purposes. In defense of the creators, I believe that they handled this plot element quite well. The episodes that heavily featured this \"sexuality\" element were handled maturely and these episodes felt as if the writers were exploring the world and the characters as they underwent puberty instead of providing blatant fan service. However, looking back, I find the inclusion of this plot element bizarre as it never seemed relevant in any other part of the plot. It seemed to serve little purpose than giving flavor to the world, which it indeed achieved in doing. But considering its heavy emphasis in the series, it felt like there should have been more purpose for it. On the other hand, I believe that this element did provide for a stronger bond between characters.\
9/10\
Art:\
One of the things I enjoyed the most about this series was the art. Both the beautiful scenery and terrific character designs contributed to, and fit in with, the overall mood of the series. The designs of the characters and monsters were well done and nice to look at. The animation takes some dips throughout the series, but none of it is unwatchable. The art style, scenery, and character designs were all great and contributed to the series.\
9/10\
Sound:\
The sound direction in Shinsekai Yori is one of its greatest features. The voice actors fit perfectly with every character and one voice never took me out of the experience. The sound track is especially well executed and does wonders to evoke emotion in many scenes. This series does not feature an opening song, a stylistic choice that feels appropriate considering the different moods presented in each episode. It would be difficult to match each episode with a fitting opening. One episode, however, did feature an opening song. This was a clever device used to introduce background information for two of the main characters which was essential for the episode to work. While the series lacks an opening song, it makes up for any drawbacks with two fantastic EDs. The ending that accompanied the first half of the series was excellently done in both visuals and audio. It provided the perfect ending for each episode. The ED for the second half of the series was well done but not nearly as memorable or as accentuating as the first ED.\
10/10\
Characters:\
I am mixed in my critique of Shinsekai Yori's characters. On one hand, I sincerely enjoyed each of the characters. On the other hand, they never achieved true growth within the story. While more than generic cardboard cutout characters, the characters were not completely 3d, but rather caught in a 2.5d limbo. Many may consider this a bad thing, but the characters were rather fleshed out and fit their roles well. They behaved, for the most part, in a consistent manner and moved along nicely in the plot. While I would have liked for some more interaction between the characters and some more character introspection, the creators did a good job in making some relatable and likable characters. The characters work in the story, and I really liked each of them.\
8/10\
Other:\
In this section I will discuss episode 5. This episode was a complete embarrassment to the series, and as such I have excluded it from evaluation. Episode 5 had a guest director who changed the art, story, and sound direction completely. The art style completely changes and left me, and many other viewers, baffled for a while. The mood and tone shift from the new art style startled me and completely took me out of the experience. The art wasn't bad, but just didn't fit with the mood set by the previous episodes. The director fumbled with the plot and took the characters out of their roles, changing Saki from a level-headed 12 year old girl to a clumsy dumb preteen. This episode truly is baffling and makes me wonder if the show's creators reviewed it at all before releasing it. Moral of the story: never let another director jack your story.\
I truly consider this to be one of the best shows I have ever seen. It competently tells a complex story with solid characters and great art and sound direction. I want to give Shinsekai Yori a 10, but it has some flaws that warrant giving it a 9. This series is a truly enjoyable and complex work.",

    This is my first review. So here goes....\
I started watching this anime with very high expectations. Came across it in mal when I was checking the ratings of Psycho Pass and the page said Shinsekai Yori was similar to it. It is not entirely wrong, but the worlds portrayed are completely different.\
This is an anime which considers what would've happened to human beings if some were born with special powers and some weren't. That's the basic premise of the story. What makes the anime awesome is the way the author has built the world around this fact and told the story based on the premise.\
          \
        Living in a world where classification has become its very basis, things portrayed in this anime are very much in sync with whats happening. It raises a lot of questions about nature of human beings and the system that is in place in the world in which they live.\
Having said all that I'm giving the story 8 out of 10 as the sory telling could've been much better. Lot of things happen for which an explanation is conveniently overlooked. If they had done that, it would've been one of the best in the list of science-fiction anime set in a dystopian world. \
The art and music are certainly praiseworthy as they never feel out of place.\
Overall I had fun watching this.\

    Shin Sekai Yori is an anime based on a novel written by Kishi Yusuke. The anime adaptation was handled by A-1 pictures. You may remember them as the studio behind Kuroshitsuji and AnoHana. This was actually requested as a “futuristic scenario done right” after I took a look at the mediocrity that was Blue Gender, but I've also been told that this series is just as bad, even using several of the same cliches. There's only one way to find out which is more correct and that's by taking a look. \
Story:\
Our tale opens in the far future. Our protagonist, Saki, has just advanced to\
          \
        the next level of education, a school that teaches kids how to use their psychic abilities, but there's something wrong. Students disappear from the school and are promptly forgotten. Saki and her friends go on a camping trip that will lead to them learning a great secret about their society.\
That's how the first arc begins. Yes, the series has multiple story arcs. One thing the series does really well is introducing intriguing ideas. The problem is that most of those concepts end up going absolutely nowhere or are just executed poorly. You think that the various ideas that are touched upon are going to eventually have a point, but they never do. It's like Kishi introduced them planning to integrate them into the plot eventually, but couldn't figure out how and let them drop, or briefly mentioned them in some minor scene in the hopes that he could validate having them in the first place. \
There are quite a few other issues with the execution of this anime. The series tries to explain several facets of its world with science, which it gets wrong consistently. To use an early example that won't spoil anything, the series talks about bonobos. It says that they're peaceful, preferring sex to conflict and that they'll only engage in sexual activities with the same sex when they're young. The first half is true, the second is an outright lie and the bad part is that a half-true scientific statement is about the best the series ever gets in terms of its science. \
The crowning moment of stupidity is definitely the ending. It starts by using a huge logical fallacy in the major climax. Then it segues into a plot twist that hinges on bad science and just to make things even worse, the series ends with the same lazy, stupid, cliché that Blue Gender ended with. Except that the execution is even worse. At least Blue Gender had some build up going into it, Shin Sekai Yori has a five minute montage at the very end to justify resorting to this tripe. \
Characters:\
The characters are similar to the story. The writing teases you with hints that these characters are going to develop and get fleshed out, but then it never delivers. In spite of the story spanning over a decade, the characters never grow or develop. They remain pretty stagnant throughout. \
The only attempts to demonstrate growth for the characters are done with informed characteristics. For example, there's a character who talks about Saki's great leadership skills but she never demonstrates any leadership abilities whatsoever. She follows other people's plans or gets told what to do by the voices in her head. Yes, she has deceased people talk to her. No, this is never explained it's just used as a deus ex machina device. \
The issue with informed characteristics like this is that the audience isn't going to believe them. You can tell us the stormtroopers are precise marksmen, but if we see them miss virtually ever shot we aren't going to believe it. Likewise, you can tell us she's a great leader. You could also tell us she gained magical girl powers from a talking dog and saved the world from goo monsters during one of the time skips or that she's the world's greatest detective. We not only aren't going to buy it, but we aren't going to care unless you actually demonstrate it within the narrative. \
Art:\
The art is really good. Everything is nicely detailed and the character designs are nicely done. That being said, there is one problem with the art. The action sequences are drawn very oddly and they can be difficult to follow. Especially the early ones. For the sake of argument, let's say that this was done to provide a sense of chaos and make things seem hectic. That would be fine, but it still doesn't flow well or look good. \
Sound:\
I have no complaints about the voice acting. Every actor gives a capable performance, in spite of not having much to work with. Hanazawa Kana (Akane from Psycho Pass) and Hirata Hiroaki (Benny from Black Lagoon) are particularly good. The music is largely forgettable, but not bad. \
Ho-Yay:\
The ho-yay factor is going to be a 4/10. The series has a bit early on. It has some yaoi between Shun and Satoru, as well as some in the background, and some yuri between Saki and Maria, plus some more in the background. Then it transitions into having nothing but het. \
Final Thoughts: \
On the positive side, Shin Sekai Yori has strong art and good voice acting. Unfortunately, the writing is just inept. The story suffers from major plot holes, terrible science, dropped plot aspects, a horrendous ending and characters who are less interesting than the random nameless bad guys you fight in a Fire Emblem game. As a result, the narrative is just terrible and I would not suggest sitting through it just for the art and acting. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, One Outs. \

    I've never felt as uncomfortable after finishing a show as I am now, after finishing Shinsekai Yori. The show makes you look inward; it makes you evaluate what you think is right and what is wrong. And it did so in a way I wasn't expecting. Whether by design or unintentionally, the show manages to put some of the main dilemmas right in front of you, while simultaneously distracting you with seemingly more important events. Shinsekai Yori has quite a bit of mystery to it, and this mystery is constantly driving the story. It's suspenseful at times, its sad at times, and more than not\
          \
        its thought provoking.\
*There will be some minor spoilers in this next section, but I will try to keep them to a minimum*\
The reason I only rated this show an 8, is perhaps a result not of the show's quality, but of my own uneasiness. Character is important to me in any story. The main character of  the show, Saki, is excellent. Perhaps one of my favorite characters of any show I've watched. But several of the other characters don't come across well to me (which may be intentional). It can be hard to understand the motivations of the \"adults\" in the story; however I'm willing to give that a pass because of the dystopian world in which they live and were raised in. However Satoru poses a bit of a problem for me, though only at the end of the story. By the end of the story I was in agreement with the antagonists of the story. Saki seemed to share the same misgivings I did every step of the way. But Satoru...after everything Satoru endured with Saki, he seemed to be stuck in an old way of thinking. The story ended on a positive note, but it took a major revelation for Satoru's character to reach a point that I felt he should've reached even without the major revelation.\
 Shinsekai Yori is a wonderful story, but I wouldn't say it is a happy story. The plot and the questions contained within, are not something you can find in many anime. The story is meant for a more mature audience, and if you want something that's a little more than mindless fun then Shinsekai Yori is probably for you.\

    I wanted to like this series so so much. It's a utopian (I think) mystery, and starts off very solid and very strong. I particularly enjoy the theme song – it sets the atmosphere for the story. The first several episodes have a very haunting feel, and the premise is unlike any other I've seen. Characters' personalities aren't anything special, but not bad either – something I can overlook. I enjoyed every bit of the first arc, and the world building was so well-developed and had so much potential.\
However, it was in the second and third arcs where I felt let down. The haunting atmosphere\
          \
        I very much enjoyed had completely vanished, and the main character had degraded into an archetype of 'romantically conflicted and clingy female lead'. In a second arc's episode (I can't remember exactly) where something very bad happens to the love interest, leaving the protagonist very affected, she was just a pain in the ass. The episode itself had a very surreal feel, but her zombified nature (this was due to some very annoying reasons), along with her whining and clingyness to the love interest just ruined it. \
The third arc was just weird. The queerats, an aspect that has been kept as a side story, abruptly shifts to the main focus of the story. Nothing particularly wrong with that, but the complete lack of transition just made it feel out of place. The whole arc was boring and anticlimatic, except for the time when the main characters were escaping from the unidentified fiend. That was one of the better points of he series. The sense of fear of the unknown was very well-conveyed. The resolution part where the main character reflects on humanity's actions towards the queerats was also very nicely done. Everything else, in contrast, was meh.\
A lot of potential, with some parts solidly done, but otherwise mediocre. Leaves much to be desired.\

    This anime has changed my moral standard. No not just that, by my own view of the world and how I should live. This anime is one of the best, underrated anime that everyone should at least give a shot. I recommend you all to watch it but under these circumstances: \
- DO not drop the series until you have finished watching all 25 episodes. (The first few episodes are very boring but it picks up after the camping trip.) \
- It may seem confusing, but EVERYTHING comes together by the 25 episodes. Most of your questions will be answered. \
- The ending is statisfactory\
          \
        given the world in which the author paints. So if you are worried about the ending don't. It's magnificent. \
- It is for matured audience. Really, it has dark themes. \
\
These quotes from this anime are now officially impacted on my view of life and it will continue for the rest of my life. I guess you will have to find out the explanation and the deeper meaning when you watch the series. Yes go watch it now.\
- We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.\
- All problems come from the human mind. In the mind, one's consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg. What lies beneath the surface... the subconscious... is far more vast.\
- I think there are many things in this world we are better off not knowing. Sometimes the truth is the cruelest thing of all. Not everyone can bear it.\
-   Sometimes, the truth is the cruelest thing of all.\
-The power of imagination is what changes everything. (cantus)\
- We are human\
Story\
Nothing could describe the theme in this anime. In fact there are many themes in the story and covers many philosophical , psychological issues and even modern day problems. It could be seen as a coming of age story, or a story regarding human nature, racism, conflict and dystopian future. The impact of extreme technology i.e genetic engineering, nuclear weapon, on the world and humanity. Many many themes. Yes, it is actually executed well so you will see everything without complaining about pacing or not understanding. Oh and even homosexuality... \
10/10. Go watch it now even just for this story alone. \
Art\
The eyes of the characters are unique. I like  them. The other aspect of art were not particular well especially if you look back. I watched this in 2016 when the anime was actually aired 2012/13. Yes, I could notice the art difference. But it still good enough. The camera angle and everything is perfect. Art could be one of the downside but it DOES NOT AT ALL AFFECT the unravelling of the story which won my heart. 8/10\
Sound:\
It's good enough for back in the day. I know this is nothing glorious like AOT, or GC soundtracks, but ED and OST was memorable. Honestly, it fit the mood. so... 9/10. \
No op is actually a good thing. It shows how there is something always in the background (ending song only) to have that dramatic effect. \
Character:\
The characters no doubt grew from a child to teenager to an adult. Though, I would have like to see more action and change by saki in the end. But overall GOOD development. And perhaps, you are wondering about shipping... well it IS IRRELVENT in this series but the message itself is so much more important then that. In the end, you realize it doesn't matter who end up with who but rather the experience they shared.  9/10\
Enjoyment:\
Look, I was horrified and was on the edge of my seat. I had to pause every 1-2 episode to analysis what the hell was going on. But it was worth it. I really liked it. I really recommend you all to watch it. 7/10\
Overall: \
look, sometimes, you just have to watch the anime to see it for yourself. With out spoiling anything, all i have to say is, it is so good. It is educational and life changing. You will grew with the growth of these characters and the progress of the story. It unravels about humanities past, present and future. It changes you forever in the inside. :D watch it when are over 18. And ENJOY <3 \

    Were I to summarize Shinsekai Yori in a single word, that word would be “intelligent”. If I could add a second word? “Too”.\
Shinsekai Yori is a highly regarded anime about a group of children who live a thousand years in the future. However, their future is not one of advanced technology, of aliens and space-travel. These children – all of the humans we see, really – possess a psychic ability called “Cantus” and live in a society more reminiscent of ancient Japan than anything one might associate with the future. Their village, though seemingly idyllic, is not all that it seems. Outside the holy barrier,\
          \
        fiends, karma demons, and other creatures are said to lurk. Further, the humans are served by the rather disgusting bakenezumi, or queerats, an intelligent species of bi-pedal rats who are, of course, more than they appear.\
This sounds like an interesting premise, and Shinsekai Yori’s first four episodes – often derided as a weak point – hold a great deal of promise. Slow and deliberately paced, they reveal much about the setting and hint at mysteries and incongruities waiting to be revealed. But episode five is where things change. Whilst the first four episodes are slower and feel like a mix of dystopia, fantasy, and horror, the next three feel more like a fast-paced action-adventure. The episodes following those three are more a slow romantic drama, and so on. This isn’t necessarily a weakness, but leads to a rather halting pace early on, as the viewer is confront with jarring shifts in tone. This suggests that, whether or not the writers knew what they wanted to do with this story, they didn’t know how best to achieve it.\
As for the story itself, it only begins to materialize around the halfway point. That’s not to say that the first half of the story is a series of episodic adventures, nor that what occurs there doesn’t have any bearing on what follows, but rather that things take a while to come together. There are several twists and moments of legitimate surprise. All of these things are properly foreshadowed for the astute viewer, and I don’t think the storytelling really relies on twists or surprises to move things along, either. However, due to the shifts in tone mentioned above, the story lacks a certain momentum. There is a bit of deus ex machina near the end, though the characters still need their own ingenuity to resolve the plot. \
The characters prove another chink in Shinsekai Yori’s armor. Our protagonist is a young girl named Saki. She is the narrator. She is the person through whose eyes we witness the story. As protagonists go, Saki is fairly bland. She is competent and courageous and able to face many of the harsh truths that she and her friends uncover as the story unfolds. This last part is a bit of a problem, however. At one point, Saki is told by one of her mentors that her ability to stay calm in the face of the many revelations and events that she encounters means that she will eventually have a position of authority and import within the village. But in a story that is somewhat dystopian in outlook, having a protagonist who is unflappable is a hindrance rather than a strength. These kinds of stories want characters with more vitality. Struggling with unpleasant truths makes a character compelling; however, we never see Saki truly grapple with the injustice and cold utilitarianism of the world in which she lives.\
Saki’s friends prove more capable of emoting than she. (Well, three of them do; Shun is even more of a wet noodle.) However, because the story cleaves so closely to Saki’s perspective, we rarely get a full glimpse of what they’re thinking or how they feel about things. A perfect example of this happens in the middle of the story. Two of Saki’s friends make a decision with significant consequences, but there’s very little foreshadowing that they intend to make this decision. We do discover their reasoning after it happens. On the one hand, this makes their decision surprising; on the other, these characters end up feel like card-board cut-outs for Saki to react to, rather than characters with real emotions or motives. Even a few conversations hinting at certain feelings or thoughts might have alleviated this problem, but to my recollection, no such conversations occur.\
Further, though this story takes place over the course of fourteen years, we never see these characters change. The Saki at the end of the story knows more than the Saki at the beginning, but she’s still largely the same. She’s mature, she’s capable, she’s courageous, she’s kind; she’s all that she was in the beginning, and not much more. Characters are the engine of a story, regardless of its medium. If those characters aren’t compelling in themselves, they should be put in situations that make them compelling. But whilst Saki and her friends can be said to experience a series of events that might be described as interesting, those events fail to make them compelling.\
The most compelling characters are two of the queerats, Squealer and Kiroumaru. Squealer is a character I can’t say that I like, but he manages to be interesting and complex in a way that the human characters are not. Kiroumaru proves a perfect foil and displays as much depth and complexity as Squealer, whilst providing a differing viewpoint on humans, queerats, and their respective societies. Truly, Shinsekai Yori would have benefited from including more of these two.\
A final note about the writing. Prior to watching Shinsekai Yori, I had heard it was a series steeped in moral complexity. This is true to a degree. However, much of that complexity is rather abstract. Whilst events do unfold that are meant to make the viewer ask if the ends ever justify the means, the characters are never asked the same question. This certainly adds a lot to post-viewing discussions, but contributes to the characters seeming shallow and passive. They are never forced to confront the realities of their world in a morally meaningful way.\
Shinsekai Yori’s art direction is a mixed bag. For the most part, the backgrounds are well done, and occasionally they’re even beautiful. Likewise, the overall aesthetic of the series – the architecture, the way the characters dress, the designs of the queerats and wildlife – is one of a kind. I’ve never seen an anime with quite the same look as this one. The animation itself is average, at best. There are some well-animated scenes in the first episode – especially the opening sequence set in modern-day Tokyo – and the unique style of episode ten is befitting of the events that occur in that episode. However, episode five’s animation is abominable, and I noticed during some of the middle episodes that the characters at times seemed a little off, especially when speaking. Shinsekai Yori did not have a large budget, so this is pretty understandable, but it’s worth noting.\
The sound design is better. There are several recurring bits of background music that are affecting and help to enhance the mood of particular scenes. I’m not fluent in Japanese, and so can’t comment on how convincing the voice acting was, but I will say that none of the characters’ voices seemed out of place.\
Often described as deep and profound, Shinsekai Yori is undoubtedly intelligent. It has many ideas, many things to say. This is not a bad thing, in itself, but I think that Shinsekai Yori’s writers were ultimately overwhelmed by all the things they felt they had to say. A shorter series might have forced them to pick a theme and stick to it; a longer one might have allowed them to more adequately explore all the ideas already present in this twenty-five episode anime. As it is, we find ourselves with two central themes and several lesser ideas that are never given enough space to grow. I think, as well, that this emphasis on thought-provoking ideas contributed to several of the problems I tried to touch on in this review.\
There is a lot more that I could say, but I did not want to include any spoilers in this review. I would recommend to prospective viewers that they go in not expecting much from the narrative and characters. Even if you should judge them more favorably than I do, they are still much weaker than the ideas they try to convey. As for myself, I think the goal of fiction, first and foremost, is to tell a good story with engaging characters – ideas and themes and the like being of secondary or even tertiary importance. For writers who want to create intellectually engaging stories, it can be a tricky balancing act between narrative, character, and theme, and for me as a viewer, Shinsekai Yori struck the wrong balance.\

         Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) gives viewers a glimpse into a perfect society where everyone is gifted with psychic powers. Over the course of the twenty-five episode anime, viewers are treated to the story of five children, and the events that reveal the dark secrets behind their world. \
Story\
     The story that takes place in Shinsekai Yori is what makes this anime so special. Viewers learn about the society and its secrets as the five children’s world is turned upside down. What follows is a beautifully crafted world that challenges the viewer's belief on the\
          \
        morality of a society’s decisions for the greater good. Throughout the three main arcs of Shinsekai Yori, information of the world and brilliant foreshadowing from character’s dialogue is presented all leading up to the final arc that combines it all for the amazing conclusion. After finishing the anime, I had the urge to just sit down and discuss with somebody about the choices of the characters, and the grey morality of the entire show. \
Characters  \
     During the course of Shinsekai Yori, the viewer is shown the lives of five children who are all sorted into the same group for their school at the beginning of the show. Viewers watch as these children grow throughout the show, and are able to see how their ideas and beliefs change. The show focuses on the character of Saki Watananabe, and how the effects of one summer trip completely changes the view of the world her and her friends share. Watching these children grow into adulthood forms an attachment to the characters, and caused me to care about them when the danger ramps up later on into the story. By using Saki as the eyes of the viewer, we are able to learn about the world as she does, and by using different points in their lives we are able to see how the characters react to the rules of the society around them. \
Sound   \
     The soundtrack for Shinsekai Yori is perfect for the world that exist in this show. Tracks like Going Home and Traditional Song of Shadows are perfect for the feudal Japanese village setting, and can give the feeling of dread in intense moments. Most of the voice work is well done, and each character’s voice seems to fit their design.\
Art \
     The art design in Shinsekai Yori does its job of creating the village and its inhabints of Saki Watananabe’s world. The design of the village shows how the citizens don’t rely on technology anymore and live in a pre-technology Japan. The creature design does a great job of showing the new otherworldly monsters that inhabit the world, and the design of the Queerrats being my personal favorite. Each of the main character designs fit for their personalities, and makes a logical progression on how that character would look with each of the anime’s arcs. \
Overall    \
     In conclusion, Shinsekai Yori is an anime that will stick with me for a long time. The beautifully crafted world and its society built around psychic powers was extremely interesting world building for me. Watching five children grow up in this world while learning about how it came to be, and the morally ambiguous ways that the society protected this world provided an engaging story, and provided thought provoking questions such as “Does the ends justify the means” and “When does something count as being equal to a human?” The show ends on an extremely satisfying conclusion, and makes the viewer feel like all the knowledge they learned of this world pays off in the end.     \

    **FIRST REVIEW ALERT**\
At first, I was hesitating whether to watch this anime or not. The promotional picture shows nothing of interest at first glance. I was feeling along the lines of \"Another anime I'm gonna struggle with\" but that simply wasn't the case. After I finished this anime I was just thinking about \"How did I not watch this sooner.\" Although this anime has some issues with pacing and plot holes they are all overlookable. From the beginning till the end this anime had me glued to the screen wanting more. Wanting to know more about this group of friends and their adventure. From the\
          \
        first episode until pretty much the end there is this lingering feeling of mystery which is being unveiled little by little the further in you get, not to mention the twists which always had me seriously stop and yell \"NO WAY\" out loud. In my opinion, this anime is suited for anyone who likes mystery, drama, and stories that challenge morals.\
ART:\
I've seen a lot of people complain about the art. In my opinion, this kind of story is not what the studio behind this anime excels at and yet they did very good job with making the art look as real as possible. Although it might have felt a little bit bland at times I still think the art was very well done.\
STORY:\
The only small issue I had with the story was the skips forward in the story. I don't think they were done poorly or shouldn't have been there at all, it was just unusual for me. The skips are only weird when you are watching the anime when you finish it and look at the story as a whole it doesn't feel wrong. \
SOUND:\
Liked the first ending song a lot, other than that I can't really say much about the sound. Didn't leave a particularly strong impression on me\
CHARACTERS:\
Some of the characters had room for more development for sure. In the first five or so episodes the false minoshiro explains how the society works in this universe which might not tell you much immediately but it will all make sense later in the story. Saki, the main protagonist, really feels like a normal villager with no outstanding qualities, other than some mentioned later on, which makes it easier to feel for her. \
Overall I have to say it was a really good story which exceeded my expectations and instantly became one of my favorites.\

    Shinsekai Yori left on me an everlasting impressions. Both good and bad at the same time. Frankly I don’t remember experiencing feelings like these while watching an anime. \
A dystopian tale about a group of friends slowly but surely untangling mysteries of their society. More than interesting concept full of deep themes with moral and ethical questions that will leave you thinking for a long time. So why the bad impression?\
Well mainly because even though the concepts and setting are top not the plot itself is at first really boring. And not in the good way but in the “oh my god when does this\
          \
        end” way. There are straight up plot conveniences and troll moments in this anime. I am not sure why this is (perhaps the source material is better) because to me it seems like there are two anime going at the same time. The incredibly rich philosophical series and the filler fluff series. What’s worse is that the directing in this anime is bad. Really bad. At first I thought it’s something like Akiyuki Shinbou’s. But sadly soon enough I understood that it’s not intentionally artistic but it’s unintentionally bad. Transitions between scenes are absolutely abysmal. There is a scene earlier in the anime which left me scratching my head (chase scene in episode 5) and once again sadly scenes of this kind are not rare in this anime. \
Another bad impression is the characters. They are very bland for the most part of the series, sometimes acting completely illogical or straight up bizarre (looking at you episode 8). Thankfully later in the series they become more interesting and the main character becomes complex. \
Last bad impression (I promise) is the production. The music is great and the first ending is fantastic (and surprisingly good when it comes to visual structure). What however is not great is the animation. It is smooth but the colour pallet is just straight up bland for most part of the series. I am not entirely sure if this was intentional to invoke further feeling of dystopia but considering the fact that there are colourful and interesting scenes in the series (not many) I do not think this would be the case. The character designs are boring outside of the leaders of committees and few other characters. Some of the clothes looks cool especially the outfits MCs wear later into the series while they aren’t in their school uniforms.\
As I said at the beginning of the review, I don’t remember experiencing something like this. Very boring parts followed by grippingly amazing moments. If the characters were more interesting, the story didn’t suffer from so much dumb moments, and the overall plot would be smoother this anime would definitely deserve all the praise it’s getting and I would personally recommend it to anybody. However bad directing and inconsistent plot followed by not good visual production significantly lowers the score for me. If you don’t care about production or conveniences add 1 to my score. ",

    Powerful, intricate and stunning this series completely came out of nowhere for me and made my jaw drop again and again. Shin Sekai Yori tells the story of Saki, a girl in a mysterious future where humans have developed telekinesis, but don't let that make you think its been done before, this series will take you to new places.\
What makes this anime so good? Firstly its the mood. It keeps this eerie surreal mood all the way through with an amazing soundtrack and stunning surreal imagery. This anime moves through a variety of emotions, it is heart wrenching, sometimes genuinely scary and it even has\
          \
        its own kind of warmth but through it all it all is this beautiful ethereal quality that kept me watching and made me truly glad to have stumbled upon this series.\
Secondly its the story. This isn't some written by the week manga (even though I like those); this story has been planned right down to the last episode, which I found to be immensely satisfying. The first episode will whet your appetite with hints at whats to come in the but don't be fooled, this anime becomes more complex and beautiful as the series goes on. It's one of those stories that just keeps surprising you and getting better.\
It's not a happy story, not for those moments when you want to feel good about the human condition but it neither is it indulgently sad; it has a hopeful tone about it.\
But I do feel I have to warn potential watchers about something. There was a point where I was concerned it might become an excuse for paedophillic fanservice, its NOT! It's definitely not that kind of show. It has a fairly awkward stage around about the time the characters are going through puberty, but just like puberty it is fleeting and well worth sticking out. You may even enjoy these few episodes as I read many comments of people who did.\
All in all this is one of the best anime I have watched in a while. If you feel like you are in the mood for the kind of anime with a mature and carefully written story that challenges you, or if you appreciate stylised imagery and a bit of subtlety in your anime then this would be a good anime to watch, I highly recommend it.\

    So this is how the world could be if Psychokinesis had taken over...\
Shinsekai Yori takes place in the future - in the very distant future. Interestingly it does not really look like the very distant future; rather than the distant past, before electrcity and that stuff had been invented.\
1000 years passed... and people have not changed at all. For instance: they believe in almost the same things as they did back then in 2010. They have not grown over those years or have not made any usages of the modern technology to rebuild their lives after Psychokinesis had almost wiped out humanity (or was on\
          \
        its best way to do so). No TV, no superdimensional computers or futuristic architecture appear in the monitor in front of you. To sum up: People in 1000 years would rather go back in the forest and live under trees - using boats in order to cross (or \"drive\" on) the river and so on - than using the enormous \"power\" of our modern technology. The basic idea of this distant future story might have been pretty interesting and surely had a lot of potential and freedom to make use of it.\
With this being the case, just shows us that there was never much room for an utopian, 24 ep-lasting serie in the distant future. Thus, after the first four episodes, the serie eventually turns into a political, action-packed drama which involves a romantic drama as well with very simple characters. \
Having said that, this leads us the next issue: the characters. They were generally likeable, but definitely not memorable. The anime is told from the perspecitve of (almost) Saki only. There are, however, a lot of other characters stumbling through this Anime; therefore, it would have been nice to get some insights of other characters. Or a proper farewell since some of them just disappaer.\
The animation was really inconsistent. Also, there was a guest director for some of the episodes, and while one of them was really good, one of them was not. Notably episode 5. \
Another notable episode is definitely episode 8. It is not mainly due to its subject matter. It is rather due to the fact that there was no lead-up to what happened. There was simply no explanation, no clarification for what they did; or why a certain person has a certain feeling for someone else. And as suddenly it started, as abruptly it ended.\
Besides these problems, there are notable things which serves the anime quite a bit. The sound does deserve indubitably solid praise and the serie has a well used voice cast. Sound effects, however, were rather decent. \
The first few episodes need to be praised for its really well-directed, excellently edited and accentuated musically atmosphere. It makes you feel uncomfortable watching it and furthermore shows the seemingly endless power of Psychokinesis in its own true nature. \
In conclusion, Shinsekai Yori cannot be classified as bad since the start was very well done; but it is far from being a masterpiece and cannot fully satisfy its more critical viewers. \

    Shinsekai Yori looks like a almost perfect anime, almost. It's not a very popular choice and it's a shame, because it is an anime that a lot of people could very much enjoy.\
There is something different about this series, something mysterious that draws your attention.\
It actually stands for what it's called, it's a story from the New World.\
It's crazy how this series will treat you with new information as the time passes, this anime will slowly show you the truth behind everything, this series is based on words, every single word counts, you need to listen carefully.\
Because the New World, is a different world.\
SCORES\
STORYLINE:\
Basically you\
          \
        follow a story of a group of children. They live in a society where people can use telekinesis, they actually polish that ability in schools, that tends to be the only thing they learn at school. This society could be called an \"utopia\", perfect society with perfect families, perfect virtues and perfect decisions. \
Basically no big deal, they have some really nice lives and it's pretty good.\
They main protagonist try to deal with the psycho powers and the \"perfect\" society they live in.\
VIBE:\
Well, you get the \"mystery\" stuff very much while watching this. I like the feeling that something is on, but you are not really certain what. It's very unpredictable and you can't really come up with what will actually happen next. I like that tension, it makes you wanna know what's next, so you keep watching with interest.\
There were no jokes around, which I liked, sometimes in animes you get that really serious plot which drags you onward to watch the whole series in one day, and then it is all destroyed by a ecchi joke.\
No, youre not getting that here. Every single second of this show is grave serious, no jokes, only plot matters. And then there are emotions.\
And like the best ever character development, best freaking ever.\
Overall it's the one I like the most, serious, without any interruption of a bad joke.\
I dont mean that I hate bad jokes, I like them, I just hate them when they are in a place they were not supposed to be in.\
ART STYLE:\
Hey, it's one of the prettiest animes out there, that is what I think at least. The best thing the managed to do here, is the growth of the characters. Well you follow their lives, so you will see how their looks develop, and that was done quite accurately, I loved that myself.\
Not only that you can experience a beautiful scenery of Japan presented there, loads of forests, loads of mountains, and magnificent sunrises. \
It was one of the best visual experiences Ive ever had.\
MUSIC/VOICEACTING:\
The was no opening music, which is a shame, I tend to love these, but the music was pretty awesome! They had a repetitive motive theyve gone with (made like 5 different tracks from the same theme, just changed a bit), but it is awesome, I myself love what they had in store. A choir of children combined with drums and bells, it matched vibe quite well.\
CONCLUSION:\
In the conclusion I can say that it's a series you can really enjoy while watching it in the evening, with the lights turned off. It's an anime that lets you think about different aspects of life. And it's a anime that will surprise you, there's a lot of plot-twists there.\

    Shinsekai Yori is my favorite anime, however underrated, of the season.\
Story: 10\
The story is the deal breaker for me in this particular anime. Although the first few episodes are lighthearted, the plot soon follows the foreshadowing in the beginning and  turns dark. After the first 10 episodes, a huge plot twist happens (I did not see it coming although others may have) and I've heard that there will be more.\
At first, I was bored with the slow pacing but after four episodes, the story picked up and I was hooked.\
Art: 9\
The art has ups and downs. A few episodes were done poorly but the\
          \
        good ones (the majority) are outstanding. The style somewhat changes with the episode, which I understand because the story has a balance of dark and light moods, slice of life and suspense/action. I personally did not mind the occasional odd angle.\
My favorite part of the art is the backgrounds and landscapes, especially the surreal ones. They are amazing and utterly inspirational. The clothes and hairstyles constantly change and I applaud the studio for doing that.\
Sound: 8\
I'm not particularly picky with sound. It's good but not outstanding. Overall, the sound does a fine job of conveying the mood.\
Character: 9\
The main character Saki is not annoying. Character development exists and interactions seem real. Although the characters seem stereotypical in the beginning, the plot twists eventually break that. The main group is well designed and I was even able to remember their names by episode 5 (huge accomplishment for me and the anime).\
\
Enjoyment: 10\
I cringed, I smiled, I cried. And I loved every moment of it.\
Overall: 10\
I would rewatch. (Although we're only halfway through the series!)\

    Is the world we know as peaceful and bliss as we make it out to be? From the past, present, and undoubtedly the future the world we have known up until now is a much more complex soil then we had made it out to be while we were still in our naive youth. Our minds back then couldn't possibly or more so perhaps we try to cancel out the truth were told because we couldn't comprehend the darkness of what the world truly holds. However, once we've witnessed what the world around you truly holds, we are forced to comprehend it and begins the\
          \
        process of the change in ideals start to change in a more realist way rather then morally. As it accumulates as time passes time we have lost most of our morale and we ourselves become demons like the ones we've witness from our experiences. In the case of Shinsekai Yori, why not add psychokinetic kids in the meanwhile. Since I've wrecked the mood, let's start this review.\
Shinsekai Yori follows six kids that possess extraordinary psychokinetic powers as the premise likes to call Cantis in a utopia set 1000 years from today. They go by the names of Saki Watanabe, Maria Akizuki, Sotaru Asahina, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko amano. These kids are isolated from the rest of the world this utopia ruled by people who possess Cantis as well and they attend to their academy to train and practice their Cantis. However, these kids one day across something called a false Minoshiro. That day, they have discovered the dark history of the world they live in and experience it in the distant future.\
Story: The story itself had great potential to be one of the best anime there is with that wicked premise. It is portrayed to be seemingly original and is executed very well to bury myself deep within the soil of immersion it's world. Shinsekai yori has a heavy focus on convincing psychological point-of-views which is what us human fail to understand the circumstances of unequals like how we treat a different species and ironically, that species thinks well alike as humans as well as they do intellectually. The problems I have with the is that it has a few plot holes that need fixing like how Cantis was even possible and we received not enough info about it origin either and Death Feedback was just a warping vortex for holes.\
Characters: The characters are about the weakest part of the show next to animation which I'll get to in a sec. In all honestly, most of the characters are just plain bland and boring, but the least I can give is that the the characters close to Saki had some good subtlety to back them up I'll give them that much. Otherwise, they are just as interesting as dry wood in a deep forest. Saki was consistent as a character. Well for the plot anyways. Aside for that, she gets kind of dull after a while later. Overall, the cast are just plain mediocre.\
Sound: Since no one gives a damn about SFX, I'll just skip straight into the OST. It fit in great within it's premise, but I did find the tracks to be repetitive at times. However, it's only a little pet peeve so myself considers just a scratch from a plastic knife. Besides, it definitely wasn't even in the measurements compared to Tetsuro Araki's works who repeats the same single OST for every episode.\
Art/Animation: The art and designs are indeed creative and the background paintings look lively and fitting for the premise. However, i simply can't overlook the character design and the animation quality. every time when Saki looks at me with her eyes I get this feeling I'm being sucked in a bland orange space with a black hole in the middle. Also, there isn't any shading on the characters. What, is light flashing at them in every direction. The animation can be good at times but holy s*** I flipped many tables every time I see a catapulted CGI boulder. Nothing special about the animation, but the was decent at the least.\
Again, Shinsekai Yori had a lot of potential, but the plot holes, characters, and the animation quality seem to get in the way of that significantly by a margin, but I won't go as far to say it was mediocre and not worth the watch. In all honesty, it a pretty good watch overall. Just isn't the best thing to come out of ever. If into the whole psychokinesis premise this is probably going to some fine oolong for you if you dig into this sort of stuff.\

    STORY\
  The story is no doubt is the best part of Shin Sekai Yori, since everything is crafted so carefully. Every element is needed, and yes even the more uncomfortable and shocking ones. (Ep. 8....) The themes of Shin Sekai Yori are themes that don't really get focus in anime, or movies. Except for daring few. \"Do us as humans have the right to be the controlling on Earth?\" and the most important, \"Have we humans actually changed as a over the many years?\" These are the questions make Shin Sekai Yori the roller coaster it is. It made me think about these themes\
          \
        throughout the whole ride, and I think the story manages to open up my mind to these questions very well. But, everything isn't perfect. The anime had two time jumps that took me by surprise. There was information in that wasn't presented to the viewer, but rather told to us by Saki, and I really think that's a shame. Because once a plot twist happens and the conflict is over, they would skip over a couple years, and have Saki tell us the bits of what happens in between. But there is upsides to this. The time skips allow us as the viewer see how much the characters changed, after a few years. This is a very good tactic to make me care about the characters. It's kind of like seeing someone grow up. Seeing how certain events effected a character years later. By the end I really care for the characters, some more than others, but lets will deal with that later. I also found the pacing not for everyone. It can be very slow at times, and with the time jumps, it's pretty much all over the place. But, I strangely liked the pacing. It allowed different events in the story to flow in their own natural way. Instead of keeping one pace through out. So overall, I founded the story it told to be one of the most compelling stories I have ever seen.\
CHARACTERS\
  While I was attached to the five main characters in one way or another, it's hard to say that most of them were stand out or great characters. This is because Shin Sekai Yori takes place all in Saki's point of view. Which means, we only see what she sees. Sometimes other characters might be off doing something else, and we wouldn't be able to see them. Some of these things might be important to their development, and we miss out. With that said, the only characters that get any \"good\" development are Saki and her friend Satoru. Out of the two, Saki is the only complex one. She's a great main character. She might be a bit plain at first glance, but really she's a strong female protagonist. She's not strong in a physical sense, but in the way that her choices effect those around her and the overall story. I also have to mention the villain. He's a villain that I hate, but I can understand why he acted the way he did. He's a character that I wanted to die, but in the end, I felt sorry and sort of related to him. The characters of Shin Sekai Yori aren't  stand out by any means, but for some reason I feel attached the main cast.\
ANIMATION\
   Animated by A-1 Pictures, Shin Sekai Yori's main weakness is the animation. Don't get me wrong, it looked visually pleasing to me during many moments. But, it's really average. The character movements aren't bad, but the show tries to use as many tricks as it can. To hide the low frame amount. The lighting is not that good. The show lacks shading and and highlights, which makes things look flat. The actual art on the other hand is very nice to look at. The clothes the characters wear are mixture of Japanese with another style. The characters designs are lacking in detail, but are simple and nice to look at. Though, this doesn't excuse bad animation. If I could describe the animation in one sentence, it would be this: Average with a few sprinkles here and there.\
MUSIC\
  Composed by Shigeo Komori, From the New world's sound track is all the round pretty good. There are many tracks that stand out and fit the show. It can be unsettling, somber, and soothing. Though, I'm not too keen on how reused it gets, but this is a small complaint. Aside from the background there's no opening, but 2 endings. Which are both amazing singles on their own. In particular the first ending song warata ringo. It's a joy to listen to, and I consider it to be one of my favorite endings. Overall the music, is wonderful and truly is worth to sit and listen to.\
OVERALL\
  Really, I felt like the reason why I like this show so much is because of the connection I felt with the main character, Saki. I can see myself making the choices she made, and her journey is exceptional. Shin Sekai Yori is a unique  show that only certain people can enjoy. It's really worth watching, if you can take some of he daring themes it throws at you. It's no character piece, so it's really only for those looking for a great story.",

    Starting this series, I was pretty skeptical because it was not my usual genre and I feared that I would not enjoy it. Starting off, I was not enjoying myself. Watching the series was basically a chore that I had to finish. Hitting episode 10, I stopped watching. I did not completely remove this from my list, but I just couldn't handle it. Like how most people have heard, there are some yaoi/yuri scenes that I was not a huge fan of seeing in an anime. I'm not against that, but it was weird to watch since it's not something I'm used to. But, there\
          \
        aren't many at all and are only seen in the first half of the series.\
The series ended a few days ago. With new series coming in the spring, I wanted to clear my anime list and have it fresh with new anime. When I reached Shinsekai Yori, I decided to finish it. I am so glad that I made that decision. This anime evoked so many emotions all at once. I have not felt this way about an anime in a while, but it made me feel so good, so bad, so sad, everything throughout the series. I believe that I was not enjoying it as much as I should have because I was watching it one episode at a time and it seemed like it was going at such a slow pace. I think it was my problem that I need to marathon a series to get the whole feeling that the creators are trying to give you. Basically, this series gave me the feeling that I love after watching a great series. it does not happen all that much with a lot of anime. For me, a perfect anime is one that gives me chills down my spine, and a lovely feeling throughout my mind and body. This fits that bar perfectly. It's hard to express what I truly want to say about this, but I think that it is worth giving a chance. Don't refuse to watch it after hearing a few bad reviews, or not liking the genre. This anime can teach you so much about values, and life and will keep you on your toes the whole time you watch it.\
For those who care about this, the art style is extremely vibrant and artistic. It uses the perfect colors at perfect time to help express the emotions that one should feel during a scene, and shows the beautiful yet horrid world the anime takes place.\
The music is strong and fits just as well as the animation. There are a few base songs played throughout that bring you back to the previous episodes thus evoking emotion by creating a comparison between the two events. That may be hard to understand, but you would if you watch the series.\
The characters were all so different and inspiring. I loved the main character so much. She seemed to be a bad one at first, but as it progresses, she grows into a respectable, strong, caring person who I have fallen in love with.\
Overall, I enjoyed this series. As I've previously stated, it evoked all the emotions that I love feeling when watching an anime. It sends chills down my spines for being so perfect. I would not pass this anime up for dumb reasons. Give it a chance. Don't quit half way like I almost did, because I assure you, you may find something that you wouldn't believe to find from this anime.\

    Shinsekai Yori (translated as \"From the New World\" is a science fiction anime series that follows the lives of five children in their small Japanese village.  Sounds simple, right?\
STORY:  10/10\
Like mentioned in the premise, Shinsekai Yori is a sci-fi anime, and for good reason.  The setting of the story, while seemingly is feudal Japan, is actually 1000 years in the future.  The people of the \"new world\" have developed a psychokinetic power, called \"Cantus\", which has shaped the world in ways unimaginable.  SSY follows the five children as they attempt to piece together and uncover the horrific, dark secrets of\
          \
        their beautiful world.\
SSY's story is told in a way that never allows the viewer to ever \"relax\" in their world.  The viewer is always kept on edge because nothing is ever as it seems.  Almost every character other than five protagonists have an angle, and the characters are all monitored incredibly closely in their village.  It's the nature of their world.  The story is unique and very engaging.  I've noticed many say that nothing happens in the first three episodes.  While not much story-wise happens (it's mostly there to explain the terms of the world), each episode ends with a twist, including the first three.  In fact, of the nineteen that have aired, none have ended without something unexpected happening at the episode's conclusion.  All in all, the story captivates the viewer and keeps good pace through the series.\
ART:  10/10\
The artwork in the first five episodes is incredible.  From then on, it somewhat varies but still maintains a very high level of detail.  The art style is definitely unique but never detracts from the experience.\
SOUND:  10/10\
The music in SSY is phenomenal.  While the series takes place far into the future, the music is very reminiscent of something one would find in an anime series taking place in the past.  It fits well with the scenery and really does its job in building tension when needed.  This series features no opening sequence, but the first ending, \"Wareta Ringo\" by Risa Taneda, is one of the most beautiful and surreal songs I've ever heard (of course, the animation is also amazing).  Very high marks here.\
CHARACTER:  10/10\
SSY really shines here.  The series features two timeskips which means that we really do see the protagonists grow up and actually see the affects of the events around them on their personalities.  The series does a great job of portraying the reactions of the characters in a realistic way.  It's incredibly easy to relate to each character in one way or another, and even characters that are introduced for one or two episodes are given unique personalities.  Usually, these characters are killed off rather soon, only adding to the emotional aspect of the series.\
ENJOYMENT:  10/10\
Shinsekai Yori's story is incredibly engaging and grapples the viewer after the fourth episode.  Each week leaves you wanting more and the 22 minutes or so go by in what feels like 5.  This is a really fun series to watch.\
OVERALL 10/10:\
Shinsekai Yori is truly a unique gem.  It is a science fiction anime in that the events in the series could, concievably, happen one day.  The initial poster for this series paints a picture of a beautiful world filled with happy people.  Viewers quickly realize that this isn't the case and is very far from it.  In a sense, this is also a horror anime not only because of the brutal, scathing history of the world, but also because the beautiful world potrayed is shattered very quickly, and its true nature is revealed.  In addition to that, it explore human psychology and development and even follows the progression of other species seeking to overthrow humans as the dominant species on earth.  \
It's a gripping series that I must recommend to anyone interested.  \

    Shinsekai Yori presents us with interesting world building (as well as an interesting world in itself), a good plot, a great soundtrack and beautiful visuals. It also presents some interesting questions of morality, and even though most of those questions have already been asked in other series, it manages to present them in such a way that didn’t make them feel redundant. However, the show’s major downfall were its characters, 90% of whom were just flat out terribly written. Nonetheless, this is still one of the best anime to have come out in recent years and deserves to be watched by anyone, unless they refuse\
          \
        to watch anything even slightly challenging to the brain.\
\
PLOT/WORLD\
Both the plot and the world of Shinsekai Yori are nothing short of brilliant. The plot is set up in different arcs, with each arc moving forward the main mystery of this world and effectively building upon itself. The show keeps you guessing throughout the very end, but also presents you with enough information that you CAN keep guessing without it feeling desperate.\
Despite a pretty large amount unanswered questions and abandoned plot threads, the plot was solid. The main plot of the show is largely unpredictable, mainly because the show is really good at giving out information at the exact moment that its needed, but not a second earlier. Even though I did manage to predict one or two elements of the conclusion at the start of the show, it did manage to keep me guessing throughout the majority, which is more than I can say for other anime. The arcs in which the show was divided, however, were extremely predictable but I wasn’t too bothered by this.\
The arcs themselves varied greatly in terms of quality. Overal, they were really good. Personally, I believe the second arc (right after the introduction arc) to be the weakest. It actually put me off the series for a while. Others seemed to dislike the introduction arc the worst, which is completely understandable because it is, in comparison to the rest of the shows, very slow moving. I personally liked them, though, for their feeling of atmosphere. \
The atmosphere is probably the best thing of this entire show, as it really makes the world. It gives this universe a sense of realism, even if what they are showing to you is completely unrealistic. At the same time, though, it supplies you with just enough magical wonder that you can keep being amazed at what they are portraying. It also keeps the air of mystery high, even when there is nothing going on. \
The world, even without the atmosphere, is also very intriguing. I love the idea behind it and, without giving too much spoilers, I really like how they portrayed the leaders. Not as tyrannical bastards, as we often do in the here in the West, but as people who have done both good and bad things and have made mistakes just like us. I really appreciate this.\
Apart from the early episodes being a bit slow, the only other problem I can see people having with the plot are the time skips. The time skips really hurt the pacing of this show, as for a large amount of time, nothing happens, then suddenly, we are years later and a lot has happened off screen. But overall, I think that they were justified and not used as badly as in some other anime I’ve seen. A lot of the things that happened within the show couldn’t have happened without the characters growing older, and without the time skips, it would have had to show all the time passing. This, most likely, would have hurt the pacing even more. So, even though I do believe that they could have been handled better, I don’t mind the time skips too much.\
I’m not going to go into the questions of morality I’ve mentioned in the introduction too much, because that would mean major spoilers. I do have to say that gray morality is handled in this anime quite well, though if I really nitpick I could probably point out where they could have done it better. They also present much more philosophical questions than just ‘gray morality’, like: “What does it mean to be human?”. I found these questions to be presented in quite an intriguing way, and even though they have been asked a million times before, I never felt like they were beating a dead horse.\
All in all, both the plot and the world are solid, with the world building being one of the best I’ve seen thus far in anime.\
\
SOUND/ANIMATION\
The animations is fluid, with the backgrounds being especially beautiful. I’m not too fond of the character designs with the long limbs, but they managed to work with them quite nicely. The animation on the first ending song especially was brilliant. I also really liked the art style they used there. \
Interesting to note is that Shinsekai Yori has no openings, instead preferring to dive right into the story. I believe that this is probably the best decision they could have made, as it really adds to the feel of the episode. I’m fond of neither of the ending themes, though I do like the second one a bit better than the first. \
The background music, however, is a different story. On its own, the soundtrack isn’t that great, but coupled with the visuals, it’s amazing. It really manages to set the mood and tone to the story, as well as add a lot to the previously mentioned brilliant atmosphere. I’m really grateful for this. \
\
CHARACTERS\
Saving the worst for the last: this is where the show almost falls apart. Despite all the praise I’ve given it so far, I really cannot do anything but critique this part of the show: the characters. \
Our main character, Saki, suffers from the worst flaw that any character can have: inconsistency. \
Having an inconsistent character is the worst flaw that any story can have. Even writing a Mary Sue as your main lead is better than writing an inconsistent lead. Because when your character is inconsistent, it becomes impossible to feel for them. \
Inconsistency can stem from a lot of things, but the main one (and also the source of problem here) is excessive plot armor. Plot armor, for those who don’t know, is when a character becomes invincible purely because the plot demands it. Almost all main characters have some degree of plot armor, and this can be forgiven. After all, if your MC dies, your story is over. You need them to at least survive until the climax, and therefore, you use plot armor. \
However, you do need to work within the limits that you, as the writer, have set for your character. If your character can’t fly, you don’t make them fly because it’s the only way for them to escape your villain. If your character is loyal, you don’t make them abandon their friends the moment it becomes convenient. It’s that simple. \
Shinsekai Yori does not seem to get this simple rule. Saki is so continuously inconsistent that I honestly have no idea what her character is supposed to be. Sometimes, she is a great leader, other times, she can get no one to listen to her. Sometimes, her cantus is above average strong, other times, she can’t even get something to move the right way. Sometimes, she is smart, other times, she can’t even think up a sentence that makes sense. Sometimes, she stands for her believes, other times, she mindlessly goes along with what the others want. Sometimes, she has a strong mental stability, other times, she breaks down at nothing. The only thing even semi-consistent about her character is her infatuation with Shun, which is just pitiful.\
The only clue I have to what her character was supposed to be is what the other characters say about her. According to them, she is supposed to be smart, strong, a good leader, with a cantus that is not above average. However, I have seen her do things that directly oppose all of these traits multiple times in the anime. I have also seen her exhibiting all of these traits, but only when it suited the plot.\
Switching personality is fine if it is done in a linear way: Person A was nice at the start of the show, but when Person B died, they became very cold towards Person C, because they wanted to distance themselves. This is fine, because it shows character development. However, Saki switches back and forth with no rhyme or reason to it, basically doing whatever the story demands. \
For a character like this, that basically does whatever the plot tells her to do, development is impossible. Because she has no set character, she is exactly the same as she was at the end as the beginning of the show: nothing and everything. Sure, she is seems different than she seemed in the first episode, but I can’t tell if that is because she has truly changed, or because the plot knew that she had to look different. For all I know, she could switch back at the drop of a hat. \
When a character doesn’t develop and has no set personality, they become impossible to care for. Because of the insane amounts of plot armor, she is virtually the only character untouchable and the audience knows it. Therefore, we never feel scared when she’s in danger. In fact, if she was killed, I doubt that anyone would care beyond being shocked that they actually killed of their main character. \
In short, Saki is the worst kind of character imaginable and it really, really hurts not only the show, but also the other characters.\
The main victim of Saki’s inconsistency is Satoru, one of the other main characters. He is with Saki the most, and therefore, is the biggest victim of her failure as a character. Even though his own personality is set, it can change at random depending on whether the plot wants him to oppose Saki or not. This becomes really annoying after a while, as it feels like they are forcing him to bend in ways he never should have. Still, he is probably the best out of the main five, because he does get development, even if it is somewhat inconsistent and sporadic. \
Shun is the Gary Stu of the anime. He is perfect, or at least, that’s what they want us to believe. In reality, however, he is an asshole. Honestly, I started off liking him, but I came to hate him for being a complete jerk to everyone who isn’t Saki; and then I mean Satoru in particular. If you don’t care about spoilers for character relationships (I assume that no one does unless you’re watching a harem): Satoru totally has a very strong crush on Shun (if not something more; I would argue that his feelings are almost as strong as Safu’s), and Shun enters a relationship with him, despite not having feelings for Satoru at all. This is a dick move for a number of reasons, not in the least because you don’t toy with someone like that. Honestly, what the hell was he thinking? If you don’t like someone, don’t enter a relationship with them. Done. It makes you look like an asshole.\
This actually leads me into my next subject: the romantic subplots. Yes, there is both shounen-ai and shoujo-ai in this. Deal with it. Honestly, it’s only one episode. I have no idea why everyone is making a big deal out of that. I like none of the romantic subplots: not the straight, not the queer, none of them. They all annoy me to no end, but like I said, they are not too prominent and sort of justified by the world they live in, so I’m going to let it slide.\
In short the characters... Oh, sorry, did I forget to talk about the other two from the main five, Maria and Mamoru? Well, the show did too. Maria has slightly more character than Mamoru, but that is nothing to be proud of, considering that Mamoru could’ve easily been a side character instead of a main one. Neither of them get development, and I care for neither of them. They, like the rest of the characters, are mere pawns for the plot.\
The problem with Shinsekai Yori is that the characters don’t drive the plot, the plot drives the characters. This results in an inconsistent main character, and other characters that can range from unlikable to bland. The only exception I’m willing to give is Squeler, who was actually pretty interesting, but again, only because the plot demanded him to be. \
So yeah. The characters are terrible. Sorry for the rant I went on there, but they just grate me to no end.\
\
CONCLUSION\
Even though the characters are absolutely hideous, the show still holds up pretty good, getting a seven even after I subracted two points purely for them. Everything but them ranges from good to brilliant. Even if the plot does have some minor flaws, they are forgivable in the end. The animation is great and the music really adds to the atmosphere of the show. The world and its atmosphere are both brilliant, and totally make this anime worth watching for them alone. I say go watch it and ignore the characters, because the show really deserves to be watched.",

    Shinsekai Yori review\
Gorgeous scenery mixed with amazing soundtrack and a memorable and \
impactfull ending.\
Story 9/10\
Comparing to the other dystopia genre anime where the story is set into a cyberpunk universe Shinsekai Yori distinguishes herself by the sheer unorthodoxy of its universe .\
It is one where the modern society as we know it has not been replaced by a technologically advanced civilisation but that of a small picturesque town characterised by a community whose lifestyles have regressed into that of villagers. \
In this community the story is set and our characters from the age of 12-26 years old are exploring this dystopian world. The worbuilding of\
          \
        Shinsekai Yori is continuenly expanding and each episode provides us with fascinating concepts such as queerats, karma demons, fiends,whistle dogs, cantus and many more interesting concepts that this world delivers. \
Whats facisinating about the story is the fact that every encounter the human characters have with the new concepts from the dystopian world shinsekai yori usess at his fullest and executes it properly by criticizing how the human society we all know really works and the consequences of the action of our human characters . \
Another theme this anime abords is about human nature and how the human mind works in a crisis situation and we all know people have the concept of fear and egoism they care for their own safety first and thats what shinsekai yori message is conveyed to the viewer during each episode.\
Again what Shinsekai Yori manages to evidentiate is the fear of the unknown for the human mind and the way humans act in that situation criticizing the actions of them.\
This anime has a beautifull romance story too in my opinion too which delivered a lot of feels and tears and the ending of the anime justifies that.\
Characters 8/10\
We have two different species in this dystopian universe. One is the human characters who posses a psychokinesis ability called cantus.\
What is fascinating again is the fact that this cantus power is so well detailed and has very strict rules of using it againts other humans without suffering the consquences called feedback.This again is a allegory to the our modern world were if you commit murder you must endure the consequences of your actions.Amazing!\
The other species are the queerats who are a inferior species to the humans but have their own colonies and rights granted by the humans.Another fascinating allegory which symbolises how our human society is structured on different categories the one who have the power and the others who are under them and ruled by them with certain rules and rights. Gorgeuos.\
Squaler one of the best villain from this anime his character development is amazing and his interactions with other characters influence the whole story and their actions across the progression of the story. Also his reasons and actions have a very legit and reasonable explication.(spoiler teritory).\
Kiroumaru is the hidden gem from shinsekai yori he is the one who will help the humans and the human society to prosper further avoiding total anihilation.\
The way these two species interact is well executed by this anime in such a great manner that the queerats character development overwhelm the humans all along the series.\
The main protagonists human characters Saki and Satoru have fantastic development in the part 2 of this anime so Shinsekai Yori manages to compensate for that loss making everything equal.\
Animation 10/10 \
One of the most beautifull scenery and pictorisque peisage that will captivate the viewers mind and soul.\
Sound 10/10\
Perfect mix of the ost with the actions thoughts and interactions of the characters with the dystopian world scenery.The ending song is gorgeous too.\
Enjoyment 9/10 \
The facisnating new concepts that each episode of Shinsekai Yori brings out captivates the viewer. The message this anime sends also is so reliable to how our society works and how humans think and act when interacting with each other so it was a pleasure to watch the anime.\
Overall 9/10 \
One of the best and memorable ending an anime can provide to the viewer.Also it holds a strong message and a lot of feels for the viewer. You can learn so much from this show and you will not regret anything after watching Shinsekai Yori.",

       \"Every individual must get the equal rights, aren't they? I red it in your books, Gods. Exactly it is the main principle of democracy\"\
   I am not an anime oldfag, but anyway i watched +-100 titles. You can say, that i don't have a lot of experience to right something about this kind of titles, but i still think, that everyone has a right to express their own opinion. \
   Ok, i'll start from a little prehistory. Before I watched this anime i was placing 10 for titles, that i enoyed. It could be just an anime, where\
          \
        I found a character I like, but the title was bad or average. But after watching Shinsekai Yori I realized which titles are really the masterpieces, this title opened my eyes. Now i gonna tell you why this title is really awesome.\
Pluses:\
-Interesting storyline\
-Universe without logical holes\
-Great musical accompaniment\
-Distributed action (if you could call it like that)\
-A lot of plot twists, that'll surprise you\
Minuses:\
-Bad art, even for 2013 \
-Missed character disclosures\
-Endings are really awesome, but there are no openings. I might not call it a minus, but i will.\
-A little bit strange start. I will explain a bit later\
   Story takes place in our world, but 1000 years ago. The society renounced violence, and lives with technologies of 19-20 ceturies with inclusions of modern ones. The main distinction and reason to live this way is the force, which people got. Light falls on the 5 children, who live in this world, which contains a lot of dangers, monsters and another creatures. Contemporaneously we are getting in this world, exploring it and finding out some problems and secrets of it. \
   Right now there are a lot of animes with unusual worlds, periods and planets. Sometimes they try to hide it, and focus on the storyline. Some of it tries to show it to us, audience, but unfortunately oftenly their universes have a lot of troubles, mistakes and failings. But Shinsekai Yori author's learned on another anime fails and done a colossal job. They focused on storyline, but managed to show us the part of this universe and thought out every simple piece. It is like a glass with double bottom. You can just watch it and follow the main storyline and being blind to everything else. But when you try to get in it watching transforms to real brainstorm. You try to catch some moments and connect all found info to a one united piece.\
Along the way anime will awnser your questions and after completing this anime you also would be also satisfied like from solving a big interesting problem. \
   Also I wanna say, that musical accompaniment is really good. All 2 endings are awesome, I still continue relistening it every day. But also OST's are good. They are always getting to the point, and accompany you unobtrusively all the way.\
   I placed 10/10 to Shinsekai Yori, but it also have minuses. First and most important is art. It is bad. Really. Characters are painted too simple, sometimes it is ok, but when we see'em from range some features are getting erased and it looks kinda weird. Backrounds in action moments are awful, i can emphasize the moments in mountains in 12-14 chapter, it was drawed like in Paint. \
   And now we came to the storyline. I already said how big and interesting this universe is. But damn it, how many moments of it was missed in anime. It feels like ypu can do over 100000 more sequels and spin-off's in this universe, and each one would be unique.\
   And the last minus for today - first chapters. When i watched 1, 2, 3 chapter I said to myself: \"what the hell had i watched right now?\". As I said, all anime along you get awnsers to questions you've got, but at the start you are only getting questions, and I was a bit disappointed. \
   After watching whis anime you won't cry, wait a countinue of the story etc. You will just sit on your chair and understand that yeah, it was it. Thanks for reading, i am really glad to know it. And sorry for my language, it is my second one.",

    This is a non spoiler review, however difficult this might be to write. \
I really enjoyed watching this one. It is not an average anime, it is a great story portrayed in anime. \
The beginning is slow, bear with it. You follow the characters as they grow up and discover the world around them, question the world around them. You need to understand this world in order to fully understand later. The world is wonderfully built, the details, the seasons, the atmosphere coupled with the music, everything is amazing, however the art is not really consistent through the episodes, it's like some pieces have been\
          \
        maybe outsourced to different artists to cut costs. \
The anime is deeply psychological, you need to see it all to get the bigger picture. Mild spoiler here, couldn't help it, at the end if you understood you will be left wondering who is the villain here? There is no clear villain, the villain is me, it's you, it's humanity as a whole. This is the wonderful part of this anime, of course it's portrayed through the eyes of Saki. \
The bad parts about the story, there are about 2 big plot holes. Did not read the volumes or read the mangas so I have no idea if it's further discussed there and explained, but these plot holes are really disturbing.  One could wonder  how a director could skip such important aspects. Apart from this, the story is based on George Orwell's works so it's not that original. It is adapted to Japanese society, but based on a Orwelian Universe might I say.\
Characters are nicely depicted, they grow, they learn, some die, some don't, they develop their personalities, they question their world, they explore it sometimes putting themselves in danger for the sake of knowledge. \
This anime is rated 17+, Horror among others, there are scenes, but not your  usual anime horror , it's more on the edge not knowing what bad things will follow, especially that the world unknown to the main cast is quite a scary place. \
I would definitely recommend watching this, if you've read Orwell's works then it will be even better, like I said it is a Japanese remake/interpretation.\
You will see the world around you very different after seeing this anime, and it's not a bad thing.\

    This is my first review so I apologize if it's not up to par or runs on for too long! In addition to the anime review, I'll also be comparing the anime to the original novel.\
I was (kinda) introduced to Shinsekaiyori by my sister and the plot sounded interesting, so I decided to give the original novel a try. And I'm really glad I did, because it ended up being one of my favorite novels of all time. So naturally, I decided to give the anime a try as well, and I was not disappointed.\
The thing that impressed me the most was how loyal the\
          \
        anime was to the original novel. The anime follows the novel exactly for the most part without cutting any important scenes or characters, and also without adding any unnecessary fillers. There was only one big scene involving two of the main characters that was cut (or rather heavily abbreviated) in the anime but this did not interfere with the flow of the story in the least. The pacing of the episodes was well done and the end of each always left you eager to find out what happens next. I was also pleased with the flashbacks at the beginning of some of the early episodes showing what happened over the course of 1000 years before the story begins. \
The art is fantastic. Most of the characters and creatures appeared and sounded as I would've imagined from reading the novel. It was also a plus that some of my favorite seiyuus (Taniyama Kishou, Kaji Yuuki, Hanazawa Kana of course) were used! I guess at first I imagined the Bakenezumis to be a little \"cuter\" but I felt their design in the anime gave them more of an impact (especially Kiroumaru since I wasn't imagining him to be so tall) The scenery shots, especially the sunset shots, are breathtaking. The next time you hear Dvořák's 9th symphony, the setting sun of Kamisu 66-chou is guaranteed to come to mind.\
One factor that makes the story so great is how much it makes you think. Even though the story is obviously fiction, it does not eliminate the possibility that a similar scenario could happen in real life in the future. It makes you contemplate what measures a government might take in order to create the perfect society or \"utopia\". It makes you consider your sexuality, whether we as humans are truly no different from bonobos when we copulate for pleasure or to reduce stress. There are many philosophical themes hidden throughout the story that will keep your mind working as you learn about the dark, blood-stained history of the Shinsekaiyori world.\
The story is also filled with a large number and variety of characters, both human and non-human. Each character has their own unique personality and significant role to the overlying plot. However, you may be disappointed if you become attached to a specific character as the author has no problem killing off characters, even if they only get one episode of screen time, but this only adds to the story's suspense. As the story progresses, we watch the characters as they grow, change, and gradually move down the paths that society has laid out for them. \
Shinsekaiyori is one of the best stories I've ever read, and in turn one of the best anime I've ever watched. The art is fantastic, the voices and character designs are spot-on, and the story is so well written and thought out. Props to both the author Kishi Yuusuke and director Ishihama Masashi for bringing this brilliant work to life. A definite recommendation to any fans of the dystopian genre.\
P.S. Although I don't hate her, I do find the main character Saki to be quite annoying overall, and I think Taneda Risa did an astounding job in ensuring her annoyance in the anime as well.\

    I have decided to write a very honest review on Shinsekai yori which to be honest  I had really mixed feelings about it.\
And I am pretty sure I am going to get hate just because I stated my opinion.\
In my opinion Shinsekai yori is a fantastic series that was very very badly executed and you will get what I mean as I go more through the details.\
Story 9/10\
After a millennium , Humans believe to have found their Utopian world , built on the remains of the dark history that humans made. The Story follows Watanabe Saki and her friends who are students at Sage\
          \
        Academy which is a school that teaches students how to control their Cantus , a psychic power humans use to make their lives easier. Well but that's just  essentially the beginning  as this is a very very dark show which I won't speak of since I would like to keep it as a surprise . Problem is the transitions were really bad and there were some unnecessary moments that were nothing but a waste of time.\
\
Art 8/10\
The Art is very good and is an eye-candy to the viewer , the animation is absolutely bad , this is one of the laziest shows in the terms of animation I have ever seen , the blood split is PG-3  :/ . too much CG too that I was utterly disappointed .\
Sound 9/10\
The Soundtracks are absolutely masterful and very memorable , this is one of the finer points in the show , but the problem lies in how utterly small the used soundtracks are.\
The Voice acting is not that special but not bad at all.\
\
Characters 7/10\
Human characters are very meh , Saki is a Melodramatic character that bore the heck out of me at some point , Satoru and the tertiary characters were the characters I really cared about , The homo scenes were unnecessary , a lot of characters were unnecessary to the story , and they got a lot of screentime . \
\
Enjoyement 8/10\
It would have been a 7/10 but let me just say that the final episode was what changed my mind to an 8 , maybe because I am stupid , even though I expected the ending I was very glad that that good ending was the one that concluded the story . This show is a rare case of the ending changes everything even though I didn't believe in this case once.\
\
Overall (9 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 8) /5 = 8.2\
Ceiling 8.2 is a 9 \
so Overall it is a 9/10 (Great)\

    Any great science fiction story has to deal with the moral consequences of the society it creates. Does technology improve human lives? How should we treat those who are aliens or the next step in human evolution?\
Shinsekai yori does an excellent job of creating such a futuristic yet realistic society, and by the series' end, explores some of these questions. I highly recommend this series to anyone who doesn't mind a lot of exposition in their anime. If you find the world-building interesting, I dare you not to binge watch the final arc in a single sitting.\
Detailed scores:\
Story: 8\
In my mind, the setting is a\
          \
        sort of spiritual sequel to something like Elfen Lied. Whereas the story of Lucy and Nyuu from EL deal with the emergence of a \"superior\" species, Shinsekai yori explores the long term consequences of such events. The common trait of both anime is the development of psychokinesis, something that SSY calls \"Power\".\
If a human brain (and as a consequence human emotion and imagination) is capable of directly affecting the outside world, doesn't that throw the currently organized society out the window? No matter what the miniscule percentage of the population has this innately devastating power to take and control life with a single thought, the ensuing genocide will ensure only the \"superior\" species will be left.\
What about hundreds of years after these events? Will there be a successful society amongst these superpeople? Maybe. How will it differ from our current society? Would their methods be seen as draconian, totalitarian, or based in the flawed ideals of divine right monarchy?\
If these thoughts tickle your curiosity,  then the plot of Shinsekai Yori will provide endless brain food. Conflicts are full of improvisational thinking and use of Power, and plot-building uses enough science lingo to make unrealistic plot points believable.\
The pacing of the story is deliberately slow in the beginning. The viewer initially knows nothing, like the children of the first two arcs. As the time skips happen, the inner workings of their society are slowly unraveled.\
As said before, there is a LOT of world-building, and every time skip usually has a episode dedicated to how the relationships between characters changed over the years not presented to the viewer. This is probably the only negative aspect of the storyline, but even at that not many critical plot points are explained more than once.\
Art: 7\
When it comes to animation I have to again rely upon my comparison of this series to Elfen Lied. Fights that involve the use of Power are brief and brutally violent. The few lengthy action oriented scenes are a beautiful reward for those who can wait a few episodes of plot and foreshadowing. Things will fly, blood will flow, and the viewer is shown the strength of Power.\
The settings of SSY all fall underneath the umbrella of \"feudal Japan\", and as a result may seem redundant or repetitive at times. Distinctly futuristic backdrops are few and far between. This is where Shinsekai Yori differs from much of its sci-fi brethren.\
Regardless, the execution of the art in scenes like starry nights and climactic battles is excellent. Creative camera angles are used, but never disorient the viewer. Not to mention that the first ED video is a feast for the eyes, covering the screen with a night time fireworks show reflected in the river below.\
The distinctive \"look\" of each major character is also slightly repetitive in the beginning and there are occasional faults of hiccups in the overall execution of the animation. Different shots in the same scene may inexplicably have radically different lighting and contrast, and some plot building is done by shots of talking heads. These instances didn't really detract from any positive aspects the art had to offer, however.\
Character: 8\
I often hear that the characters of Shinsekai Yori are flat or two dimensional, and show little development over the course of the series. \
I would agree on some fronts. The heroine of the story, Saki, is in some ways just as naive at the end of the story as she was in the beginning. Even though her judgments on the world around her change, her core moral beliefs are never challenged no matter what insane things happen around her.\
Regardless, I give this aspect of SSY an 8 because the static nature of each character enhances the moral dilemmas that they face. Long term character development is sacrificed in order to escalate the core conflicts that last between each time skip in a consistent way. The static nature of each character and their flaws between time skips ensures that the reactions of each character to major events send the message that the director and writers want to send to the viewer.\
When I consider the characters in this manner, as lenses with which to magnify and dissect the moral dilemmas that are dealt by the story, I begin to think of their lack of development as a consequence of having this entire series of events over a relatively short 25 episode anime. My score is based on the idea that such a sacrifice was necessary to improve the overall quality of the anime. If you disagree, then obviously your score will differ.\
Enjoyment: 8\
Whew. What a ride. The final arc and conclusion of the series was fulfilling and tied up most loose ends. The final plot points are a surprise, and the major characters end their stories with a positive or sympathetic note. The core rhetorical questions that define a sci-fi series are explored and answered without cheapening the events of the story, something that I find even iconic anime like Akira unable to do.\
Overall: 8\
I have to place Shinsekai Yori in that rare list of anime that successfully defy genre standards. \
Most sci-fi depict the future as a dying world suffering under the advances of science and technology. Shinsekai Yori depicts it as a reborn, completely New World filled with hope. A hope that maybe the sacrifice of freedoms, memories, and sometimes lives will not be in vain. \

Shinsekai Yori - From the New World\
Story :\
 If you have a look at this anime, not too difficult for you to recognize the message hidden meaning behind the content of the work, the problem is how you feel alone. Especially in the last episode, the whole mystery are answered, I find there is too much, too much significance on consecutive strikes, that I can not help wondering, thinking about them ...\
Fantastic! That is the word I can comment on the content of this anime.\
Character : \
The character designs were done\
          \
        very well this stage, I think a bit difficult with them a bit, because what anime adaptation was not the Light Novel Novel or Visual Novel. Looking back cast, I see very clearly, and could see the look that realize part of their personality. Mamoru shyness, weakness shaped like daughter; Koufuu old bald look very rugged and somewhat insane; Shisei looks very cool, somewhat mysterious; Flood \"mouse\" U Linh Try at first glance looks pretty weird and scary ...\
Art/Animation :\
This section is a highlight of the anime. Just in Movies, 66 Kamisu town was exuding tranquility of the countryside, the rivers, the trees, but it seems murky scary - especially when combined with the soundtrack, complete with an anime can horror, mystery.\
Interestingly, the sky scene appeared in many episodes, with different markings, sometimes trying pm, purple, sometimes dark, murky, but also the clear, blue. .. depending on the context.\
Complaint with the art exchange appears 2 times throughout the film. When I'm drunk with compelling content in the ep to ep 4 5 startled me with different art from the scene, the colors, the character, feeling very uncomfortable. From ep 6 onwards everything is back to its original; Sang ep 10 changed again.\
Sound :\
Anime special, not only with OP ED, called \"Wareta Ringo\" (roughly translated: Apple corrupted) by Saki female (seiyuu Risa Taneda) shown. At first listen a bit harsh for electronic music, listen to gradually got used.\
Last ED2 until ep 17 for a new furnace, called \"Yuki ni Saku Hana\"\
I quite like this with warm bass tone through seiyuu voice Kana Hanazawa (as Maria), reminds me so much emotion\
Enjoyment :\
As a favorite anime genre horror, mystery (Horror, Mystery), so I was not too difficult to attract SSY since the first ep.\
Overall :\
SSY is an anime content or transmit to the audience the message, meaning, think it deserves an award given in 2013\

    Shinsekai Yori is probably one of the better releases the anime community has seen over the last couple of years. Initial impressions are rather timid. It reads like a checklist of mainstream-but-not-so-mainstream fare.\
Set in the future? Check.\
Humans? Check.\
Very few of the above left alive? Check.\
Implied (and later verified) apocalypse? Check.\
Superhuman powers? Check.\
Weird beings? Check.\
Surrealist art, decent music and good production? Check.\
The basic premise of the anime is actually revealed at the end of the anime. Literally at the end. The last frame reveals a message that says something along the lines of \"Imagination is power\" or \"Imagination is the source of all life\" or something\
          \
        similar; implying that thoughts are powerful. Thankfully, this does not turn out into a mushy experience. Shinsekai Yori is the story of a young girl named Saki Watanabe who grows up in a village in Japan. The story itself is presented as a reminiscence of a much older Saki as she recounts the events that unfolded as she grew up. The central plot tool here is the effects of 'Cantus', a psychic power present in all humans in the anime, and the chaos it causes despite being tightly reined in by the community. \
Very honestly put, the story is rather wayward. The central and final conflict happens to be about a species called 'queerats' trying to gain their independence from the humans. Strangely, this is something that is almost entirely left out until the last few episodes. On the other hand the story builds up a rather interesting and gripping piece about fiends and demons (humans who have lost control of their Cantus), and Cantus leakage, over the earlier episodes only to seemingly abandon the entire idea by the time the anime is half way through. It was rather grating to see things gain and lose relevancy throughout the anime. While the idea itself is novel, the fact that it was implemented badly made it look like the Shinsekais drawing the Yoris were rather halfhearted about things.\
This doesn't mean that the story is a let down. Quite to the contrary, viewers will be pleased to note that their butts are still on the seats and eyes still on the screen by the time they reach the end of episode 25. The plot(s) (plural; since it is more meaningful to consider the 'queerat' story independent of the 'Cantus' story) are well thought-out, properly paced and most of all, satisfyingly explained. As satisfyingly explained as possible in a fantasy setup that is. Thankfully, both plot lines also manage to transition seamlessly, so most people will acquire the inevitable feeling of discontent only after finishing the anime and updating their anime lists.\
The animation is something that needs to be mentioned. While it was top notch, in some places, it felt as if the cell shading (yes, nobody shades cells anymore) somehow changed hands. This was most visible in one of the earlier episodes, where the tone of the visuals changed rather noticeably. Probably budget cuts.\
Coming over to the audio and aural experience, it can be said that everything was excellent. The voice acting cast (Japanese) was spot-on and were also cast well. Hiroaki Hirata, as the queerat commander Kiromaru, deserves a special mention. Among all the characters/voice cast combinations in the anime, his was the best and suited the character to a T. The music, OP/ED and background score is a mix of things ranging from indomitable (and beautiful) Kana Hanazawa to Antonín Dvořák. There is never a dull moment in the anime thanks to all the sounds being in all the right places throughout the 25 episodes. However, a stern look could be given to the lip-synchronization.\
The characters in the anime are well done too. The anime follows the usual precedent for its genre by killing a character or two every few episodes and letting the MC cry a bit. This, of course, happens to be the protagonist's strength too. In fact, the 'strength' of the protagonist is explicitly mentioned several times but nobody will ever be certain about what it is. Top contenders include the ability to lose friends, crying and 'strength' itself.\
The biggest pitfall for Shinsekai Yori is its characters' tendency to yammer away at the most inopportune of moments. Being chased by monsters? Hey Shun, let's stop and talk a bit. Is our friend missing? I want to talk about my feelings for a moment now. Sometimes, the anime feels like Skyrim with all its lengthy dialogue in all the wrong places. It makes sense if a character is introspecting in the midst of a crisis (hello Naruto): this can be explained as time being irrelevant when presenting thoughts; but it makes absolutely no sense to see characters talking about friends when they're an inch away from death. Another thing that needs to be mentioned are the facial expressions and emotions which were mistimed in many instances. An example: Kiromaru, Saki and Satoru Asahina plan an attack in the final episode and Kiromaru leaves to execute the first part of the plan. What are Saki and Satoru up to? It is a life-or-death situation and they are both sitting down on a slab and calmly discussing things. One would expect the pacing here to be much faster with both of them getting their environment and themselves ready for their part of the plan, but no, they take this wonderful opportunity to relax and share a few feels.\
All that said, Shinsekai Yori is definitely an anime that's worth watching. It's a well-rounded meal that'll leave one feeling satisfied but missing that one small, inexplicable bit. A setup for a sequel perhaps? Only time will tell.\

    Over the last decades, anime which are set in a distant future have become one of the most attractive and original stories on the anime industry. Shinsekai Yori takes us to a not so distant future where Man has created a new order(Although the story is set on Japan). Unlike the cyberpunk genre and other futuristic anime series, in this anime we won't see technological development (with exceptions) . It is set in a rural environment, with lots of crop fields and temples.\
Japan is divided into a lot of societies where humans have developed special psychic powers called \"Cantus”, also known as telekinesis power. Theoretically\
          \
        these powers are an advantage which could be beneficial for the society but the world has changed and you can't judge a book by looking at the cover, the world hides a terrible secret.\
The country is divided into a lot of districts. Besides humans, there are a lot of colonies where live several species besides humans, highlighting Robber Fly colony , Giant Hornet colony and Goat Moth colony which will play an important and decisive role on the story. All this is because of the superiority which humans sometimes demonstrates, proclaimed them as the \"superior race\"(at least hypothetically) versus all the rest of the species. Obviously these groups are not feeling so good for this.\
Between all this organizations, in a small village of one the districts, six boys are playing on a mountainside. The development of the psychic powers started to manifest on a specific moment, everyone have its own development. When all her group of friends has entered on the school, Watanabe Saki is depressed for being the only one who doesn´t get an opportunity to prove herself. \
Finally one day, she gets it and rejoins her group of friends. The days passed normally when and strange rumor started to circulate: the legend of the impure cat which kidnaps children. This rumor is also known by the adults, who are worried for the security of their children.\
For making the things worse, the legend becomes reality and the students start to disappear. Saki and her group started to investigate what is the origin of the world where they are living and why they are experimenting so much pain. The New World has been created with the human cruelty and blood, wars and human suffering (Literally).\
In this entire secrecy atmosphere, the boys tried to continue with their lives and in a bit of time several events takes them to meet the other species who lives on the world, concretely Robber Fly colony with his leader Squealer. He is one of the most interesting (or even the most interesting) character in the story. Squealer is considered like a speaker, the voice and ruler on the colony who are disgusted with the behavior of the humans and is waging on a war versus Ground Spider colony. His role on the story is one of the most controversial themes on Shinsekai Yori, who is the villain and who is the \"hero\" on this story?\
But it isn't the only one. Also another conflict point which usually is debated in every forum is the presence and importance of the sexuality on this anime. But not only between persons of the opposite sex but also with the same sex (after watching the first five episodes more and less you will know why this is)\
With all this strong points, Shinsekai Yori isn't an anime for everyone, the darker setting along with the gore ( even macabre) and psychological themes, creates a very mature anime, very recommendable if you are not looking for the \"usual kind of anime\". None of the characters are afraid of showing how they are feeling, what are the desires and necessities and how to satiate that. For all this the characters are on the strongest point of the anime. One of the most interesting aspects of this peculiar group of friends are that each one has its own personality, since the typical comedian boy, the shy boy, the adventurous girl and the curious girl creates a great cast of characters.\
The meaning of moral and social rules is very changed of the initial conception, which develops the characters personality all over the story. Society will become darker and the social and legal laws have been taken to the extreme, having greater social controls, leading the youth to be educated in an environment of occultism and conflict with continuous skill development.\
As for the music, most of them serve too well to heighten the tension and creates a dramatic atmosphere. Though there aren't any opening themes, the ending themes Wareta Ringo and Yuki ni Saku Hana serves are very sad themes which connects too well to the horror and supernatural themes of the anime series.\
To sum up, this is one of the most interesting anime that you will find. I consider it as the best anime series of 2013 and it is so recommendable if you are looking for a less conventional story, in a world where the social rules have changed, where children can \"live on peace\"",

    Summary: atmospheric quasi-hard SF dystopia; good production values plus a mostly-sensible & fairly unique plot make for a memorable experience.\
I liked _SSY_ from the start: you are pitched into an apparently utopian futuristic-Japanese-Scandinavian rural farming village (shades of _Higurashi_!) along with young protagonist Saki & her friends, but immediately you start to suspect that a horrible truth is lurking, that this is a Brave New World designed to produce... what? What's the horrible reality? Why are her parents so worried? Children are disappearing, to what end? Casually introduced is a species of intelligent slave-rats (by what right?) Clues are regularly foreshadowed, daring the view to\
          \
        try to predict, not always successfully.\
Our main characters walk a knife edge between ignorance and incurring the ultimate sanction by prying too much, hiding from the adults even as they are unsure they have anything to fear, and in keeping with the paranoia, the atmospherics & stellar soundtrack are tuned by the director to veer from idyllic to horror within instants, until finally the truth is broken in a big data dump. The system of the world is unveiled: they are walking weapons of mass destruction which destroyed ancient civilization, and the entire system is geared toward suppressing any homicidal tendencies through brainwashing, genetic manipulation, and ruthless murder of any children who might become the slightest threat. The future plot seems clear: this is something of a \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\"-situation, and being an anime, I can easily predict what will happen next - the kind-hearted heroine will lead a rebellion against the odious (if well-intentioned) regime, topple it, and install some fairer less-filicidal system. Surprised in the data dump, they luck out when the watchdog is killed and get involved in the slave-rat politics, further demonstrating the cruelty and manipulation of their society. From then on, shit gets real: politics outside the barrier is just as brutal as life inside the barrier under the scrutiny of murderous teachers - ambushes, poison arrows, armies, deception, enslaving baby rat-slaves, nothing is off limits. After wading through a sea of blood, they think they've escaped.\
But nope! The adults were onto them all along, and the obvious is completely subverted. They return to normal life (albeit with some hilarious swings, like the episode where all of a sudden everyone is gay), and one of the protagonists suffers the long-forecast breakdown, taking out a whole village with him. Things look a bit different and the system starts to look better: what's the alternative?\
In post-dystopian societies, there's two major kinds of plot: rebellion, and attack. The latter focuses on a society that has failed to keep growing or developing, that has chosen stasis and passivity. But this is a dangerous choice, as the world may keep changing: \"He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator.\" (Consider Sowell's \"tragic vision\" vs \"utopian vision\" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions or Scott's \"survive\" vs \"thrive\" http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/ ; apocalypses and dystopias embody morality plays from the tragic/survive paradigm where people forget the crawling chaos that underlies everyday life, where they forget that civilization was forged in blood and that fundamentally _homo homini lupus est_.)\
Instead, we start to see worrying signs of progress among the rat-slaves: concrete? Brainwashing of their formerly dominant queens? Representative democracy? Yet the villages themselves seem to lack any of these: construction is fragile wood and they don't even know who rules them (the committees work in secrecy). And they are actively decaying: there are repeated mentions of electricity rationing and limits, the education of children seems to ignore any real science and technology, military considerations begin and end with psychic powers, villagers are conditioned to be fearful of the world, new mutations/animals/monsters keep springing up outside the barrier (and predictably so due to Cantus leakage) with little note taken of them inside, they have no military to speak of and indeed all their efforts are effectively bent towards crippling any ability to self-police (the world-building seems seriously flawed, since who would choose to make *every* human unable to kill another human when the whole point was to stop Fiends who apparently have no problem shaking off their conditioning‽), the arrogant eschewing any use of fortification despite the value of them against slave-rats & other mutants & the utility of fortified shelter for even psychers (safe place to attack from), and the population is apparently on the decline given the failure to repopulate the village Shun destroyed. Society had grown complacent, self-satisfied, indolent, and weak by shutting itself off from the world. The message is even less subtle in the first episode of _Attack on Titan_ where characters refer to the king ordering people not to go beyond the walls, and where salvation seems to lie in stealing the power of the outsiders who break through the walls - can there be any doubt that this is in part a criticism of Japan's years closed off from the world under the _sakoku_ policy? (At least, if it isn't, it's a bit eery how well _AoT_ works as a metaphor, and it's difficult to explain the inclusion of a character based on Akiyama Yoshifuru otherwise.)\
The stage is set for disaster. And disaster there is: a multipronged attack by subterfuge, indirect sabotage, poison, the use of new mutants and rediscovered technologies, and use of the blatant fatal flaw in the system, another human without inhibitions, a Fiend, whose origin makes a complete mockery of an earlier plot event the viewer took as a victory for the protagonists, undermining it and leaving a bitter taste.\
After this point the plot starts getting weaker. They pursue a Macguffin to defeat the Fiend, some mushy-headedness undermines it, the plot & director hint heavily at their assistant planning to betray them (which would have been a great twist: the whole Macguffin was planned by the villain to obtain an anti-psycher weapon and cement his victory) but ultimately decides against it, a clever loophole is found, they win, and the status quo is restored after most (but not all) of the slave-rats have been genocided. The protagonists then discover the slave-rats were engineered by their ancestors into slaves who could be casually slaughtered, and decide to... do nothing. We close with some further sentimentality about improving society. Somehow. What? When Satoru plays with Tainted Kittens (whose purpose we recall clearly) and Saki spares some slave-rats, it's hard not to wonder what exactly we're supposed to take away here; her apparent act of mercy for Squealer is offset by the nostalgia and suspicion she's doing it for her own sake. I found myself wondering if this was intended to be a _1984_ sort of twist, showing how the protagonists have become completely and totally coopted by the system.\
The story strives to be hard SF, with good explanations for everything (even offering a little speculation on what runs psychic powers, since clearly the user is spending nowhere near enough energy to accomplish the feats), and is so good I cannot resist taking it seriously and noticing flaws rather than simply suspending belief and turning off my brain. And the plot does has a number of issues: some Chekhov's guns are simply dropped without further comment: the leader who has lived for centuries never teaches Saki her secrets, indeed, that is never mentioned afterwards; the protagonists apparently had *another* member in their group who they've lost memories of, but this is also dropped without any additional memory; how exactly Maria and Mamoru could've had a child in the time before they are killed by the rat-slaves is not explained. Other problems include: the final gambit is mindbendingly risky (what if the Fiend had simply burned Kiroumaru alive *like almost every other victim*?), the overall structure of society makes only partial sense and is fragile to even one Fiend yet apparently everyone is holding an Idiot Ball and focuses purely on prevention and never on dealing with the inevitable Fiend; there are no reforms after the attacks exposed multiple flaws in their security; the ambivalence on Squealer (the most interesting of characters in the entire series) seems as much a product of poor writing as intended thought-provoking moral ambiguity; parts of the claimed world-building are not carried through (so, the scientists based things on bonobo troops and free love... which is why everyone is *monogamous*‽ where are the orgies and one-night stands, where are the polyamorous assortments of lovers?) or are implausible (brain surgery does not work that way, even in slave-rats-human-hybrids).\

    This is really a fantastic series and is a pretty underrated gem of the season. I gave it a 10 despite odd pacing at the start (which is why I assume most people dropped it early) after about the first 4 episodes it really takes off into a griping story of what's going on, and the MC's having to face something sinister looming in the background.\
The character development is perfect with a light romance element.\
I highly recommend this.\

    In my opinion, Shinsekai Yori is the best anime I have ever seen. I love how the series blend many different genres such as futuristic and psychological. I love how the story is fueled through many science based topics such as genetics. The characters in this show are great because most of them are relatable and even the most inhuman of characters seem human because of how psychologically driven this show is.  For example, I can relate to Saki, the main character, so well and her reactions to the events (some of them at least) would be same as mine. This is why she\
          \
        is my favorite character in the series. Because this show follows many different stages of the characters' lives, it is interesting to see how the various characters mature and change throughout the series.The story is very complex and it seem that like in the end, that every detail matters. The best part is seeing how these details will affect the story. The many themes in this story such as moral ambiguity move the story on by portraying which is morally right versus what is best for society as a whole. The best part of this series is how everyone is portrayed as totally human and are affected by human traits all throughout the series like paranoia still being present in an \"utopian\" society. I love how this series shows how false a utopian society is and how the government must hide society's problems through many evil techniques. The art style is something that I have never seen in an anime before which adds the uniqueness of this series. The ost to this series is amazing and helps build up the most important scenes in the series. Also the song \"Goin Home\" or \"Largo from Dvorak's 9th Symphony\" is one of the most symbolic pieces of music in this series (I won't say more about it though).\
Overall, this series deserves a 10/10. It is the only series up to date where I would stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning waiting for the subbed version to come out. Also the episodes went by very fast and it made 22 minutes seem a lot shorter.\

    I have heard the name of this series a lots of times.I heard it from the reviews and comments of people who liked it and from the people who disliked it.I am one of those who liked the series.\
Shinsekai yori brings to us a realistic future that is happening around one thousand years from now.Its setting is mostly happening in a small village that is excluded from the outside world.That village is the definision of the so called man-made utopia.The story follows a group of children with the power of PK(psychokinesis) who are living in that village.Ofcourse there is no such thing like a utopia\
          \
        and the children slowly discover the secrets behing the missing children,tainted cats,bakenezuims and the history of the mankind.\
The anime may look childish at the beginning but I would not recommend letting your children watch it.Trust me!!!This anime is by no means a pleasant watch.If you want a nice relaxing story that you can eat popcorn with while relaxing on your bed search somewhere else it deals with many adult themes that are very disturbing.Well I guess that there are some people that laugh at tragedies but I am not one of them.I almost forgot don’t get turned off by the yaoi and yuri scenes , there arent a lot of them and they arent on level of the legendary ,,Boku no Pico”.Even these scenes have a impact and a meaning in the story.\
The characters…There hasn’t been one anime that made me feel like this .I hate all of them.I want to butcher them all and burn their bones.But at the same time I love all of them.The main cast is composed of five characters Satoru Asahina , Mamoru Itou ,Shun Aonuma,Maria Akizuki and the lead Saki Watanabe.I love and hate all of them.There was also another character but I wont mention him here you will probably guess when you watch the anime.Each of these characters have unique personalities and all of them make realistic decision based more on their common sense and knowledge than fellings.\
When writing about the sound of the anime you would begin from the opening.Opening ,opening , opening…Was there such a thing?No I don’t think so.There was no opening. Who needs an opening when you can listen to nice music all 24 minutes of the show. I think there wasn’t a moment when I didn’t hear the background music.The BGM was amazing and I don’t say that a lot because I don’t even notice that there is such a thing as BGM in most animes.\
Art is probably the weakest point of the series,but I didn’t say anything about it being bad.The character desings were good and the background was amazing.Shortly said it did its job right.\
I didn’t enjoy this anime.Not in a single moment.There were times when I was jumping around my room imagining myself killing all the people in this anime.Especially in the end I even had dreams in which I did all sorts of censored thing to them.There is no enjoyment in this anime only suffering.Only a true M would enjoy this.\
So this is the end of the review, I said all I wanted to say now its up to you guys whatever you will watch it or not.I fell like I forgot something(Probably nothing important).\
Sorry for the gramatical mistakes in the review.English is not my mother language so bare(deal) with it.Thanks for reading.",

    \"We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.\" — Shun Aonuma\
\
Eve of 30th September 2012, It had been roughly three years since I started watching anime. I was sitting on facebook, trying to scroll my boredom away. The past two seasons of anime haven't brought a single good show and my enthusiasm for anime had hit rock-bottom, more like for modern anime. Suddenly I received a message from a familiar name who I haven't talked to much recently, the basic contents of message just said - \"Shin Sekai Yori - anime - must watch - first episode out\". That recommendation, on that fateful day ended\
          \
        up restoring my faith.\
\
\"Sometimes, the truth is the cruelest thing of all.\" — Maria Akizuki\
As if being true to the quote, SSY doesn't shies away from letting it's viewer know that things are going to get ugly from the get go, as one begins to question \"the truth\" behind the utopia. In fact when the chips does go down and struggle begins - It feels \"organic\" and nothing alike a forced development. It really had been a long time since an anime had engaged and intimidated me and with later episodes, I also begin to understand why it got categorized under science fiction, which is hard to explain here without giving out spoilers, though one might argue that it has both pseudo-science and scientific elements entangled with one-another. What fascinated me more, is the mix of spirituality and science in a few scenes, the age-old question(s) and the controversy that comes along with it.\
\
Typically, SSY is a show of \"details\", if you don't pay attention you'll be left behind along it's uneven pace and at times, non-chronological execution. There are a lot of elements, quotes and events that mimics and symbolizes our current society and the ideologies behind it very well [the quote I wrote in the beginning on this review, yes the one which you may have already dismissed as a cheesy line - keep it in mind while watching and you may see]. I've been told many times -\"Hey! it's just an anime...don't think too much\", I'd say it's precisely the result of this type of thought process which doesn't let people to really appreciate and explore a genuinely good series and to judge for what it really is. Instead more and more dumb, wish-fulfilling, moe and cliche' shows hogs up the limelight, even get revered as \"smart\", \"intelligent\" and \"best\" by the masses. That's also why most makers take their audience for a fool and we get less good shows.\
\
Another thing to praise here is the music, that resonates within you from the inception. A beautiful, traditional, innovative and befitting set of scores brings out the best in the story. Listening to \"Going Home\" still creeps me out. The ED sung by Taneda Risa - Wareta Ringo [http://goo.gl/bRZArn] is another likable addition, both for anime and my playlist. Also, since I've come to develop a taste for classical music during \"Nodame Cantabile\", in Shin Sekai too I can't help but appreciate the symphony by Antonín Dvořák (From the New World) - [http://goo.gl/nfa5xz]. The VA's have also performed very well. In fact, it becomes an important part of the narrative by the end of first episode, if you can catch the \"hint\" fast enough.\
\
How can one forget to mention the unique art style of SSY! Not only is it hauntingly charming but the character designs also carry a freshness to them, which is a much required relief from the recent moe-fication of anime industry and ultimately becomes a driving force for the story. One can clearly notice the \"jumps\" and inconsistency in art, as the result of multiple directors directing different episodes in their own style, not just in art but in story too. Where as it might be frowned upon as \"link-breaking\", it doesn't defy the logic of SSY and is more aligned with the narrative, so it might not necessarily a bad thing. Also, one of the episode directors, Yamauchi Shigeyasu, whose direction I come to like after watching \"Casshern Sins\" (which I strongly recommend) brings his unique style to SSY's particular episodes and raises the bar of aesthetic perception.\
\
It's really sad that I can't be much descriptive about the storyline itself since I'm trying my best to avoid giving out possible spoilers and ruining it for you. But as far as character development is concerned, I'm more than happy that this coming-of-age anime remains truthful and realistic towards the events/confabs/relations, that shapes up the thought process of our characters much like how a real person may react. Personality development comes out as natural and \"i-don't-know-who-the-fuck-is-he/she\" moment never comes, character remains [comfortable] in their skins throughout.\
\
In short SSY is a dark tale of \"humanity\", twisted moralities, conflicting philosophies, friendship, love, lies, betrayal and of survival. It, however contains some controversial scenes and themes, which although doesn't effect the overall anime, might put off a few people, I advice them to be wise and try to see the broader picture here. The moment I had finished watching first episode of SSY, even the pessimistic and skeptical side of me admitted that this one has promise. And after finishing the last episode I felt sad, I had found a good series that I followed weekly and now it had ended. SSY, in all it's entirety, is a very good series and for me - the best anime of 2012.\

    In depth review #1 - Shinsekai Yori - From the new World (No spoilers)\
Plot/Story:\
Shinsekai Yori follows the perspectives of 5 young children (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun) in a dystopian society set a millennia in the future. The main character, Saki, starts the story off by acquiring her powers at the age of 12. The power i am referring to is psychokinesis PK or just telekinesis. Saki then joins up with the 4 other characters in the main class where they develop their powers. While here, saki and her friends stumble upon forbidden knowledge of the past they shouldn't of had. The now have\
          \
        to deal with the stress of knowing the truth and the consequences their society has in store for them from knowing.\
Genre: \
Shinsekai Yori is a supernatural dystopian thriller anime. It may seem like this anime is a little too ambitious with it use of genres but the creator blended them together perfectly with his comprehensive plot.The supernatural elements in this anime comes from the mystical creatures that dwell in this universe and from how certain humans acquire the ability of PK (psychokinesis) when they are young. The dystopian element of this anime is the main focus throughout the show. The society that was created in this show is a bleak, strict and cautious one but there is a reason for it. Whether or not the actions that where carried out in this society is justified is debatable, which is theme tackled by many other animes in this genre. Something that was done differently in the anime however was viewing this dystopia from a child point of view. The thriller aspect of the show comes from how each episode leaves you on a cliffhanger. Shinsekai Yori captures the moment of suspense through each cliffhanger perfect and i would say is the show better attributes. Also the events that occur involving the 5 main characters leaves you worrying about their well being in this society most of the time.\
Maturity Level: \
If you are planning on watching this anime and want to truly enjoy it you are going the have to be somewhat mature. This is because this anime expresses many mature and dark themes throughout it such as loss, sacrifice and death that will make you think about how it corresponds to our reality. It may seem simple but it requires some form of critical thinking skills to understand the severity of the actions that happens in this dystopia. I wouldn't recommend to kids. Also for some reason, many people believe this anime to be confusing. Honestly it really isn't. All you need to do is pay attention to blatant foreshadowing and to the dialogue and you are good. There are some episodes that will purposely try to confuse you though, which i thought was a cool mechanism, so don't get discouraged if you don't know everything off the back. Everything is perfectly explained as the anime progresses if you didn't understand it already.\
As for gore and blood and sex there is a couple of instances that are worth pointing out. For blood and gore, there are scenes where people experience gruesome and bloody deaths. Don't worry though, this isn't the focus of the show. These scenes are mainly used to signify dominance and power and nothing more. As for sex, there isn't any nudity but there is a couple of kissing sequences that made the show a bit controversial. There is a gay kissing scene in episode 8 and people thought that this was enough to drop the show. I ensure you this is not a yaoi or anything close to one. It was just one scene that portrayed a theme used to described their dystopian society in an earlier episode. This is why you need to be somewhat mature and not be so simple minded when it comes to this anime.\
Characters:\
The story focuses around 5 characters  (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun). They are all friends in the same PK class who were paired together in group 1. The story tells the story behind each characters memorable moments with each other and how they react with the realization about their existence in this world. At first they are just regular kids but when they all find out about what happens in the past, they each develop differently corresponding to the level of shock they endured from the news. Most of what happens to their development would spoil somethings so ill just leave this segment at this point.\
Animation/Production Value:\
I personal loved the animation but ill try to be as unbiased as possible in this segment. The animation team was very ambitious during their time animating this series. They hired a couple of different people to make certain episodes throughout the show. Usually there is just one animation team in animes so there were a couple notable consistency issue throughout the show. The most memorable change being on episode five where the quality in the animation takes a nosedive. It stays like this so a couple of episode which turned a couple of people off from the show sudden change in animation. The first four episodes however are visual stunning and catches back up later.  As for use of color, this anime can look like a radiant painting in one scene and a gloomy mystical realm in others. There color pallet is wide and is illuminated in almost of there dramatic scenes. They also managed to light darker lit spaces like caves and nights well, something other animes struggle with sometimes.\
Sound /Production Value:\
As for the sound, i believed it to have a very high production value. The sounds and tunes that played in the background of the show were subtle but noticeable enough to be memorable. They also complemented the tone of the animation very well while the creator was stressing a specific mood. Transitioning to the OST, i believed it to be one of the better ones i heard in a while. I usually don't bother listening to the OST in anime but i just had to for Shinsekai Yori. I have around 7 songs that i am in love with, including the ending theme song. Overall, the sound production gives off a feudal Japanese area vibe that is filled with mysticism. I though it fit well with the series.\
Opening/Ending:\
Something that i thought was really unique in this anime was that it didn't have an opening theme. While watching the show - I didn't feel as if i was missing something without it. While analyzing the series after watching it, i would say it was better off without one since it wasn't needed. It reminds me of the anime Mushishi where a flashy 1:30 opening would alter the pacing and the aura given of from the show. As stated earlier, Shinsekai Yori did have an ending theme which was extremely catchy. When i first heard it i though i was lagging but after i realized that it was part of the song it grew on me. It had a certain refreshing atmosphere to it that made me listen to it every time it came on. I usually skip past ending themes but not through this one.\
Final Thoughts: I would say that is anime was amazing. I heard about it from a video titled \"unrated anime in 2013\" a couple of days ago and it definitely is a hidden gem. The style of the anime and the most unique plot i heard in a while left me speechless while watching it. This is especially true for when everything i was thinking about unravels and comes to fruition.   8.4/10 \

    This anime is, simply put, FANTASTIC. Definitely one of my all-time favorites, easily. The story, while slow, is intriguing and gripping, the world- my god, the WORLD- is deep, mysterious, beautiful, bright, and dark all at once, and I think the selling point of the series. The characters are very likable, and you truly care and are shocked when one of them dies. Like George Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, characters are devoid of plot armor, which truly gives it a more gripping progression as you realize that your favorite character may not last until the end! \
The entire progression of the anime,\
          \
        rather than the development of a story, is the slow revelation of the nature of the world the characters live in. There are battles, there are mysteries, there are conflicts, but all of these, rather than focal points, are vehicles through which the characters discover more about the history that led them to where they are now. And yet despite this, the obstacles really do matter, and when peoples' lives are on the line, you truly do feel the fear and anticipation involved.\
The designs are utterly breathtaking when you take the time to appreciate them. From the characters' clothes to the creatures and monsters, you realize that, to make this anime, the designers completely threw real world designs out the window, and created things from the ground up. The innovation and creativity they showed, just with the protagonists' clothes, is wonderful.\
The characters themselves are very real, even despite the surreal world they happen to live in. Their interactions are interesting, and their journey is engaging. The only part of their interactions one might not enjoy is their very sexually free views. As such, we see some yaoi and yuri that some viewers may not be comfortable with.\
The magic, while a central aspect of the world, is not the focus of the story, just another facet. The fine details of it are difficult to pin down, and it maintains a sense of mystery even at the end. The characters appear to have near limitless power, and yet manage to fit into a world without seeming overpowered thanks to the lack of focus on this aspect. \
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and highly recommend it to viewers over the age of 18, as the subtleties of the show may be lost of younger viewers. If you love shounen manga, and can't enjoy an anime without battles, then this one isn't for you, but to everyone else I say watch it! You will thank me!\

    I watched this anime a while back, and I decided to watch it again for mainly two reason. The two reasons being:\
1) The story was very enjoyable\
2) The anime was very thought-provoking\
The story was like no other. The whole anime was a mystery and the suspense built up until there was a big turn of events in the last few couple of episodes. This wasn't like most anime where the main character knows about the information, and it is being kept hidden from us. No, in fact, nobody knew what was going on. I felt like I was part of the anime, trying to solve\
          \
        the mystery. I got easily absorbed into the anime, and I'm glad I did. The first part of the story can be slow, but I think it will be worth it.\
In the anime, you do not know what could happen. Things do not turn out the way you think it would. The unpredictable nature of the anime makes it one of the best anime ever. Naturally, a mystery anime should not be predictable. But the rationale behind the secrecy is very clear at the end, and it sends shivers down your spine.\
The anime also takes you on an emotional roller coaster, from sorrowful feeling, to thrilling emotions, to moments of perplex. However, all of your emotion gets wrapped up in a turmoil during the final scene. All the memory hits you like a truck and it leaves you with an uneasy feeling. But this is a good thing. In fact, this is one of the main reasons why I KNEW, this anime was great.\
However like all anime, this anime isn't for everyone. This includes people who do not like thinking too much, and would rather enjoy a fast paced anime where fight scenes happen every other minute. In this anime, each action has a deep meaning, and will be linked to someone later on in the anime. There are also parts where the dialogue is quite heavy, so you might get a little impatient. But for me, I loved the dialogues, and it kept me on my toes.\
This anime did not get the attention it deserved, and I think the icon, or the main image, is to blame. But after watching it, the image looks completely different. I get this tingling sensation from looking at the image, and makes me think about the anime.\
I can not recommend this anime enough.\
This anime deserves a chance.\

    This is the best anime I have ever watched, not even, best television I've ever seen. I've never written an anime review before, but this anime DESERVES it. This is the only anime series I have rewatched 4 times and it is phenomenal every single time. This type of anime leaves you empty once you are done with it. It is melancholic, yet beautiful. It is also dark, but hopeful. There are enough plot twists that keep you enticed and the pacing is perfect. There are like 2 \"filler\" episodes that barely move the plot, but they add so much to the depth and character\

    Just finished this anime and i think it is very good. Be wary of spoilers.\
The animation (specially in the initial episodes and the last one) is great and the CG's are well-placed so they don't look intrusive at all in my opinion.\
The story; as everyone already praised in the reviews is really a very good change to the dystopia scenario. There's this element in the anime that i wanna talk about wich is subliminarity, you can feel that every character line isn't there just to fit a script, almost every piece of information dialogues have gives you a hint about somthing and as i said,\
          \
        isn't there for just no reason. You can notice hidden intentions and awkwardness in conversations.\
Many times the Bakenezumi are shown as creatures very similar to humans, and the whole revolution thing seems a lot like what non-PK humans would if they were in that actual situation, but it's a slow burn, the anime never say yes nor no to you and that pacing is awesome. I'm not going to talk about the fictional universe because there's already very good reviews about that.\
What i really want you guys to do is watch this anime with a good stereo headset so you can notice how much awesome the sound editing is. In the animation, you can already see that most scenes has depth and looks somehow 3d and i must say it is not different with the audio. The episode of the camping opened my eyes to this and i could not stop paying attention on the ambient effect sounds and background musics even when at very low volume. This combined with the art quality in general provided with a great immersion.\
Most characters have a \"cute\" design and them being and acting in a world that you know is dark but also seem very beautiful creates a macabre atmosphere in many scenes.\
This anime is worth your time, go ahead and watch it.\

    I see this anime recommended on many websites at many times and I thought that I'd would find at least someone writing a review here sharing my consensus regarding it but barely 2% of the reviewers have given this anime an overall score of 8 or less.\
After episode 3, 4 or 5 the overall quality drops and they all start to look similar to that one episode from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann that had the director fired after very famous quotes was spoken about it; but the problem being with this show is that the quality is consistently bad up until episode 7 at least.\
The\
          \
        story was promising and could have become a great show but the lack of direction from the drawers and animators made it look really bad. Because of the cheesy dialogue and the poorly animated characters, it wasn't enjoyable after its first pilot episodes. I'd call this a too-much-try-hard.\
Jump straight into an episode between 3-6 then start from the beginning, then go and enjoy another show that doesn't try to force a sex scene while being captured by enemies and then have the blue balled character turn homosexual three episodes later. Probably cowritten from all the fanfiction that made 50 shades of grey.\

A quick glance wouldn't suffice to show how much of a gem Shinsekai Yori was as an anime. It revealed the raw traits of human in an amazing tale of dystopian fiction.\
The story was narrated as something mature and slow. In fact, it's a progressive story starting from childhood all the way towards adulthood where the pace will pick up. A degraded world set not in a futuristic setting but more akin to that of villages was an aspect I loved. Their society hold interesting concepts such as psychokinesis powers, and the characters within journeyed\
          \
        upon their world to recreate their own understanding of human nature from love and kindness to fear, manipulation and violence. What they know may not be the real truth and as they find out more about what we as humans do, the plot becomes more involved. The world we are in bridged a connection to their world as we see these aspects in real life. And it's through the thoughts, dialogues and decisions of the characters that we questioned about society. This did obstruct some clear explanations because of how complex the themes were but for the most parts, the execution was successful. Every characters had a real personality that complemented well with each other, along with great developments as they faced challenges. Many elements presented were mysterious and engaging to the mind. I also had to point out at the efforts put in to create convincing scientific explanations to help give realism to the transformed world.\
While the story helped set the core down for the dystopian setting, it's the dark and shadowy art that laid the mood out. The fantasy world were full of beautiful and intriguing sceneries that showed the changed world in nature. All the fauna and flora scattering the lands had unique designs that resembled that to our world's. Something which kind of took away the emotions were how bland the character expressions can get. Animations at times fluctuated, to the point of being jerky and dull. The soundtracks were average but it matched the slower-paced mood of the anime. Silence was used quite often to depict how empty the world became. A positive thing was the good voice-acting that filled in the missing emotions voided by the character expressions. With all these in mind, it can also be said that stronger efforts went towards the action scenes where the animation, expressions and soundtracks were of higher quality. They had me at the edge of my seat just because of how much tension and suspense were generated throughout those scenes.\
Shinsekai Yori left me thinking about mankind as a whole at every episode. What do each of us have that shaped how our society grew and divide? Due to the solid writing that discussed the themes of human nature, we are given an excellent array of ideologies to ponder about. Exploring and discovering the remnants left behind by the broken world alongside the characters was a fascinating and rewarding experience.\

    Shinsekai Yori is an incredible work of art that will leave you considering the role humanity has in the natural world along with our despicable history of discrimination, slavery and genocide. In an anime filled with time leaps, you're given the full scope of a generation's view in the so called \"utopian\" society developed in the 1000 years after modern civilization ended. While this anime will strike you as strange and unique over the first few episodes, it becomes endearing and unmistakable as the series goes on. While the show does suffer from a few unanswered questions, it will keep you flipping through the episodes\
          \
        until you're left with a hole in your chest at the end.\
{Story - 10/10} - Easily Shinsekai Yori's strength. This anime's storyline and the themes packed into it over 25 episodes is outstanding and will leave you craving for more every time the credits roll. While the world we're introduced to is strange and the storytelling seems disjointed - everything becomes clear as the story progresses and plot-twists will keep your mouth on the floor until the very end. \
{Art - 8/10} - The art in Shinsekai Yori is solid. It isn't a masterpiece but the viewer connects with characters and the story - it fits perfectly. Some of the color schemes evoked specifically in relation to the so-called \"fiends\" and \"karma demons\" were spectacular.\
{Sound - 7/10} - The music and sound fit the story and nothing felt out of place. With that said, in comparison to how wonderful the story and characters were, the music and sound merely fell into the background and at no point was it awe-inspiring. \
{Character - 10/10} - Shinsekai Yori's story was only immaculate due to the excellent character development throughout the story. The relationships in the story attach your heart-strings to characters and more than once those heart-strings will be shattered. While there was controversy surrounding some of the relationships as being \"unnatural\" due to the LGBT nature - it more than fit the concept of the story and never felt out of place due to the way the story was told.\
{Enjoyment} - Shinsekai Yori was one of the few animes over the last few months that has kept me binge watching despite the need to study for exams and work. In fact, I had to write this review immediately after finishing it, despite having a 100% final tomorrow afternoon I should be preparing. This anime is enjoyable for anyone, but it is a must watch for anyone who wishes to connect with an anime on a deeper level and consider philosophical questions about humanity.\
{Overall} - Overall I gave Shinsekai Yori a 9/10. The sound and art were less than masterful, but the story and characters kept me coming back endlessly. \

    Shinsekai Yori can resemble the stories we used to tell each other around campfires or sleepovers, mystery, horror and suspense around a group of psychic kids in a specialized school and as the days pass they realize that more things lurk in their school and their lives, learning the past can not always be a good thing. \
Story 8/10\
the first 5-6 episodes can be boring, but they are a poor indicator of what's to come, one problem doe is the tendency to get distracted, from one entire episode of psychic football just to make a small point at the end, to chunks of kid's drama\
          \
        to monster fights to adult drama and the homosexual/Bisexual scenes witch are strange and sometimes there is so much information that you need to re-watch the scene so you can grasp everything that was said.\
And to end, the story has one of the greatest and evil villains but that's for you to judge because despite his horrible actions he may had taught it was the right thing to do but hey doesn't every villain think that. ;) \
Art 6/10\
The characters have almost no shades or textures they look like stickers over a background like they were made on paint, the world on the other hand is kind good especially at night with the lighting and shadows, the fight scenes look average with some low quality CG.\
Sound 7/10\
Sound quality was good with unsettling music, noises and sounds adding the right mood to the atmosphere, in ep 5 and 10 there was a noticeable lack of sound effects in specific places, no amazing or memorable song but overall a good ost for this for this anime.\
Enjoyment/Overall 8/10\
A must watch for mystery and campfire horror fans. If you don't like slow-paced with an oppressive atmosphere, this won’t be for you but if you enjoy a slow-paced mystery, Shinsekai Yori delivers it. As for me i started thinking i was going to drop it but ended up watching it all and found it enjoyable, i will re-watch it one day that's for sure.\

    It's honestly sad that this series sold like garbage in Japan when this series is clearly better than a bunch of magical high school harem ecchi garbage that we get nowadays. Out of all the A-1 Pictures anime shows I have watched, Shinsekai Yori is definitely one of, if not, their best series that they have ever made. \
\
[Story]: (9.5/10)\
The story is set in Japan a millennium from now. Five children—the protagonist Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru, and Shun—have been born and raised in a tranquil town that can be described as a utopia, overflowing with water and green foliage. After a certain incident, Saki and\
          \
        the others come to realize the true nature of their world. The five throw themselves into life-threatening adventure and fighting to protect friends and a world on the brink of collapse.\
Judging from the cover, I though this show was going to be your typical middle school/high school kids with superpowers set in a utopian world. That's one of the reasons why I decided to ignore this show for a while. I was like \"There's no way in hell I'm going to sit through 25 episodes if the show is going to be what I think it's going to be\". Later, I decided to finally watch the show and the first few episodes didn't do the show any justice. It was boring and I thought of dropping this show a couple times but I forced myself to watch the rest. After about Episode 4, I started to realize that this show was not what I thought it was....\
I just want to say that the show did an amazing job on world building. I think it was on Episode 4 where they explained everything about the world that they're living in. The history about said world, the present, everything. Yet, when they explained \"everything\", you know that not every question was answered. You can tell the adults were hiding something and those are one of the many questions that started popping up in the first half. The first half was pretty much just an introduction to the world and society that they're living in, their abilities, and etc. All in all, nothing much happened in the first half and the second half is where the show truly shined. \
Every single question that I had in the first half like how their powers truly works, why some kids in the village are just mysteriously disappearing, the history of the world that they live in and of course, those goddamn \"Queerats\" were all answered in the second half. When these questions were answered, I was satisfied. They made perfect sense and it didn't feel like the answers were pulled right out of their ass. Like that question \"Why some kids are mysteriously disappearing\"?. When the show answered that question, it just goes to show how paranoid the people on the top are but it does make sense on why they do it. It all depends on the person's morality and how far they're willing to go to keep the world safe and make sure \"it\" doesn't happen again. This also ties in with the history of this world and what caused the demise of the world that came before theirs. If you did watch the show then you know that there is another side to this argument and explains that their approach on this situation is all wrong. Again, this all depends from person to person and that's what I loved about that show. It explore's the person's moralities. \
Speaking of moralities, another thing that I loved about this show is there is clearly no good or evil in this show. It will all come down to the person's definition of good and evil and how they see both sides. For example, the \"Queerats\". Basically, they're like our \"Dogs\" in this world expect they literally act like human beings and they are as smart as us.  The only difference is the way they look. They don't have the psychic powers that the humans have but they do have weapons likes Swords, Bows, and Spears. The Queerats serves as slaves or workers under the humans and their lifestyles are quite similar to a homeless person. There are Queerats that don't like to serve under humans while some do. Would you consider them as \"evil\" creatures after what they've done to the village and the people? I mean, I wasn't surprised they did what they did because I understand what they've been through. The humans are aren't any better too because they have done some disturbing shit behind the scenes like those \"mysterious disappearances\".\
The anime is separated into three arcs and it's super obvious when an arc begins or ends. Every-time an arc ends, there's a huge time-skip and you'll see the characters have aged. Arc 1 features the characters as little kids. Arc 2 features the characters as teenagers where they begin to see the reality of the world that they live in and Arc 3 features the characters as adults where they learned a lot of dark secrets about their society and its people. In my opinion, Arc 1 was the most boring arc of them all. It felt like a slice-of-life series and I did say that there were a couple of times where I thought of dropping this show. Arc 2 is where I began to get interested in this show after it proved me wrong on this series being a typical high school students with superpower and Arc 3 was clearly the best arc of them all because the story got even better than the 2nd arc and there's more intense action in the 3rd arc.\
______________________________________________________________\
[Art/Animation]: (5/10)\
As someone who likes great visuals in their animated shows, Shinsekai Yori's visual was a complete turn off for me. Most of A-1 Picture's work always looked bland to me but for this show, they took it to a whole another level. The character design looks very boring and the visuals overall is just very unappealing. It's like I was watching a 1990's anime or something. The animation is very decent, at best and very mediocre, at worst. 50% of the time, the animation is inconsistent and it seemed to me that they couldn't keep up the quality for 25 episodes straight. The action scenes were also......meh..\
______________________________________________________________\
[Sound]: (8.5/10)\
Shinsekai Yori doesn't really have a lot of notable soundtracks because half of the time, the show was just the characters talking and doing whatever with no soundtrack playing in the background. The OP OST does sound nice and it somewhat made me feel like I was watching an American TV show because there's no OP. \
The show only played one OP theme song and that's the official 2nd ED. Although, I don't really count it as an OP theme song..more like an insert song played at the beginning. \
The ED theme songs are \"Wareta Ringo\" by Saki Watanabe (Risa Taneda) and \"Yuki ni Saku Hana\" by Maria Akizuki (Kana Hanazawa). I actually liked the 1st ED theme song more than the 2nd ED theme song. I love how the song sounds so simple with only the guitar playing in the background and right when the chorus hits, the percussion suddenly jumps in and makes the song sound more epic. For the 2nd ED, as much as I like Kana Hanazawa's voice, her song here just didn’t do it for me. 1st ED is just better overall. \
______________________________________________________________\
[Characters]: (9/10)\
I love how the characters in this series are represented. At first, you thought they (the humans) were the ultimate good guys who clearly did nothing wrong and are just protecting themselves but later on in the series, you start to question their own actions and whether or not they're in the right or in the wrong. At times, you want to side with the queerats because they're the ones being enslaved by the humans in that world. Of course, they had their reasons for doing such actions but are their actions really justified? Hell, I’m even going to say that “Squealer did nothing wrong!” and “Quuerat Lives Matter”. Like I said above, this all depends on your morality and that's one of the things that I loved about the series. \
I'm surprised at how likable the main characters are, especially Saki who is a very competent person and can handle difficult situations without breaking down easily. Of course, just like every other human being, she is susceptible to breaking down because in her mind, she's panicking but she's able to keep a cool head, assess the situation and make sure she solves said situations. I love her because of that and I'd like to see more anime that features a character like Saki.  \
As good as the main characters are, they are without flaws. Besides Saki and Squealer, who received the most character development out of everyone and they are pretty much the only three dimensional characters in the series, the rest of the main characters were either two-dimensional (not a bad thing, actually) or received little character development. For instance, Mamoru along with Maria was pretty much ignored in the 2nd half of the series. It does have its reasons though so it’s not something that I can rant on because it connects with the plot. Did I also mention that this series is more plot-driven rather than character-driven? That’s why I'm letting those flaws go. \
Another minor thing that I didn't like was how almost everyone in their teenage years suddenly turned gay and almost every teenager was hooking up with the same sex. This is also the same case for the main characters. For example, after the 1st arc ended and a timeskip, we see Saki and Maria holding hands/kissing and they're now a couple. Look, I'm not a homophobic but I just find it unbelievable that almost everyone in the school were suddenly a bunch of homosexuals. The abrupt transition to the 2nd arc and the fact that there was no hints to suggest that they’re gay were also huge factors. I did say this issue was a minor issue for me right? It goes to show that this anime is not afraid to show things like this and how far the society has gone, to the point where gay people are considered a norm in the society. \
______________________________________________________________\
[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\
I came into this show with very low expectations. Reasons for that is because the cover didn't quite appeal to me and the synopsis sounded like some sort of generic high school teenagers with superpowers. I gave this show a try and it really surprised me. I didn't expect Shinsekai Yori to be this dark and though-provoking. \
______________________________________________________________\
[VERDICT]\
\"Shinsekai Yori\" is a captivating series with a dark and deep story that's very well written. The world-building is amazing and while the show might have a slow pacing at the start, it starts to pick up its pace at the late 1st half - 2nd half. Don't be thrown off and suddenly drop the series just because of the first four episodes. The series is also thought-provoking and makes us question our own moralities because believe it or not, we act like these guys but we just don't notice it that much. This is one of the best A-1 Pictures show to date and this show is highly recommended\
[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\
\
Pros:\
+A Great, Dark and Deep Storyline\
+Amazing World-Building\
+Impressive 2nd Half\
+Amazing job on the exploration and representation of a person's morality. It also makes us question our own moralities\
+Great characters with an amazing and strong, competent female MC\
Cons:\
-Pacing issues, mostly in the first half of the series, especially the first 4 episodes\
-Terrible Visuals and Animation",

This is one of those odd ball anime that you rarely find. Never have I seen a more complete story in only 25 episodes. I am going to try and be vague and brief as possible to not spoil it. \
To describe the anime's setting. It is kinda Orwellian with a little Bradbury. Where every one is a physic and they work together, but you know it isn't a perfect utopia. You know something is off. \
I would say it is a mystery mixed with adventure. \
Music is fantastic. Gives me shivers,\
          \
        but there is no opening theme, which is strange for a anime. \
Characters are not some over powered edge lord, even though they have \"powers\" they are still human, and weak. They can't scale 5 story tall monsters with their Katana. They have to deal with problems in a logical way, which is something that I love.\

This anime is a instant classic. A must watch, You can read this review, but it only takes time away from watching it.\

Shinsekai Yori or From the New World. Where do I begin? \
Story - 10\
The story, set roughly 1000 years in the future, is about Saki Watanabe. A young girl with Cantus ( psychokinesis ). Once she gains her power she attends Zenjin Academy with her five friends: Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma and Reiko Amano.\
Saki believes her village to be an idyllic place but she soons start searching for the truth when Reiko goes missing. She is then thrown into the deep truths of the\
          \
        history of her village and discovers not all is what it seems. \
This is an original plot I have not yet seen before in any other anime. It shows a good balance between light and dark, good and bad, learning to make sacrifices and overall growing up in a world where not all is what you thought. Overall, the story was fresh, original and kept me wanting more every episode.\
Art - 10 \
The art in this is beautiful. Ranging from the characters to the scenery, everything was beautiful. \
However, I believe this to be even more so when I see the affects on the anime as a whole. The art, so beautiful and light, contrasted with the story being dark and mysterious makes for an awesome balance you don't see everyday. \
The art was simple in some areas while in others it was bizarre. It made every episode interesting as you got to see new areas of the world Saki lived in. \
Sound - 10\
The sound was gorgeous. There is a frequent track you hear throughout that was beautiful but sometimes gave me the chills. It gave the scene the right amount of intensity but was not in your face.\
The sound gave this anime another thing. It made the scenes what they were. I think without the soundtrack, I would have to give this anime a 9. Again, this along with the art contrasting with the story made it a masterpiece with these 3 aspects.\
Character - 10\
The characters were well thought out, deep and you could attach an emotional bond easy. My favourite character was Saki. She had such a good mix between being strong and being weak. The creators did a fantastic job at not giving you an overbearing character or someone you didn't really care about.... ( Sorry Reiko... )\
Enjoyment - 10\
Pffft. I think we all the know the answer to that. \
Overall - 10.\
This anime was beautiful. It had such strong characters to contrast with the light colours, a beautiful soundtrack which made the scenes and an original plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. Sadly this anime is very underrated and more people need to watch it. I myself doubted it but you should give this a shot!\

    Story 10:\
Ahh, the story of Shinsekai Yori, From the New World. This story was one of exciting ups and downs that kept me viewing out of curiosity alone. I do know that keeping curiosity does not constitute a 10/10 for plot, but I will justify my decision further. First of all I would like to mention the story's excellent use of foreshadowing throughout the story. The foreshadowing offers the viewer a chance to see into future events without being so incredibly overt that the following events would be obvious. (I would mention specific examples, but I am actively avoiding spoiling the story for the readers).\
          \
        To expand on the previous idea I would like to mention that the story is not predictable (sorry to anyone who finds that statement redundant), but it's unpredictability doesn't come from left field, introducing a random new rule to the world's rules that completely throws you through a loop with it's absurdity. This is what I truly love about Shinsekai Yori, it keeps you on edge, catches you off guard and continues to do so while obeying it's own established rules. If you enjoy a flavorless anime that gives you the plot on a platter then this show is not for you (I'm looking at you nearly every harem).\
Art 8: \
Sadly, this show is not perfect, and I would have to say that its art is this show's only flawed product. On average the art looked spectacular (Especially their hats.) The colors were vivid when necessary, dark when necessary, and delivered a smooth overall product. There were, tragically so, some points when the art seemed inconsistent in quality with the rest of the show. This means some of the character designs seemed off or sloppy, backgrounds were sometimes blurry, but don't let these little details scare you off from the show's colorful world.\
Sound 10: \
The sound was another lovely part of this show. The first ending was catchy, and I found myself actually sticking around to listen to it at the end of every episode (Which I rarely do). The second ending (While still good), did not worm its way into my ear like the first one did. The show; however, did not have an opening which disappointing and rewarding. I found this rewarding because it allowing the show (without interruption) to get into the meat of what was happening. The show's sound also did very well (paired with the art) to set up the required ambiance. Some creepy chilling music paired with the dark atmosphere actually sent chills down my spine as I watched (That's later in the show). \
Character 10:\
The characters managed to stand out as individuals each one acting individually of each other, with different reactions to each situation making them seem as if they were individual people rather than just a homogeneous group (Which sometimes happens). Each character standing out making you care about them, hate them, and even think they are a pussy. As you watch them interact with each other and the environment.\
Enjoyment 10: \
Obviously, based on the endless praise I have given this show throughout the review. This show is re-watchable you watch the first time and experience the twist and turns and then you re-watch and see the little things you missed (such as the aforementioned foreshadowing) there are always new experiences waiting for me when I decide I have the time to go back and visit the world of Shinsekai Yori. I hope you enjoyed the review.  \

    Shinsekai Yori was one of the more polarizing series of the Fall 2012 season.  Its dark themes, twisting and complex story, and slow pace turned a lot of viewers off.  But for those that saw it through to the end, they were treated to what I consider to be the best show of the year.\
Story:\
Shinsekai Yori's story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, but in something of an inversion of genre expectations, we're introduced to a pastoral Japan, that's seemingly peaceful and well-maintained.  Of course, we know things are not quite what they seem.  How is a society of telekinetic humans\
          \
        able to thrive given the very nature of such a power, and its role in the collapse of ancient (our) civilization?  The rabbit hole goes deep, and the unraveling of this mystery through the eyes of Saki and the children of Group 1 is the engine that keeps this story moving.  It's an engaging, often unsettling, and always though-provoking tale.\
Characters: 9/10\
We're being told the story of Shinsekai Yori through the yes of Saki Watanabe, who starts the series as a 12 year, freshly awakened to her telekinetic powers.  The story spans a considerable amount of time, and throughout it, we learn about the world, and experience Saki's growth into one of the strongest female characters in recent anime.  The supporting cast isn't as well fleshed out as Saki, but they are almost always believable, and some standouts, like Shun, Maria, Satoru, and Tomiko can carry the show on their own for stretches.  The unreliable memories and perspectives of Saki and her classmates is part of what makes experiencing this story so compelling.\
Art: 7/10\
The character design, backgrounds, and color palette of Shinsekai Yori are excellent.  Unfortunately, the same can not be said about the animation itself.  This is a sometimes slow, dialogue heavy show, but there are a number of action heavy sequences throughout, and the animation quality can drop noticeably.  During fights, and other high action, the visuals often can't keep pace with the intensity of the events that are unfolding.   Episodes 5 and 10 have a different director and art style altogether, and while I appreciate the impulse to try something potentially interesting, it just doesn't work here.\
Sound: 9/10\
The voice acting is consistently excellent, and the use of music (especially Dvorak's \"From the New World\") throughout the series amplifies the emotional impact of the experience.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Watching Shinsekai Yori takes work.  The plot takes a while to develop, but you'll be rewarded for sticking with it.  There is a deep mystery to this world, and facts are hard to come by.  The plot is delivered in such a way that revelations often come by way of inference.  The fate of some characters, and the resolution of certain issues aren't bypassed - these aren't plot holes - but you won't always be told exactly how things happened.  Just like the main characters, you'll often be left to sort through incomplete information as you try to figure out what has actually transpired.  So, how enjoyable is Shinsekai Yori?  If you're like me, you'll find it to be an absolute blast.\
Overall: 9/10\
Taking this story on was ambitious, and there were some notable stumbles.  The animation is sometimes sloppy and rushed,  and in its worst moments, it can be utterly jarring.  Additionally, the pacing and editing is often inconsistent - it's sometimes brilliant (episode 16), and sometimes dismal (episode 5).\
Those issues aside, the outstanding plot, world creation, and characters are what set Shinsekai Yori apart.  The world of Shinsekai Yori, and the mystery that surrounds it, is excellently crafted.  We experience the world through the eyes of Saki.  We're never privy to more than what Saki, knows and experiences.  We know, as well as Saki does, that things are not as they seem, but like her, you won't be handed anything.  Sifting between reality and illusion is as important for the audience, as it is for the main cast.  This is the kind of show that demands engagement in order to be fully enjoyed.  If you can handle the animation hiccups, and have patience, you'll be rewarded with a unique, challenging, and beautiful piece of science-fiction.",

    Well, this will be a difficult review... but let's give a try. First a disclaimer:\
Yes, two guys kiss in one episode. It is sad that many people dropped this show only because of a 10 second scene. If you are homophobic, don't even start reading here and go try to be a better person. Curious is how \"two girls kissing\" is ok... oh you people. Now that we are done here, let's go:\
Story 9/10\
Shinsekai Yori takes place 1000 years in the future, where the society returned to a more rural state, and religions like Buddhism and Shintoism are once again predominant. But what makes this\
          \
        world so special is the fact that everyone now has telekinesis power, called Cantus, and how everything works around this ability, specially how to control it. There are children disappearing, demons, supernatural killer cats, a strange new humanoid race, Mantras… and this is only the beginning of the mysteries.\
The best part of Shinsekai Yori is the world where the story takes place, since it is all surrounded with a dark mystery, where most people are unaware of the secrets of their society. With the eyes of the group of five children, we also start to uncover the true nature of the place they live in. But here is the first problem of this show: Despite it was sold as a Horror and Psychological show, it barely has any of this elements. Drama and thriller are the predominant genres here, and they are really competent in these aspects, working with the tragic consequences of the children's discoveries in the show. Also, by the time you reach around episode 18 there won't be anymore mysteries to be revealed, except for a last and awesome revelation in the last episode.\
Enjoyment 8/10\
So... if Shinsekai Yori isn't all about mysteries, what else it has to offer? Well, there is another intelligent race living in this world, and they are called Queerats. They are like animals with some humanoid characteristics, that live in tribes in the forest and all their acts are monitored by the humans. And here lies two extremes aspects of Shinsekai Yori:\
- Best: The final arc. It is full of action, drama, violence, tension and everything you would expect for. Even better, the final revelation of this anime brings us a good chance to reflect upon everything that happened and we can even try to bring it to our reality.\
- Worst: Pacing. Pace is a huge problem in this show, specially when the protagonists are interacting with the Queerats. While we are all looking for the mysteries and thrilling scenes, we have to spend a bunch of episodes watching the kids running in the forest and talking with Queerats. To makes things worse, in the beginning you can't tell if these episodes are relevant or not, until you arrive at the final arc. If they were able to develop the mysteries and the Queerats problems together, definitely we would have a better result in the end.\
Art 8/10; Sound 9/10\
The sound is really competent, it is able to create the mood of melancholy, tension, and brings a kind of \"epic ancestral religious\" music over the show. The art is really beautiful, and the absence of colorful places and clothes makes everything even more melancholic and sad. But the quality of the animation is unstable, and we can notice many episodes with a lack of quality (and many of them are in the Queerat parts).\
Characters 8/10\
The characters are ok, they fulfill their roles, but I couldn't develop a stronger link with any of them. Saki is a strong female lead, while Satoru and Shun are the most intelligent ones in the difficult situations. Mamoru is the fragile one, while Maria is more cheerful. There are some other minor characters, but most of them shows up only to die 1 episode later. The Queerats Kiroumaru and Squealer are probably the most interesting characters, since that they are the ones who are the cause of the final conflict, and we understand their point only a few minutes before the ending of the show.\
Overall: 8/10\
Shinsekai Yori is a really enjoyable show. It brings an interesting world surrounded of mysteries, that are uncovered little by little, and which their consequences bring a good drama for the plot. It has some problems with the instability of the animation quality and pacing, which causes some let downs while watching it. The secondary plot, which turns out to be the main plot in the future, surrounding the tribes of Queerats is a huge problem that turns out in a good and interesting conclusion, that you are able to enjoy if you put in your mind that this show is not only about mysteries.\

    Very good science fiction that doesn't pull any punches and trusts in the viewer to be able to put the pieces together.  Very well told and conceived - outside of things like psychokinesis, even the science used is within the realm of abstract possibility. Character deaths are often abrupt, but never happen without furthering the plot and making deliberate points. Everything seems to be in service of the underlying story.\
My only complaint, and the thing that kept me from fully enjoying the show, is the main character, who is as bland as stale Wonder Bread.  Characters continually mention how amazing she is, but\
          \
        even they have a hard time coming up with any reason she would be amazing. \"I guess I would call it strength,\" they say. But Saki is often the first to break down, and is more often than not the most cowardly and useless person in any situation.\
The supporting and antagonizing characters are much more interesting, with Squealer and Kidoumaru being prime examples. In the end maybe that's the point.\
Shinsekai Yori is a largely unheralded gem of modern animation, and is well worth a watch.  Ultimately, it's a story about how to know when you've lost your way, and a cautionary tale that we must always protect the core of our humanity, which is in the end what all great science fiction is about.\

    First of all, I would say that Shinsekai Yori, is a thoughtful masterpiece, but an animated disaster.\
This anime encourages you to think inwardly, to think deep, to think about your morals, your character, and to judge what is right and wrong in whatever situation. That's all fine and dandy, and they even throw in lots of variables to complicate things and confuse you a bit. That's still okay, the anime may seem quite heavy in terms of its dark atmosphere, but so far, we're still surviving.\
Story: 8/10\
When we talk about the plot, most of us would think, \"Wow that was amazing.\" But upon careful discretion\
          \
        we will see some key plot holes that surface. The society itself that they are living in is greatly flawed, the so-called system that seems to be flawless at the beginning, exposes itself to many loopholes as the story progress.\
It is difficult to think that human society AFTER our current modern era has retrogressed in terms of intelligence, and still is surprised at the thought of a democracy/monarchy... and so on. This incoherence is further emphasized when we see the adults, which the story uses the excuse of \"fear\", causing them to make mistakes and result in horrible tragedies.\
Unfortunately, I don't buy that. \"Fear\" is one thing, but as Tomiko has shown \"experience\" is another that probably trumps over all fear. The key conflict in this series only starts like in the last quarter of the entire series, and that is some really screwed up pacing, if you ask me.\
Sure, they took a long time to develop the characters, which I would give full marks for, but it completely detracts from the plot so much. The characters grow up, they change, it's all good, but I mean cmon, within the transition periods the characters learnt absolutely nothing? Time jumps are an absolute no-no. The anime should have completely shortened the first 3 arcs of the show into maximum 6 episodes (about 1 quarter of the show).\
Plot holes are generally unexplained, but well hidden. They try to cover up many things by talking about the \"inhibition\", \"fear\" and even the main characters' morals. But common sense only seems to exist within the queerats and not the Cantus users. \
For example, humanity as they know it takes perfect care to ensure that the epic disaster never happens again. Not bad. But - they forget contingency plans - there is no evacuation route, there is no communication lines, there are no steps, procedures to follow in the event of an epic disaster. In short, disaster and crisis management has gone out the window. Humanity is driven to the point of extinction because, even though they managed to come back from near extinction before, they have not learned their lesson of \"survivability\" which includes \"having a back up plan\".\
Another example, the source and origin of Cantus is never explained. It just seems to be this weird innate power used for crushing the weak, that stems from absolutely nothing, apparently. A huge energy source, created from this \"awakening\" of sorts via a mantra. So basically, everybody is a \"God\". Excellent. And these \"Gods\" would ultimately become useless because they really suck at using their powers - which they have been training their entire lives for. The anime literally shows like about less than 25 people who effectively use their Cantus in any combat or battle situation. That's pathetic and very sad.\
The above two main plot holes justify my giving of the story a 8/10 instead of a 10/10. I have a lot of other plot holes that they haven't addressed - proper explanation of how the final \"fiend\" was \"extracted\" from her parents, explanation how such out-of-this-world sea monsters ever came under queerat control, explanation of why Cantus users need to use waterways when they obviously can fly, explanation of why Cantus users need boats, when they obviously can levitate above water, explanation of why Cantus users don't have planes or helicopters when they have weird-looking boat submarines already, explanation of why Cantus users are unable to escape effectively, even with the use of Cantus, explanation of why Cantus users constantly tire and run out of energy when Cantus is essentially an unlimited source of power which the anime keeps stressing on. If I were to be REALLY fair with this anime, it would deserve a 7/10, but I felt that since the anime was told \"in Saki's perspective\" I can concede that Saki probably would not have known all of these things (although she probably might have known some), so I did not penalize for ANY of these plot holes, when I actually should.\
Honestly, if you watched the anime and DID NOT pick up any of the plot holes above, you are just not thinking enough about this anime.\
Still, I give them bonus points for being able to gloss over quite a few plot holes and not have anyone notice (you probably won't notice it, but some things are unexplained and just dropped off halfway through the series after a time jump). Even the resolution at the end, though it felt good, was not complete - have they really explained everything that came together, the big plan by the queerats at the end, how did it practically take shape? - I feel there are many ways their plan could have just failed in their tracks, but the story does not bother explaining these.\
It was a very good story, but not perfect.\
\
Character: 9/10\
Enough said, the character development was solid. Although the main characters' whiney nature is really annoying at times. It is btw, completely inconsistent with her \"strong\" yet \"weak\" nature. It doesn't make much sense - sometimes she breaks down and is terrified, other times she suddenly has a strong sense of conviction in spite of great danger, I mean, if you grew through your experiences to become stronger then good for you, but this girl just keeps switching from useless to useful, it just seems like it's all for the convenience of driving the plot. But still, good characters.\
Art: 5/10 and Sound: 6/10\
The art was confusing at times, really. All those dreams that the main character is having makes me want to puke. The Music, was meh, it hardly had any OP, though the ED was just fine. So I give it half points. Same for the art. It lacked a lot of animation and was pretty dull. Also, the background music I found really annoying for some reason, it was just that same old stretched-out melody, with action-packed music being completely village drummed out. I mean it suits the whole tone of the anime but it really bores me to death.\
Enjoyment: 5/10\
The pacing for the first half of the show was really slow, and really bad. And then the pacing for the latter half was very slow, then very fast, then very slow, then very fast... and so on. The story could have been driven much better if it didn't gloss over so many key moments, and it explained situations a whole lot better than just a huge narrative that bored me to death, seriously. I had to literally FORCE myself to continue watching past episode 6, and I guess it was slightly worth it. (I would have given this anime an overall score of 4 if I hadn't continued, but I promise the anime does get better towards the end, but still that's a bit too long to expect me continue. PLEASE HOOK ME IN AT EP 1, not at EP 20. cmon!)\
I know this show is supposed to make you think, but I really find that narrator's voice of the main character talking in 3rd person all the time, really annoying, useless, and I find it cheating that the narrator literally gives you more clues about the story itself, than the actual visuals that I see.\
Nice plot twist at the end though, though it wasn't pretty big, and was mostly predictable. I give it a bonus 1 point.\
Overall : 7/10.\
Watch it if you really like questioning your own beliefs and if you have a LOT of time. Also, a lot of buddhist references at the start -> it is hard to imagine a POST-MODERN era to still be holding such religious/ritualistic approaches. But okay, since it had to be about hypnosis and whatnot, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it was merely a practice and not a belief (this is again a plot point that was never explained and just glossed over)\
So be prepared to be really bored for the entire first half of the show, but after that, the characters really shine (or should I say what's left of the characters... hahahaha)\

    „The power of imagination can change everything“\
Shinsekai Yori shows you your inner fears, lets you think about the fate of humanity and your inner feelings. It’s definitely an unordinary anime, in a good way of course. The story is happening one thousand years in the future. Saki, the main character tells you her life in a retrospective way. Right at the beginning you get the feeling that there is something odd about the setting, not just because humans have the power of psychokinesis, if you think about future settings you actually never had this kind of world in mind. If you start thinking about this,\
          \
        the story has already caught you. The idea behind this anime is unique and completely thought-out.\
After I watched an episode of Shinsekai Yori I sometimes needed a break just to rethink what I just saw. The story is so complex and deep that you don’t just watch it, you enjoy it, you try to understand the actions of the characters. At the beginning you know nothing about the story but you want to know more, this raises the whole length of the anime until the end, no episode is boring, you get the feeling that everything what happens has a meaning. Unlike other animes I didn’t see any plot holes, everything was thought-out well. The supernatural power is is not just there, like in many other animes, it has a reason and it actually fits in the story quite nicely. The power is not too much, there aren’t unnecessary power-ups or unlogical usage of the power. \
The style of art is amazing. At the beginning I thought it would be a bit trashy because it’s a new style, a very unique one. If you keep watching you will start to love the style of drawing and animation, this art is just beautiful, the colors are outstanding and always fit the atmosphere, to watch it in HD is totally worth it.\
The sound is one of the best I ever heared in an anime. I just love the soundtrack, it fits the setting and emotions so nicely. It’s very calm and deep for the most part but it can spring almost instantly to dramatic or sad. The soundtrack together with the pictures are a perfect match. I don’t like the sound of most of the animes but this, this was not just random music, it was art, like if you are going to an opera. The sound alone is a reason to watch this anime.\
The characters are very special. At the beginning I was so interested in the background story that I didn’t pay as much attention to the characters. But Saki as the main character evolves very quickly within the anime, the anime starts when she is a kid, and ends when she is 36 and tells you her story, you really feel with her and you will starting to love her more and more as the anime progresses. The characters are showing in a really good way how different we really are, love, sacrifice, honesty, honor, hate, revenge, they show you how human beings really think and you maybe gain an inside in your own heart.\
I enjoyed every minute of Shinsekai Yori. I’m not one the guys who watched all episodes in a marathon, just because I wanted to enjoy it as long as I can. Shinsekai Yori has a message to us which let us think about our existence and our future.  You maybe are a bit askance about the anime because of it’s unordinary art and story but you really have to give it a shot, you won’t regret it. \
Well, this was kind of a short review but I hope I could help you with the decision to watch it. Feel free to leave a comment or feedback.\

    Originally a novel Shinsekai Yori or From The New World is not an anime I would usually get into but when I was left with no computer for almost a year I ended up satisfying my anime needs by buying the Rogers Anime on Demand. Which contained no shows that peeked my interest enough to watch or continue watching them. Then I decided to give From the New World a watch to see what it had to offer. \
Story:\
When the anime began I found it rather boring but since I had nothing better to watch I continued through the episodes until it got to episode\
          \
        8 which I will talk about later. One thing I liked about this anime is how you see how the main characters grow up over two seasons of the anime from young children to adults. You can see their world and overtime how it works which is a big step seeing as it is set in the future and would have to have a lot explain in the ways this anime succeeded at doing. It seemed like an average anime nothing special about it until episode 8 where things get much deeper and I was so shocked over the huge 180 this anime decided to take, which paid off in my opinion.\
Characters:\
Starting off two dimensional for me I really never thought when I began watching this that I would love these characters as much as I did. When the anime takes its dark turn and characters begin to face terrible fates you can't help but feel sad about what is happening to all these characters and almost feel the same pain as Saki. I have to say episode 8-11 for me had to be one of the saddest parts of the anime. When the main characters begin to forget a past you as the viewer watched happen you just can't help but wanna cry cause you know the characters aren't coming back. Shun, Satoru and Saki were my favourites but Maria and Mamoru didn't really do anything for me, they still were good characters but weren't as good as the other members of the main cast.\
Art:\
I do like the art in this anime but I still feel like it isn't anything special or the best art i've seen. It looks very different from the anime style we usually see its nice but not at anime standards. \
Sound:\
Nothing special about this soundtrack wasn't exactly up to my standards still fit with the anime and it wasn't like it was ear bleeding to listen to it was nice it fit in the background of the anime.\
Enjoyment: \
This anime is one of the best animes i've seen in quite awhile it really does kill you on what these characters have to go through overtime. The anime has a way of making you convey emotional turmoil for all the characters and really there has never been an anime for me in quite a while who had done it this well to me before. I suggest you give it a watch atleast until episode 11 if you can't really understand the story or feel empathy for the characters  I'd be surprised. Please give this a watch!It's something new and refreshing for those of you looking for an anime with compelling story and characters. If you don't atleast try it trust me you'll be missing out.\

After the millennium, as predicted by Rousseau, mankind back to the basics. People abandoned civilization and technology, choosing a comfortable and quiet XX century. life. There is no government - people living in small towns and villages in communion with nature. Oil and atom become unnecessary.

        our character met. Children walking to school, the priest prays, adults working and everything seems like in a normal world, but if that were the case? Unfortunately, however, extraordinary schools, in addition to cultural and historical sciences, as well teach the power of telekinesis, local priests with mysterious rituals trying to trample evil power, while adults hide horrible secrets. And if someone from kids not good enough at school, they does not get a bad grade, but just mysteriously disappears.\
Music: melodic and mysterious, and drawing: shiny colors, tones, lighting, landscapes, backgrounds, and gives a special atmosphere to anime. Everything displayed naturally, even homosexuality has a special, scientifically based and not at all distorted role. Time does not stand still here and our characters grow and change.\
True, rare atrocious anime and somehow uncomfortable feeling. It's as if you were olone in the dark forest surrounded by wolves, the only difference that in this anime are far deadlier things happening. Unnecessary clans of blood to make you feel the thrill. In addition to beautiful nature and specific knowledge of the world there are many secrets, many obscure things ... I just finished watching a 14 episode and still have no clue what gana happened in next episode. \
At first glance, nothing seems to be original. The mysterious disappearance of a children's - we've already seen countless times! With telekinesis as well as many from and Japanese and Westerners authors. Sport games with magical powers was enough after \"Harry Potter\" ... And as it is, this anime is something unusual, have some kind of fresh flow!\
The scenario completely unpredictable. Characters did not impressed me much, but unique atmosphere and  plot  makes one of the best anime titles of 2012-13.

Shinsekai Yori is without a doubt one of the greatest anime series ever created. You have to understand ~ That isn't something I throw around carelessly. From the very first episode I was captivated by this dark and twisted tale of love. It stands as the only anime to hold my attention to such an extent that I ended up watching the entire show in one sitting.. I just HAD to know what would happen next.. I've never been gripped like that before it was\
          \
        a wonderful feeling to say the least. Quite often that wonder was accompanied with dread and sadness. This anime will build you up and then break you down piece by piece. I cannot speak another word for I fear I will spoil your enjoyment of the anime. I believe everyone should go into watching this anime just as I did.. with absolutely no expectations of what the show is about. Go into it as a new born baby that is experiencing life for the first time .. and come out of it as a war hardened man... or woman :)\
DISCLAIMER: This show is incredibly DARK and as such is NOT recommended for children under 15 years of age. \

    Shin Sekai Yori is a show I’ve dedicated a lot of time to as a blogger. The task of writing a post on each episode every week was made a lot easier by the fact that I actually really enjoyed it, and always had something to say about it! I actually had too much to say about the show at times, which is why I’ve now decided to write a review on it. I’d like to be able to compile the most important thoughts I’ve had on the show during those 25 weeks into one post. Who knows, maybe it will help someone reading this\
          \
        to decide whether or not they want to watch the show? One can only dream!!\
I won’t waste time by giving you a synopsis- if you want one, read it here on MAL- I’m just gonna launch right into it!!!\
The strongest aspect of SSY was definitely its story. Well, less its story, more the themes it incorporated into it! It frequently used its characters’ actions to make comments on human nature, comments like: humans are evil, if we’re given weapons, we will definitely use them because of this, fear of our destruction will lead to our destruction, etc. And because none of this was said outright, discovering them provided me with a certain satisfaction!! I know many prefer not to think too deeply about shows, but even though the story, at face value, is interesting, with plenty of twists and turns that make it difficult to predict what’s going to happen next, I would strongly recommend taking the time to ponder over what you watch, because if you’re anything like me, the story alone, without any deeper meaning, won’t be enough if you can’t bring yourself to care about its characters, which I’ll elaborate on shortly.\
There were two other things I really liked about SSY’s story. One of these things was that, as the story took place over a span of just under a decade, it really felt as though you’d gone on a journey with the characters by its end. The other thing was that the writers really knew how to get inside your head. It’s strange, even though the human characters in the show often felt artificial (again, I’ll get onto that soon) it really felt as though, at times, the writers understood what it meant to be human, especially in regards to fear. The show could be wonderfully creepy at times simply because the writers understood what we find scary, and exploited that. Pain, darkness, monsters, the unknown, being trapped, being pursued- all things we universally find scary, all things regularly used to create fear!\
The weakest aspect of SSY, however, was its characters. Right up until the end, I’d not heavily invested myself in a single one of them! Frequently they’d be placed in life-threatening situations, but I just wouldn’t care. The problem was that some of them didn’t display enough of a range of emotions for them to feel convincing as characters- Mamoru, for example, only ever seemed to display fear and uncertainty- and some of them could have done with their motives being fleshed out more- like, why was Satoru such a compulsive child, but such a composed and reliable adult? I just felt as though I hadn’t been given enough to get behind them as characters. But I suppose that’s what happens when most of your characters are just vessels used to further the storyline, or emphasise a point…\
Saying that, there was one character that stood out, Squealer. Everything about him made him a superb villain: his voice, his appearance, his behaviour… everything! Firstly, given that he’s a queerat, it was more difficult for us to identify with him, secondly, almost every time he opens his mouth, he sucks up to the humans around him in this sickly sweet tone of voice that just feels wrong, given his sinister appearance and questionable actions- it is obvious from the start that you can’t trust him- thirdly, although I complained about the show not making enough of an effort to tell us what motivated its characters, this wasn’t necessary with Squealer, a little twitch of his eye, or a slight grin was enough to make you think that he wasn’t completely on the level!! But as his motivations were rarely made clear, it was difficult to pinpoint why you felt this way, and it was this uncertainty that made him such an interesting and unnerving character to watch.\
In terms of its art, SSY was pretty darn good. Its backgrounds were often stunning, and the nightmare and storytelling sequences looked incredible! The art was extremely varied during these sequences, making use of monochrome and bright, contrasting colours at points. Some of these sequences even reminded me of famous works of art. The storytelling sequence on karma demons reminded me of a Seurat painting (the artist who painted using dots of colour), and one nightmare sequence, one of Salvador Dali’s. My only complaint is that most of the characters weren’t that interesting to look at. This relates back to what I was saying about them not displaying enough of a range of emotions. Because the only expression some characters seemed to wear was one of fear, they quickly became very boring to look at!! It was a nightmare as a blogger to find screenshots to use in my posts, simply because of this lack of variety!!! I think if you look back at my posts, week after week I’ve had to use screenshots of Saki looking scared, which is quite funny, in retrospect!\
Overall, a very good show! Worth watching if you’re looking for a visual treat, or something with depth. Avoid if you’re looking for something simple and light-hearted, you will not find it here!!\

                          \
    By now you've probably read the introduction to the show listed above:\
\"In this utopian village, strange rumors about a monstrous cat that abducts children circulate, and students are said to disappear from the academy. The world and its history are much darker than they appear and humanity is on the verge of collapse.\"\
That in particular.  This is a spoiler free review, but I'm going to start off with this.  This show is absolutely not entirely about that.  The premise of some big cat being the antagonist slightly interested me, but this show was by no means a priority for me based on\
          \
        that.  The show starts off as such, everything was pretty much as I expected, along with some cool surprises.  \
But, that simplistic plot soon crashed.  What this show gets into is completely unexpected, and was an amazing experience.  I'm not going to say that what this show did was incredibly unique (honestly, I got a ever-so-slight Final Fantasy X vibe from it.  That in no way spoils anything, but some of the foundation kind of reminded me of it).  But even so, what they pulled off was amazing.  Every major detail this story had got a good amount of attention.  It was at times kind of hard to keep up if you weren't paying attention, but I loved the depth behind everything.  I felt like there was a story behind every house, brick, etc.  \
The story developed well.  Initially, while they're exploring the incident with the big cat, it was interesting, but by no means something that kept me guessing.  While that incident is still important, other things occur is when I was on the edge of my seat.  There were many scenes in this show where I was holding my breath because the situations were so tense.  \
Everything aside, I really loved the message this show conveyed.  Just when you feel like you know who the enemy is, they give you a different perspective on things.  Which isn't surprising considering they used a certain establishment to base humanities civilization on.  The last episode left me in shock, not because they revealed something I slightly expected, but because I didn't expect the sudden shift in perspective.  I'm so used to shows ending in a predetermined way \"Bad guy looses, good guy wins, the end\".  The formula doesn't entirely apply here.  The morality of everyone's actions was a common problem in the show (not that they were beating you over the head with it surprisingly enough), and ended on that note.  It was a really great way to carry the story and its characters throughout the show.  \
Even with all that, I can't say I was too attached to this show while watching it.  For all its depth, I didn't really feel completely attached to the characters.  I don't know if this was intended or not, but as much as I enjoyed them, I had a hard time feeling too much remorse for them.  That was kind of a problem being a show based on the darkness of humanity.  That isn't to say I didn't feel anything, but I can't say I really had a favorite 'human' in this show.  I absolutely had a favorite character, but it was from a place I didn't expect.  Long story short, I was interested in what happened next, occasionally an episode ended on a cliffhanger and I had to tune in immediately, but that absolute investment wasn't there for me.  \
This show may seem extremely shallow just reading the short bio, reading a couple reviews, or even watching the first few episodes.  However, there are a lot of really great surprises that you can't even comprehend without giving it a chance.  I'm so happy I decided to give this show a chance, I have a feeling you'll feel the same way after finishing it.  It's a great story that really gets you to think while watching it, which is very refreshing.\

    If you're looking for an anime that is intelligently written, has realistic characters, and none of the pitfalls of modern anime, then this is the one you want to watch.\
Shinsekai Yori is one of the most well written anime's I've seen thus far, and that's probably because it is based on an award winning novel. I chose to watch this show because recently I've been searching for well written anime, stuff that I could show anybody without explaining, \"it's anime, just go with it.\" This one had nothing I would need to explain to an outsider. No fan-service, forced comedy bits, or melodrama. \
You have\
          \
        to give the first five episodes a shot before the plot starts moving, but it's never a dull watch. Early into the show, the animation is gorgeous, the music is hypnotizing, and the world building is always interesting. Later on the animation goes down in quality a lot (most likely because of budgetary reasons) but the narrative becomes tighter and more engaging. \
The story follows a group of characters from childhood to adulthood, it's epic in it's scope and imagination. It's themes will make you think about sexuality, racism, classism, and how illegitimate the fantasy of a good or bad sides are. In Shinsekai Yori, there is no good or bad. There are two warring factions that both have major pitfalls. \
Finally, this story has great character development, which is especially the case for Squealer, who is so interesting he reminded me of a Shakespearean character. \
Everything isn't perfect. There are moments in which the writing falls flat. Things just happen or the characters have revelations, but instead of showing us, they just tell us after the fact. I'm sure those elements were more fleshed out in the novel, but it the show it felt like they will pulling solutions out of their ass sometimes. Also sometimes it is far too exposition heavy for my liking. \
8/10....this is a much watch for anybody who considers anime to be a lesser medium. \

    Shinseki yori is to date one of the most memorable and impressive shows i've ever seen. \
Truthfully, I wont touch on most of the shows content, because frankly, this show is such a ride that telling you anything would be a disservice. This show is fast paced, confusing at times, but the way it builds upon itself to eventually reveal more and more components makes it a truly unique experience. You know so little to begin, but by the end, you've undergone tons of world building, character development, cast inter connectivity, and in a way true viewer interaction.\
Many characters feel unique leaving you on the\
          \
        edge of your seat wondering who is good, who is bad, who is what to whom? you love the way they go together but you keep checking within yourself to make sure you're following. \
The show does a great job leading you down many roads, and eventually directing you to the truth. A very \"needle in the haystack\" feel. This is the grace of the show, the way it tells a story with so much happening, and leaves you to learn a little bit each and every step of the way. It wraps you in, you want to know so bad, and when you finally know, you are fully satisfied. \
From the plot, the characters, the sound, and the mystery of it all, you are truly entwined in an experience. this show is more than just simply pleasantries, but a mind wrenching, compelling, and enduring story you will likely never forget.\
If you got nothing from this review, I hope at least you will take away that Shinseki Yori (from the new World) is beyond anything else I've ever seen, and truly an amazing and riveting adventure.",

    I write this review in english and spanish, if you are interesed.\
English - Shinsekai yori can be described with two words: Wonderfully epic. \
The story begins with a calm vibe, like a slice of life, but it becomes more and more darker as the story progresses. What makes the series being unique and great is the way it is narrated and performed, every detail is important and helps the story to can be understood and developed. My problem with Shinsekai is the art of the characters, the sounds and the ambience are very well made and fulfill their purpose, but sometimes the design, especially humans,\
          \
        looks very unpolished (c'mon man, they're A-1 Pictures, they can do it better than this!!). So, this may be a little frustrating, but does not affect anything in the development of the history.\
Finally, Shinsekai yori can be considered a dark story about human life and his twisted mind of doing things. If you are interested in seeing a magnificent series with little to no errors, or if you like animes with good history and development, you are invited to see this series, I assure you that you will love as much as me.\
Spanish - Shinsekai yori puede ser descrito con dos palabras: Maravillosamente épico.\
La historia comienza con un ambiente tranquilo, como un Slice of life, pero esta se vuelve mas y mas oscura a medida que la historia avanza. Lo que hace que la serie sea única y genial es la forma en que es narrada y llevada a cabo, todo detalle es importante y ayuda a que la historia pueda ser entendida y desarrollada. Mi problema con Shinsekai es el arte de los personajes, el sonido como la ambientación están muy bien logrados y cumplen su propósito, pero a veces el diseño, especialmente el de los humanos, se ven poco pulidos (vamos hombre, son A-1 Pictures, pueden hacerlo mejor que esto!!), Lo que puede ser un poco frustante a la vista, aunque no afecte en nada en el desarrollo de la historia.\
Finalmente Shinsekai yori puede ser considerada una oscura historia sobre la vida humana y su retorcida mente de hacer las cosas. Si estas interesado en ver una magnifica serie con poco a nada de errores, o si te gustan los animes con buena historia y desarrollo, estas invitado a ver esta serie, te aseguro que te encantara tanto como a mi.\

    Story is great, but it's really difficult not droping the show, because of the extremely slow pace. Some moments felt like fillers and this show was only relying on the main idea (without really touching it) to keep the viewer watching. Basically I'm saying that this show had so much more potential. And I think that the ending was easy to guess and that they were making the audience wait a bit too much for it\
Art really loved it, the fact that it's constantly changing made me want more.  \
Sound liked it also\
Characters were well made except the MC, which was supposed to be\
          \
        relatable but was stupid instead. And when characters were killed they were killed for some 'reason' without an explanation\
Enjoyment, in each new episode there was only one little thing which made you want to continue the series, almost in 10m in every one felt like fillers.\
Overall, you should watch it, because it's different and for the message, because it's something that will make you think about it over and over and that's were the enjoyment comes I think.\
If you made it past episode 10, just finish the show :)\

    Shinsekai Yori is what you can briefly describe as a mystery gathering more layers upon layers as it goes on. This is not an overstatement considering there are (I kid you not) plot twists every episode/every other episode.\
If you've read other reviews, than this is no surprise, but...\
This anime is confusing.\
A cycle I experienced in Shinsekai Yori was,\
Oh man I'm confused!!!\
Hmmm...\
I think I get it...\
You know what, I think I get the gist of it!\
then....\
Time leap!\
Repeat.\
If your like me, your thoughts across the episodes will probably be, \"This is really intriguing and I want to understand it\" but you can't follow everything that's going on.\
I\
          \
        guess what i'm trying to say is that Shinsekai Yori is an anime that sets itself to be one of those\
4deep2u's anime. But in the end it was much simpler than you would think, while its simpler, that doesn't mean its disappointing. Though I will add like most anime, this has its plot holes. \
But the best thing about Shinsekai Yori, at least what I think, is that its not about the end, or the beginning, but the journey of what it is, and what it teaches us along the way.\
But anyway enough of that philosophical crap.\
There are some pretty interesting part to this where I was confused like everyone turning lesbian/gay, but yeah, give it a watch yourself and see what you think.\
I like the endings too, they are catchy!\
Thanks for reading.\

    So I don't usually write reviews, this in fact would be my first one, but I felt the need to make an exception. For the TLDR, go watch this anime. It is one of the deepest anime I have ever seen. Is it perfect? No, but is raises fundamental human questions that even the most sophisticated anime out there only dream of approaching. To describe it simply, it is probably the most \"seinen\" anime I have ever seen. Also a warning, this anime is emotionally draining. By the end you will have felt the joys and pains of growing up, loss, sacrifice, and ultimately be\
          \
        left with the question of \"was it worth it?\" The journey is difficult, but worth it.\
Now for the longer version. This anime  is incredibly strange in that it is almost impossible to classify exactly what genre it fits in. It weaves in and out between horror, mystery, romance, action, social commentary, and even some elements of science fiction. If I had to choose a specific genre though, I would say it is a coming of age story. It captures the pain and beauty of growing up over the course of several decades of life, dealing with everything from fear of the outside world to the bonds of friendship to loss of a loved one to sacrifice in saving one's people. After watching, I felt like I had invested year of my life into the characters and that I had known them for much longer than the 25 episode run time.\
Perhaps the most impressive accomplishment of the anime is its handling of the antagonists. Every character who could be classified as \"evil\" has near perfect justification for their actions, and make you question what the true correct path should be. It deals with themes such as hiding the truth for the betterment of society, eliminating potential psychopaths for the safety of others, and killing innocents in the name of freedom and liberation. You clearly see why each of these sides do what they had to, and are left to your own judgment whether or not their actions were justified. If I have any complaints however, its that while many of these questions are presented, few of them are answered, leaving you rather unfulfilled at the end. If you are looking for resolutions, this anime is not the place. But the philosophical depths this anime explores are something that should not be ignored by anyone looking for something deeper than your average shounen anime.\
So here's the funny thing, I would not consider this an enjoyable anime. Its deep, its beautiful, but do not expect to feel any sense of fulfillment or real happiness by the end. It felt rather like reading a George Orwell or Ray Bradbury novel rather than something like Tolkien. There were also a few places the anime took me that I would rather wish it wouldn't, but ultimately cannot fault it for pushing my bounds a bit. Despite my misgivings, I feel the journey was still worth it.  I highly recommend watching and judging it for yourself, it is a true overlooked gem, and you don't see anime like this every day.\

    Friendship is used in practically every media. Whether it's anime. manga, books or TV shows. But never have I seen anything that has portrayed it as well as Shinsekai Yori.\
Story (8):\
The story is set in the distant future and follows the lives of five children: Saki, Mamoru, Satoru, Shun and Maria. In their society everyone has a special power called \"Cantus\". They go to Sage Academy where they learn to manipulate their Catus. Their lives are seemingly peaceful, but there are rumors spreading that children who cannot properly use their Cantus suddenly vanish....but nobody seems to remember them. When Saki and her friends go for\
          \
        a trip, they find the truth....a truth that threatens to rip their beautiful friendship apart. The story takes place over 3 periods of time, when the characters are 12 years old, 14 years old and 26 years old. This was an interesting part of the anime, but I felt that it made the overall pacing a bit slow, though not overly so.\
Characters (8):\
The characters and there friendship is defenitly a key part of this anime. The characters were likeable and had some of the best development I have ever seen, especially in how the relationship's between the characters was constantly changing and developing. Having said that, I felt that Mamoru didn't have enough focus on him and therefore he didn't have much development in comparison to the others.\
Sound (9):\
Shinsekai Yori defenitly had some gorgeous pieces of music. The ED was sung by Saki's voice actor Risa Taneda and the OP sung by Maria's voice actor Kana Hanazawa. They were equally beautiful, moving pieces that suited the anime very well.\
Speaking of the voice actors, they were amazing. With famous seiyus such as Yuki Kaji as Satoru and Kana Hanazawa as Maria the voice acting is just the cherry on the top of the cake for this anime. Seriously stunning!!!\
Art (7):\
The art wasn't really what I was expecting from A1-Pictures. The style itself was quite simple and not very unique but the art was generally quite consistent and most of the backgrounds were well done. I felt that the character designs were simple, not bad, but not amazing. \
Overall Enjoyment (8):\
All in all I think that Shinsekai Yori is a futuristic anime like no other. It has a tense, even depressing, atmosphere that will delight any thriller lover.\

    I had no intention to start with this serie, because the art and story didn't appeal to me. But it was higly recommended to me, because I was looking for a deep, complex plot with some dark elements in it. I'm very happy that I watched this show. It leaves me thinking about human nature. \
Story\
Shinsekai yori is an epic a about Saki. The pace of the serie starts really slow, it's to get to know the characters better and about the structure in their world. After their first encouter with the secret of their history, the story goes really fast. In just a few\
          \
        episodes Saki became an teenager and quickly an adult. If the transistion went slower, I would've love the show even more. The way the story is told is done brilliantly. The story builds up by every episode. It makes you really curious in the world they're living in and how humans will make their decisions eventhough it's morally horrible. The ending made a very impact on me. It still makes me think about human behaviour. \
Character\
Getting to know Saki better really makes you emphatize with her and understand her actions better. Although the main character is an average girl, she is really strong. This description made me feel connected with Saki. Eventhough your're average person you can be really strong. By following her life and see her grow up, her actions are believable. The romance between the friends is realistic, but It felt like the love scenes were just randomly added in, it was not neccesary. The exospecies is a spot on comparison for the submissive group of humans. From the beginning till end they couldn't be trusted yet, still I emphatize with them.\
Overal\
The art and costume design is beautiful. From the middle of the show I start really liking the show. The structual system of their society is thought out well in every detail, which I can really appreciate. I love anime's which stays in my mind for days even when I already finished with it. This serie reminds me a lot to PshycoPass but in a completly different setting.  \

    I am going to set this straight. I am extremely dissapointed of the direction this show took. After watching the first chapter I was honestly interested, and the next 3-4 chapters were gold. The story, the mysteries, the messed up society, and the ANIMATION was GORGEOUS! Oh my god it was SO PRETTY in those first chapters.\
Then came the rats. Honestly, why? They made the whole story SO BORING... I did not give a fucking shit about the goddamn rats, the most common characters in the show. Instead of focusing on the human's powers, Shun, Shisei, the history of humankind and a potential rebellion of\
          \
        the main characters against the system, we went down a road full of clichés and RATS!!!\
The theming was nailed, and the reasons behind the acts of the characters are clear and understandable. But it feels like a history documentary at points, not like an interesting story...\
This could have been carried in such a better direction. This is one of the greatest wastes of potential I have seen in anime. I am giving it a 7, but honestly, I do not recommend this show. It is, altogether, weird, and kind of boring despite the \"deep\" and \"mature\" meaning behind it. Also, A-1 did a terrible job on the animation, changing it up several times through the anime, almost always to worse. \

    First of all to anyone who want to give this anime a short DON'T \
Regardless of how good the rating or how the review make it sound like you should give it a go..... DON'T \
Shinsekai Yori revolves about a couple and they are mostly the main focus where Saki watanabe is the smart kid who is a irritating kid who messup plans of the adults. \
Asahina Satoru her right hand man a mess murdering kid who see rats nothing more as a killing objects. \
This Anime had a really nice concept were in the future people gain mind like abilities from the X-men able\
          \
        to fly for a short distance, create fire and defy gravity or create mirrors out of nothing. \
Yet what this show focus on are lame story arcs like kids having miss controls of their powers unconditionally and then adult thinking they might posses a danger so they decided to kill them off  but not in the expense of hiring a Cat to Stalk them and giving them a day to know that someone is going to kill them and then the kid just ran off out of the town making it more difficult to kill him.  I mean if a person had powers they should be able to kill a kid right? \
To murdering the 2 main characters friends and failed badly at it resulting in them copulating and having a child who ended up thinking that she was a rat and then helping them in the war against humans and killing of most of the humans with powers like flies. \
To showing an arc about a friend who has lost control of his powers only to be then erased out of their memories and then being named X and then just left in the dust not sure even why they even made the character in the first place. \
To having the first character being bad at using her powers and then the next day get no screen-time only to find that she is dead and the adults had killed her and their memories erased..... \
 To a huge war killing alot of people and the stop this mass killing kid on the lose use a distraction and then stop her heart using there powers and then end of story. \
the main characters get married and give birth to a child.... yet i honest see no point of it they saved no one ???? and the world was the same just that the rat army or race where all killed off and put in the museum  \
\
also the writer decides something things more unique to make it hard to kill humans by having a \"Death feedback\" or Curse which prevents people from killing each other. making it seem really uncalled for and really a waste of time to watch since in the end if your not thought about it you can just kill everyone like at the end of the war arc. The show also don't feel futuristic more old and spiritual with people living upto 260 years old but uses bio chemistry to keep her young and then have no purpose in the story development at all.   \
In the episodes all these random things happen and to much argument for no reason. There would suddenly be a war outside the village where human like rats live and the main characters would just happen to be there and help kill the enemies for them which this rat was smart enough to ask 2 kids with \"god\" like powers to do. \
whats worst is that they are more dangerous then human in terms of numbers and they are probably much smarter since human who created weapons decided to throw it away and no just keep it for a rainy day. apparently no government exist and they fell isolated in there own town.    \
\
whatever you do DO NOT WATCH IT i think most people here just review thinking that it is something that they are not used to watching or out of their comfort zone but for the sake of your life and time don't waste your time there are much better shows out there and more meaningful to watch  \

    I wanted to write a review on this anime to encourage those who check it out, say \"meh\", and move on to give it a chance. \
ART: I have seen this anime a dozen times on tumblr with the tag \"scenery porn.\" And it is that. The scenery is so gorgeous that it's almost distracting. Heck, no almost about it: it IS distracting because it's beautiful and abstract (in a good way). The setting is Eden-esque, throwing you into a future era in a seemingly perfect world. \
While the character design is definitely different, so much work was put into the animation of the characters\
          \
        that you'll learn to love it. \
The anime is very different from the manga in terms of the way the content is presented and the art work itself. \
\
CHARACTERS: What I like about these characters and the way the anime is presented is that it really puts you in their heads. A big black cloud of murder isn't really scary (Lost aside), but when you're made to feel the same terror as the characters by seeing and hearing what they're experiencing both real and imagined, it makes you clamor for the next episode. \
Time skips abound! We get not one but two time skips (as of episode 20), three if you count the narrator's setting who is telling the story of her past history. \
\
STORY: Starts out a little confusing. They immerse you in the world of these characters and expect you to just go along with it without every little detail being explained to you. I like that. I'm not a fan of anime where explanatory exposition takes precedence and the characters are like:\
A: I have to tell you something important.\
B: Something important?\
A: About this world. \
B: This world? This one right here?\
A: Yes, the one that we live in. \
B: The one we live in...\
A: Yeah. You're going to get some super powers and be the leader of this world we live in.\
B: Powers? Me?!\
Ugh. Which is why even the exposition and dialogue heavy episodes of this show are enjoyable. They don't treat you like an idiot and they know conversations don't really happen like the above mentioned. \

    I'm writing this seconds after finishing the anime. Through tears of not quite joy and not quite sadness. Let me start off by saying that, it took everything I had not to already write this review 9 episodes in... because honestly by the 6th episode I was 100% sure that this was in fact the best anime I'd ever seen, and would become my all time favorite. Now that I've said that, I'll start the review.\
Okay, so the story. I honestly have no words. If you're into philosophy and the question of human morality when it comes to not only us, but other species.. well,\
          \
        honestly this anime beats them all. Every episode made me \"wow\"... It's not so much because the ideas are unique, but rather beautifully executed. It felt like each episode inspired me in my own writing imagination. It has a somewhat Gulliver's travels idea to it in a morality sense (but I won't spoil it more than that). Other than that, everything about the time-period was executed beautifully.. and in 25 episodes you somehow got an amazing story with so many different layers, that never felt like there were holes in the plot. Each episode felt like it lasted 3 minutes, and I couldn't wait to see the next one. It was jam packed, yet flowed evenly, and managed to never feel rushed.\
Art. So some people might dislike the art, but I think that the way it's drawn is necessary for the type of anime it is. I loved it, and it had a lot of really beautiful backgrounds and scenes.. and the way the characters moved was very free and loose.\
Sound. Soundtrack was amazing.\
Character: While some characters didn't get as much spotlight, the show wasn't trying to fool you. You knew who the main characters were, and you knew which characters influenced them and why. You really saw them grow in the time skips.. and spoiler: there were points where you felt like you knew why THEY were the main characters when seeing other characters in certain later episodes. Every character had a really different personality. Also, idk if anyone else noticed their resemblance to the original group in digimon, but I did. haha.. Either way, you really felt for the characters and didn't feel like the writers were lying.\
Overall, this anime had everything I've ever wanted in an anime. It would have made a great book too, I'm sure. It had action and romance and tragedy and some scenes that made you happy. It definitely wasn't a fun loving anime, but there were definitely points that touched me.. in a way that made me smile. This anime definitely isn't for anyone looking for just entertainment, because there is WAY more to it. If you're into animes that make you think, and wonder, while keeping you on the edge of your seat and guessing different outcomes... this is it. Also, it wasn't always so obvious who you were routing for, which made the relationships and viewpoints realistic. I wouldn't say it ends \"Happy\" but it ends how it's meant to end in the best of possible ways. Definitely not a sad outcome though depending on how it could have ended.\
10/10 would recommend. \

Watch fairy tail or Cuticle tantei Inaba for example – I watch ‘em both and I love them but they’re literally from a diferent realm.\
The plot appears to be quite simple if you read the resume in any anime related site, Some kids in a futuristic society discover some life threatening  secrets, but don't be fooled, you get sucked into\
          \
        the story more and more with every episode that goes on, as the story is really complex with detail.  \
This isn’t one of those in which you get the whole idea just with one episode, trust me. It isn’t.\
The thing that I think is brilliant about this plot, is the attention to detail. \
Everything is well explained and somehow connects withg the story in the end. They have  a proper background history – emperros and previous empires, some mythology – which is proven not to be as mythological as the story develops – and a – freakishly - well structured  society. And is that society that happens to be the core of all this. I’m trying really hard not to spoil any of it, but let’s just say that in this anime we watch the consequences of trying to get an utopical society.\
Character-wise, the main characters mays start as kids but they all experience this sudden growth, that obviously has it’s price in some cases. As the story develops, Saki stands out more and more becaus of her curious ways, that arent that good in a society based in secrets.\
You can get moved for even a secondary character that appears in only one episode, because every character is portraied as human as possible.\
The Soundtrack really helps getting in your head with those whimsical songs and all those cliffhangers which I'm pretty sure gave me some white hair while I ha to wait to see the next episode a full week.\
Other thing about shinsekai Yori - and actually the thing that makes me love it the most - , is that you end each episode thinking about human nature. It really makes you think about ethics and how far can society go to achieve na image of perfection, passing all the possibilities implied with genetic manipulation. It’s really hard to explain it without spoiling it, but mainly that’s it. an anime that really makes you think.\
I'm no anime expert, even though I've watched some over the years, but I can guarantee you that this is the best anime I've seen EVER.\
I think I'll rewatch it some times. that's how much I'll love it.\
So, if you find the review even remotely appealing, go and watch the anime, I’m pretty sure you’ll love it too.",

    Shinsekai Yori was definitely not what I was expecting.  For whatever reason, I thought I was getting into a slice of life/high school anime, but ended up with something quite unique and very dark.\
It all starts off with the characters being a part of a school that helps students control their psychokinetic powers.  As the story goes, questions about their society appear to surface along with its history.  From the perspective of Saki, we join her as she begins to wonder about these questions herself.\
As mentioned before, the story is pretty dark.  It all appeared wonderful on the outside, but the\
          \
        closer you get to the truth the more \"unique\" the world got.  The execution of the story was handled really well.  You never quite know what to expect next for their world was quite different from our own.  A lot can happen in a millennium.\
I found most of the characters were okay, but Saki and some of the other characters along the way really steal the show.  Saki is a very likable protagonist because she is a good person at heart and cares deeply for her friends.  She isn't some hero with super powers, but she tries her best.\
The other characters Saki encounters are also very interesting and help provide more detail about the world they live in and how different it is to the world Saki thought she knew.  Since we are interacting with these characters through Saki's eyes, we tend to not know what is going on in their heads for Saki has no idea either.\
There are some parts that I did not like about this anime, but they aren't anything worth mentioning here and it would also reveal some spoilers.\
Those looking for a great mystery that is both dark and complex should check this out.  It gives you just enough information to keep you wanting to ask more questions while not withholding too much information.  The mystery doesn't last all the way to the end, but once all has been revealed, things start to get quite messy in a good way.  There also is a good amount of action and suspense that happens later in the series.\
Those looking for a quick horror/suspense anime should look elsewhere.  The story takes a long time to unravel and there happens to be a lot of dialog that might put some people off.  The overall mystery takes a while to build up and the action sequences don't happen for a little while.\
In the end, Shinsekai Yori was very enjoyable.  It might be slow starting at first, but once things start to get swinging, it provided a suspenseful experience that I haven't quite felt from the anime I've seen so far. Though, there are some that come to mind, but I won't get into that.\

    Shin sekai yori or as it is translated in English \"From the new world\" was controversial anime that aired in fall 2012. The first few episodes may not be to everyone’s liking (I didn't like it) but it was necessary to learn about the world they are in and learning about our main cast. People had drop this anime when it was airing but slowing people came back to watch it (Including me) after they heard great things about it. \
Story\
The story is about humans with abilities called cantus and how they are living their world. They are considered gods by the queer rats.\
          \
        This story revolves around racial, religion shrouded in mystery too interest the watchers. We will follow our main cast (especially saki) to see the decisions they make when they learned about humanity ancient history and they go on about it. There is a little bit of yaoi/yuri scenes ( like only in 1 episode or something) so if you can’t even handle a 1 second of it, then I ll advice you to not watch at all, so you won’t add an extra count in the drop section or give it a low score because of it.\
Art\
It took awhile for me to get used it because they characters looked like paper, so flat on the background but then I got accustomed to it and fond the art eye candy with vibrant bright colors to be very fitting to theme the story that it was presenting to us. They animation was great, it didn't seemed sloppy at all It wasn't any lacking great details or looked like some scenes were skipped.\
Character\
Each and every characters involved in the plot seemed very different from each other. that brings nice variety of cast together and make it overall seem appealing. Saki our main girl, she is a very bright child with a great future ahead of herself, she is considered the leader as she can make right decisions at times where its needed, looks out for others even though she isn't strong herself and getting full supported of her friends. we have a queer rat called Squealer the representative of the Robber Fly, he is very cunning and calculated with an ambition and goal in mind that he finds righteous. the last character I want to introduce is another more role rat but from an different race called Kiroumaru The supreme commander of the Giant Hornets colony. He is GAR as he risk his life to protect the main cast without hesitation.\
Enjoyment\
they tension was heavy watching this show, it was very intriguing and grabs you in, making you easily watch each episode as it only took like 10 minutes. They composition is good, it has that melancholy feel to it. The characters where interesting and feels legit as in the way they react too things or the decisions to make too survive in their crazy world\
Overall\
this show is master piece, a pure 10/10. I couldn't even think of something they could add too make this show even better, that's how great shin sekai yori is. I definitely recommend this too all people who love sci-fi, mystery and well developed plot.\

    Imagine a future where everyone has psychokinesis, the power to manipulate the physical using the mind alone. What kind of people would we become? How would a society run itself? What would be their greatest fears? The anime Shin Sekai Yori (From the New World) answers these questions in a terrifying series about such a utopia.\
Shin Sekai Yori is based on the novel under the same name by Yusuke Kishi. The anime tells the story in three distinctive parts in the life of Saki, the female protagonist. The first part introduces Saki and her friends as pre-teens, when they come across their ancient society’s darkest\
          \
        secrets by accident. The second part takes place in their high school years, when one is sentenced to death and two others run away. The third part tells the tale of the battle between humans and monster rats when Saki is an adult. Each part of this epic utopian tale reveals more of the future Japanese society accelerated a thousand years from now, where everyone has developed god-like powers through psychokinesis.\
As far as originality is concerned, Shin Sekai Yori continues to tell a similar theme among many utopian pieces of literature. Common themes in many utopian literatures include a person who questions the society’s rules, what the society’s authority does to protect their utopia, and ultimately what is resolved in order to maintain superiority over everyone else. Shin Sekai Yori touches on all of these themes while also bringing the element of referring to our present day as an ancient violent civilization that destroyed itself. Although the utopia that is set in this series is a lot smaller and appears more “feudal” than anything else, history repeats itself as the world faces the threat of humanity on humanity once again.\
Needless to say, Shin Sekai Yori also reveals a subliminal message on human nature itself with very familiar tones from other utopian storylines. The anime, for example, covers the very fears that drive the society to ensure their stability. Likewise, the very stability is shaken by an external power that abuses this fear to start a revolution, as was the case of the monster rats in the third arc of this anime. And yet, the conclusion of this tale leaves an audience (particularly me) with a sense of hope, yet dissatisfaction that anything was truly resolved by making a utopia in the first place. This is, once again, a very common theme in utopian art and literature.\
Shin Sekai Yori tells a very similar utopian story with a Japanese (specifically anime, in this case) perspective. It emphasizes the fears of a society to drive stability and ultimately has it torn down by the very rules they had created over their people. It leaves audiences to question whether our society alone is better or worse in today’s context. And above all, it tells the story with a very haunting musical score. That in and of itself probably kept me watching this series each week as it came out!\

    Too much time spent.\
A 25 episode series just for that short twist in the very very end is not worth it for me.\
Nothing else is noteworthy in the series. Animation, art, development - all meh. It seemed like they wanted to cater it to a gender neutral audience but I don't think they nailed it. Failed to attract me much.\
I was only interested in the setting and the premise; how this world came about, what was truly going on and such. At certain point I found the humans and main characters - especailly Saki, so very foolish.\

    Shinsekai Yori didn’t fail to flaunt the supernatural side right from the beginning. Introduced to what is assumed to be a split between two different kinds of people, those with powers and those without, the outcome is obvious when crooked smiles and killing sprees are all said and done. But what is done is done, and now there are groups of people who live to harness this new power. After all of the pilot, a third of which devoted to a purifying ritual and the other two-thirds to exposition and legends, I could safely say that much of the premise is up in the air,\
          \
        in complete secrecy. And boy, isn’t that engaging because there are quite a few terms that I’d like to discover as we progress. At least we know that Watanabe Saki (Taneda Risa — this seiyuu is growing on me fast) is in the club just by a hair and that she knows that not only are her friends keeping secrets from her but also her parents. And, that a Copycat is far different from a Tainted Cat. \
This is really a fantastic series and is a pretty underrated gem of the season. I gave it a 10 despite odd pacing at the start (which is why I assume most people dropped it early) after about the first 4 episodes it really takes off into a griping story of what's going on, and the MC's having to face something sinister looming in the background.\
The character development is perfect with a light romance element.\
I highly recommend this.\

    Shinsekai Yori is one of the most intelligent anime I've ever watched. The dialogue, the plot and characterization are all top notch. None of the main characters feel like flat cardboard cutouts. An example is how the main characters often debate about the motives of other characters, trying to predict what the next actions of other characters may be, and the right way to act so as to achieve their objective. Characters such as Satoru, Inui and Kiroumaru for example are very strategic in their thinking and almost everything they say and do is entirely rational. The plot is very good, logical and consistent. The\
          \
        plot is not particularly convoluted like in some detective stories, which is a good thing as it makes the story more easily checked - there are no loose ends that I could find, everything is neatly tied up by the time the anime finishes. \
Actually the main reason I watched this anime is because of the violent scenes involving psychokinesis. These are regrettably few and short. I would have preferred more and longer violent scenes. This is one of the few shortcomings of the series in my opinion, is that it shied away too much from violence and gore. Also the music isn't very good, like, I wouldn't listen to them outside of the anime. But the voice acting is okay. Saki can get annoying but then again she is probably the most emotional character in the series, if you ignore her and focus on the other characters you'll find the anime very enjoyable. And at the end of the story she becomes a conduit for Shun anyway, so at least she does something useful. There is some feudal allegories that may or may not be relevant in the modern world, depending on which perspective you look at things. Satoru says at the end that monster rats are not humans may or may not have significance depending on whether if you think that all homo sapiens are truly human or not. Mamoru and Maria having dun goof'd was probably the \"darkest\" part of the anime, plot wise, but really it could have be much worse, considering some things people have done in real life.\
All in all an excellent anime that I would recommend for anyone who likes an intelligent plot, intelligent rational characters, or violence (although there are only about 10 seconds of violence throughout the whole series added together, these scenes are admittedly pretty gratifying). \

    Shinsekai Yori\
Or To the New World. When you imagine how life moves and how we evolve, it's difficult to imagine the idea of chaos and entropy without experiencing it for oneself. Physics is order, biological structure is order, and humanity is based off of the idea of order. And at that point, we don't really experience/know we are experiencing chaos and entropy in our everyday lives.\
Nonetheless, we live. And that's what I found most interesting about Shinsekai Yori. It wasn't about a bad guy and for the greater good and all. \
It was about living.\
Animation: 8/10\
I'm starting off with the animation because this is what\
          \
        primarily shocked and awed me. My favourite part of all of this was the fact that many episodes of the anime differed in art. Many people are bothered by this, but the idea was that different staff were used for different episodes. And because different staff was used, it allowed for a different point of view of art design and character design. It provided so much more depth than any other. The only issue I had with this was that it felt a little rushed. The different styles brought amazing depth, yes, but at the same time, the episodes seemed a little choppy in animation. Despite all this, however, Shinsekai Yori is aggressively presented and experimented with new things constantly.\
Sound:10/10\
There really isn't much to say about the sound except that the soundtrack is friggin' awesome. It really fits the somber mood, and uplifts when it really needs to. But mostly, it hits the low notes of the anime especially well. I could fall asleep to this, but that would be a stretch because I would be scared cold imagining what's happening with their village and with the Demons.\
Characters: 10/10\
The characters popped out of the screen. There isn't much else to say but the fact that they were phenomenal. Character development was on point and each character played their own role in the story. And because they popped out so much, the emotional connection with the characters when one left or another died or another is confronted with a major issue was so extreme, I almost felt myself shaking after every episode.\
Story: 10/10\
In short, people die. People die a lot. In fact, Shinsekai Yori shows us how cruel the world can be. This anime is one of the most adventurous animes I have ever seen. And not adventurous as in there are adventures. People die. I commend To the New World so much for having the courage of killing off main characters and having some sort of reality. The whole anime focuses on the main female lead, Watanabe Saki. These deaths in her life not only feel like real deaths, but you can feel Saki. You can feel the isolation and you can feel the weight on her shoulders. And while progression is slow at first, near every event made me feel anxious for Saki. Every death and every moment made me want to tuck my face into my knees for Saki. There were points where the story just made me want to stop watching it because it is so well portrayed and so well tuned to impacting the viewer.\
Overall: 10/10\
Shinsekai Yori is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's not your fun anime. It's different. It's so different, the art, the characters, the incredible storytelling is almost flawless. Very few animes I've seen made me connect with the characters and the story they were telling this much. It's not often that we get an anime like this and it is truly underrated. Definitely on my must watch list. View discretion advised, however. There is blood. There is death. There is some pretty twisted stuff.\

    I really enjoyed this anime, for several aspects. What I think is the most important is the psychological aspect. But first I'm going to make a quick review of the graphics and music.\
Globally, this anime looks pretty good, and the graphics fit the theme of the anime : bright and colorful during the protagonists' childhood, but much darker when they start to understand how twisted the world they live in is. It also shows well the characters' confusion sometimes, especially during the last episodes. The music is really good and also fits the anime's atmosphere. \
Now let's talk about the plot. When you start watching this\
          \
        anime, you receive a lot of information, which can be confusing, but later it gets clearer. Yet some things are more implicit, thus can be a bit confusing. The characters and their relationship could have been more developed but they're still interesting. The plot itself is really well done, because you never expect things to go like they actually do, or you can only guess it at the last moment. It evolves with the characters and their discoveries. I really enjoyed the thriller-like atmosphere of the whole story. The fate of the group of protagonists is really tragic and brings a really sad feeling, which adds to the sadness of this world's condition. \
However, I could not give a 10/10 to this anime because of the ending. It's not all that bad, but really predictable, unlike the rest of the story, and for me it leaves a bitter taste of ignorance from the “new world's” humans. Maybe that's what was intended, but I expected a more nostalgic/melancholic ending that would, in my opinion, fit better with the whole atmosphere of the anime. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but for me it seems a bit weird. \
\
To conclude this review, I really liked this anime and it's among my favorites so far. I wouldn't recommend it for younger people though, as the psychological aspect is really dark, and makes the anime really mature. But if you like when animes make you think a lot, I really recommend this one. \

    There's no such thing as black and white; there are only shades of grey. I can't think of any anime other than Shinsekai yori that most accurately reflects these sentiments. \
I don't know what I can write here that hasn't been already said the majority of the reviewers, but I will try anyway. Looking at the picture cover of Shinsekai yori, I can guarantee you all that never would I have ever clicked on this anime in a million years if it wasn't for a feature article on MAL regarding the Top 15 Creepiest Anime, (or something along that line) and I'm so thankful that\
          \
        I did because I would've missed out on a real gem. \
It's rare finding an anime that so poignantly captures the socio-economic, psychological and identity issues facing our world that Shinsekai yori manages to accomplish in its short 25 episode series. The audience watches as Shun, Maria, Mamoru, Saki and Satoru all transition from youth to adulthood. For the number of time skips that goes through this anime, the transitions are smooth without even the slightest hiccup, it feels as if we grow along with them. Especially in the case of Saki and Satoru, the characters are very well-developed and are dynamic. Satoru, one of the main male protagonists, evolves from a head-strong, arrogant boy into an introspective, wise handsome man. \
Shinsekai yori touches on the interactions/dynamics between class, races and even other species -- complex societal problems that we face today even. Are we in an Elitist society today? Do other countries have the right to \"police\" a weaker nation? Are certain classes/groups still subservient to others in modern society? What is ethical? Do we value safety over our freedom? Shinsekai yori delves into these issues through its analogous representation between humans and the \"Monster Rats\" and well as the ethics behind people who have PK. \
Albert Einstein had once said, “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones,\" ultimately questioning the intensity and level that human power has reached -- the basic foundation of Shinsekai yori essentially. In my opinion a \"very good\" anime does not only provide high quality tension/suspense, thrill, mystery and subtle romance, but makes you think. As prone to anything well written, whether it is a movie, book, manga, comic etc. the purpose behind is what we can learn or take from watching or reading it: what have a gained from this piece? Shinsekai yori does not only do that, but more.\
If you like to think, this anime is definitely worth your time (essentially everyone, I hope).\

    Being this a futuristical story to begin with is arguable, since the feeling you'll get when watching this is as if going to the past, rather than the future. With no further delays, I will start with the review (beware: SPOILERS ahead):\
-Story (8/10): \
Shinsekai Yori takes place in a small area in Japan (what'd you expect?) about a 1000 years from now. After an era full of oppresive regimes, the people with special god-like psychokinetic powers (Cantus) manage to get peace isolating themselves with very strict rules. Peace? Haha, that's a good one. In fear of the chance of children with the Raman-Klogius syndrome (also\
          \
        called \"Fox in the Henhouse\" syndrome) becoming 'fiends' (abnormal beings that are able to control their powers freely, without their subconscious controlling how they use their cantus, and are additionally able to kill other human beings without ending up as a victim to death feedbacks) or children with the Hashimoto-Appelbaum syndrome becoming Karma Demons (Cantus users who have lost control over their abilities, and who leak their power to the outer world, causing deformations and mutations around it), the adults would dispose of children who didn't manage to activate their powers or with psicological problems, changing people's memories so they wouldn't even remember the existence of that person.\
In addition, there is this \"Queerrat\" population which seems to be 2nd most intelligent being on Earth, but (obviously) don't have the supernatural Cantus ability: therefore, they treat human beings as God's (actually because they don't want to be blown away and erradicated from the surface of the Earth).\
Anyway, enough explanation. To the main plot: We follow Watanabe Saki and her 5 friends as they grow up and end up knowing many secrets they shouldn't know. As Saki and Satoru get lost in the mountain in a school trip, they make contact with a more than clever queerrat (you will understand it when you see it), Squealer. The years go by and Mamoru (one of Saki's friends) realizes he's being pursued by tainted cat's (the town erasing system), deciding to leave the town.\
As the remaining group looks for him, they reencounter with Squealer, who by then has become a powerful queerat officer. Maria will stay with crybaby Mamoru and ask the others to go back to the village and report them as dead. Anyway. I'll save the end for you to watch, since it's quite shocking. Sorry about the spoilers you've read.\
The speed of the story is quite different during the series. While the beginning is quite slow, slowly the pace will start increasing, reaching a rather satisfying level.That being said, you have interesting parts, boring parts, and a special part where you'll ask yourself why the hell they even introduced that detail, since it was rather unnecesary (up to you to discover).\
There were absolutely no flashbacks, fillers or unnecessary fanservice, which in this genre is perfect.\
Another remarkable detail is that you can't really say that the villains are actually villains and the goodies actually goodies. I ended up sympathizing with the 'villains'.\
-Characters (8/10):\
This part was quite interesting. Most characters experience a psychological change (a BIG one in another sense), and since the story is being told form their childhood, their background is quite complete too. However, some characters (especially Saki) are too rigid and have too high moral standards, which can turn quite annoying.\
Especially the 'villains(?)' have an interesting mind setup. They will sometimes look like goodies, and others they'll be the biggest baddie in the whole series (and the other way round).\
-Art (7/10):\
Studio: A-1 Pictures. \
While the landscapes are overall well-drawn and put up into screen, the people's designs we're too superficial. They all looked the same especially the eyes). Also, the colours were too thick.\
-Sound (8/10): \
There was no OP, which for some people can result into a turn down. Personally, I always skip them, so this part was no problem for me. The BGM matched good with the scenes. \
The voice acting, with a couple of exceptions (i.e. Mamoru), was well done, as usual. Looks like in this series they weren't half sleeping.\
-Enjoyment (8/10):\
There were some chapters were I was bored to death, but in others I was on the edge of my seat (well, actually on the edge of my bed). Overall I enjoyed the show, although the end was rather shocking.\
-Overall (8/10):\
Do I recommend this? Certainly, I do. Although the beginning is slow and will remind you of animes such as Nagi no Asukara (or something like that), the story is very catchy and well set up. \
Hope this helped you make up your mind. Thank you for your attention.\

    Written with a more sceptical approach and my own opninion for all those having doubts about picking this anime up.Also first review so have mercy.\
Story,(7)\
Shinsekai yori is a about society that has been formed in the future after makind has fought many wars. More specifically it tells the story of saki and her friends as they come to age and the dark and twisted secrets they encounter along the way.\
Art,Sound.(9),(8)\
The show is pretty artistic and the animation pretty fluid, as far as the sound goes it matches the tone of the anime but the action scenes mostly contain the same soundtrack which isnt neccesarily bad\
          \
        but maybe a bit boring.\
Characters.(6) \
character develepoment is pretty smooth even though there are some holes here and there that probably should be there but i found it very hard to empathize with any of them and i was left kind of emotionless.I was unable to identify myself with any of them.\
Overall,(7)\
Even though the story is pretty good and everything fits into a piece it just didnt touch me like it did most other people and even though i enjoyed the anime it felt really mediocre.No feelings of excitement ever arose as i watched it to the end it was only interesting due to the nature of the theme.\

    This is my first formal review that I have ever written for an anime, so excuse me for anything that I get wrong\
Story:10\
\"Bildungsroman-literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood\" This is the best way for me to describe the layout of this anime. The anime has three distinct parts that one can split it up into, and they explore the following: The protagonists Childhood, Teenage years, and their Adult life each and every part of there story has some relevance behind it, with the later parts of anime drawing reference to the story that happened\
          \
        near the start. Due to the fact that we are growing up with the Characters in this mysterious world, we as the viewer are experiencing the world that they live in at the same pace as the characters, in the beginnings of the anime this is more noticeable, since we are exposed to the mystery's of the world and we have the same knowledge of the world as they do, allowing us to relate to these characters, since we do not feel that anything is being kept from us in the sense of characters opinions and feelings and thoughts about the world. In the grand scheme of things the story has  a variety of twists and turns with a huge revelation at the very end (Which if you where observant like me you can figure it out within the first 10 episodes like I did :D)\
Art:\
The art style from Shinsekai Yori is truly a unique one in terms, the characters, and it features an art style that i have never really come across, the way that it blends faded colours with bright vivid colours, always kept me hooked. The vast scenery that is shown also doesn't disappoint with it having some of the best anime views that I have seen.\
Sound:\
There is not much that one can analyse in the sound department other than the soundtrack, and I must say that it sure as hell delivers, the OST mixes Japanese Folk music, with contemporary electric guitar magic, and it never fails to stimulate you in the right way when the mood dictates. The OST itself truly captivates this sense of epicness and grandeur that shinsekai yori exhales within every frame.\
Character:\
Every character that is present serves a specific purpose, and you will find yourself becoming rather attached to them since they all have rather unique personalities. Straying from the main 5, you will find that the other sub characters are vastly intricate and unique, and have some very unique and crazy personalities, this vast variety and depth of characters is what makes the world of shinsekai yori feel so... polished.\
Enjoyment:\
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and was captivated by the world that the creators has placed me in, Not much to say in this regard\
Hope you enjoyed my review ^_^ \

    *Be patient and you will be rewarded in so many ways*\
--Shinsekai Yori is a very well thought,slow paced \"god\" tier story.Followed by a throughout thought plot ,many many twist to satisfy every kind of curiosity and almost every viewer who will watch as many as the first 3~4 episodes.Moreover for a sci-fi its really realistic !!\
-- The Art animations i \"godly\" and shitty at the same time, it has its own small details and other interesting stuff. What im trying to point out is that the art is ridiculously fits the show but some times there are those scenes really badly made, which stand out...\
          \
        (i guess we forgive them??)\
--Another thing this show uses some metaphoric scenes(some are really poorly made  T_T) in order to explain some mysterious situations and pass some really deep messages which is something particular and worth praising!\
--The horror comes rather late but its there together with that \"smell of death\" around every corner.Nothing is granted,suspect everything!Another notable fact is that this show really knows how to close an episode properly.Like you can say cliffhangers always waiting at the end of each episode.\
--The music is well made and fitting to the show and kinda memorable.\
--Characters are kinda cliche if you ask me nothing really worth praising or mentioning. Its one of those shows you just cannot evaluate it.Same goes for their development. ITS Surely there but cannot judge if its good or bad... most likely its bad tho..\
------------------------Weaknesses and personal opinions------------------------------------\
-To begin with, this show is like a new world and it calls for you to explore it.Although, the anime itself keep a low profile and share information slowly(thus slow-paced).The thing is that it advances on its own giving even more new things and the it has about 7~10 mins explanation scenes...Well if that wasn't enough most of the times you get half the answer. By that i mean it explains only a portion of its \"new issue\" in order to keep you hooked in and with the hope that it will be explained later...In the end 40% of the questions remain...The MC is kinda... useless like 24/7 ...(who cares tho?) but the worst in the end it contradict itself...I mean imagine a WHOLE thing is happening for a reason but you just ignore the reasonat the end...Imagine doing \"important\" stuff without a reason(perfectly eplained)... WTF??!!\
--Small example.It promotes bisexuality based on that world's rules but the sad thing is that this will trigger a series of events...Why sad?? Of course because in the end you will never learn why bisexuality was promoted. It was just a plot device without sense . Just to climax our curiosity and fuel our big urge for answers.... \
--Last small notice there is some \"timeskip\" which is not so bad... Just except that between that skipped time nothing happened. Just daily routine i guess for... 10 years or something?\
--And it has that magical moment when something impossible happen...(worth mentioning that shitty moment exist)\
In my opinion this is a really great anime , well thought, memorable and very enjoyable.There are so many plot holes and questions remaining in the end...For me its an 8/10...\
Just take a note every time you have a serious question...tbh my note had 15 questions and only 9 were answered by the end.I recommend it to everyone , it is something you won't regret and it can easily trick you into thinking of it as a masterpiece\
Reasons to watch it:\
-Its actually a mystery and has some romantic touches!\
-Well written god tier story!\
-Thrilling and intense af most of the times!\

    Let’s start with the facts—stories focusing on the future of our civilization are HUGE, and more and more are popping up every day. There’s just something about imagining what awaits us in the future that appeals to us, that keeps us interested enough to continue to consume story after story that helps us do exactly that. \
Whether it be admiring our future technological achievements, marveling at the drastic changes brought onto our environment by the continued activity of humans, or simply watching people ride on hoverboards and wear self-tying shoes, we continue to be enamored by the glorious future that awaits us.\
However, even more intriguing\
          \
        to us are stories that show the dark side of our future—the wars that may be fought, the atrocities we may commit, and the warped society that humanity may mold from our current advanced civilizations. While stories about the future are huge, as I said above, stories about a *dystopian* future are even bigger, both enchanting and horrifying us in displaying not the glowing civilization which we aspire to become, but the dark future we fear may become a reality.\
This is where Shinsekai Yori—From the New World--comes in. While all of the tags commonly used to describe it fit very well it is, in the end, a dystopian story. Taking place in Japan 1,000 years from the present, we are shown a peaceful, loving society of psychic humans that operates flawlessly, allowing for each of its members to live happily and freely.\
However, this is just the surface. Beneath the stable and well-kept façade of the villages, in which children obliviously hone their psychic abilities while living peacefully, dark secrets lie, and slowly rise to the surface as the series progresses. Children who do not fit the mold disappear, quickly forgotten to all normal members of the civilization. Cantus, the “power of the gods”, comes with more risks than any of our characters could have ever realized. Wars are fought. Friends are lost.\
As the story goes on, we are time and time again shown that things are nowhere near as peaceful as we had originally thought. To keep even the frail peace that exists in their society, tough choices must be made, and at times even our own morality must be tossed aside to ensure the survival, and happiness, of the greatest number of people. In order to ensure survival, great sacrifices must be made.\
I won’t spoil the story for you—I firmly believe that Shinsekai Yori is something that should be experienced with no outside knowledge of the events which unfold—but I will say that this tale is unique. In a sea of dystopian stories about government control, humans subjugating humans, and control over our very thoughts, Shinekai Yori manages to stand out, all while utilizing many of these tropes itself. This is managed both through the elaborate world of the series and, most importantly, through the characters.\
The story focuses on Saki, an average but emotionally resilient young girl with a desire to know the truth, and her group of friends: Satoru, a happy and loyal boy with a knack for making trouble, Maria, an emotionally-driven girl who is very good at attracting others to her side, Mamoru, a shy, trusting boy enamored with Maria, and Shun, an introspective young man who is naturally gifted in the use of his Cantus. \
Through these five characters, we are introduced to the inner workings of this world, from the Sage school where they learn to control their Cantus and how to fit into their society, to their interactions with the environment and the intelligent-yet-subservient “Queerats,” whose purpose is to labor under humans, their “gods.” As these children grow and uncover the dark secrets of their society, all while weathering their own personal struggles and navigating the intricate social landscape of adolescence, we learn as well, and slowly discover the true nature of their world.\
The music and artwork of this series only serve to further deepen the world of Shinekai Yori, taking us from contemplative to fearful to mysterious at just the right moment. Personally, I feel they fit perfectly within the context of the show, and led us from secret to secret and revelation to revelation seamlessly.\
To end my review, I want to focus on what I feel, above all else, made Shinsekai Yori work: Its focus on humanity. In a world where everyone has access to unimaginable power—power enough to completely eradicate entire cities of normal humans (or entire colonies of queerats), how do we remain human? What, in the end, constitutes humanity? Is it possible for humans to live together peacefully, or will we inevitably turn to violence, and pain? These are the questions that Shinsekai Yori raises, and attempts to have us answer. \
Shinsekai Yori is set in a dystopian society and, refreshingly, the entire story takes place in that dystopian society, and our characters are forced to simply make do within it. The focus of Shinsekai Yori is not to dismantle the current world and create a new one, but to begin the process of transforming our world, through constant effort and with the belief that we CAN get better, and that we will. \
Shinsekai Yori is truly a one of a kind story, and one I believe everyone should at least give a chance. In fact, this story was so unique that it prompted me to write my first review, which I hope you enjoyed. Thank you for reading, and remember:\

      text = "Everything is not what it seems. That could not be any truer if you look at the cover of this anime and then you witness the shocking events that follow. If you’re looking for a light-hearted escape from the confronting issues of real life then this is not your anime. \
This anime is a mystery, sci-fi fantasy that takes place in the world 1000 years in the future. We follow a group of kids, Shun, Mamoru, Satoru and Saki, the protagonist. We’re introduced to Saki entering the Unified Class, a place where the children. after their powers have manifested improve their control over them by\
          \
        doing tasks such as tournaments and group team building skills. When the group goes to summer camp, they find a source that provides them the shocking history of how their community and the many rules around it came about. As the secrets behind the classmates that mysteriously go missing and the motives and histories of the monster rat colonies are unravelled, Saki and her group find themselves entrenched in the complications which they were given the ‘privilege’ and free will of being a part of by their community. \
I was very perplexed and frustrated throughout the duration of this anime because things are revealed in little increments, thus at points, you’re left questioning the significance behind the events which are hard to understand. Everything does become monumentally clear in the last half of the anime, but one must have the patience to be engaged with the storyline and the characters till that point. My patience was wearing quite thin until I reached that point, simply because I felt that the emotions of the group of kids and the society were quite muted and hard to relate to. \
The plot is detailed and intricate, it is only the character development that seems lacking. The group must sacrifice many things to uphold the community that they come from, thus the very fact that they seem to lose the ability to question the motives and foundation of that community left me quite flabbergasted at times. The world building, including the colonies of the monster rat communities and other monsters was the most outstanding aspect of this anime. We are shown the monster rats as meek and cowardly when they require rescuing, as feral and rabid in the throes of war and cooperative and altruistic when we meet Yakomaru/Squealer. As we see many sides to the rat communities, after we get past their unnerving appearance, it’s hard to know how to feel about these creatures. We learn that the community has great control over the minds of the individuals, thus we begin to question whether the group is acting because of how they really feel, or due to the fact that their memories have been altered by the leaders of the community.\
As their memories are warped, the unity of the group feels like a fragile and sometimes non-existent thing. The connections between the characters which showed promise at the start are tested by the many trials that they face involving the monster rat colonies and their own community. After learning the truth behind the manipulative nature of their community, the fact that the group goes about their daily lives once returning seemed unbelievable. Though the time jumps in this anime should have increased the connection viewers had with the characters, I feel that the relationships became way more artificial and the characters grew more callous. Many sacrifices are made within the group, yet the fact that their faith to their community and conducting the actions that are lain out for them doesn’t seem to waver had me pulling at my hair in frustration, many times. \
We have many contenders in this game of power and we, like the group are left questioning who to trust and who has something else brewing beneath the surface of their friendly face:\
We have the leader of a rat colony, Kiroumaru. the leader of the ethics committee, upon which the rules are founded, Tomiko and the leader of another rat colony Squealer/Yakomaru:\
It’s especially hard to determine who to side with as each of these individuals appears to help the group at one point or another. \
This series explores the nature of war. The fact that war is not about allowing our conscience take the wheel, it’s about doing anything and everything to ensure the survival and prosperity of the individuals own side. War is not conducted with reason. it’s conducted by people’s bloodthirsty desire for power and superiority. Most of the time, there is no logic or humanity behind acts of war. It is up to the power of the suppressed conscience to determine how far an individual can go to get what they want.\
The final twist at the end was one that I partially saw coming, though felt right in it’s ability to wrap up the show. This is a story about sacrifice, morality, power and the consequences of not questioning what has been planned for you by those around you. This anime concludes on a bittersweet note, leaving you with an uneasy, yet hopeful feeling. If you’re willing to go on a confusing, yet thought provoking journey, then pick up From the New World.\

    Shinsekai Yori has to be one of my favorites of all time. In fact, it is not only one of my favorites, but sticks out like a sore thumb among my top shows filled to the brim with anime directed by Shinbou, Ikuhara, and Yuasa. So why this show among all others would break into my favorites? Well, as it turns out, director Ishihama worked on the Tatami Galaxy which was directed by Yuasa. His influence bleeds into the show, despite it not being a story that really fits with a surrealistic style. Ishihama manages to blend in many similar aesthetic choices from Tatami Galaxy\
          \
        into the show. In fact, one of the best episodes in the show is probably the most similar to Yuasa's work. Despite this, the lack of budget definitely shows at times, but it doesn't detract at all from the show due to Ishihama's strong directing. I give it a solid 8/10 for artwork.\
The music is quite fitting for the show, and has major effects on the tone. I felt like I was in the settings where the story took place. Despite that, there are no real stand out songs, excluding the ED, Wareta Ringo. Speaking of the ED, the animation is quite fantastic and aesthetic is even more similar to the Tatami Galaxy in it. I give the sound a 8/10.\
Many people like to claim that the characters in the show are bland. I disagree. Due to being a novel adaption (Not a light novel, but an actual novel. With words.), it is a more mature story than most anime. Because of this, the characters are much less exaggerated, which may be off-putting to some people, who would rather have characters be characterized very directly by the show, which i consider a fault in the medium of anime. In most novels, characters i characterized by their peers and their actions, rather than the narration. Now there is a problem with the characters in this show. They simply aren't constructed as well as in the novel. Just reading the first chapter of the novel changed my view of Saki by quite a bit. I think if she was given more of a role in narration, the show would have benefited. I give the characters a 9/10.\
If I've given the show 8's and 9's for all other categories, how in the world can I give it a 10 overall? Well that's because of the story. Where do I even start with this? The story is incredible. It tells a very human (hehe) story from all sides of the major conflict, while still showcasing excellent world building which also functions as a mystery which drives the characters into the conflict itself, rather than infodumping absolutely everything at once (there is one infodump though). The anime ended strong, rather than rushed like most other shows, not to mention the falling action made me reflect on what happened. Not only did I reflect much on the show itself, but also on how it changed who I was as a person, which is the mark of a truly great story. Needless to say I gave the story 10/10.\
Because of how different SSY was compared to most anime I enjoyed it very much. A 10/10 for enjoyment, and a 10/10 overall. I would recommend this show fully. I look forward to future works by this director. Hopefully, great things come from him after a promising first show.\

    It starts out as the seemingly typical dystopian story, where horrible events prior result in a complete reworking of the social order. As per usual, the narrator hints at a hidden menace festering within this newly established society, and the audience automatically expects an impending change. But while it does go the way of similar stories in that the status quo is revealed to be warped at best and sinister at worst, the story and narration possess several elements that elevate Shinsekai Yori.\
Story-wise, it does not merely utilize the evil society versus select group of special individuals trope. It’s not as simplistic as that. It\
          \
        shows that even in a social group there exist factions with different, sometimes competing, ideals and objectives. And often the same thing can mean different things to different people, creating conflict and imbalance. The characters have different ideas about progress and what it takes to sustain that progress. They have different ideas about freedom, justice, and equality. \
This approach does the story good as it precludes the unnecessary, overly dramatic vilification of the characters. Here, you don’t have straight up, uncomplicated good and evil. You have people who are weak, terrified, angry, desperate, hopeful, determined, protective, bigoted, maniacal. And all these varying wants and emotions create the tensions in the story. \
There isn’t just one side against the other. It’s about a multilayered society the interpretation of which depends on the context you choose to view it in, depends on the character whose eyes you choose to look through. Shinsekai Yori does a good job of exploring the psyche of the individuals who occupy the different aspects of this new world while simultaneously establishing the part they play in the grand scheme of things, the consequences and resulting realities of their actions and decisions. \
The narrative style lends further strength. By making effective use of subtlety and contrast, it creates a story that feels progressively anxious and foreboding. First through the choice of narration, then through the contrast between the past and present societies, and last through the actions of the characters versus the reaction of the viewer. \
Instead of adopting a third-party POV, the viewer is immediately thrust into one of the main character’s perspective of events. The story’s main timeline is from when the narrator was much younger, so the narrator adopts a tone that is older and seemingly wiser, a direct contrast to naivety and innocence of the events she is relating and the people she and her friends used to be. This treats the viewers to the dual sensations of an adult’s misgivings and the insistence and folly of youth. And because the narrator implies that the misgivings are valid, the tension is even more taut, as the viewers are unable to do anything but go along for the ride, all the while knowing that something terrible will indeed be happening.   \
There is also the contrast between the urban, technologically-advanced past society and the rural backdrop of the present society. It is later shown how this conscious decision to forgo technology and commercial progress poses certain disadvantages.\
Another contrast also exists between how casually the characters react to and experience violence, and the violence itself and the viewers’ perception of it. There is a marked disconnect between the two. The characters see nothing wrong with it, they treat it us a matter of fact, while the viewer is forced to simultaneously react to the violence and recalibrate his or her moral compass to adapt to the characters’ world normalized bloodshed and slavery.  \
Everything makes for an ominous, nail-biting journey disguised beneath a misleadingly subdued narrative. The tension and horror isn’t brought to the viewer via extreme gore and violence, as is typical of many “dark” anime nowadays. In Shinsekai Yori, said tension and horror build as the viewer understands more about the world and the characters. It is a horror that stains and lingers far more effectively because it wasn’t arbitrarily imposed, it was planted and coaxed inside the viewers, and grew with the story and their understanding of it.  \
I can’t recommend this anime enough. \

    From the New World (Shinsekai Yori) is a dark story full of mysteries. It will keep you guessing and leave you with plenty to think about. The material is heavy, and its pacing is on the slow side. That said, it's worth the effort.\
The main hook of the story is in its gradual revelation of the state of the world 1000 years after psychic powers appear in humans. The opening episodes show, in small, unnarrated introductory snippets, that things got bad, but the key details are left out until an infodump in episode 4; after the \"ground rules\" of the history are established, the remainder\
          \
        of the story is focused on present-day problems and people trying to solve them - with a few secrets left until the end. We follow a group of children as they grow up and lose their innocence, in all senses of the word. Along the way we discover everything that went wrong. Despair for a hopeless situation permeates most of the scenario, yet the conclusion still manages a mildly, reservedly optimistic view. \
If you are watching this, it's for the story, more than anything else. Anime stories that successfully deal with something this complex and nuanced do not come along often, and to no surprise, the story comes from a novel adaptation. Themes of class struggle, othering, and uncontrolled power feature prominently. The main characters, despite being powerful psychics, often find themselves unwitting pawns in some scheme, with their lives in danger.\
As one might expect from a TV anime adapting a full novel, animation falls into a secondary role, and A-1's treatment has some occasional dips in visual quality, budget-saver stills, abstract visuals, etc. These things don't interfere greatly with the story's tension, which is built up similarly to series like Kino no Tabi or Mushishi - quiet, with punctuated moments of violence. It shows enough to stir the imagination and leave you hungry for more. No filler OP is used - it cold opens, shows a brief title, and then proceeds, so you're getting longer episodes than is the norm. The audio works in an effective complementary role, cuing in the viewer to a possible deception with every little remark, but leaving the answers until much later.\

    Shinsekai Yori. This has become my favorite anime (possibly above Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB)) because unlike FMAB, I felt like I earned my entertainment. Sure, FMAB was awesome in plot and everything. I was thoroughly entertained by not having to spend so much effort. But I am more like Shensekai Yori (not I like it more, but I \"AM\" more like) because I am a product of hard work. When I work hard at a goal and acheive my goal, I feel great. Similarly, when I had to think with effort in order to understand the subtle details and question of Shinsekai Yori, I felt\
          \
        great.\
From the New World. At first, I had no clue how the title related to the anime. I asked myself questions such as \"are these people not from this world?\" during the first episode, looking for clues. Let me tell you now, this is how you are supposed to watch this anime: by asking questions to yourself. It's not the kind of anime to \"look at\". Thinking is our ability to make this anime into the masterpiece it is.\
I like how the story moves from place to place and from time to time, giving a bit of motion. Although the beginning is what some would call \"slow\", I feel like that it a subjective necessity. The middle and end of Shinsekai Yori are so impactful and eventful, that the beginning does feel slow. But the beginning brings so much. In addition to the contrast, it reveals very important information on the history, facts and opinions of the world. I say opinions because, as mentioned earlier, we have to think in order to make it good. Listen to the voice of the narrator. Does it sound like some one we know? They say that the victors write history, so history is mainly just an opinion with many small facts. \
The themes that continue throughout the show make sense and fit with the atmosphere. Shinsekai Yori has a very tense atmosphere, and this makes for a very on-the-edge-of-your-seat experience. I always felt that something bad was going to happen to some character, and not many anime can give me this feeling, since all the main characters have their \"special abilities\" of immortality and always winning at the end, given to them by the author. The mature themes of death, active expression of homosexuality (all kinds of sexuality are mature) and others contribute to this dark atmosphere.\
Death plays a major role as being the solution to \"problems\". Anything that the adults and elders of the community fear will be \"solved\". The homosexuality actually has a serious role that does not involve light fanservice. Mentioned in the earlier episodes, the information that the humans we are looking at are genetically modified to be a bit more like the \"Bonobos\" (sexual monkeys) and have some new DNA to solve other problems. Bonobos embrace each other sexually whenever they start to feel stress or anxiety, and they disregard gender/sex. The big question is why, during the teenage stage, the characters start to be more homosexual? There are a few reasons. 1) They are still in school, and they still have to focus on learning. 2) If heterosexual behavior were approved, then it is possible that many more children will appear with teenage parents. Then, the naive teenagers may possibly do careless things such as leave it alone and let the Queerats take their child, who may do some crazy things like start a rebellion. 3) The producers want to emphasize this point, that these humans are very different from us, and the change in a few pieces of DNA (so that we're more like the Bonobos) will bring a new norm that will seem crazy to us. In my opinion, I think if the real people of today had a DNA change so that they would behave more like Bonobos, the authority will need a solution to stop the public sex and the intense population boom. Imagine every person who feels stress having sex with each other. I feel like the norm will definitely shift, if not to guided homosexuality, then to another solution at least.\
I love the fact that Shinsekai Yori has no OP and a great ED. The former allows us to jump straight into the action without interruption. The latter provides us with time to think about what just happened in to episode we watched (reflection is very important, as we get to analysis ourselves and all the possible answers we have). The ED has this great quality (being a person who enjoys great music) of silence in the right places. At the beginning of the ED, after each guitar lick, there is a whole beat (a QUARTER REST) of silence, which makes it absolutely amazing. At every point in time, music can either offer us sound or silence, and both are equally important.\

    This is my first review so I am not gonna write anything long . \
While I give this anime a rating of 8, I would recommend everyone to watch it .\
The emotional feed back and ideology are simply great and very difficult to be found in any other anime . \

Story\
The first few episode maybe difficult to go through if you are like me who wants something to grasp on . The series just builds up some difficult and inhumane actions the \"Humans\" conduct in-order to survive. A group of children try to find out about how their society came up to the current situation\

    I'm not going to write a long review here. In fact, I've never written a review for an anime before in my life, and I never planned to. But I felt the need to do so for this one. Shinsekai yori deserves it. It's been out for a while and I have never heard of it. I was bored so I decided to anime jump and downloaded about 8 full series of different shows to watch. Little did I know I had luckily come across the anime that would soon top my personal chart. \
Story- 10 - Shinsekai yori, is just phenominal. The story is\
          \
        unique and kept me hooked the whole time. I watched the entire show in one sitting and am now writing this review at 3 in the morning because I just can't get it out of my mind. I've seen multiple shows that have played their hand at making a story that bridges multiple years, in this case the story of 5 children all the way to their adulthood, but never has any been so successful at it as Shinsekai yori. The first time they made an age jump I was a little caught off guard but I was able to get back on quickly and other than that it was entirely flawless throughout the entire series. \
Art- 10 - I'm generally pretty lenient on art anyways so my opinion is usually pretty easy, but even I caught myself admiring the art at times in this show. While many anime give little effort into the background I found myself just as fascinated by the gorgeous backgrounds and scenery as by the story itself.\
Sound- 10 - What can I say, it was perfect. While a large majority of the sound is repeated throughout the anime, it isn't simply because it fits well, it actually has significance in the story and I found the sound itself continuously changing my mood and how I felt about what was happening. Again, I'm not great at reviews or explaining things, but you'll understand when you watch/\
Enjoyment-10- There hasn't been a show I've been this attached to in a long time. I've always put Clannad and After Story at the top of my anime list because they simply brought me into the story so well that I was severely depressed for quite a while because of it. While that might sound bad, I think that's what makes an story great. If it can actually make me so attached to the story that I feel like that world is more real for a little while than my actual world then it is truly a great anime. Shinsekai yori did just that. I'll admit, I was beyond attached. I was constantly trying to solve questions that arose throughout the series, I was left in shock, I was angry, happy, irritated. Name and emotion and this anime made me it at one point. Don't get me started on sad though, god my eyes still sting. As an 18 year old male I'm not at all ashamed to say that this show had me bawling my eyes out in the middle of the night and literally covering my face with my hands. Not to spoil anything, but, as any good story goes, there are some sad parts.\
Overall, yup, you guessed it, I'm giving it a 10 out of 10. I never even heard of this anime until I was watching it but it is no doubt my favorite anime and I'll recommend it to anyone I know. Regardless of what genre they prefer because I think enjoyment will be largely universal. Although to rehash something I had read elsewhere, it is said that some people drop this anime because of the small amount of yaoi/yuri scenes in it. Which honestly baffled me. I'm not even almost a fan of either but that didn't make me enjoy the show any less. In fact, that unique way this so called Utopian society works is truly intriguing and it does nothing but add more depth and uniqueness to the story. I literally cannot imagine anyone dropping this show once they've started. \

    If I had to describe this anime in a single word, that word would be \"different\".  It's difficult to compare this show to others, as it didn't feel overly similar to anything I've seen before, in anime or other forms of media.  There are some shows that share similar themes with From the New World, but for every way I could say this show is similar to another one I could probably think of at least one way in which they are different.\
This show features a world that is simultaneously utopian and dystopian.  A world in which telekinetic powers are considered the\
          \
        norm is maintained by standards that can be downright brutal.  There is a great deal of humans being treated poorly by other humans for the purpose of protecting society as a whole, and this does eventually lead to the deaths of pivotal characters.  Even when the show seems to shift focus into more familiar good guy vs bad guy fare, when all is said and done you can fully understand where the antagonists are coming from, and are once again reminded that the human society depicted has a ton of moral grayness to it.  Despite all of this, the show ends on the note that if we as people truly strive for it, we can make things better for everyone.  The show does an excellent job of showing the struggle of the characters in this society without ever seeming like too much of a downer or like its being emotionally manipulative.  All the while the show slowly reveals the mysteries of its world,being careful to not give you too much information at once and leaving you constantly wanting to keep going to learn more.  If the story has one shortcoming, its that it does seem to go kind of slowly every now and then.  A specific example of this is when several of the main characters were out on a snowy mountain looking for some of their friends.  A little more time than I would have liked was spent on showing shots of them searching with nothing really changing.  I also think that the beginning is somewhat slow, which can make it a bit difficult to really get into the show.\
I do feel there is one last story element some people may appreciate knowing before watching.  Sexuality between characters is explored and doesn't stick solely to the standard heterosexual couples.  The human race in this story has been genetically modified to use sexual contact as a way of coping with great stress, even among people of the same sex and even if the people involved are quite young for it.  This isn't a detail that is forced down your throat mind you, it is used quite sparingly and is never once used as an excuse to show explicit content.  I was fine with it, and I figure that most other people would be as well so long as they approach with an open mind. However, I do think it justifies a warning as I'm sure that there are some people who might not be able to be as accepting of this plot point.  \
Not to be outdone by the story, the presentation is also very well done.  Some of the visuals in the show are simply stunning; the show occasionally left me feeling like I was watching an expertly crafted painting in motion.  When the art wants to impress, it succeeds with flying colors.  The soundtrack is quite a somber one over all, which fits quite well with the story being portrayed.  This story may have originally been from a novel, but it's quite clear that a great deal of thought was put into translating the story into a visual and auditory experience.  \
Unfortunately, there are plenty of characters, and not all of them get as much attention as I feel they could have.  This is most likely due to the fact that the story had to juggle between developing characters and developing the world itself.  Plenty of time is given to the main character Saki as well as some of the antagonists.  On the other hand, we don't know about the lives of Saki's closest friends prior to their meeting at school.  I don't want to make it seem like the characters are bad though, they all have their own personalities and they stick to those personalities well.  I would have like a little bit more detail, but what we got worked well regardless. \
Ultimately, I would enthusiastically recommend this show (provided my warning didn't scare you away).  I would especially recommend this to anyone of the mind that the media has trouble coming up with anything new, as this story was extremely novel in my opinion.  It has shortcomings here and there, but they are so small in comparison to all of the things that From the New World does right. \

    This was a series that I had stumbled upon by accident and I was glad I did.  \
Shinsekai yori is one of several series that seems to just glide under the radar of the majority of the anime viewing community without really being noticed (or noticed, but for the wrong reasons).\
The show is set a thousand years in the future.  Human civilization has been destroyed several times and people now live in small isolated villages surrounded by barriers to keep out mutants and worse that roam the wilds beyond.  Humans have also developed the power to manipulate their environments with ease and\
          \
        materialize any object they would need with a thought, rendering technology obsolete.\
The story centers around a group of friends growing up in one of these villages who accidentally learn the truth of their origins and follows them as they uncover even more sinister truths about the world they live in.\
The story itself is quite good, though there are some parts that feel like they were just thrown in for the sake of adding a little more action, the show never assumes that the viewer is an idiot.  Any complex points of the show are given just enough description that the viewer can figure the rest out on their own as the story progresses.  \
The art style varies throughout the show with some of the mutants appearing more comical than terrifying.  Whether this was an artistic decision or a budget-driven one, I doubt anyone will ever know.  The animation is equally inconsistent with some scenes having very fluid animation while others are not.\
The characters are what make this show.  The core group are quite fleshed out and you can't help but become more and more attached to them as time goes by.  Their relationships with each other are handled very well and fit with the universe they live in.  Some of the main cast are openly gay and rather than exploiting that as an avenue for low-brow comedy, the writers portray these characters as normal people engaging in normal relationships. I found this to be a refreshing change from the blushing, flamboyant queens.  Naturally, this made some viewers uncomfortable.  \
Overall, I really enjoyed this show and recommend it to anyone who is looking for something a little different and can handle the occasional punch in the guts that this show delivers.  Great story, great characters, lightly seasoned with action and suspense.\

    This is arguably one of the best animes I've ever watched. Shinsekai Yori tells a story that completely blew away my expectations. To be honest, the description didn't interest me in the slightest but I decided to give it a try anyways due to how bored I was. As I started watching the first few minutes, I was already drawn in by that intro and kept me wondering about this world that is introduced as the future 1000 years from now. This story has a lot build up, so it starts a bit slow but picks up right before big events which kept me on\
          \
        the edge of my seat. Another thing I'd like to mention is that even though it is set 1000 years from now, it still seems very believable from the situations that occur to how humanity chooses to deal with it. The story has a powerfull message it sends in the ending (which I shall not spoil) that gets you thinking and sticks with you after you finish watching.\

    This is, hands down, the best anime I have ever watched.\
I will try to give nothing away for this review, so I will talk about why its great without getting into what the story is really about.  Since the anime is so well mapped out, and each episode ties in to the end -- there are no \"fillers\" and every moment in the show was well used from start to finish.\
Why is this anime great?\
First off, this anime reminded me of watching a very good book (or series of books), which is not surprising as that is exactly what it's based off of. \
          \
        Watching this anime made me think about half the reason I read books: The ability to really explore an idea, no matter how uncomfortable, to the ends.  Reading, unlike most other media today, tend to explore the taboo and question convention without always picking sides, generally in subtle and not so subtle story arcs.  I find that most movies and anime rely too heavily on visual or story-telling shock, and I lose my connection or the story lose its own morals.  Frankly, movies and shows tend to be too morally black and white, but while anime tend to be more grayish it often times caves to convention and pick a side.  This one is one of the few that actually managed to actually become more gray as the story continued.  \
Shin Sekai Yori does exactly that, and for the first time I found the art supported the story in every way -- subtle and not so subtly driving home points that would have been lost in a novel format.  it did it without the fanfareand utilized a lot of modern ideas to connect current audiences with both the past and the future of this fantasy society.  In essence, it asked the questions that literature tend to ask and it used music, art and animation to enhance each point it made.  I'm a very visual person, so I felt exactly how cleverly they used this format more than some of my friends who were less so.  However, the plot and direction, hands-down, has been agreed upon as being extremely well done.\
It setup, what I like to call the modern idea of a Utopia -- not the one in Thomas More's time but in today's time.  It then begins to deconstruct it to show how the surface difference only hide some of the basest, most natural and ugliest of human nature.  Often times I thought the show was being heavy-handed in some parts, but only at the end did I realize how subtly they infused each scene to reinforce even the viewer's own prejudices.  On top of which, several topics were thoroughly discussed, mostly around the nature of society itself.\
In the end, I loved that I got duped by the heavy-handed overall message only to see the more subtle ones at the conclusion of the show.\
The subject matters in this show is actually extremely mature and, many implications (on and off screen) are extremely dark, brutal and steeped in modern day psychological studies.  The way they tackled these subject matters through the characters was truly admirable and I really have never seen its likes before.  The questions the story asked with this medium was one of the best I have ever seen executed, especially concerning the central subject matter discussed.  Shin Sekai Yori is not just one of the best anime I have ever had the privilege of finding and viewing, it had some of the best social commentaries I have ever seen being tackled by a modern show.\
Also, it is highly suspenseful, horrifying, beautiful, and fascinating.  You cannot go wrong with this anime.  It really is a Masterpiece.\
This story will stick with me for a long, long time, and I cannot enthuse about it enough.\

    This review is mostly spoiler free!\
When I finished Shinsekai Yori, I stared the screen for a long time- i was still mesmerizing this wonderful series. I can't believe this series isn't as popular as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica or anything else.\
In my opinion, 25 episodes were too short- this show contains just too much themes. Discrimination, sexuality, universality of humans ethics, ... But I guess it's because of that why every episode is very compact and full.\
But as a matter of fact, for the first 3 episodes I had a hard time; I couldn't understand what they were trying to tell me. But after episode\
          \
        4, I saw myself drawn completely to the series- I even stayed up until 6 am to finish it.\
Story (10)\
I've never seen anything like it; amazingly original, it allowed me to think over a lot of thing of out actual society. An anime of this depth is quite rare. The sentence I still can't forget is : \"Isn't it a mistake to judge queerats (sort of beasts ; they are the slaves of humans in the series) through the lens of human ethics? \" \
And every element of the show is connected; nothing is useless. Plus the more episodes you watch, the more you're able to see the big picture, what really is happening.\
There were a couple of plot twists which made Shinsekai Yori very interesting.\
Art (9)\
Very good. I especially enjoyed what the characters were wearing; a beautiful mix of japanese traditional clothes and some futuristic touch on it. The boys were drawn very attractively, too.\
Sound (10)\
If I could, I would've given it  a 100! Amazing. The two endings songs were wonderful! Normally I skip the EDs but this time I listened to them until the end. The background music made me wordless too: it gave the show the right ambiance, the right feel.\
The voice actors were all terrific, too.\
Character (10)\
Each character plays a great role, and each character makes us be attached to them. \
Enjoyment (10)\
The pace is just right, not too slow and not too fast. They did a great job creating a mysterious and a \"fantasy\" feeling ambiance. (((((SPOILER)))) Plus, this is a personal opinion, but I loved the fact that Yuki and Satoru were together at the end- I was hoping for that from the beginning.\
Overall (10)\
I would love, love, love a sequel, even though I'm quite aware that's not happening, haha.",

    The most commendable thing about Shinsekai Yori is its theme.  Not only is it relevant to real human societal flaw, but the way it's delivered flows in the best way possible to match it.  With gradual character revelations, the stages of a society's beginning, middle and end are depicted in a very realistic and sociological way.  \
What's particularly special isn't its allusions to humanity (though, they somewhat hold more depth than others) but instead the magnitude of focus the series spends on painting the grand societal scheme of human control and desires.  And successfully so, it's clear and direct. There are\
          \
        no games, fillers, or blatant fan service for the audience or really any commercialized appeal that is relied on - but instead just pure content and detailing that adds to the story's premise. At the same time, the characters that follow the storyline mature accordingly and see what the viewer sees.  Like mentioned, this series shines in its fluidity and thematic qualities - yet (to me) this appears to be its only best trait.\
The show overall was never tear-worthy outstanding, though it had its share of impressive moments. You could say that the sum is greater than its parts, but still it felt slightly lacking.  It could be personal bias/tastes in enjoyment but there wasn't anything dynamic enough in character to move me or make me see a masterpiece at the core (I could go into detail, but I wouldn't want to spoil anything).  But in all, yes it was definitely time worth spent and was one of the better anime on the supernatural scale, or any scale I suppose.  \
Additional precautions: The show is a bit darker than it looks.  There is blood shed, unexpected death and a melancholy that lingers - but nothing is excessive or overly explicit.  Most likely, anything that may be deemed controversial is an added point to its message about humanity.  And if you're open minded enough about watching the story regardless of its small homosexual scenes and attitudes (which in my opinion were quite minor) then you'll have no qualms - but do know that they are there.  Also note it picks up momentum after about 4 episodes and things get less confusing. \
Recommended in general: Definitely :)\

    This is my first review here and English is not my native language. I'll try to make it as objective and spoiler-free as possible.\
Let me start by saying that I cannot fathom why this anime has received so many rave reviews. The show starts awfully slow and the story doesn't progress until very late in the anime. There seems to be no clear direction as to where the plot is taking you. You, the watcher, can't help but to feel confused and begin to wonder why are you even watching this particular anime in the first place.\
Shinsekai yori takes place a thousand years into the\
          \
        future. A small percentage of the human population evolved and gained telekinetic powers. After endless wars against non-psychic humans, they rise to power and eventually rule the planet. This is revealed to you through the series and is not particularly important until the very last episode.\
What you will be watching and following most of the time will be a small group of teenagers enrolled in a school to learn to control their telekinetic powers, referred to as Cantu. Bear in mind, thou, that this show is not action oriented and is not meant to be a pissing contest between Cantu users to prove their powers. For this reason, if you are looking for a flashy anime with cool characters, Shinsekai yori is not for you.\
There are no memorable characters worth mentioning. With no one to root for or care about, you are only drawn at the premise of a compelling and unique story. But after sitting through 25 episodes, it just left a bitter taste in my mouth. The plot is dark sprinkled with short bits of surrealism here and there. With the seemingly omnipotent powers of Cantu, the only real threat to humans is their Cantu going out of control. This serves as the center point of the story.\
That seems interesting, right? Well, I thought so too. There was so much potential here, which sadly was wasted with the introduction of...mole rats at the service of humanity. Yes, read that sentence again. Mole rats. That final revelation at the last episode, which I wont spoil here, doesn't change anything at all or diminishes the silliness of the whole thing. You have to juggle the dark and (at times) interesting parts of the story focused on the Cantu and it's mysteries, and the ridiculous and almost comical parts focused on the mole rats.\
The show takes its sweet time to raise questions and answer them. I found very few plot holes or unanswered question, but in all honestly, I cared less and less about the story as it progressed. The first half of the show is the most interesting and thought provoking part of Shinsekai yori. It definitely caught my attention and got my hopes high, if only for a moment.\
If you find slow-paced psychological anime with lengthy dialogues enjoyable, you might want to watch this. However, don't expect your mind to be blown apart by it's not-so-deep plot and/or lack of witty twists.\

    One of the best artistic anime I've seen and was beautiful from start to finish the only thing I personally didn't care for was the story. The story itself had great ideas and concepts but felt chopped up into different story segments that didn't blend together well almost as if those ideas clashed against each other which for me took away from the enjoyment of the overall story.\
While watching the entire thing there were major plot points that I felt was just left hanging and never building up to a climax for certain characters or situations, rather certain characters just slowly fade into the back\
          \
        of the story going from being a big influence on the main character to feeling almost nonexistent as the story went further into developing its main characters and their story.\
There was also times where things would be left unanswered for myself and the main characters and those issues were left alone and would never be brought up again like after one situation is done its almost completely forgotten when the second situation begins and there's never really any closure for anyone throughout the entire process which left me rather unsatisfied.\
In the end I'm glad I finished so I could understand the story by the end of it but would I watch it again? Probably not.\

    Shin Sekai Yori Review:\
MINDSET:\
Based on an award winning light novel, which is slightly better than the horrible ones where we were constantly forced fed every season.\
SYNOPSIS:\
A very few number of humans were able to naturally learn psychic abilities, and then, castastophe happens with mass war breaking lose (like its WWIII) with people being massacared for no reason, and government organizations with no ethics using completely unethical methods to keep things under control. We travel like 500 yeards in the future, when technology downgraded into a more rural Japan-like feel with psychihc powers being the new replacment for computers, because no politician were forced to keep\
          \
        all of humanity under forced control because too many of them have psychic powers.\
REVIEW:\
At first, it does seem to be your run of the mil slice of life with cool super powers in a sci-fi setting. And if that’s what the entire Anime is about, then it should'nt even deserve to be an award-winning light novel in the first place! \
However, after just three or four episodes in, this show has very interesting and dark themes, it treats them very maturely, and even though it has Yuri and Yaoi moments, they are rather sparse which dosn't take too much away from the show. (but whoever drops the show because of that, are not total idiots and have every reason to take there course) It presents a very grey morality which barely any shows take that kind of route these days. There is no clear cut villain, all actions whether its by society or not, has   a great reason of why they do it without being so obvious. Like all of the bad things the leaders of the town have a reason because of the past.\
 They kill a student if he/she was not good enough with there powers, because just like the first few psychics that came into existence, had barely any control of their power. And allowing here to live, could potentially make her a mass murderer. This gives the show a lot of depth and intelligence on how it handles the plot. (btw, they also indoctrinate all of the pupils/students to keep things under control) \
 It's directing does quite a lot of the foreshadowing to keep things a mystery, to keep things very subtle and unpredictable. It takes horrible plot devices, and uses them incredibly well. Like how indoctrination in Code Geas can be used as a plot device to forcfully move the plot. In here, it seemed to be very well fore shadowed, and is revelaed much later on the series. (after the slice of life aspect of course) the show gives You more information around the world and gradually giving us a very good grasp on how this world works, develops and reacts truly giving us immersion.\
Overall, the show handles ethics, philosophy and morality with great maturity and understanding of such topics being done in a very clever, and subtle manner. You truly sense the deeper and more inticing subtleties the more You progress further towards the show...\
 HOWEVER:\
While the pacing of the show is pretty good for the most part, its when we have soo much (at times convoluted) plot exposition being forcefully fed deep in out throats as it refuses to be excremented! We had three entire episodes of on just that! Most of time, it shows You gradually on whats the bigger picture, but there are moments when there is a little too much exposition we are forced to accept and is very difficult for it to be lodged into Your brain!\
The characters were easily the worst part of the show, don't think they are very deep, and complex, the whole cast in some way shape or form needs tweaking for the rest of the show to really succeed and deserves high scores. They are (unforunatley) archetypes as being governed by one or two major traits, I can only think of one truly great character of the show, but considering the large size of the entire cast, this doesn’t compare. And don't even get me started with that pussy character who was COMPLETLY USELESS THORUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DURATION! They lack other components on what makes greater characters and feel far too straight forward and sometimes alien at moments. There were a few moments when they did'nt act 100% appropiatly towards the situation. However, they do there job in a mediocre manner, which warrants me an average for the cast.\
In terms of production values, A-1 Pictures tend to create  high school based works (like slice of life and shojou) therefore, they are clearly not used into animating very serious and mature shows, meaning that the impact of the Animation will not be as strong when the shtuff hits the fan. Basically, it dos'nt make as much of an impact as I wanted it to. Also, for an ambitious project, the character designs don't live up compared towards the good stuff with the show, as they are designed with a minimal colour pallet and the designs just look  way two dimensional. There were some moments when the scenery just look absolutely beautiful compared towards the designs of the cast. There were moments when it look artsy, which creates further immersion. However, those moments can be few or far between.\
 In terms of music, only one notable song in the OST, with no opening song which is very rare amongst the countless, with a very great visually and musically ending theme!\
LEGACY:\
This show will most likely live and pass the test of time, as the countless number of causals will mature. It was badly pandered because it felt different towards everything made in 2013 due to “far too much Subtlety” since shows like SAO, AoT or any fan service piece rubbish. Having a very basic plot, shown in a very basic and obvious manner. The majority would rather look at chickens soup on LSD, rather than a painting by Picasso. It was a show who  stands out as being different from everything else, and it will praised for being that after two decades...\
SCORES:\
9/10 - For an amazingly well crafted and mature story, with extra points for being very wise and almost flawless!\
5/10 - Rather weak and completely average cast, but they do the job quite well and because they are well handled for the most part. But hey, an average cast is better than the all of the characters in AoT or Blue Excrement combined!\
7/10 - For a fitting soundtrack, but nothing too special except for a few songs.\
6/10 -  For animation that does the job, has a few great moments, but has moments when the Animation really needs to step up its game. (mediocre character design though) \
6/10 – The only true good aspect is the overall story, and some of the art, while everything else is not as enjoyable.\
FINALE: 6.5/10 For only the amazing story, but with everything else being mediocre or OK. (quite a shame that it got this score) :/\
PERSONAL SCORE:\
7/10 – I don't care characters, but overall, it is very interesting and is one of those anime(s) that appear once every blue moon.\

    Shinsekai Yori is an award-winning novel which was adapted as a twenty five-episode anime by A-1 Pictures from 2012 to 2013. Despite being hailed by numerous anime critics, it was commercially unsuccessful.  Honestly speaking, I am one of those who wondered why it failed to garner financial success because this is one of the most ambitious and the strongest titles I have watched from an anime series in 2013.\
While a dystopian world as a theme is nothing new to the world of anime, the source material's way of handling it stands out among others of its kind.  Topics like genocide, inhumane scientific experiments,\
          \
        racism and moral ambiguity are prevalent in the series while being hidden under a very calm surface. Hence, the false sense of peace the Shinsekai Yori has in its first half really gave a misplaced superiority complex among its populace and an uncomfortable feeling to the viewer. The pressure in keeping the status quo built up until it was destroyed in full swing when the suppressed struck back. While certainly horrific, this manner of storytelling also left an indelible mark to the minds of the viewer. It involved teenage characters at some time but the series is not for the young.\
Shinsekai Yori also featured one of the best presentation of moral ambiguity in recent anime history. The importance of status quo, the inequality between two different races and the cat and mouse chase (only to be overturned later on) were presented in an impeccable manner. Both sides have their point, no one is exactly right and people can sometimes be more monstrous than a real one. \
One legitimate flaw of Shinsekai Yori’s setup is it took too long before anything major happened. The first fourteen episodes’ plot progression was too slow to the extent of many dropping the show midway. However, these were carefully spent on world-building for the viewers to really immerse themselves in the series. Hence, when the action began, it went full force which left many viewers in awe and those who dropped it earlier to watch it again and be entranced by its beauty. Another legit flaw is the show has a habit of throwing jargons like cacti, minoshiro and queerats as if the viewer has knowledge about those beforehand. Fortunately, these are also explained in a thoughtful manner later on.\
While I also love Shinsekai Yori so much that it borders on fanboyism, the artwork is its biggest weakness. Due to its experimental premise that does not sound commercial at all, it seemed like it suffered several budget cuts in its run. The quality of the artwork violently changed several times throughout the series. The colors used ranged from really good hues to dull and the character designs were drawn inconsistently at times. It is kind of jarring and it might turn off viewers that are critical with the visual appeal of an anime. More so, the camera focus is distracting at times. A casual audience would not want to spend minutes staring at Saki’s crotch while she speaks.\
Fortunately, Shinsekai Yori compensated its lack of visual appeal with its very beautiful and haunting sound which complemented the whole series. It knows when to use strings during climactic moments, the percussions to accent the cat and mouse chase between humans and queerats and silence is amply given to emphasize scenes where the characters are in deep-thinking mode.\
One notable aspect of Shinsekai Yori is it lacks an opening song for a good reason. The \"Traditional Song of Shadows\" is one of the most epic background music I have heard from an anime which fits just right with its very ambitious nature. The piece \"Going Home\" was also used numerous times in the series and was interpreted to be used after the havoc to a haunting effect. The ending song, while an upbeat one, foreshadowed Saki’s very long journey towards attaining a truly peaceful life.\
Every character in Shinsekai Yori is well explored, from their motives to their ultimate fate. The series was able to make them very compelling to the extent that you might even find it hard to side with the main characters because the reasons of the antagonist were well explained and the humans were not exactly perfect either.\
Watanabe Saki is also one of the best anime characters that I have seen in my entire anime watching experience. She is not too smart, she is an average looking girl and she is relegated to the role of an observer many times in the series. Yet what makes her human is her unstoppable will to change the world despite is negativities and her ability to go on without further sacrificing what's important with her. While she did not forgive what was wrongly done, she shows mercy when the perpetrator has suffered enough for his sin. \
Squealer, on the other hand, is one of the most fleshed antagonist in anime. His journey, from a mere queerat to humanity’s vessel of destruction was shown amply. His reasons for doing so is also sufficiently given to the viewer. His speech at the end of the series made the last episode as one of the best endings in any anime ever. \
In the end, Shinsekai Yori is truly a one of a kind experience and is deserved to be called one of the defining animes of 2013. If you want a thought provoking show which intricately built its characters and its world, this one is for you.\

    This anime is unlike anything I've seen before. Its just so deep and very well put together. Despite the start of this anime being confusing and seeming like it wasn't leading anywhere, it was one of those animes that got better as the show went along, especially by the second half. Its hard to talk about this anime without spoiling it, so I'm going to do my best.\
Story: 10\
The story is quite complex and you can't talk about it without spoiling major plot points. So all I'm going to say is that the story keeps you guessing and really make you think. Its highly engaging\
          \
        by its second half, although a lot of people found the first half to be boring or something, but I enjoyed everything after episode 5. There are some surprising twists in this anime.\
Art: 9\
You see its hard for me decide what score to give Shinsekai Yori's animation, because.. well there were some episodes were animation could get kind of badish. LIke episode 3 I found to be quite awful. But then the animation could become beautiful! The second half really picked up and the animation settled nicely after that. I would of given it a 10, had the animation been substantial.\
Sound: 10\
This anime actually didn't have an opening, but i liked that aspect of it. This anime was too engaging to deserve one. The endings were okay. The background music.. WAS AMAZING! The music is this anime was beautiful! There are tracks in this anime that will stay in my mind forever. The soundtrack really matched the tone of this anime and even made the anime more enjoyable as every time certain soundtracks would come on, it would just empower the scene.\
Character: 9\
Most of the characters were well developed. Some of them have typical personalities, but they are all very well developed and interesting. Two in particular that I found myself really rooting for them to survive because how attached I'd grown to them. Those characters Saki (our main character) and Satoru. This anime forms believable bonds between characters and you can really feel the friendship between the friendship group we follow in the anime. Saki is our main character and we follow her throughout the entire anime. The screen never really leaves her, even during action sequences. Although sometimes this did cause 1 little nit pick such as when certain characters died off screen.\
Enjoyment: 9\
Its was highly engaging but its second half and I found myself not just wanting to watch the next episode, but needing to watch the next episode. The start was confusing and definitely had me racking my head on what I was watching, but after a little while I began to enjoy what I was seeing on the screen. But fear not, every boring moment at the start of series plays major roles in later episodes.\
Overall: 9.5\
Would of been a 10 had the first half of the series been more engaging, but trust me it does pick up and the rest of the series is binge worthy. Highly highly recommend this underrated series. It honestly unlike any anime series I've seen before with a sort of original-ish context. \

    NO SPOILERS INCLUDED\
With the first few episodes of this show I felt lost and things were progressing slowly. \
There were even a few very trippy sequences and during those times I considered moving on from this anime. I also didn't enjoy watching two guys making out so explicitly. Once I got through these few episodes and began to comprehend what was happening I became immersed. \
Most the characters were likable although at times some would act too needy or wimpy. \
The story went in a completely different direction I expected it to go in, the story was far more complex and held a ton of\
          \
        philosophical and political tones. Also I enjoyed the story taking place over 15 years, it was done very smoothly with every few episodes jumping forward in time as everything unfolds. Character progression here was spot on.\
Seeing it in Blu Ray the animation was beautiful although it felt slightly different in some episodes depending on action sequence or otherwise. \
One example of this would be computer generated boulders being thrown across battlefield's over a standard anime backdrop and to me looked out of place.\
Soundtrack worked for me and fit this anime fine, I had no problems with it.\
Overall this is definitely worth watching, it was beautiful and clever. Due to the complex nature of the story it kept me thinking about it long after it was over. At times you will certainly feel lost but i wouldn't let that put you off.\
My final thoughts are as such, I honestly wouldn't re-watch this show anytime soon. The charm in the show is not knowing who to trust or not and where the story is eventually going to lead to. After you figure all that out it probably wont do too much for you a second time around, But..\
.. if your looking for a new anime to watch with a complex and clever story with an interesting & fun twist included then check this out.\

    DISCLAIMER : this is my first review I have ever written so I guess that just tells you how much I loved it to actually write a review, but sorry if it sounds all over the place.\
\
   I might be a little soft giving the story, art , sound ,character, enjoyment all a 10, but this anime deserves it. Shinsekai Yori was like no other anime I had watched in the years I have been watching anime. In all honesty I didn't think I was going to like it, but somehow this show made me fall so deeply in love with the characters\
          \
        and story line. SSY made me feel like you were apart of the family of friends and everything that happened in the anime was as if it was happening to me as well (and I can't name a show I have watched that made me feel like that in a long time).\
   Furthermore, the character development is realistic and the pace/events add up to make sense even if there is some time skipping (like they skip a few years ahead). Though with the whole time skipping comes a lot of  age/character development. Throughout the anime it felt like I growing up with the characters and developed a sense of maturity (like they did) by the end of this show. It was amazing to see that something so involved with fantasy and unnatural powers could capture the essence of great character development of a 12 year old growing into an adult. The characters are the jackpot in the show, no other characters out there like the amazing group one in Shinsekai Yori.\
   Going back to the age skipping, well in all honesty it was a little confusing at first because you want to badly to know what happened in the middle of the time you last saw them and now, but as I went on it started to make more sense and it gives you a better connection to the characters in the way that you can easily see the difference between their younger self and their older self. But, the anime doesn't really leave at such a big cliff hanger on what happened in that lost time we didn't get to see. \
 All in all you will fall in love with this anime. But, here are a few warnings... \
1) You need to really pay attention to this anime and all its eps. It is not one of those anime that gives every answer to you (that would be boring) you will figure your questions out the moment the character figures out the question as well. \
\
2) The narration is from Saki (one of the main characters). So the events will always be from her perspective so don't freak out if someone isn't seen for one episode that just means she wasn't with them to actually show what is happening to them. But, 10 out 10 times you will know what happens to the characters that we didn't see for a few eps because Saki always finds out. SPOLIER:except for two characters, with those two characters you have to use context clues to figure what happened since no one really knows in the anime exactly what happened to them.\
\
3) Shinsekai Yori isn't a soft hearted anime. There is a lot of bloodshed and a big handful of gory killing/screaming scenes.\
\
4) If you don't like gay couples then you most likely shouldn't be watching this anime because SSY is a no one cares about gender you love who you love type of anime.\
\
5) On the note of love there is talk about sex and sex does happen in this anime, but I don't think it's anything to obsess over.\
\
6)The story line here is no joke as well as the elements of sound and art. So if you are used to light hearted and comedy type of music/anime/characters then you might want to prepare yourself for this new territory you are stepping into.\
\
7) Be sure to give this anime time. You need to let all the events and conversation to sink in, if you start skipping or run through it quickly you will get none of it and will hate the anime because you don't understand whats happening. \
   Other than that I don't really know what else to say except that this anime is amazing, heart wrenching, beautiful, award worthy, and absolutely worth watching all 25 eps. And trust me by the end of it you will get so attached that when it is over you will feel like your child just went off to college (lol). \

    I tend to view the wide umbrella of \"dystopian anime\" as laying on a spectrum between clarity of message and attempted profoundness of message.\
On one end of the spectrum are anime's like Stein's;Gate, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Attack on Titan. The message is very clear (good vs evil for FMAB and AoT, \"defying destiny\" for Steins;Gate), and they can be damn entertaining, but you aren't trying to extract a deep life message, and the show isn't trying to give you one.\
On the other end are more philosophical animes such as Ergo Proxy and Serial Experiments Lain. These can ask more profound questions, and are worth\
          \
        the watch, but can be overladen with \"arthouse\" style storytelling that can cause a haziness of message and a sense of \"talking past\" each other if you try to discuss the anime with someone.\
Shinsekai Yori hits a perfect medium on the spectrum. In a Brave-New-World style universe (with fantasy elements), the show hits at morally uncertain questions without ever leaving you too dazed and confused about the plot -- or the point -- of the show. \
Shinsekai Yori does almost everything right, to the point that it could very nearly be my favorite anime. The one point where it does falter, substantially, is in the characters themselves. In their efforts to show why Saki should take the role she does at the end of the show, they turn her into an overly detached observer of her world, rather than a fully emotional participant. They allow Saki to cry when tragedy strikes, but almost never allow her to show anger. They had an easy way to do this, as well; just make better use of the narrator of the show and you can develop Saki as a character.\
The other \"main characters\" of the group are also nothing to write home about in terms of inner conflict or development. In fact, the most interesting and multidimensional character of the show is probably the \"antagonist\" himself, who only really shows himself for less than a third of the episodes. \
The gripe about the weak characters, however, is really only one acceptable flaw in a show where everything else is damn near perfect. The truth is that Shinsekai Yori does dystopia better than pretty much any other anime, as well as most books on the subject. My biggest regret at the end of watching it is that the source material isn't translated professionally into English, which speaks to how little there really is to complain about the show. \

    Borderline 10/10 really. It makes its point beautifully, world is innovative, story has a compelling SF theme. Timeskips mean a lot of actual story and nice pacing which is great. Art style felt unique, and production quality was great. Really dark show with deep themes and emotional moments. Very self aware and strong in plot logic until 70% in, when plot logic starts taking a nosedive. Which was my only actual issue I guess. Other one maybe being that some of the heavy themes introduced seemed like they would be dealt with more, but show ended up focusing on another theme which it decided would\
          \
        be central, and it kinda forgoes many of the earlier ones. But I'm not sure show introducing themes a, b and c, but ending up focusing only on c, is actually a downside at all. It's just that I would have liked to see say theme b* tackled more, that made me just slightly disappointed to see it abandoned. \
 SPOILERS AHEAD: \
Plot logic issues: \
 - How come fiends just happen to have faulty death feedback, something that's written in the human DNA. Logically, it should take mental insanity disorder to coincide with random mutation that would disable the death feedback. Chances of this happening are insanely low, and it wasn't spotlighted since there was no exposition of fiends appearing every now and then, and dying from death feedback. People just randomly going mental is dubious enough as it is.\
 - Existence of actual soul in an SF. Dammit Shun.\
 - Fighting fiend with bioweapon seems suicidal and nonsensical, why is nobody pointing it out, is it because the knowledge of what bacteria are has been lost? It doesn't seem likely considering the minoshiro library databases and other kinds of knowledge that was preserved.\
 - The way bioweapon was introduced clumsily (out of nowhere).\
 - If someone were to sacrifice themselves (death feedback) to kill the fiend, it's dubious literally no one would be able to overcome the conditioning of not hurting other people, especially free thinkers from group 1, or anyone using a workaround method: actual gun, or cantus bullet like projectile, or deadly trap. At the end of the day why not just toss the fiend a few kilometres away like Satoru tossed Saki to save her from the gas explosion. Surely anyone could do this as it's by definition not deadly against a cantus user.\
 - Why didn't Tomiko (by far the most knowledgeable) know about the bio-weapon and/or tried to acquire/use it in the past (she stated that only option against fiend is to run), and more importantly, why isn't any character asking this question?\
 - How did local queerats manage to track down Maria and Mamoru when it was implied they ran very far away. At the very least, lacks foreshadowing that they didn't really run that far away. \
 - Why did Saki forget that Maria isn't actually dead but that her death was faked? Also what's with the DNA confirmation Tomiko mentioned? Was she just lying/playing along?\
 episode 24: \
  >not using cantus to play terraria with that cave system (something that was demonstrated both possible and easy in early episodes (even a kid could do it))\
  >needing a mirror to realise your skin isnt brown and wrinkled and that you don't have fangs and do have a lot of red hair.\
  >at this distance psychobuster will infect both satoru and the fiend. implying you somehow know the AOE of the airborn bacteria. Implying you can't manipulate wind.\
  >14:46 wait, why are we still alive?\
 * By theme b, I meant the brave-new-world theme, treatment of children that is, conditioning, hiding information, lying to them, erasing their memories, disposing of them. Never did the show resolve to it as bad or show it change, or show it as something that really needs to change. There was only a natural implication of how bad it is, but in the end it doesn't even get a mention, and it appears show just considers it necessary. Again, this is more of a personal quirk I had with it, rather something actually bad. I suppose focus needed to be kept on theme c, how monstrous we, the upper class, can be in our treatment of lower ones.\
And reddit c/p from a comment, a final thing for me that is holding this from 10/10: \
''Most of all, though, the ending was way too vaguely optimistic. Their society was pretty nasty, but there were very important reasons for that, and no alternatives presented here.''\

    The only way to describe this anime for me is 'waste.' Specifically, wasted potential. Let me first say that the art and overall acting are excellent throughout the series. The characters are compelling and realistic. The first 15 or so episodes are something truly special, there is such a strong and intriguing dystopian aspect to the series, you can feel the terror of the children as they slowly realize why and how their peers go missing, and whether they'll be next. You're forced to consider hard questions; what exactly is the greater good? what sacrifices would you accept to maintain 'peace'? Would you give up\
          \
        freedoms, even your basic rights, for what you perceive as a better chance for your species to survive? Both sides of the issue are presented logically and fairly. In addition, there are rather deep and complex relationships between characters, and you can easily see these interpersonal relationships fueling a very compelling storyline later on. The first 15 or so episodes were pure excitement and the series was incredibly promising. Then came only disappointment.\
*SPOILERS BEGIN HERE*\
Around episode 17 they completely abandon the dystopian aspect and instead focus on all-out war with monster rats. It's like they took EVERYTHING that showed promise in the beginning, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage. watching the last 6 or so episodes was a pure disappointment. They abandoned the dystopian considerations in the plot. they forget key characters, leaving you to ask why those characters were even in the plot to begin? why did the plot totally abandon shun? why spend over half of the fucking series building this absolutely riveting social scenario and then completely cheapen it just so you can cheesily bring in an ogre into the plot?? WHY? why did shun die, when his death means very little to the overall plot? it was also disappointing that maria and mamoru died off-screen as well. the show should have gone in the direction where the protagonists strive to overthrow or protect the current societal status quo. You could even pit them against each other, some choosing to rebel and others not, and old friends and lovers are forced to fight. That would have been a much more compelling storyline. the latter half of the anime felt like sending your kid who wants to be a doctor off to college and having them flunk out and develop an opiate dependency. I'm truly sad that the story turned out the way it did, it really was on it's way to being one of my favorites before they completely derailed the theme of the anime. In the end, i still enjoyed it overall because of how deep the characters were, but the plot did a disservice to the amazing characters.\

    Just by looking at the cover, if you think Shinsekai Yori is going to be another run of the mill school anime with fantasy, romance feels anime like Angel Beats or a bloody gore feast like Another then prepare to be disappointed. Cause Shinsekai Yori ain’t none of that! Then what exactly is Shinsekai Yori despite falling into the same genres as those two completely different anime mentioned earlier?\
Well, that’s what I am going to look into today so gather around kiddos because today’s review is Shinsekai Yori!\
\
A village barricade from the rest of the world inhabits people possessing the ‘god’s power’ known as pyrokenesis.\
          \
        The story mainly focus on Saki Watanabe a twelve year old who just got her powers and is now to going to attend this school to train along with her other friends Shun, Satoru, Mamoru and Maria. But, little does Saki know of all the hurdles she and her friends has to face along the way- as slowly over the years they change by losing their innocence and becoming more aware of the world around them and discovering it’s dark secrets! That’s all I am going to say about the plot, because I would be a total prick if I spoiled anything.\
One thing that made me keep on watching Shinsekai Yori was how mysterious it was how it manages to shroud everything in mystery and keeps us guessing what the fuck is actually going on. But, also simultaneously each episode contributes to dropping certain hints that foreshadow of the story’s outcome. Whether it be the stories the characters tell, the odd behavior of the adults like Saki’s parents, not to mention that the background music managed to set the tone perfectly! \
The character’s behavior and thought pattern also go through unexpected changes that the average viewer like me and even our main female protagonist Saki are in awe of. You like Saki also start questioning if whether everything in this show is what it seems or not. Cause remember looks can be deceiving and the end of the day this perfect world with powerful beings might not be as great as some make it out to be! \
The way the story is narrated by I assume an older Saki is done really well, and from the tone of her voice we get an idea of the pain, suffering and hardships that our main character had to go through in her youth. Hence, it kind of hints that Shinsekai Yori is going to be one of those shows where after a handful of episodes- shit is going to hit the fan like crazy! And guess what? It does actually that too more than once, which is amazing! The story unfolds brilliantly and it takes quite the interesting take in EP8. For a minute had me wondering if this was the same show anymore! , which is not a bad thing by the way. Well, not in my opinion at least! \
The animation for the show was done by A1 Pictures and I have been a fan of most of their work like Anohana and Your Lie in April. However, if you compare it to those works the animation quality doesn’t stand out all that much. I mean, alone the animation isn’t bad but truth be told I have seen better quality from this studio.\
The reason I am saying all that is because the quality looked inconsistent and that certain scenes seemed too dim for my taste. But, the studio made sure that the important scenes and backgrounds looked stunning, with its use of serene/ fall colours that make Shinsekai Yori almost look like a painting that you can hang on your wall. The animation especially shines during the first ending them that I freaking love. I couldn’t care less that Shinsekai Yori hardly an opening theme because of how wondering its first ending theme it was with a song that managed to give off the same vibes that show did. And I love it! The second one was forgetful because and I just wished they kept the first one for the entirety of the show!\
Now, as for the characters I hate to admit it but there was nothing too spectacular about them. Yes, most of them were likeable but none of them managed to be as interesting as I would want them to be. I would say that I however did like Saki and Satoru the most out of all of them and that they make a great duo. I am glad that the most of the story was centered on them and that by the end they were fully realized characters. Special mention goes to Squeeler, a monster rat that Saki and Satoru met that will cook up some interesting drama during the final arc of the show which you should look forward too.\
The major issue I realize most anime tend to deal with is pacing and Shinsekai Yori isn’t no exception. I am not saying this is the worst paced show but it did lack in that area. The show is divided into three parts and the first and last part took quite some time to really get things going and come to its conclusion. The second arc was amazing from start to finish, but the other two wasn’t, hence some of the episodes and only some in the first and last arc were kind of boring.  \
Another thing most anime don’t have is a good ending. Shinsekai Yori, in my opinion, has a wonderful ending. No, in fact it has a jaw dropping ending which makes sense and again brings us to the topic of how looks can be deceiving and that everything is not what it seems. \
As for the dub, I would say that it was pretty mediocre. I honestly prefer the subbed version more and I highly recommend you check that one instead.  Even if I did like Emily Neeves as Saki, her performance alone is not enough for me to prefer the subbed version over the dub. I am not a Grey Ayres hater, but gosh they could have picked someone better to portray Satoru. Like why do I have to hear Sunohara’s voice when I watch this show? And no I am not a Sunohara hater either!\
If you are going to watch Shinsekai Yori thinking it’s a horror anime, then you are going to be disappointed like I was. I know a show doesn’t need to rip people’s heads off and spill blood everywhere to be considered horror, but there was nothing about Shinsekai Yori that caused a shiver to go down my spine. I mean, Monster despite being completely different from Shinsekai Yori managed to live to being a part horror anime with its psychological elements. But, I guess that’s because Johan is one intimidating motherfucker! \
 Overall Shinsekai Yori, didn’t up being as amazing as I wanted it to be but it was still very enjoyable. It might fail as a horror anime, but it succeeds as mystery one – not to mention it has great supernatural elements induced into it- as it features as a unique and fascinating world. And so I am going to award Shinsekai Yori with an 8 and that it’s WORTH THE WATCH! If you love mystery anime then you are going to love Shinsekai Yori.",

    Having done a rewatch, I can say that this is my favorite anime of all time. It's absolutely beautiful to watch, and the themes it explores are incredibly profound. \
I apologize for the lack of explanation, but explaining too much would spoil the show's enjoyment because enjoyment comes from the \"why\": the unraveling of the mystery and exploration of human motives.) Shin Sekai Yori is basically about a post-apocalyptic dystopian society where everyone has and learns to control psychic power. The single most important factor governing this society is the prevention of calamities, namely appearance of karmic demons or ogres. Enslaved by human society are\
          \
        the intelligent monster rats who see the humans as gods due to their power and this dynamic is crucial to the development of the plot. The show explores themes of morality, ethics, law, eugenics, child developmental psychology, teen love, and social contract. Usually a dystopian story (novel, film, show, etc.) sets up the dystopian government, which bears resemblance to current governmental structures and expose its flaws (like 1984, Psychopass). The dystopia in Shin Sekai Yori rather gives justification for the horrible things the society does. What is necessary for society to survive? Why does this society go to such lengths?\
The pacing is slow. This isn't an action anime. It doesn't really pick up until ep 16. Until then, we watch the main characters go from schoolchildren just entering middle school to adults functioning in this society. Because the things that society does are terrible, children are kept from this knowledge and it is revealed to us as the children learn as well. The pacing gives us time to mull over the things we learn about this society. It feels like the series could go for 50 episodes based on pacing, and yet by the time you finish the series, so much has happened. Not to mention, some of the scenes are breathtakingly beautiful (boat scene with shun and saki) and the music while generic at times can be haunting.\
As I've said, this is probably my favorite anime in its profundity and execution. The pacing is slow, but it's all part of the atmosphere created. \

    Shinsekai Yori is that rare thing, an anime adaptation of a novel—not a light novel, but a novel, a capital-N novel—and it shows. The plot unfolds gradually and deliberately, free from the limits of episodic stories that reliably return their characters to the status quo. Indeed, characters age and develop over the course of years; romances, families, and individuals rise and fall. Its scope is panoramic: it creates a complete picture of an alternate world centuries into the future and a small community living there, allowing the writing's focus to transgress from the psychological lives of the characters into disquieting political allegory while remaining thematically congruent.\
          \
        At the centre of these themes is the question of appearance vs. reality, truth vs. mystery. Are there truths that should not be known to the world? Can the things we love be used to control us and conceal the truth; and is it sometimes better to keep it that way? Up until the end, there are unresolved questions about the strange idyllic world of Kamisu 66, the rural town that is the fulcrum of the story, and it is unclear whether such questions should be resolved when their answers have such devastating consequences.\
Shinsekai Yori is named for Dvorak's popular symphony of the same name; it is interesting to note that the 'From the New World' symphony and its iconic melody in the second movement were originally meant to evoke the mystery and promise of a very different New World: America, at a time when the predominant European attitude towards the United States had not fomented into disappointment and resentment. In a similar way, the wonder of the Japanese pastoral in the early episodes—the harmonious, isolated world of magic and mystery—steadily declines over the course of Shinsekai Yori. When the melody is reprised in the last arc of the show, it summons not mystery and potential but loss: the loss of innocence, the loss of moral certainty, and loss of that new world where great things were possible. New World becomes Old World, with all its vices.\
The show principally follows the lives of five characters who grow up in Kamisu 66 and belong to the same class group at school, where they learn to control and command the psychokinetic powers that led to their world's state of technological regression. After an encounter with a sentient library robot from humanity's past, the twelve-year-old characters are exposed to the first of several revelations about their world that continue throughout the show and dramatically affect all five of them personally and psychologically. These revelations focus on the horror and transformation that human societies underwent after the appearance of psychokinetic humans who could kill with a thought; but rather than emphasise merely the nature of these powers as a lesser show might, Shinsekai Yori uses these developments symbolically and allegorically to comment on human psychology and social organisation. There is also something unmistakably Japanese about it; the extreme accommodations necessitated by these psychokinetic humans, or 'PKs', including genetic modifications that prevent them from killing other people, smell something like Tokugawa era enforcements of isolation and harmony. Japan in the days of sakoku was the only country to successfully rid itself entirely of firearms; we are wont to criticise this kind of self-imposed isolation, but when the alternative suggested by Shinsekai Yori is a nightmarish chaos in which indolent despots mass-murder powerless commoners, it raises the uncomfortable notion that such enforcements may sometimes be not only necessary but good.\
This unhappy impression is compounded by the psychological effects that these revelations have upon the five children, which have far-reaching ramifications in the tiny community of Kamisu 66. There is a consistent suggestion of an aristocratic ethos in the show: that good personal character is the only factor that plays a part in whether one is worthy of power and forbidden knowledge. Saki, the main character, is singled out as possessing unique mental strength, while Mamoru, a gentle-hearted boy who spends his time drawing pictures of his unrequited crush Maria, is unable to emotionally handle the unpleasant realities to which he is exposed. This ends in disaster when he becomes a target for the Board of Education and runs away from home; Maria, following him into the snowy wilderness, bears his child, a birth whose consequences are ruinous in the final arc of the show, when the baby returns as a Fiend—a PK who is able to overcome their genetic programming and use their powers against humans. Similarly, Saki's friend and crush Shun, a kind and intelligent boy expected to excel, is overcome by his own powers, which leak destructively into the world. The nature of this disorder is, in a none-too-subtle metaphor, described as rooted in the subconscious mind.\
It undersells Shinsekai Yori to describe its setting as a dystopia, although it bears a particular resemblance to the sedated society of Brave New World, where drugs and sex are used as a means of political control. The things we love blind us: the library robot explains how the social engineers of their community encouraged young people to relieve stress and tension through sex, heterosexual and homosexual, like bonobos, so they ignore the mysteries of their condition. Characteristically, the only one to resist this is the mentally strong Saki: we're not monkeys, she says. At that early point of the story, there is still an idealism that resonates in her words. If the Kamisu 66 Ethics Committee and Board of Education represent the enforcers of harmony and a Tokugawa-style consensus, Saki seems initially like a Western transplant, a humanist or Christian seeking truth; cynicism sets in later as she is groomed by Tomiko, the head of the Ethics Committee, to become the next leader of the community and guard the hidden knowledge that undergirds their society.\
Indeed, the position of the humanist is occupied by a very different character in the last arc of Shinsekai Yori. Early in the show, when the twelve-year-old children are seeking to escape discovery after speaking to the library robot, they encounter two members of a genetically engineered slave race called Monster Rats (bakenezumi) who help them to evade capture. The first, Squealer, is a sweaty and dishonest groveller whose supplicating attitude to humans belies an apparently self-interested core. The other is Kiroumaru, a strong but gentle retainer who shows a loyalty and kindness to the children that reads as more genuine. These two become central figures as the characters age into adulthood. Squealer turns against the monarch of his colony, overthrows her in revolution, and encourages other rats to do the same in their own colonies—that he would eventually rebel against his human masters also is a predictable development, and the show's final conflict focuses on this attempt by Squealer to seek, in his view, liberation for his people. Kiroumaru assists the humans in their struggle to repress the rebels.\
The injustice of the rats' condition is not underplayed. The last secret unearthed in the show is that this race of slaves is not the result of genetic experimentation on naked mole rats, as initially believed, but human beings, modified to appear like rats so that they could be killed by other humans; they are the descendants of the commoners who escaped mass-murder by the PKs. Yet, as we see the contrast of the underhanded Squealer and the dignified Kiroumaru, the text does not make much effort to justify the former's efforts until its conclusion, when he stands defiantly on trial against a panel of PKs who mock his humanist declaration. 'We are human!' he cries; and is promptly sentenced to an eternity of physical and mental torture, kept alive as a bundle of nerves and slime. As for Kiroumaru, he admits to Saki that he too had republican fantasies once, but abandoned them and instead sought to do the best he could to improve himself within the system. This cynicism is unexpected in popular media: to accept iniquity as a natural condition and endure its travails is not a comforting moral imperative, especially to Western humanists.\
In the final moments of Shinsekai Yori, we see Saki and her partner Satoru raising children in their thirties. They are the only two remaining of the five schoolmates who encountered the library robot. Together with their progeny, they express hope for a kinder world; but this is not Squealer's hope for universal justice or a transformation of society. Their only expectation appears to be for personal justice, for the secret truths and mysteries of their society to be guarded not with jealousy or paranoia but rather good will and charity. In perhaps the show's most subtly dark moment, Squealer is extralegally granted the release of death by Saki; his truth will go unspoken and unknown to the world, but Saki decides that she still bears a responsibility to that truth. In the end, therefore, the virtue of truth is only apparent to the ones equipped to handle its implications. No, this is no New World; it is the Old World, with all its vices.\

    With an uninspired title this anime is not usually on the top x list of best anime ever. I did however end up sighting it in some random YouTube video I clicked among a few other choice picks and thought it may be worth a try.\
This anime masterfully leads you on expectation road with a few breadcrumb baits just watching your mouth water then takes a few turns you really could not expect. The thing that is great about this anime is that you always think the story is going in another direction and then it sucker punches you. Slightly slow beginnings may keep some\
          \
        viewers away but I would implore you to at least watch at least five episodes before you make your judgment.\
Shinsekai Yori is now my favorite anime of all time because of the beautiful mix of story, character development, and art making this an instant classic in my eyes. As developed as the world is, I was convinced this must have been based on an incredibly long book series because the attention to detail is probably better than any anime I've ever seen. I cannot think of any inconsistencies to be honest, everything has an explanation and it truly is well thought out.\
This anime will be well worth your time.\

    Well, I think it's safe to say that Shinsekai Yori is definitely one of the most interesting anime I've seen thus far.\
Story - 10/10\
I really love everything about this show's premise. The concept is super interesting, the lore is amazingly intriguing, and each little piece of the puzzle is just so complex and genius in its integration into the overall plot. It seems that too often, when a story attempts a large time-leap, it is not executed properly. Shinsekai Yori, however, is a shining exception, even attempting multiple time-leaps throughout the series, and executing them all perfectly. You really get the sense that these characters\
          \
        have deeply matured and changed, sometimes quite drastically, without needing to be there with them for every second of their development. I don't want to say much else, because with this anime in particular, I really would feel bad in spoiling anything.\
Art - 8/10\
The art in Shinsekai Yori is very good. While the art and animation is fairly good and solid most of the time, the scenes dealing with Fiends, Karma Demons, and dreams are absolutely stunning.\
Sound - 9/10\
The soundtrack to this anime really shines. The music that plays during the tense, mysterious, or revealing scenes sounds very cool and perfectly fits the mood in those moments. And we can't forget to mention that first ending theme. Mmm, so tasty!\
Character - 9/10\
Like I stated in the Story section, the characters (that is, the ones who stick around until the final story arc) are incredibly well developed and executed. Even the ones who unfortunately don't get the chance to stay with us the whole way through go through some really key, and sometimes heart-wrenching moments. I really felt their desperation, their fear, their sadness, and their moments of understanding right along with them. There are also a few characters that are of a race known as \"Queerats\" that are particularly interesting in that you never really know for certain what their intentions are, making for some great tension, mystery, and intrigue.\
Enjoyment - 9/10\
I really enjoyed the journey through Shinsekai Yori. It was very interesting, mysterious at times, and intense. Sure, there were times where it was a bit confusing, but that's definitely to be expected for a story with such a complex and heavy plot.\
Overall - 9/10\
I would certainly recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to sit down and pay close attention to every detail. It's certainly not an anime you'd be able to enjoy to it's fullest extent if you aren't able or willing to do that.\

    Shinsekai Yori inhabits an odd place when it comes to anime. Its a deeply psychological themed anime that explores the viewers unease as the plot develops while at the same time it feels like an odyssey as you watch the five young children that are at the center of the narrative grow up from the beginning of the show until its end. Set in a post-dystopian world, the world of Shinsekai Yori is ordered and beautiful - but in order to achieve order, peace, and stability the world is built on what some may call immoral and dirty societal practices that are deemed necessary to\
          \
        keep society functioning.\
In many ways Shinsekai Yori is more in line with western stories like The Giver or the Hunger Games than it is with anything in Anime. Partly because of this a viewer may come into this show not realizing what they are getting into. This show will make you feel uncomfortable or think, if you are willing to allow yourself to be uncomfortable and think. Unlike other dystopian stories, as viewers we get to see the proverbial making of the sausage and see exactly how/why the society functions as it does and as viewers we can come to appreciate how this society ended up emerging the way it does. For everything it does, Shinsekai Yori also tries to remain rooted in realistic and logical steps and any of the supernatural powers/effects feel like they naturally flow from an incredibly well built world. \
Warnings:\
As mentioned above, this show does feel more western in some ways than many anime. Other warnings, this is not a Shonen or a Seinen and while there is some action, the action is meant as a means of exploring the world and the complex societal relationships within the story. There were some gay/lesbian scenes in this anime, however they are not gratuitous and have a legitimate place in the anime as part of the worldbuilding necessary to setup the society these children live in. Some viewers and reviews have docked this anime for the display of these scenes simply because of the existence of said gay/lesbian scenes without acknowledging the fact it was a brief (and fairly subtle) part of the world building. Finally, this story explores several threads of this society and does not simply just explore one aspect of this dystopian society. For those who struggle with a narrative that explores multiple aspects and themes, this may not be the anime for you.\
Art:\
The tones and colors are quite stark and contribute to the exploration of the fears and hopes of these children as they grow up in this society. Shinsekai Yori had several guest directors who directed their episodes in different art styles compared to the main narrative and while this can be jarring for some, it largely feels like it adds to the world. Animation is largely fluid and seamless, however some lower budget episodes are somewhat apparent.\
Sound:\
As far as OSTs go this is a haunting OST. In fact I would say almost traumatizingly haunting. Fear, hope, and unease all help create the feeling that this is really coming from a \"Brave new world\". If I had to compare this OST to another OST that fit beautifully alongside the world it had built, it would be Spice and Wolf. Strangely this anime does not have an OP, however it does have an amazing ED that feels like it continues the exploration of your emotions.\
Characters:\
There is something satisfying watching characters grow up from immature selves to their more mature adult selves over the course of a show like this. None of the characters are over the top and you will likely not place them in a top 10 list of your most memorable characters, however each character feels like they genuinely fit the world they were placed in. There is such a thing as quiet strength in people - a quiet strength in people who have to overcome adversity and the main characters in this show definitely have that strength. Which once again brings me back to the point that in some ways this feels more like something Western than Japanese at times.\
Enjoyment:\
This one is a bit of a strange category. I can say I enjoyed thinking about this world, watching the changes and natural human inconsistencies rub up against each other and cause the conflicts that kept the plot of this anime going. It felt natural, logical, creative, innovative, and in many ways awe-inspiring. The usage of Dvorak's New World symphony in this anime added to the feeling of this feeling like an epic. However, this anime does leave feelings of unease and while I can say 100% that I enjoyed this anime its something that you have to ruminate on and can't exactly jump into a rewatch immediately after viewing it for the first time.\
Overall I would give this anime a 10/10. While there are some arguably minor flaws like in some inconsistencies in art direction, the ideas and themes it explores are both beautiful and leave enough room for the viewer to make his/her own judgments without being spoon fed \"right\" or \"wrong\" views. This anime assumes you are wise enough to judge the world around you and then ultimately realize a harsh truth, all we know is that we know nothing. Dissertations could be made on this anime and it definitely does deserve rewatching to pick up on themes that one may have missed the first time or to think about certain aspects if they were taken to their logical conclusion. In many ways I would call this a masterpiece, but I would also call it something sort of strange or alien in the world of anime as there isn't really anything like it.\

    Shinsekai Yori made me angry.\
Shinsekai Yori made me bored.\
Shinsekai Yori was amazing.\
Shinsekai Yori made me want to read the novel instead of watching.\
Shinsekai Yori is gonna be a huge mess to criticize. I'm as polarised as can be since the anime is both a diamond in the rough and complete and unabated mess. I myself don't even know how I really feel about this. I was bored and annoyed at so many things and then the ending almost entirely made up for every single bad part of it(something which I never say).\
Let's kick out the lesser issues before breaking down the story:\
Characters: 7 : wow,\
          \
        realistic, non-anime characters at all. No over the top, no expansive, no exceptional or wierd ones. Just real people doing realistic things.\
Are they nice?\
Not really. They really do not shine at all. I think SSY might've been reinforced with more vibrant, emotional anime characters. It might have served its purpose very well to have quirky, likeable anime girls be put in the dark and deep world of Shinsekai Yori. But sort of bland as they all are, I still ended up liking Saki a good bit and none of them are a problem. Cohesive, realistic and that's it. \
Sound: 7 : Good job. Some nice songs (one of the main tunes kept reminding me of the Shire theme from LOTR though) and in general it's a good job. Since characters rarely overreact the voice actors are somewhat sheltered, but I don't think any of it was ever a real problem.\
So now let's get to the story.\
SSY is split in 4 parts. Parts which are very, VERY different from one another and generally do not do a good job at all of feeling like they are from the same anime. Each of the parts represents one of Saki Watanabe's important life periods, and the differences in tone, point and message between each are pretty drastic.\
First you get Saki and her 4 friends in childhood, where they learn the DEEP DARK SECRETS of their world.\
Then you get one of Saki's friend in quite a pinch.\
Then you get two of Saki's friends in quite a pinch.\
Then it's all out war and it's coming thiiiiiis close to the end of the world as we've known it.\
Now without spoiling I'm giving 10 to the story, because it is outstanding. The world is cohesive and well thought out, the storylines make complete sense, the situations are diverse and intricate as well as generally interesting. It may not be absolutely mind blowing but if \"outstanding\" is the requirement, then yes, it does stand out quite far beyond any other animes I've ever watched, except Ghost in the Shell SAC.\
But the excellent story is unfortunately not very well portrayed or served by this anime. \
The first problem that bothered me with SSY is that none of the parts seem to compliment each other properly, despite appearances. They do not so much each add to Saki's life experience as seem to be a mishmash of different storylines that should converge to a deep overarching narrative, but seldom manage to.\
In a clear (non-spoily) metaphor: let's say I wanna make a cake. I'm getting my ingredients, I read the recipe, I smash and mix and stir and put in the oven. Then I eat it and it's good.\
SSY feels more like someone read the recipe 4 times, got all the ingredients while reading the recipe, then smashed and read the recipe again, then stirred, realised he forgot something in the mix, put it in, stirred again, read the recipe again to make sure, and then put it in the oven.\
And no, it's not nearly as good.\
To break the metaphor, a ton of elements in this show are presented either at the wrong time, either with a terrible pacing, sometimes too fast and other times too slow. It makes me roll my eyes to write it, but I many times complained that this was TOO SLOOOOOOOOW, before complaining right after that too many things were glossed over quickly and they could've used more pacing. And I was right in both cases.\
With the first part of the story, you get roughly 4 full episodes where literally nothing happens. Nothing at all. All that happens is that we get the world introduced to us. Yes, over 1h20mins of introduction. Overkill much? Not only is it a very slow and boring part, but it's not that dense either. The characters are preteen kids at this point, and spending this much time on a child's perspective of an obscurantist world is an almost complete waste until their first real adventure, which also happens with them being kids but is more lighthearted than the rest of the anime.\
The second part is more interesting but it also shows one of the biggest problems I had with this anime: incompetence at properly telling a story on part of the anime's director or editor. Or both of them. At the end of part 1 the kids have done something very naughty and they are about to get a harsh punishment. Except it doesn't happen for reasons that we are told much later. That by itself I can deal with.\
But part 2 starts immediately after, we jump through several years of the characters' lives, their personalities and situation has drastically changed, and it's like I'm looking at something entirely different now, with virtually no explanation as to how they came there from being on the brink of severe punishment. The characters, the stakes, the opinions, the dangers, the tone, they've all changed from minute 22 to minute 0. Imagine the Harry Potter movies, but all of them done over the course of a 25 episode anime. That's what it felt like, like we got out of one phase/movie and then another rolls in instantly after and feeds us a completely different story pie. Now I don't hate any of the pies it gives me, but a bridge between preteenagehood and mid-teenagehood would've been nice. Instead it felt like I was watching some sort of picture book taken at every holiday, and I passed a page and the page after was several years later.\
And while I don't hate any of the stories in this, I sincerely think that part 2 is the most inconsequential and sort of pointless of the entire anime. It is supposed to be the biggest shift in tone of the anime, so I suppose that was its point, but it really felt like an extension of part 1 that isn't followed by anything. What part 1 introduced is here in stronger, darker, more evil. Part 2 also has one of the most surprising twists in the anime, but to be honest, I never felt like this twist had a real point in the overarching story. Again, it feels like a mishmash of ideas, a random mixup of thoughts and concepts that can work when in a novel they are given a long, individual care and lots of expository lines, but in an anime it works differently, and I think part 2 just completes one of Saki's friends' story and I was sort of dumbstruck with a big \"why\" about it. Why even do this entire part at all? Was it to try and make it a whole lot darker than part 1? If so job's done, but what happens in part 2 goes way beyond getting darker and it sort of shocked me that so many elements that are made or used in part 2 ultimately did not mean much.\
Now it might sound like I'm nitpicking, but part 3 and 4 are a perfect sequel to one another, and to the events of part 1. \
While part 1 introduced LENGTHILY the world and was the most dull by far, part 3 and 4 provide new, cohesive storylines that add to the overarching plot. So what is the point of part 2? I do not know. It truly feels like a side story that would work in a book with hundreds of pages where tone and pacing aren't as important as in an anime, but here...\
So maybe SSY the anime is cursed from the start for being an anime based on a real novel of hundreds and hundreds of pages, and it unfortunately isn't very well presented because of it?\
Maybe.\
But then there's the Art.\
And I have no idea where these other reviews found the art good.\
Ok the still images sometimes are nice, fields, forests, etc. Faces mostly look good. And some buildings and more intricate things look very nice...\
But what about the eye?\
Saki's eye.\
Saki's somehow mesmerizing eye. So mesmerizing that I had to see a huge zoom-in on her deadpan eye at least once in every single episode. Especially in the first half.\
What's with all the stills that have literally no animation except lip movement?\
What's with the obvious, glaring lack of effort at making it all feel alive and moving? Many times, we don't even get the courtesy of a still with a moving camera, we just get nothing. Long, long still images of nothing. No head tilts, no eyebrows, no body movements, noooooothing. A big long moment of deadpan faces talking in a circle. Then a zoom into a character's eye(almost always Saki's). Then more deadpan talking.\
How about the repeated attempts at telling something important with abstract slide shows of seemingly random images that should've apparently made me understand something(which I didn't)?\
How about ALL................\
How about the VERY numerous and very annoying times where in an anime, characters verbally explain things that happened to each other instead of showing it?\
..................THE\
How about I waste more of your time with more how abouts?\
Let's cut to the chase here: it's not terribly drawn, it has some neat things to look at, even if the characters are wayyyy too deadpan and oftentimes the only \"animation\" that I remember on their face is tears on their eyelids and cheeks.\
But there are a thousand ways to tell a story with visuals, give it proper pacing, and set a style that agrees with the tone.\
Shinsekai Yori's anime makers didn't know ONE. I am serious when I say that while its message and general storyline were very, very interesting and I'd put it as one of my top animes ever when it comes to story, the animation, storytelling, conversion from novel to anime, and general \"art\" in the sense of transmitting something from creator to viewer through any other means than verbally explaining them, were all REALLY TERRIBLE.\
......................DAMNED\
I was mad at this anime, several times. I was mad at many things. I got mad when I felt like so many important points weren't clear. When a lot of things I should've expected from a properly told story weren't told, or were barely told. I was bored, mad, annoyed, and generally wanted to drop Shinsekai Yori. And the worst about it is, I really, really didn't hate anything it said, even its most inconsequential parts didn't bother me really. I just felt, in every way, like it was bad. \
Having an overall good to excellent message, making interesting points, giving a story that's enjoyable, deep and cohesive, and at the same time having it portrayed in an amateurish, uninventive and generally bad way, yeah I got mad at this. For half the anime I was in this state where I am interested, I wanna know what's going on, I wanna go on, but everything I see just puts my nark on and I wanna yell what the hell am I watching.\
I seriously wanted to give this a 6 and call it quits until the last few episodes.\
......................ELLIPSES?\
And very much to my surprise because this literally never happens(first time for everything!) yes, the ending does make up for almost all the BS. Almost.\
The last few episodes of Shinsekai Yori are brillant. If the whole anime was done this well it would be a 10/10, no doubt. Their pacing is great, they are dense and make great use of both characters and plot, they do not dawdle in pointless banter(or little enough that it doesn't really harm anything), they just shine as bright with the storytelling as the entire thing shines with its world and story.\
What was going to be an angry and bored 6/10 shot itself to a 9/10. Now I was too mad and too bored for too long to honestly give it a 9, but I'm tempted.\
The quality of storytelling, once stripped from laziness and its most debatable ideas (I still didn't understand a single one of those mind slideshows that Saki had), rocketed to very good, and combined with an excellent climax to a deep and interesting story, made this one of the most satisfying moments of all year. I just need to find out how to convince my friends with the argument \"but it gets really good at the end\" now.\
I want to lavish praise on Shinsekai Yori, because it makes me want to watch again even though I just finished earlier today. It caught my attention and never let me go from the first adventure to the end. I want to tell everyone I know to force themselves to watch it despite the awful storytelling, because the ending pays off so well and because it ultimately, despite all my frustrations, comes off as a very good watch. More than anything I want to tell people to try it because despite the artworking misleading you slightly, this show is dark. And I mean child assassination, implied drugging and forced breeding from war prisoners before kidnapping of infant and assassination of the parents, terrorism, suicide attacks, bombing, brainwashing, obscurantism, fascism, genocides(yes lots of those), use of weapons of mass destruction, and so on, dark. Not the \"I dress black because I'm dark\" or even the \"my path is blood and war\" dark. Actual dark. Horrifyingly, devastatingly and traumatizingly dark. And a show that's deep, dark, and intelligent deserves to be tried, even if it only pays off by the end.\
Had this show been in storytelling, showing without telling, animation effort and quality, and pacing what the original novel was in intelligence and inventivity, it might have ended up being one of my all-time favorites. It wasn't the case, and I consider that a huge shame. But I'll still recommend Shinsekai Yori to anyone who is, like me, the type that doesn't like to drop unless he's absolutely 100% certain that it's shit. Because you might get very bored, you might get very annoyed, and it might certainly not be a very good anime, but it is a story and a portrayal worth trying to the end at all costs.\
And now, I got my hands on the fan-made english translation of the shamefully commercially unavailable novel and I'm gonna read it.\

    Overall: 6/10 (above average)\
Shinsekai Yori's story is the primary motivator for watching the anime.  The first episodes are somewhat boring, but as the past starts to be revealed (themes of war and human rights), the suspense intensifies.  While I was never blown-away by anything in the series, it managed to keep the suspense and mystery through the final episodes, as the darkness of humanity's past (and present) is brought to light.\
The visuals are sharp and uniquely surreal with strange creatures and devices.  The soundtrack is well themed to the atmosphere of the show.\

    If I had to recommend an anime from this year or the last, I'd recommend this one. Shin Sekai Yori or \"From the New World\" is truly a great piece of work.\
Story\
A lot of effort was put into the story and it showed on the anime. It flowed almost flawless, that you didn't even realize that you just watched 20+ minutes of it. The subtle clues, the main characters progression from young to older, everything was done so well. As for the premise of the story? It's very simple. The value of human life. If you've seen the entire anime you'll know what I mean\
          \
        because you watched that last episode and if you haven't seen it, just keep watching. I promise it will get you hooked. The art work might turn you off, but like they say \"don't judge a book from it's cover\"; the art work is the least important item in this anime and guess what? It makes no difference in the high quality of this show.\
Art\
Like I said, it isn't great, neither is it terrible. It's pretty average, but it just doesn't seem to matter when you have a great story line and characters. In the end isn't that what's more important? Still I enjoyed the ending sequence from the 1st part of the season. Loved the whole fire works show.\
Sound\
I really enjoyed the 1st ending song. It just seemed to fit in with this anime. As for the other stuff such as voice acting and the such, just superb. I don't think they could have come up with a better seiyu than the one they came up for Saki. Her voice convey's the feelings just right and you can really feel the emotion.\
Character\
For the most part they were great. Saki is a great main character with depth and looks. Yakomaru was a great character who represents a difficult situation in the story line. For the most part the main characters of this show really delivered. They are not boring or dull. They all have their issues, problems, etc and they are not generic at all. \
Overall\
I enjoyed this anime a lot. It has such great depth and character that it doesn't need fancy artwork or a bunch of jpop to make it great. It stands solely on the story and characters who are by far some of the best I've seen in all my years of watching anime. You know those tv shows, movies, etc that really make you think? Well this is that kind of anime. I give a 10 because it is just a great piece of work. A masterpiece imho. Definitely recommend.\

    Story- 7/ \
Decent set up and great development, suffers from poor writing. \
This anime has a decent enough set up, as outlined in the synopsis. The mysterious atmosphere is both created and well maintained through a series of developments in the story. Even if some of these ‘developments’ are fairly weak, your interest as a viewer is well maintained. What was great about Shinsekai was that you always felt that the story was advancing, even if you weren’t sure what to. A great success for this genre. The conclusion thus felt very smooth and conclusive.  \
The story does however jump around a tad too\
          \
        much. Previous Unsolved mysteries would suddenly make surprise appearances, change something in the story, and then disappear. Equally, the story in Shinsekai Yori would often skip a few years and infill those years with a quick ‘’so and so did this and their actions resulted in that’’. Maybe this is just the writers being lazy, maybe this is a result of poor translation between the novel and the anime. Whatever it is, Shinsekai Yori’s story didn’t feel as intelligent as it could have. \
My biggest disappointment with Shinsekai Yori was with the detail. The anime used the excuse of all historic records being destroyed and this ‘time jumping aspect’ (mentioned above) to avert any detailed explanations of events. More detail in the world at the time (especially for the queerat races), cantus in general and the history of the world would have greatly helped the impact of the ending. \
Characters- 7/ \
Interesting  characters, suffers from poor writing. \
The main character was perfect. In this case, when I say perfect, I mean annoyingly perfect. In a sad scene she would cry, in a happy scene she would laugh, etc. She just did what the ideal character would do in every situation, and she thus felt a bit extreme for a human being. The main character needs some flaws and needs to cross some lines; and Shinsekai did not deliver this.   \
It was difficult to tell what characters were more important in the story at any given time. The writers used the logic that if a character is banging another character, they will automatically be more important. And with that seemingly being their only logic, each member in the main group of friends literally ends up banging each and every single other member of the group, depending on who needs developing. This happens regardless of gender. Yes, regardless of gender. Anyone who is not in a relationship is forgotten and what you end up is a very varied character development and a misplaced sense of importance within the group (relationships were so spur of the moment and shallow that the ‘banging’ technique often didn’t work). The same thing happens with the supporting cast; people would appear and disappear when needed. There needed to be more consistency. You could argue this leads to a greater sense of mystery with what is to happen, but there are better ways of achieving this. \
Other than these points, the characters were all interesting enough and all did add to the overall atmosphere. \
Art/sound-7/ \
Great work. \
The media in Shinsekai Yori created a fantastic atmosphere, full of mystery and fantasy. There was a depth to the soundtrack that made every mood successful and the artwork helped to further accentuate this.\
Enjoyment- 7/ \
Personal dissatisfaction with outlined issues \
Shinsekai Yori was engaging enough to keep me watching. The initial set up is decent enough, but it seriously restricted how ambitious the anime could’ve been. You could see it struggling to make a good story out of a flawed idea. In the end however, it did deliver and I was satisfied with what I saw. I think there was just some problems with translating the novel  into an anime.\
Overall-7/ \
Just about worth a watch. \
Decent but restrictive story which is well developed and explored with an array of interesting characters that add to the overall sense of mystery and fantasy. Worth a watch. \

    Shinsekai Yori was an incredibly beautiful anime.\
Story:\
The story, adapted from a Japanese novel, was a masterpiece.  It gave the underlying impression that \"even a seemingly perfect society is one run by cheating and lies.\"  The concepts were all deeply provoking, and my interest was held all the way through excluding a slightly slow beginning.  Overall, the story made me think- something that a horror anime like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni or a comedy like Ika Musume could not accomplish.  It left me with a better understanding of people and society, and I loved every minute of it.\
Art/Sound:\
The art was for\
          \
        the most part amazing, excluding some small errors.\
The first ED, \"Wareta Ringo\"/\"Sliced Apple\", was amazing, and even after listening to it on repeat for many many hours I still have not grown tired of it.  The lyrics, if you read them translated, define the story beautifully, and the animation is superb.\
The second ED, \"Yuki ni Saku Hana\"/\"A Flower Blooming in the Snow\", has less of an effect on me. It is beautiful as well, but was not a good replacement for Wareta Ringo at all.\
Characters:\
The characters were somewhat unmemorable at the beginning, and I had a hard time telling them apart for a while.  By the second story arc, however, I knew each one of them well and had developed feelings for each one.  The anime did a good job of allowing the viewer to bond to the characters, seeing as you follow them through their entire lives in this futuristic society.\
I would definitely recommend this anime to all who like intriguing and speculative fiction.  It is slightly scary at times, but mostly the psychological aspect is the chilling part.  Watching this anime made me want to go back and read the novel!\

    I am usually a fan of dystopian futures in all forms of media and wholeheartedly recommend this to fans of the dystopia genre, in general. Shinsekai Yori brings interesting elements into the utopia/dystopia story (including \"natural\" altering of DNA and fountains of youth) and covers many bases in a relatively short time.\
The Good:\
This story is intoxicating. Even in episodes where very little happens, the cold pause at the end of every episode is a cue for personal reflection. Lack of action and slow pacing is somewhat bothersome, but it is used well to cause viewers to better feel and experience the moments of amnesia and\
          \
        loss experienced by the characters. The slip of time, the slip of memory, and the emptiness of loss are well expressed through imagery rather than dialog, and I found that to be interesting, although some effectiveness was most likely lost in the process.\
The Bad:\
I found myself muttering \"That's selfish,\" more than once and can see the selfishness that was ubiquitous in the characters and the culture. Perhaps this was the writer's intention, but it did leave me lacking in compassion for certain moments that probably could have used a little more of my compassion.\
The drawing and animation of the characters always felt a little distorted. It is an interesting style, but could also be a little distracting. That being said, there were still some very powerful images and sequences that make up for a lot of the faults.\
Although it may be unavoidable due to budget/time/technology/not sure, 3D animation was a little too obvious and awkwardly sat on top the the highly stylized 2D drawings.\
There were moments of information overload. I can understand there may be a function or meaning to just dumping a thousand years of history, science, and various information all at once, but reading it through subtitles was a little difficult to say the least.\
Everything else:\
As a point-of-view piece, I would just like to note that this follows the stream of consciousness of the main character, Saki. Unfortunately, as with many stories that also follow narration, there are simply pieces of the story missing; i.e. when characters are not around Saki, you have almost no clue where they are or what they are doing. Nonetheless, the anime holds very faithful to the stream of consciousness storytelling, and information is revealed as it would be to the main character, leading to what many would say are plot holes. I'm not sure if these would be plot holes or simply differences in the conclusions drawn by the character and reality. Either way, it can be a difficult to follow if watched too casually.\
The morality of the story was very vague and left open to interpretation with nudges in many directions; however, I felt that \"scientists\" were demonized a little too much, but I suppose everyone was demonized a little too much.\
Overall:\
I am happy I watched this anime. I watched the whole anime over the course of 3 days, and it managed to infiltrate my dreams in very interesting ways (not horrifying ones, thankfully). It's a dark work for a mature crowd and is a dystopian future tale that is well-suited for today.\

    Can you imagine what the world would look like in a hundred years or so? Will we be living in a just and humane society, a utopia in other words or will chaos prevail and what lies ahead of us is a dystopia, a world filled with hatred and anguish? Thinking ahead of what civilization would look like in the future is difficult itself but Shinsekai yori has a rather intelligent concept of such.\
Indeed, Shinsekai yori has exceeded my expectations of what I thought would be a typical anime with a fairly sensible plot and it has also lead me to believe that it is\
          \
        the epitome of intelligent animes.\
I've said this before but my bases for rating anime are rather special and not commonly used, as these are my personal and subjective criteria.\
1. ARTISTRY: 10/10\
\"Artistry is the quality that appeals to one's sense of beauty.\"\
Artistry is an important quality in an anime. It determines the first impression. If the animation looks ugly and it does not appeal to the audience's eye, they would develop a bad impression of the anime and they wouldn't be fond of it. However, if the art, sound, and other elements that pertain to artistry are realized and shown in a nice way, a good impression is bound to develop and the audience would enjoy the anime.\
It would be absurd if I would say that this anime, Shinsekai yori, didn't accomplish this. The animation itself is exquisite, not to mention the development of each character. If you compare this anime to all the other anime, you would and should realize that the plot, the character development, the animation, more or less everything are unique. It's not the typical elements you see nowadays, like a maiden in search for true love, a moe character that's very shy, or a tsundere in that matter. Each and every character had an exclusive personality and all of them played a specific role and their part.\
The soundtracks as well were nice but not many songs were utilized. Well, I guess it's part of making the show appear not with a playful mood but a rather solemn and serious one. Nevertheless, the soundtracks that were used, especially the ending theme songs, are impressive.\
2. INTELLECTUAL VALUE: 10/10\
\"Intellectual value refers to the anime stimulating thought. It enriches our mental life by making us realize fundamental truths about life and human nature.\"\
This is the strongest focal point shown in Shinsekai yori. The way the plot was laid out and the essence of the plot itself is what magnifies this aspect.\
Shinsekai yori, as I reiterated earlier, has got to be the most intelligent anime I've watched. The way the plot was set up and laid out, basing its setting on a very futuristic time and utopia, it's very interesting to see how the makers of this anime perceived what the future would look like after a hundred years or so. I just can't help to think that such a fictional story could seem so realistic in nature. \
3. SUGGESTIVENESS: 9/10\
\"Suggestiveness is the quality associated with the emotional power shown and experienced by the audience.\"\
Suggestiveness is a very important element in composing a good anime. The power of emotion always drives us to our conclusions as whether it is nice or not so utilizing suggestiveness of emotions is the best way to guarantee a good remark from the audience.\
Undoubtedly, Shinsekai yori did a good job in keeping our moods intact. Many scenes demonstrated various moods. Happy moods, sad moods, nostalgic, melancholic, chaotic, everything. I don't plan to specify a specific scene, as I do not want to give spoilers for those who are reading this review before watching the anime.\
Most of the time, though, it seems that they're overusing the dilemma situations on Watanabe Saki, creating a suspense-filled mood. Nevertheless, those were all portrayed nicely but I guess that's a point they can improve on.\
4. SPIRITUAL VALUE: 10/10\
\"Spiritual value is the quality wherein which the show elevates the spirit by bringing out moral values which make us better persons.\"\
\"The power of imagination is what changes everything.\"\
That one statement determines that this anime deserves a 10/10 for its spiritual value. Everything that occurred in the whole story revolves around that one quote. It's nice to know that this anime was able to manifest the plot's morals and revolve the message of the story on one concept.\
5. PERMANENCE: 10/10\
\"Permanence is shown when a great show endures time and space. Thus, it immortalizes its maker along with the show itself.\"\
Ten over ten. Watching this is a very memorable experience. I like how anime teaches you something valuable and engraves something in your mind and heart forever and Shinsekai yori succeeded in doing so.\
While the general audience may not exactly be universal, since it does have some rather profane content, all those who watch it should have a good impression on such a well-made anime.\
OVERALL: 9.8/10 or 10/10\
So, overall, what's the point? This is the point. Shinsekai yori is a unique anime that is not often seen in the animes we have today. Not only that, it excels in many aspects. Shinsekai yori would serve to be a good basis and a good role model for other animes to follow. This, I believe, is a milestone of the history of anime and I can guarantee, after you watch Shinsekai yori, you won't forget about it.",

    The human psyche. Nothing is more mysterious or more compelling than it. Even 1000 years into the future and man is no closer to understanding it and as a result, no closer to understanding “others.” What is ethical and furthermore, what is humanly ethical? When does man ceases to being something considered “human?” We who are seemingly bounded by nothing are bounded by some of the smallest things in our universe: our genome. Today we will be looking at an anomaly from 2012-2013 based on the novels by Kishi Yūsuke entitled “新世界より” (From the New World) and how these questions are in essence the main\
          \
        concepts within the animation. \
At first, it appears that Shinsekai Yori has a fantasy feel to it with all the magic and rituals and whatnots presented to the audience as a normal and widely accepted occurrence in this given society. All seems well when we are introduced to a cast of friends with most focus on Watanabe Saki, our main protagonist yet I use this sparingly. She was the last to gain access to her 呪力(magical powers or “Cantus”) and accepted in Sage Academy yet instead of rejoicing, fear was among those close to her, particularly her parents. As it goes on, however, the story soon delves into the mysteries that surround their strikingly utopian society and a dystopia is soon realised. Set a century into the future from present day, it is brought to light that a “great catastrophe” occurred during the ancient times (our time/present day) that led to the fall of man. However, through natural selection, among other things, we have our resurrected society where humans are the supreme beings and blessed with the power of the gods: Cantus. \
Central to Shinsekai Yori is the idea of human ethics. What is human and what ethical. Two fundamental cornerstones of a successful society that enables us to work together to achieve so much yet at the same time separates us since there is no true answer to both of these, only merely a collect list of items that fits the bill by a majority consensus. There was never a clear “plot” per say in Shinsekai Yori, just a group of kids discovering the ugly side of the world they live in. Yet it soon becomes evidently clear that problems are not just with the humans alone. They coexist with a species of highly intelligent animals called Queerats. Yet the Queerats are subjected by the humans since they lack the power of Cantus. Now don’t get me wrong, Cantus plays a crucial role within the animation and those who have seen Shinsekai Yori would probably call me out for downplaying its importance. \
“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” \
Of course we have all heard that with great power involves great responsibility. It is because of the power of Cantus that the society of Shinsekai Yori is only a fraction of the Golden Age of the ancient times. Fear of misuse of the power and the failure of retaliation, all stemming from man’s attempts at playing god and their eventual fall. \
Yet the truly captivating idiosyncrasy of Shinsekai Yori, for me personally, was the presentation of the Queerats and their struggles to keep their heads afloat amidst humans. Bring in Squealer, a highly intelligent Queerat of the Robber Fly colony that can speak the human’s language fluently. It becomes evident that everything Squealer does has an ulterior motive behind it and soon he leads a revolution amongst his kin and introduces democracy and equality, eventually gaining the courage to pursue the liberation of his kind. Having taken several college history courses, it brings to my mind not the first or the last revolution in history but still significant French Revolutions of the 18th century. Here, the Queerats strive for equality and portray “human” traits versus what was introduced to us as humans portraying at times animalistic behaviors. Going any further would result in spoilers but keep this concept in mind as it relates back to the big questions that were presented earlier.\
That isn’t to say that the entire show was without its faults as it becomes apparent that the show can become quite predictable along the way. Yet the anime does drop subtle yet eloquent hints that would foreshadow the coming doom that would aid the viewer into thinking in the right direction. Also something that irked me was the lack of answer to some of my questions. A few characters were left in the dark as the story progressed and their backstory never fully completed. It is understandable, however, that these characters were to aid in the plot and mystery surrounding Saki and her friends. It also helps the mystery overall as the viewer is left to piece together what the animation left unanswered.  Also a little jarring was the transition from mystery to Tomb Raider treasure hunting near the end. A small point but a point nonetheless. \
Produced by A-1 Pictures, Shinsekai Yori is usually well animated and the backdrop is extremely detailed and pleasing to look at, subjective as this is. Character animations differ from the norm as the characters are more unusually slightly slender than the norm but then again, what would be considered to be the norm. It is worth mentioning, however, that near the end animation does get a little choppy as I began to notice that facial features didn’t always match up with head movements. As I am no animator, I’m in no position to judge whether it was done correctly or not but it just didn’t sit well with me. \
Sound for the most part was extremely well executed and most BGMs were intricately woven into certain sections of the show that evoked certain emotions. It is a downer though that the most memorable piece “Kage no Denshouka Daiichibu” was severely overplayed and eventually became repetitive. On the plus side, the mystic of the piece was enjoyable and truly did fit in with the entirety of the show. Not many other pieces stood out well enough for they were mostly overshadowed by the one piece. Also interesting to note was the fact that there was virtually no opening except for one in the entirety of the show and the one was used to emphasize the situation at hand. The endings weren’t bad either as I would actually listen to them rather than skip them entirely.\
Characters were well done in the sense that they did their job at presenting the many facets of the human psyche. Never devoid of emotions, nearly all characters portrayed quite well emotions that would cause controversy today, especially sexuality in any regard. Brought to life by the characters is the question of what make a human “human” and what is right. Both sides are argued and the audience makes the decision. Enthralling was the fact that the kids did not remain as children. They grew up, something that many animes today deny the viewer and actually expect us to accept that teenagers can solve world problems. Fallacious claim yet still rings true to a certain extent. \
As stated before, Shinsekai Yori was a rather dark anomaly, diverting from the usual genres of animation. It left a great impact on me personally as a philosophy student by showing me how insignificant I am in the grand scheme of things. \

    Shinsekai Yori is an excellent dystopian anime held slightly held back by its pacing. The concept is that sometime in the 21st century certain humans developed intense telekinetic powers, called Cantus, which allowed them to control ANY form of matter. Some of these humans lost their mind due to the powers and began mass murdering entire populations, making it so almost all non-Cantus-wielding humans were elimintated. The plot of this anime concerns the society that develops around these super-powered telekinetic humans.\
I felt it necessary to include this description of the plot because this anime revolves HEAVILY around world-building, and it is done excellently. The \
          \
        anime follows 5 children learning about, and being indoctrinated by their society. This serves as a tool for the writers to show how their society has been built up around the Cantus users and the logic and successes and failures of said society. The characters are central to this world building, and there are a few episodes where that are pretty much just characters talking about the world around them and doing nothing. This leads to the main and only real weakness of the anime, the pacing. \
Despite having a very strong world, and an interesting story to tell within this world, the series just moves too slowly. Characters often reiterate things we already know about the world and the anime is filled with a lot of silence and slow moving scenes.  I think this is partially done because the characters are trying to understand the world themselves, as they are mostly children, however it makes the anime somewhat boring at times and I felt like I had to force myself through parts of it just to get to that juicy world-building. This is definitely NOT a shonen despite being a kind of coming of age story about 5 kids with superpowers. It is very somber and serious and devoid of much action or happiness. Personally I dropped the anime twice, just because I wanted something more engaging but kept coming back because the characters and the world are so well made.\
A note on art and sound: The art and sound are very cohesive throughout the anime. The art style is semi-realistic, and uses a lot of greys, browns, and dark greens. This gives the world a very muddled and somber feel to it. The sound is excellent, I found myself remembering most of the background music and the credit theme is 10/10 even though it doesn't fit with the rest of the anime very well.\
Overall I would still recommend this anime to most people but totally understand if most of them didn't like it. You have to get into the world in order for some of the slower episodes to be worth it, but damn is the world interesting. Maybe I am just being a bit picky about the pacing, and if you don't mind slower animes that much then you will definitely enjoy this one.\

Why I rated Shinsekai yori  very bad \"3\"?\
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
It's the perfect example for the fantasy/sci fi genre done badly.  The world-building was lazy and uninspiring. The characters, mainly Saki, Satoru, Maria, Shun and Mamoru are boring to the core and their personalities add zero to the story. That's because they don't actually have one... they're all the same thing but with different designs. Is that really what we need in anime?  The story is fairly simple... oh but tries hard to be complex and hard to understand! By confusing the audience with useless narrative tricks (in this case): weird time-leaps; zero\
          \
        foreshadowing (quite important in anything with mystery).\
The story is about humans in a far future, in a isolate and fragile community where some people have a psychic ability.  Using this ability isn't free of rules and countermeasures imposed by the \"elders of the village\" to protect the village from itself . . .and then there is: tainted cats  and queerats (intelligent rats who view humans as gods) and they all hide secretive and dangerous information, that children aren't allowed to know, because spoiler-ish reasons.  \
Insert here \" rural yet dystopic and set in the future society\" + \"supernatural post-cataclysm\" + \"1 dimensional characters\" + \" humans versus beasts theme\" + \"soft and pastel colors and pretty shading\" =  Shinsekai yori   (and waste of time)\
I'm sorry A1 Pictures I'm really not impressed and please, next time, keep in mind that world-building isn't or shouldn't be all about the right colours and the right shading. The drama and the horror should also be prepared, or it will fail its purpose. I guess it's lesson number 1 in storytelling.\

    From the New World  -  新世界より (Review Spoiler Free)\
Overview \
From the new world or Shineskai Yori is an adaptation of Yusuke Kishi's 2008 novel of the same name and is set in Japan's Kamisu era a 1000 years into the future. This world on first impression is an idyllic one in which the citizens live in an extraordinarily peaceful existence in small agrarian villages. In this world everyone possesses interesting physic abilities which elevate them to the levels of gods in the eyes of the other sentient race in this universe  'The Monster Rats'. Throughout this series we follow the trials and\
          \
        tribulations of Saki as she peels back the various fibberies which make up Kamisu society and gasps as she realizes that underneath it all is a steaming shit bowl of social control, psychic conditioning and hierarchical artifice. \

What's Good \
What's good about this show and what's good about the best anime in general is the emotional and moral ambiguity that comes with it. Many shows in the west, in a rush to sound definitive, often lose their ability to present anything with any real nuance. That ambiguous nuance is something 'From the New World' does really well. The danger of a story like this with so much allegorical subtext is that it can become preachier than nine priests glued to a principle. From the new world offers no easy absolutes and the motivations for both sides of the narrative conflict are given equal and justifiable cause for their actions and viewpoints. Their are some interesting philosophical plot devices used in the story which are really used well. In particular the effects of the subconscious both individually (in Karmic Demons) and collectively (the topography and ecology of Tokyo) were a highpoint for me. \
__________________________________________________________\
What's Bad \
The human characters aren't anything special to be honest. They aren't bad they just feel slightly under-inflated. With the exception of Saki every character suffers from a real lack of plot development. This is a shame because many of the side characters (especially Shun) really could do with fleshing out before they get the shepherds crook and proverbial drunk toss. The monster rats Squealer and Kiroumaru are infinitely more interesting than their human counterparts and while that isn’t necessarily a bad thing it felt like an opportunity to create parity emotionally was lost. The biggest (50 foot elephant crapping on the floor while falling into a post wank nap sized) weakness for the show however, is the animation and direction in some of the episodes. The animation and coloring for episode five and ten are absolutely awful and went down about as well as a wet fart in church. I had to force myself through those episodes and for a show with such an rich and ambitious world that’s a real shame. Lastly I felt the exposition could have been handled a little more tactfully. There were times when we were spoon-fed whole episodes of lecturing exposition with little to know relieve. \
\
Is it worth Watching?\
Absolutely, the show overall was really strong. Although I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's not overly flashy and the pacing is quite slow, so if either of these things scare you please back away now. You need to use your brain with this one in order to really connect with this story. The viewer need to rationalize, criticize and judge the events, peoples and world they are exposed to in this story. If the prospect of doing this gets your intellectual blood flowing then 'From the New World ' is the show for you. \

    Shinsekai Yori(non spoiler review)\
AKA also known as From the New World is the most interesting anime I've watched so far. The story is unique, the characters are wacky, the art adds to the mysterious feel to it, and the sound/music is amazing. Everything added up together creates an eerie mysterious world that makes you wonder \"What is this world?\" \"Why are people like this?\" \"I'm kinda scared myself\" Now lets dive into the review:\
Story: IS OUTSTANDING. Story is creative, original, and well done. My only problem with this anime is the fact that the middle is excruciatingly slow. The details in the middle are crucial\
          \
        but it seems as if the story isn't progressing and it's just about some teens having some psychic powers. For those who watch and think the same, please continue watching. There's so much to the story in the future and it is absolutely worth watching, everything wrapped up in the end is what Shinsekai Yori's story a 10 for me. It makes you question your humanity and self worth and this anime didn't make me feel depressed in the end, it made me question my life. Yeah it's that deep so go ahead and watch this anime.\
Art: Art is really good. I liked it but it wasn't too my taste. Despite it being not my taste I still wanted to give it a 9 because of how good the art matches up with the atmosphere. The background is amazing and the characters look like they're from an old folkbook. \
Sound: I personally did not like the sound because it was too creepy for me but that's the beauty of it. Everything is done accordingly for the story's atmosphere and I really appreciate that. \
Characters: The characters were weird. The main MC is annoying but I enjoyed the fact that she was. There were many flaws in her personality and character but who doesn't have a flaw in real life? The main MC was very human like and made me irritated a few times but as it turns out her personality had a huge contribution to the mystery of this story so I appreciate her a bit more. The other characters are odd and strange so I really liked how Shinsekai continued with the theme of mysteriousness.\
Overall this anime is amazing. Everything about it is amazing (except for the slow middle) but it really is interesting. I can't say much without spoiling but this anime is definitely worth your time but be careful it's a bit heavy so take your time with it and enjoy the world that Shinsekai Yori provides. 9/10.\

    Well what should I say, this anime is different from most others. Its most outstanding point is definitely the post-apocalyptic future scenario that is actually a paradise for humans with special abilities. It shows a not technically highly developed world; it reminds rather to a friendly past with an outstanding nature, a wonderful place for loving beings.\
For me the beginning and the end made the anime, because most valuable information was presented in those times. After the first few episodes you are actually interested what is going to happen next, although you still don’t know what this is all about. It really takes time to\
          \
        get into this scenario. The atmosphere is definitively very deep and the background and character drawings are simply beautiful.\
What really took a bit of my patience were most of the episodes in the middle of the show. They were stretched very far and often quite boring, because you are waiting so long for something significant to happen and at the end of the episode you just wonder when they are going to reveal some secrets or drive the plot of the main characters further. These slow and long episodes somehow stretch the series a lot. I also hoped for great fights between psychic users, because that is what the show is all about. Somehow the antagonists developed also different than expected. I hoped for a stronger plot twist in the middle in order to get some interesting and intelligent antagonists. For me the characters and the story would have had much more potential to make it more outstanding and stronger. The characters would have had also more growing potential except Saki maybe.\
But the hopes get much higher, especially for the final episode. After it you are finally able to understand the story and the history of this kind of civilisation. It’s like the puzzles finally fit together and make sense. First it makes you quite surprised because through the whole series you probably would not have thought of an out coming like this. After thinking about it again somehow it was quite enjoyable and definitely left a sense for a deeper meaning between species.",

    Shinsekai Yori is probably one of the best anime I have ever watched. It has a very slow start to it, but around episode 5 is when is gets better. \
This anime has actually taught me something, it made me think about the world we live in now, the real world.\
 The way the humans treated the mole rats is kinda how I see humans treating animals.\
 Just because they aren't \"smart\" or whatever that nonsense is. Just because they are \"different\" \
If you watch this anime you will slowly see what I mean with the connection of mole rats and humans to the world\
          \
        we live in today. We are different, but the same. \
This will be an anime when you finish you will be like,\"wow, that was amazing.\" \
It also reflects off the daily life/what teens go through. It may not be exactly like the anime, but it's somewhat a small peak of what teens go romantically(but not as extreme)  \
This anime is truly amazing on how it builds, the character development, the plot twists, and the overall message. This is truly an underrated anime.   ",

Have you ever daydreamed about what life would be like in the future? Have you daydreamed about special abilities and how society would be fractured by whether one possesses said abilities? \
If so, stop reading now, and go watch this anime. You're still here? Grab a cup of koolaid and prepare to drink it.\
The story revolves around the lives of a group of friends growing up in a peaceful village that seems remarkably backwoods. Their lives as they grow, interplay with the relationships between each other, village superstition, relics from\
          \
        a bygone civilisation and their social status. The journey from the first episode till the last is one filled with mystery, adventure, discovery and enlightenment in a sense. If you've ever stared at a coin from decades past and wondered where that coin had been, this show lures you in with a similar bait. And boy does it reel you in with plot twists, heartache, beauty, vengeance etc. Keep in mind that when i say heartache, i don't mean those cheap tear milker types *Cough* Angel Beats *Cough*. I instead refer to the pains you feel once you have resonated on an almost spiritual level with a character/situation. \
The art is where things take a turn for the inconsistent. For the most part, you have your standard level of quality. Character designs specifically are especially pleasant, save for one caveat; quality drops. A few episodes have some very questionable character art.\
The sound is immersive. It draws you in and submerges you into this world, blending beautifully with the story and art. Enough said.\
Characters. Absolutely fantastic. Never have i seen characters depicted so realistically with all their strengths and shortcomings. Together with the story, the characters elevate this show to a standard that i have yet to see achieved by any other show thus far. The fact that no character can be seen as evil is a testament to how well their actions are justified in reality. These actions being the result of ill treatment or otherwise paints a picture so painfully realistic, that even during the times where i was hoping for the success of protagonists, never once did i hope for the antagonists to fail. I was that conflicted. It is in the characters you see depth and evolution based on their experiences across the episodes.\
Enjoyment-wise, it was never a dull moment. I've seen a couple anime and i can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite amongst the others. When an anime makes you remember things you learned during, philosophy, sociology and psychology classes, AND leaves you with that satisfied but ultimately melancholic feeling at its end, you know you watched a masterpiece. Enough of me gushing, let's see the numbers.\
Story - 10 : A \"what if\" type scenario executed beautifully\
Art - 7 : Instability of art quality, makes for instability of scoring. Lol. KMS.\
Sound - 8 : Beautiful and immersive. Complements the story and art nicely.\
Character - 10(11?) : The pinnacle of character development.\
Enjoyment - 10(11?) : Characters and story made this show. Literally. Ugh.\
Overall - 10 : Characters and story delivered us from choppy art quality\

    Initially I am reluctant to watch this anime because there is a homosexual (implicit) scene which is quite disturbing. But considering the scores listed on MAL it's very unfortunate to miss it just like that, only certain anime gets a score above 8.5. I do not make MAL as a good benchmark-at least a story but as a worthy benchmark-at least this anime to try. Actually, the ease is already provided by the author, the homosexual scene series is full in episode 8. After watching it, I myself realize that there's no point worrying about what I'm worried about, the homosexual scenes are not as\
          \
        explicit as the talk, even the scene Can not be said as fanservice, because the purpose is clear & an important part of the elaboration plot.\
Basically the homosexual behavior is a projection of an ideality. They are a bonobo community that uses sexual stimulation to prevent conflict. They are symbols of utopia, because in their lives an argument, a commotion, or any kind of conflict never happens. It can be justified given the premise this time is the future that is always closely related to utopia and dystopia. The life of bonobos is a projection of social life in Shinsekai Yori. Well, very interesting is not it. In addition I also think, maybe Shinsekai Yori is one of the best projects A1-PICTURES.\
Shinsekai Yori's story tells Saki's life journey from childhood to adulthood. Although I did not read his novel serialization, I could tell that his adaptation to the animation world went successfully. Although her story seems rushed perhaps because of the limitations of the number of episodes, but the use of the story can be said to be efficient. The Author only conveyed the important things that happened to Saki's life and seemed to rule out things that did not seem to have much effect on the plot. Shinsekai Yori itself has many advantages that are not owned by other anime. Practically the number of weeded anime-heavy anopia can be counted on the fingers. I think the plot hole is not too deviate from the story\

NO SPOILERS.\
Under some positive peer pressure I have finished this anime 19/6/2017. This will be one of the most straightforward reviews you will ever read. Note: I have not read the manga.\
Setting: \
Would definetely promise you a unique story and a lot to take in, but not thoroughly explained and flawed. For example: We understand that humans with psychic abilities doesn't need things such as power tools but having NO electronic technology seems too extreme and unrealistic. For example humans should still have weapons for hunting. The range of psychic ability is too short and\
          \
        they can't even use psychic abilities as a form of communication.\
Character:\
Honestly not much character development, not necessary anyway. Everyone pretty much stayed the same. Also don't expect any waifu establishing. No \"interesting\" character designs, no audience \"bonding\" with the characters.  \
Music:\
Very appropriate and atmospheric, suits the \"eerie\" style of this anime. It is also the sole factor for the immersiveness for this show. No opening though. Some say it's to cut budget, some say it's for atmosphere.\
Pacing:\
Very good chronological order storyteling, though pacing can be waaaaay too slow sometimes. This is the most serious case of slow pace I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong I don't like empty-headed shounen either. But Shinseikai Yori is different from a thriller, it is very easy to put down and sometimes makes you wonder \"why am I still here.\" The story is interesting however some unnecessary parts drag on way too long. Conversations can stretch for more than half an episode. \
Overall:\
This anime is neither over/underrated. Actually it is \"overread.\" The plot actually does not have as much depth as you think. After reading online reviews I began this anime expecting a full on exploration on philosophy, societal and human values and anti-Utpoia. In reality the anime only explores these areas lightly. Even Parasyte will make you think more.\
WOULD I RECOMMEND YOU TO CATCH UP SHINSEIKAI YORI?\
NO\
REWATCH VALUE?\
Approaching zero.\
REWATCH VALUE FOR THOSE WHO THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT THE FIRST TIME?\
Still approaching zero. It's like a detective show, you can't watch it twice since you know everything. Especially going through the slow paced sections? Unimaginable.\
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW then yes you should see this.\

    Oh shinsekai yori, how i loved you in the first 5 episodes.  I didn't watch this as it was coming out, in fact i just finished watching this, but im pretty sure this is split into two seasons as to how randomly things changed after about 14 episodes.  I am going to say that Shinsekai Yori has a beautiful soundtrack, and really interesting art style, that is very eye catching.  The story is compelling at first but then get's really....confusing. \
The characters definitely take the lowest score here. I thought Saki was .....distasteful? Is that the right word? Basically she made way\
          \
        too many mistakes that by the end I just hated her.  Satoru had great development on the other hand.  I started off hating him, but by the end he was an okay guy.  \
The story is very mysterious at first, and for the first few episodes I was eager to keep watching to see what happened next.  But after a specific episode, the entire story seemed to change, and that's where this anime lost me.  It was like, \"okay theres this issue, its mysterious and all of us kids need to figure it out!\" and then it changed to a political war.  Maybe this anime was too heavy for me, just because the story seemed to be all over the place. I will say though, for the second half of the anime it was very interesting! The second half and the first half just seem like different stories.  \
The overall message was clear in the end, but there were a lot of plot holes and questions that needed to be answered. I feel like maybe they had too many ideas and not enough episodes to fit it all so they crammed everything into 25 episodes. \
Overall a 7/10 simply because i feel like it was all over the place.  It's one of those where you need to watch it a second time to really see the message, which isn't a bad thing, it just means that it requires more attention to all the details.  Which for a first time viewer can easily be missed.\

    This is probably the most unique, non-formulaic anime I've ever seen, and because of that I was willing to overlook some major issues with pacing, characters, and plotline, etc. Shinsekai Yori is weird in that it takes place in the future, but does not involve giant robots or space travel. There is \"magic\" in the form of psychokinetic ability, although there is a pretty decent scientific explanation behind it and many of the quirky aspects of the setting. This show would be very hard to place in any of the traditional genres/categories because of this, although if anything I would call Shinsekai Yori more of\
          \
        a dark fantasy than anything else.\
 I also liked that the story was told through the perspective of children, which allowed the viewer to come to understand the world of Shinsekai Yori in a more naturally progressive way. I gave the series and overall rating of 8 because of the aforementioned flaws, but it's a series that is so remarkably unique that I would recommend it to anyone who can handle its very dark themes.\
*Spoilers\
The main problem with the show, at least in my book, was the timing/progression of the story. The time skips, particularly the big one that started in episode 8, left me trying to figure out what was going on for a number of episode while also trying to process new information that was coming in. While I understand that the creators wanted the viewers to be just as disoriented as the remaining children as group 1, I believe they could have handled this a bit more elegantly. the way that it was handled made it feel like I'd accidentally skipped episodes. The fact that they combined this with memory fragmentation was what made it particularly problematic.\
The awkward progression of the story also led to a general feeling that some parts of the story went by too quickly/slowly, and many scenes felt as if they could've been replaced by something better.  The arc with the search for for Mamoru and then Maria/Mamoru for example, seemed to take a very long time even though we know how important that action was for the main plotline. The boulder game tournament from one of the early episodes, also, felt a bit unnecessary. There were far more fascinating things going on, why spend an entire episode on that? \
That brings me to the characters. I can't say that any of them really stuck out to me. Maybe this was the point, but the queerats - squealer and kiromaru - were the particularly interesting ones in the second half of the show. Although their motivations were obvious, their unpredictability actually made them scary. The main characters, by comparison, were predictable and I didn't find the various romantic entanglements between them all that convincing for whatever reason.\
Although the execution wasn't great, the story of Shinsekai Yori was what really elevated the show from the 6-7 \"averagish\" range in my book. It was interesting that some of the most important moments of the story were left up to the imagination. For example the writers knew that leaving the details of Maria/Mamoru's fate outside of the scope of the story made it all the more crushing upon the reveal. And then you begin to understand the feelings of apprehension whenever squealer appeared -- that was a brilliant design by the creators.\
So in the end, Ignoring a few plotholes, and random unbelievably stupid decisions (i.e. wasting the psycho buster), the show as a whole told a really fascinating story that ended in a very strange/unique feeling of emptiness. I don't think the show should be ranked along with the very elite of anime, but it should be watched if you can handle this kind of show. \

    This anime deserves an 11/10\
I am not as articulate as some of the other writers, so I will keep this short and simple. I gave this anime a hard 10. Let me start out by saying that this is not the kind of anime I usually watch. I usually prefer light-hearted anime with some comedy, romance, and action. Also, I felt obligated to write a review on this anime, (I've never written a review before) as I felt an 8.51 was a disgrace to the anime. \
I have watched excellent anime like Death Note, Attack on Titan, and Hunter x Hunter. I would rate all\
          \
        3 very highly (Hunter x Hunter being my favorite, for the sole reason it has a good mixture of comedy, drama, and action and is the style I prefer). However, this anime blew my mind.\
It is dark, cynical, and keeps you on your toes. Taking into account the story, and the way it was carried out, I would gives this anime an 11/10 if I could. This anime is mostly focused around keeping you in the dark, and every episode keeps you wanting to know more. (I don't say this lightly, as I've seen Death Note and Attack on Titan)\
If you have the guts to watch this anime, you will not regret it, I promise. \

    Slight spoilers ahead on the themes in the anime.\
What started out as a seemingly regressed, but peaceful, society, turned out to be so much more than that.   Every episode presented a dark twist into what happened in their history or what they've been doing behind the scenes to keep a seemingly peaceful society.   Methods such like population control, genetic manipulation, brainwashing, selective breeding, and other things to keep everyone as docile sheep.\
Definitely very thought provoking and kept me interested from beginning to end.\

    This was one of the few animes that really got me on the edge of my seat. I found the art amazing, although the characters' outfits are not as complicated as other animes that I have seen. I feel like the writer's choice of clothing for them added a touch of realism, like the characters actually have a connection to reality. That's also what made this series so thrilling and addictive at the same time, that connection. I remember starting out at episode 1, and ending up at episode 15 on the same day. I suppose that's not healthy, but watch the anime, and it\
          \
        will become evident that you too, cannot move from your seat.\
The artwork for this anime is simply astounding. It's very simple, but at the times where it matters, the level of skill picks up. I picked out a few hilarious and not so hilarious mistakes here and there, but overall, the art left a big impression in me. I suppose that's also why I started on this anime, the artwork. Now I can't say much else without spoiling the entire thing, so let's move on. \
Okay, let me just say this, the seiyuus express so much emotion in the character. It was like I was there. But hey, all good seiyuus are trained to do that, so I suppose this is a plus for all animes out there. \
The story. Well. I'll just say that the story far exceeded all of my expectations. I came in expecting a romance, a drama. What I got, was a shitload of plot twists, emotional trauma, some good ass action and adventures, and a whole bunch of sexual tension and booty calls. \
Now THAT's what a good story is all about, in my opinion. The 'laying off' of some characters were necessary for the plot to move along. Although I sometimes have a feeling like I'm just being played in a loop by the author. It sometimes feels like the anime is moving forward, yet NOT moving forward at the same time. \
I suppose this might just seem like another generic review boasting Shinsekai Yori's superiority over other animes to some of you readers, however, I believe that this is what it deserves. Screw being generic, I'll give the anime what it deserves. An Oscar, a Nobel Prize, whatever it wants. This, is just how good this anime was to me. \
P.S: I'm not saying any reviewers here or in the world has a generic point of view. You simply agree that this anime is either good or bad. And we all have our own reasons. I'd love to see people who has seen the anime thanks to any of our reviews do a review of this anime. It's sensible to give your own opinion. Heck, I'd be proud if my review helped a person decide whether to watch anime or not. Well then~ Ciao~\

    For me Shinsekai Yori is an anime about the history of humankind, despite the fact it takes place a thousand years from now. A very unique and good show that worth the praise and was refreshing to me in it's own right.\
I started watching Shinsekai Yori when it started airing in 2012 but stopped at episode 13 because I lost interest in it because I thought \"what a slow anime...\". I started it again from episode 1 in 2017 and finished it in a week. Now I think it was too fast and slow at the same time. The pacing of the story was a\
          \
        little bit slow for my taste, but the rate we received information about everything was too fast/not enough time has spent on it. Most of the time we got information about the current world and the last 1000 years in big (too big for me) fragments, which was good because we could somewhat empathize with the shock of the characters but it caused information loss for me and there were some parts I had to rewatch because of this and I'm not a big fan of rewatching dry information bits.\
Despite the pacing, the story was really good and it had quite a few plot twists. We got segments of the main characters life's with years in-between so we could concentrate on the more important bits. With the summary of the in-between years the story remained intact, did not got segmented. It was a very elegant way to tell it.\
As for the animation and art... I didn't like it that much. It was unique and likeable but sloppy more than once. I know that making an animation is hard work and I can accept some hiccups but there were a little bit too much for me. Also there were some parts in the animation that were completely unnecessary in my opinion or I just didn't get what they wanted to express with them. Although I have to praise it's fluidity. The scenes felt natural most of the time. Another great part was the effects. They were nice and subtle sometimes, really over the top in others and could strengthen the feel of each scene.\
Sound-wise I really enjoyed the entirety of the show. I liked the reoccurring songs, the sounds (or the lack) of animals, the dramatic music, the voice of (most) characters and the ED as well. It suited the show well. One of the few things I disliked was Mamoru's voice for some reason but overall they did a great job.\
And here comes what I disliked the most. Characters, character development and character relations. Most of the main characters had a certain depth, some more-some less, but I just simply can't say I like any of them or I hate most of them. They are too ordinary despite being special in that society. And there's not really any development in their personality. It's not that they are the same in the beginning and the end of the show, it do feel like their personality age, but all along I feel like their perspective is too narrow despite everything they live through. As for their relationships with each other... I just couldn't understand why they felt that way toward each other most of the time.\
The supporting characters in the other hand were perfect in my opinion. They had the necessary depth in personality and goals that was required and I could decide easily whether I like them or not.\
I would especially like to praise Squealer's character. He was a really well established character.\
It is a good anime, but I think it could have been better. The message it wanted to convey was conveyed but if you learned history you can learn the same if you think about it. Most humans are arrogant, egocentric, somewhat racist and short sighted creatures. Most of them want happiness for themselves even if it means the agony of others. But if the need arise they can change, temporarily at least, to solve the problems these attributes create. It happened multiple times in our known history. Personally I hate mankind for these attributes but I can love each individual because of the potential he/she have to change it and the things around him/her.\
As a final word... If you interested in this anime because of it's premise or because of a review then watch it. It can change your perspective and thoughts of the current world and the past. It can change you so you start thinking and not accept everything without a second thought. Thank you for reading this review!\

    This review will contain spoilers. \
This is my first review, so please bear with me.\
I also would like to just keep this nice and simple.\
Story: 8\
There is about 3 arcs in this series. After all, it is a coming-of-age story. (child-teen-adult) Each arc does an amazing job on portraying such vivid details and very intriguing plot lines and \"plot twists.\"\
I really like how the plot could make you question what kind of society we live in and connect it back to the series. (light spoiler) For example, one party contains this superior power over another party and the party that is inferior try their best\
          \
        to find their voice and fight back. (light spoiler end). I also like how this series captivates the audience into such suspense scenes and intense scenarios that will make you want to click onto the next episode. I would think that this series gets its praise on how many of the plot lines get explained at the end(kind of?) Also the themes of corrupted government, controlled society and oppressed vs privileged really deserve an applause because many animes today would not dare to touch upon such theme.\
But, there are plenty of flaws that take the story that make it less enjoyable for more attentive audiences. For example, when the series would transition from one arc to another arc, it felt really rocky. Transitioning from the child arc toward the teenager arc was really awkward. Many of unnecessary scenes that could have been avoided because it had nothing to with the plot. The teenager arc seemed really rushed to me because of how the queerats was the main conflict in the child arc.(Spoiler)  . . .Suddenly, they want to focus on Shun and later Mamoru which end up being completely ignored in the last arc. (Spoiler end) The story itself was really well presented with such a complex theme and portrayed a very serious tone. But, the main problem was pacing with the story and weird time skips. (side note)(spoiler) Saki's narration really destroyed the whole mystery thing because it was in first person and that automatically tells us that she lives to tell the story. Meaning that the outcome with the  \"fiend\" was very predictable. ) \
 I feel like the Karma Demon and Fiends were not as important because the producers just brushed it off for the queerrat plot. (Spoiler) Technically, Shun was not a Karma Demon because he still kept his humanity under control and constantly using his Cantus on the floating balls. Because the Karma Demon that was explained in episode 2 he lost his humanity and destroyed everything that he interacted with. You can say Shun was an enlightened Karma Demon because he knew how to avoid that becoming a Karma Demon. I think that Akki was obviously not a fiend because of the difference in Tomiko's story and the current \"fiend\" just did not match and the symptoms of a fiend just was not present in Akki. \
Character: 2\
The main reason why I gave this series a very low score. With such an amazing plot, very well developed characters should be a given. But not with this anime. The producer felt that giving Shun, Maria and Mamoru their own episodes of development is an excuse for character development. The child arc did a pretty okay job on explaining how each other characters interact with one and the other. (Spoiler) But when the children went to the summer camp, I personally felt Shun, Maria and Mamoru were not important because of how the producers did not show what Shun, Maria and Mamoru did to survive their journey to regroup with Saki and Satoru. (Spoiler end) Honestly,  that bothered me the most about the characters is that they did not have any impact on me whatsoever. (spoiler) When Shun, Maria and Mamoru die, it was just eh. I felt like their deaths were just brushed off for the sake of the plot. They weren't forgotten, but every time they were brought up, it just was not meaningful in my opinion. Saki and Satoru felt very bland to me because of how they interact with their conflicts is offsetting. Everyone they interacted with only made the MC's look good because they are the MC's. And the amount of plot armor Saki has is just beyond ridiculous that I really wanted Saki to struggle in the series but did not. The narration really just took the whole mystery aspect of the series out and obviously told the audience that whatever happens Saki is going to be alive. \
Art/Sound: 9\
Art was good for its time, and the producers did not get lazy with their animations. Props to them.\
The music was very appealing to the story and tone/theme of the series.\
Enjoyment: 5\
It was a nice break from your average animes. But after watching 16 episodes, the captivating aspect of the series start to disappear and just did not appeal to me as much as it did in the child arc. At episode 20, I just forced myself to watch it because I just wanted to finish it and see what happens. But the climax of each arc really makes you think on how beautifully the series tackles philosophical and corrupted society/government themes.\
Overall: 6\
Tl;dr. Watch if you like philosophical themes and a more mature anime.\
Don't watch if you really love character development and believe that characters make an impact in the plot.\

    Imagine people with ESP/PK-Abilities suddenly appearing everywhere in this world. Most stories about people with extraordinary abilities are about these people surviving in a world against humans or fighting each other. But Shineskai Yori is different. In this world the \"ability user\" can't control it and the world as we know it is no more. 1000 years into the future. Humans have adapted to these changes. They try to life a normal life while trying to control said PK-Abilities. \
I started watching Shinsekai Yori first when it aired but was not really interesed as the pace was just really slow, so I dropped it at\
          \
        episode 3 even though I was certainly somewhat hooked with the world that this story took place in~... BIG mistake. I picked it up again Christmas 2014 and was hooked again from the start till the end. It somehow just felt perfect. The slow pace at the beginning faded away and I was left with a story so good that I had to rewatch it afterwards. \
Story: Even If the first few episodes had a slow pace, I promise it will be worth. After rewatching it I realized how important these episodes were in connection with... well everything. Not only did it show how the world has changed after 1000 years (e.g. the recaps that were shown at the start of some episodes), it also build up the really important connection between the watcher and the world in witch shinsekai yori took place. The only real \"downfall\" Shinsekai Yori had was... well the Yaoi scenes. I was really surprised when these showed up and knew that a lot of people would automatically downgrade this Anime. As I went on I realized that these scenes made sence but were not really necessary... \
Character: Oh boy, the character development was just superb! As we follow the story of Saki Watanabe a girl who was one of the last ones of her age group to recieve her Cantus (the Pk-Abilitiy I talked about before) and her friends we start to slowly get to learn more and more about the world they live in. With each time-skip you can see they changes these characters go through and how important they are to the story itself. They all go through certain phases that, in my opinion, make 100% sense. As they slowly start to realize how \"crooked\" the system is that they life in and even try to survive while trying to escape it.\
*The next paragraph contains mild spoilers* \
On a side note I would mention one of the probably best developed villains I have ever seen in Anime - Squealer. I -for sure- was not the only one who knew that something was wrong with how he acted near his so called \"gods\". But only as the story progressed I realized just how important he was for the story and how must of an impact he makes in it. I could go on just talking about how justified his actions really were.\
Art: There were certain episodes that felt as if they have been done by a different studio or have been experimented with - yet! I felt like it was part of the whole. And I absolutely loved the art-style they used for this anime. Even if some people considered it done half assed I just can't imagine this anime being drawn any other way. \
Sound: I love that ending, I seriously do. And I like the variety we get from the OST. They always somehow feel fitting BUT at the same time I don't feel like they are as special as some other OST's (Parasyte-the Maxim for example that just completely throws me off every time I hear it ... ) \
Enjoyment: I enjoyed Shinsekai Yori from the get-go . It was a masterpiece. The story and character development, the art, the music,... simply, the feelings I got from it were simply amazing! \

    Ill talk about my low scores first. Art: Shinsekai Yori is pretty to look at but nothing outstanding. I love the scenery. I don't really know what else to say because I am a poor judge for art. Sound: Great OST but many people may find the constant repetition of songs boring. It didn't bother me personally but I have heard that complaint. You will frequently hear a part of a symphony called From the New World (same title as the show) and I always enjoyed hearing the peaceful melody. \
Character: Theres a lot of characters in this show but I ended up only caring\
          \
        about three. The protagonists are 5 young children that we see grow into adulthood (well only a few make it there) The characters that do end up not making it to the end did not receive enough plot development and you might even forget about them. The antagonist is perfect but I can't even name him because that would be a spoiler itself. If you're like me your suspicious of this character from the very start and you have your suspicions each them he makes an appearance. The story didn't necessarily develop him well but he was developed in a way that you almost can like him and that you can almost forgive his actions but in the end still hate him.\
Story: The story at first is a bit plain. Another take of a utopian/dystopian society set far out in the future. You follow the lives of some village kids. The setting is rather interesting. 1000 years in the future in a nameless part of Japan. A world that seems to lack technology yet there is no evidence of a war wiping out technology. Already you know that the show has a mysterious past which unfortunately all gets shoved down your throat at episode 4. Although they did do a good job. The only hint of a dark past before that is the shows opening that takes place in 2011. A time when cantus first appeared. Now everyone has superhuman powers known as cantus. At the core cantus is some form of telekinetic power. All humans have this power. However there is another form of intelligent life and that is where the story gets even more interesting. Monster rats live outside of the village in large colonies ruled by a queen. Some monster rats are capable of speech and that is important later on. They are an oppressed species and bow down to humans accepting them as their gods. In the second half of the show the monster rats will show their true nature. The ending will absolutely blow you away. I stared at my TV for a solid 5 minutes just running through my head what had happened. \
Warning: Many people will drop this show because of episode 8 or something around that. At this point in the show the characters are teenagers I believe and there are some gay scenes where guys are kissing. That is not a legitimate reason to drop this show. Please get past that and you should be able to enjoy the rest of it.\

    As there are only positive reviews and none that actually say something about the vibe this anime gives, yes I do agree the story is well thought-out and very well shown in this anime, but there's just something in this anime that leaves a \"meh\"-feeling behind for me. \
The mystery it involves and how it develops are rather odd... \
It starts out great, with interesting subjects that really grab my attention. The more the story continues, and I must say it does continue rather fast, the more I lose interest. \

    This is so far my favorite anime of all time.\
What really engulfs me is how deeply this anime touches into the human psyche. Not only does it connect karma and mental effects to the subconscious mind, but it also does so with a strikingly realistic example.\
As some of the main characters show great intelligence, compassion, sincerity and wisdom, the story spans over different periods of the main characters' lives.\
As the friends adventure together growing closer, the creative and highly intelligent dialogue touches many topics from a futuristic outlook. Those topics are -- among others -- the history of the future of society, scientific theories of\
          \
        phenomena of the future and, as already mentioned, the depths of the human psyche.\

***Spoilers Ahead***\
Echoes from themes seen  on H.G. Wells Time Machine, Ergo Proxy, Babylon 5, Elfen Lied, Utawarerumono, and others, as well as a really harsh view on human nature vs. adversity and change...and a marvellous depiction of coming of age and maturity process with the main characters, and a totally overthrow of views by the (sad and somewhat horrific) revelations in the last episodes...that is Shinsekai Yori. \
Not a light story, and a very well woven and conducted plot, this is a really masterpiece, that calls for attention and understanding of what we see.\
Like in Ergo Proxy, by the end we see we\
          \
        might have been cheering for the wrong side. As I am one that gets really angry with the Powerfull oppressing those less resourful than them, I got impressed with the turn of events and the reality of the character's history and society, and you get sad at what happens with some characters there, who were fighting an impossible battle against a terrible and cruel oppressor, who actually commited a terrible crime gainst their own kind.\
We see here what would happen if humans would mutate and the mutants had the upper hand against the larger, less powerfull not mutated humanity. Just one Fiend (a psychopatic individual with telekinesis) could kill thousands...with the numbers we have total, if 1 per cent mutated and from those 1 percent became Fiends, that would be the end of our civilization (which is what happened in the story). Numbers would mean it all.\
The portray of the mutation there was also magistrally done. A very logical take on what would happen if a part of the human race could access Quantum Waves and telekinesis (PK here) and what kind of problems could arise due humans being humans with godlike powers (Karma Demons - altering quantum strata without control and Fiends, psychopats and serial killers with PK at their command and no restrictions to use it for killing and destroying, with the focus such people naturally have making them the most powerful PK users) and also a very harsh views over morals and societal control, as well as how ruthless and immoral some would act in order to preserve themselves (the mostrosity showed in the final eps was cruel and made the events in the end sad to the extreme, when we see what befell humans after the conflict against the mutants came to its end). \
Strong words from a brave fighter in the end, as he says that no evil will endure forever, even facing the incredibly cruel fate reserved for him by his captors and oppressors...and you know who I am talking about...\
Marvellous story, which by the end calls for a glimmer of hope amidst darkness, this is a powerfull and very satisfying anime, I wished more like this could come forth in the future. \
And indeed, true Science Fiction in its best, challenging societal rules, morals, and the nature of humans facing  adversity (no matter what cruel fate bestowed upon humans)\

    *****things to take note*****\
-Seriously this plot is crazy =_= \
-I watched this anime about a month ago. ( so it still kind of stay in my mind )\
-----STORY 6/10 -----\
Like what i had had earlier on this plot is REALLY crazy . Let me give some reasons why i said this. Firstly in the first few episodes everything was peaceful and they had good friends together . HOWEVER this was destroyed . Yea i agree that this is normal to create some conflict BUT seriously what happened later on was some monster rats came out and somehow became the main character which short of pissed\
          \
        me off -_- and after that war started. Although the war arc was truly well done XD . Just that it took too long to get what is happening . \
-----ART 7/10 ------\
Art was not bad even though there's alot of rats coming out later on the rats were rather drawn quite detailed . Nothing much to say about this section.\
-----SOUND 7/10 ------\
I like the soundtrack \" from the new world \" even though this was not originally created for this anime . This was originally created by Dvorak for orchestra purpose . I like how it fit into the anime :D Like having some peace then have climax . \
-----CHARACTER 6/10 ------\
CRAZY characters .... like i said it was crazy to have TALKING RATS as main characters other than that characters are normal . For example in the \"peace\" they had clever ones , active ones and quite ones . \
In my opinion they kind of throw away some of the characters from the \"peace\" just to develop the plot duh i know this is quite normal in anime XD \
------ENJOYMENT 6/10 ------\
Start was CRAZY and BORING . Climax was GREAT . \
OVERALL : 6/10\
This anime was not bad just that it took too long to start the real thing and i kind of get boring during the introduction till the war arc starts. Overall this anime is enjoyable if you survived for the first 10 episode or so . \
Recommended if you like dark atmosphere and long winded anime but good climax . \

    I had a very difficult time trying to score \"From the New World\".  Have you ever watched a series that wasn't very impressive early on, yet you kept watching it because you hoped or expected that it would eventually get better?  Perhaps it teased at times that something big would eventually happen.  There's a good chance many have experienced this, and then been disappointed that the series never lived up to the hopes one had for it.\
I experienced these worries at one point with \"From the New World\".  It looked like it could be very promising when I learned about it\
          \
        before it started airing, which it thankfully did end of being.  When it was good, especially in the latter half, this series was one of the best shows of this past year.  The plot was very deep, full of twists, turns, and tragic moments that kept it engaging and suspenseful.  However, this series was... so... difficult to get into early on.  In fact, I at one time was really considering putting it \"on hold\" in favor of another airing series.  The episodes involving the Monster Rats early on were not very interesting for the most part, plus it had a few very... awkward moments that were disturbing.  Looking back, I guess I can understand why those scenes are there, but I still found the early episodes only passable.  However, the series did have some good moments that were interesting and made it difficult to stop watching.  It was like it teased that something big would eventually happen that would make the wait worth it, and in a way it did.\
I think another element that hurt the experience a little was the art.  It's not the most visually appealing series out there, plus there was a lack of consistency.  However, there was one element that was consistently great throughout the entirety of the series, and that was the soundtrack.  It was not only great, but outstanding - one of the best soundtracks I've listened to in any anime, and that's saying a lot!\
So how do I score \"From the New World\"? (I don't average category scores, just so you know.)  The latter half was very good, but the first half was only passable and very difficult to get into.  For now, I am giving this series a 7/10 (Good).  If you can get through the first half, then you should have little problem enjoying the rest of the series.  Those who do enjoy the first half may find this series one of the best they'll ever watch.\

Shinsekai Yori has the story of a life time. Quite literally. As events unfold early on, not much is explained.

        more and more knowledge comes to fruit, one cannot help but admire the immense detail and lengths it goes with seemingly no effort. The first quarter places many dots in the story and seem to not add up at all. However as the season passes two thirds of the way through, there are enough points that the anime effortlessly draws a line connecting them all making everything fall in place.\
Scenery and backgrounds that some times gain more attention than the characters them selves. This anime does not disappoint in any way shape or form. The art that's used is, for lack of a better word(s), utterly astounding. Cell shading? I'm sorry this is the 21st century, Cell shading is ancient anime technology. Every scene looks like it would have many hours to complete. Even those that are on screen for a second or two. Even the moving objects have shades, tones and gradients out the wazoo. The only draw back is the facial expressions are more often than not, lacking the proper emotion of the events that just transpired.\
With music and scenery noise to make you think you are watching an A grade movie, Shinsekai Yori is bliss to a musicians ears. Original piece music that sounds like it should have its own record label, is one thing. But the use and placement of every little sound is not misplaced. The only time where musical pieces are used enough to be easily picked out would be in the final few episodes where it seems to be the final stretch of the anime's resources.\
Out of the 25 episode series, if one where to cut out all the story points, you would be left with about 17 or 18 episodes of pure character development. It holds nothing back but in doing so, it lacks in the feels as you already know the relationship stance of all the main characters. It by any means does not say that the characters emotions for each other does not evoke feels within the watcher, It just heavily dampens many potential feels scenes.\
Even if one were to view this anime from a heavily criticized point of view, they will still not be able to say they did not enjoy it. Complicated civilization and story lines aside, Shinsekai Yori really does captivate its viewers with largely enjoyable action scenes that will always have some greater plan of action behind it making you want to know what's next. Those who like anime a heavy story with a deeper meaning will enjoy it for the perspective it gives on future human civilization. Those who like a large amount of action, may find it lacking between battles but the scale will make their enjoyment worth the wait.\

-Minor reference to episode 8\
Shinsekai yori is 25 episodes anime produce by aniplex and aired during fall of 2012-spring 2013.This show is mostly overlooked and avoided because of light yuri and yaoi(lesbian and gay) content featured in episode 8 which is actually part of the story so please don't let this stop you for giving this show a chance.\
Story:9\
Story of Shinsekai yori follows a coming of age story of a group of friends in post apocalyptic \"utopian\" society where telekinesis is present and humans live alongside  other creatures who deem the humans as Gods.Story heavily questions morality and its a bit slow in the\
          \
        beggining.\
Art:10\
Shinsekai yori uses a lot of vivid colors,animation is stellar and character design are quite unique and well made.\
Sound:10\
Sound is another asset of this show that was done masterfully from orchestrated and choir section to some fast beat music and sound is handled superb.\
Character:8\
Main cast of Shinsekai yori consist of a group of friends and technically Saki is the main character but the strength of characters was this group relation since it is easily relatable.Other characters are fleshed out and my only \"nit pick\" is that some of the good characters are killed off screen.\
Enjoyment:10\
I really liked this show it kept me at the edge of the seat and had me guessing some of the moral ethics of our society by the end of the show.\
Overall:10\
If you can get past the slow start and episode 8 \"controversy\" you are bound to have a great time with Shinsekai yori.\

    From the New World (Shinsekai Yori). A new look at a dystopian society of the future with a supernatural twist. If you enjoyed literature such as Brave New World, Animal Farm, 1986 or Anthem, this is definitely the anime for you. These pieces of literature and From the New World share many similar themes from the prejudice of factions to use of propaganda. Shinsekai Yori is based in the world one thousand years in the future where humans have evolved gaining the power of Cantus (psychokinesis or telepathy powers), and a weaker race, the queerats worship humans and work for them. In this apparently Utopian\
          \
        world where no human can harm another lies the mystery of how this society is held together.\
The story revolves around Saki Watanabe as she lives her life and discovers the hidden truths “From the New World” (puns are cool don’t hate). Though the plot is definitely not boring, to me it felt a bit lackluster compared to the praise its receiving from the community. Many of the “twists” are easily predicted and often times the pacing feels rushed. Now not everything about the plot was below par, the creation of the setting is its selling point. Immersing yourself in this world is simple, yet it still seems vast because of the many different environments they animated. I wish they explored the world outside of Japan though.\
The artwork and animation of Shinsekai Yori ranges from disproportionate bodies, and terribly bad crotch shots for no reason as seen above, to innovative depictions of hallucinations and out of the box uses of vibrant colors to contrast to the darker mood. When the animation was good, it was good, but a couple times too often did the quality drop. Enough to be annoyed if you really pay attention to it. The exclusion to this is the action scenes, which I thought were pretty smooth overall. They always made sure to accent with sound and animation whenever Cantus was being used during the action too. The character designs themselves I have no qualms with, but none of them really stand out (except I love the color of Maria’s hair). There was some out of place fan service. Though some of the fan service was necessary in establishing the great setting itonly happened a few times throughout the show, and has little relevance to how much enjoyment you will get from Shinsekai Yori.\
The saving grace for this anime is really the soundtrack. The use of traditional Japanese instruments mixed with some modern tracks really heighten the tense points throughout the series. One particular track has a choir of children singing in an uninterpreted language giving off an eerie and unsettling feeling. While the ending theme was so catchy, and still illustrating the essence of Shinsekai Yori.  Lastly the sound effects for the use of Cantus I mentioned earlier was a nice touch.\
Overall if you enjoy the dystopian society, and really like to delve deep into questions of human nature Shinsekai Yori is for you. Do not let my harsh criticism scare you away from watching it, I just do not believe it deserves the grand praise it is getting, but it definitely was a good watch. Keep in mind that this show is not for younger audiences, and contains quite a bit of gore and violence. Though for a “horror” genre it was not that scary, its other elements hold it up there, as an above average anime.\

    Wow... Just wow... This is probably one of the greatest anime I have ever had the privileged of watching. And in my honest view, I give you this review.\
Story: 10/10\
Now I really don't want to say much about the story, as this is one of the greatest things about this anime, the reason why, is how utterly unique it is. Shinsekai Yori \"From the new world\" is set roughly 1000 years in the future, in a closed off, self-sufficient society. Now, humans in this world possess an incredibly overpowered ability known as 'Cantus'. Along with this power, the people in this world live in a\
          \
        peaceful and tranquil society. Or so they would have you believe. The story does a lot of exploring of the human psyche and several scenes will easily leave you speechless. Also, if you're super sensitive to guy on guy and girl on girl... Get your head out of the 19th century and enjoy the anime.\
Art: 10/10\
Please Please Please Please Please watch this anime in HD. The fact that this anime deals with the human psyche on several levels, means you're going to want to watch these scenes in HD, due to the simple fact that THEY WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. The Art style for this anime is flawless, and perfectly portrays each and every scene too its full potential with ease. \
Sound: 10/10\
The Soundtrack, albeit limited, applies itself in such a way that the songs never seem overused or stale. Along with the voice-acting of each an every character, you wont be at a loss for sound. \
Character: 10/10\
I would like to limit this section, as a lot of the character development is best left for you to experience on your own. Following our group of friends as they grow up in this strange society of psychics, you will easily grow fond of them all. \
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Love love loooved this anime. I think for me the fact that the story was incredibly unique, bloody, but not too bloody and isn't afraid of exploring all different sub-genres makes for an all-round fantastic anime. \
Overall: 10/10\
Ten out of ten, must watch anime, that I would suggest to most people. Now I say most because there are several moments that might be sensitive to younger viewers. \

    This is one anime I can safely say it’s a masterpiece. At least for me, it was.\
The story is amazingly told, being a little slow paced in the beginning, but after this, things happen and they happen fast. A lot of information is shared which will require your full attention, so watch this show with your brain attached. \
I was engulfed completely when the second part started. Do not drop this because of the little shounen-ai and shoujo-ai of this show. It’s only a little part of this amazing show and people should not whine about it when it isn’t the main thing of the\
          \
        show. \
The time skips could be a downfall of the show, but they handled this with care and preciseness. \
The art was simplistic but matches the show perfectly. It does not need flashy colours or amazing light effect or something. It was right the way it was.\
The soundtracks were amazing enough to make me remember it, which says something.\
The characters are well written in their own way. The main character, of course, was the one who stood out the most. She was well designed and her character development was amazing.\
This story will show you in a perfect way how cruel mankind can be. It is gruesome and will leave you with a new perspective of the world.\
This show deserves more credit.",

    I start asking sorry for my bad english.\
Story: Good. Basically we have some children that have to learn to use their espers powers and while learning strange things happens. The story is well done and its really strong in the first arch. The power of this arch is that you want to know what happened to the previous world but the anime doesn't give a proper explanation i mean weren't great to have more episodes in which the characters investigate what happened and tryed to tell others about it? What i mean is that there is a mistery  not fully discovered trough the series\
          \
        and it bothered me cuz i really wanted to know what happend in a way different as the anime explained,they left some unanswered question and a lil bit of dissatisfaction. The anime instead goes on and put other situations that are enjoyable but not as the first arch introduced. What a pity.\
Art: Outstanding. Its like you are there with the characters. Great colors, great direction, Great animations, great surroundings and locations. It gave the same feelings when i first saw sen to chihiro no kamikakushi with school when i was 8. OUTSTANDING.\
Sound: You can sense it. There are music that give you anxiety others that give you joy they put the right sounds in the right moments in the right ways. There is a leit motiv named Ienikaeru (Going home) that give you a lot of feelings emotions how can i say it? At first its a music that remember you serenity, tranquility, that make you think you are safe just like the characters THEN IT EVOLVES WITH THE STORY giving you melancholy, anxiety and then sadness, regrets fear too. The made a masterpiece with the sounds.\
Characters: THEY ARE NORMAL PEOPLE. If you pay attention in this years characters are all the same and full of stereotypes and cliches. Here we have some of this but its a soft side of the characters. I admit that if they did just a lil bit of more introspection and work they should have been a masterpiece too but apart from this they react properly in the various situations and not in a stereotyped way.\
Enjoyment: As i said i wanted to have a different handling of the story focused on the discover of the ancient times and then, when fully completed, the other archs that we saw. I'm not saying that the other archs are bad, they are good and well made, i just  would have preferred a different development.\
Overall: This is a good product. It have all you need and provide you with a lot of emotions and feelings. There is mistery there is magic and there are fights you will spend magic hours watching this anime. I hope you'll enjoy as i did. \

    Shinsekai Yori or From The New World is one of the anime that surprised me very much.The story is done in an excellent manner.the characters are flushed out really well and we can relate why they act the way they act.but not in the beginning as this anime deals with a lot of mysteries.Even for a story that spans across about 15 years of time it never fails to produce  that mysterious feel.and this in fact is the driving force here.The later half of the show felt like it went in another direction however it is done perfectly.There were even moments that scared me\

    Shinsekai yori or From the New World is one of the most unique and incredible anime I watched in a while, it might as well be my favorite right now. Each episode has a cliffhanger and the end which really keeps you on the edge of  your seat! I know at episode 8.. (minor spoiler) the characters basically turn bisexual and have some intimate scenes, (no nudity) but after this episode you should still give it a chance!!! Highly recommend it, has almost any genre and has a ending which I was in love with since my ship came true! Give it a chance,\

    The first thing about Shinsekai Yori it that it's a sad anime. The world may be beautiful, but the beauty does not extend beyond the scenery. The world is very mysterious and very threatening. Children go missing and rumors of monsters that hunt lonely pray are common knowledge. The anime starts being about 5 friends in their childhood. It ends being about 2 of the friends 12 or so years later. This anime is willing to kill characters in gruesome ways so no one is safe. The anime is partly about power and powerlessness. All the humans in this world have amazing telekinetic powers but\
          \
        they always seem to be on the knifes edge of the existence due to the ease with each these powers can get out of control. There is another race of intelligent beings that call humans gods who work with the humans but are show to be willing to attack humans from very early on the series. Both The Giver and Physco Pass come to mind when watch this anime as examples of foreboding tightly controlled communities. There are also complex relationship in which more then one main character is bisexual and their are hints that free love is used as a means of control reminding me of Brave New World. Even the name, From the New World, seems to directly reference it. As far quality goes, I found the begging parts a bit slow and the character's reactions be to intense for the events going on. The best thing at that point was the mysterious world which I wanted to know more about. Later on when the characters grow up a war breaks out.  I found this part of the show significantly more enjoyable. I have a small gripe with that part in that is there is a character who died who gives the protagonist advice. I kind of thought that whole part of the story was weird and distracting. Overall, it's a very intriguing anime that gets better as you watch it. If you like tense dark anime like Madoka Magica or Mi-HiME, this is very much worth watching. 9/10.\

    No spoilers, or summaries in this review, just an opinion-based, general discussion.\
Looking back on everything that has happened, I can say that this anime put me on a journey that no other anime has put me on before. It really makes one rethink our morals as human beings and the way we treat other living creatures, even ourselves. I like that this anime was not afraid to jump into the unknown of storytelling, especially one of a totalitarian society. It did its best to fit a lot of realistic depth and meaning into those 25 episodes and in my opinion, it was very well done.\
          \
        The amount of symbolism incorporated with not only the story itself, but the art, music and characters really proved that the creators were not just trying to put a veil on fudged work. There was a lot going on and yes even though I do feel like there were some plot holes, they at least addressed what they needed to address in a satisfactory manner. I would like to name some specific examples on how this anime was able to take things to a new level, but for the sake of keeping this spoiler-free, I say just keep the things I've stated in mind and point them out for yourself! Go watch!\

    \"The power of imagination is what changes everything\" - spoiler ahead, but then again it would take you a very long way to get here, since this is literally the final scene of the show. A show, a story, a journey ventured forth with a group of six (yes, six originally, I took details with great care!), centered around a young girl of twelve, through many hardships, until her moment of entrusting future to the next generation.\
No, it is not a show about boys / girls with super powers saving the earth with bare hands, needing nothing but their bravery.\
Challenged by many thoughts, but I\
          \
        finally took the courage and time (maybe also with a little effort) to put them all down here, just so one day I can probably read this again. Or maybe give someone else a hint about Shinsekai yori - \"From the other world\"\
This is a review containing some spoilers here and there to record my -personal- feelings toward the show, and thus it might or might not give you a biased view when you watch the show. If you are reading this, I'd recommend you to stop, go watch the show and then read the rest (if you are still interested). You have been warned!\
From the very first start, the show strikes me as a weird show. Children? That sure is fine. Supenatural? God, I hope this is not another one of those type. But contradicted to my expectation, the show gave me something ... similar. A strikingly sensation, if I may add, for I've encountered this feeling many time before - a feeling of walking in a world full of imagination, almost, but yet not the same as reading a book.\
And no, it is not a show full of red, yellow, green and the other four colours of the rainbow either.\
But to say Shinsekai yori is a colourful book is of no exaggeration. The art is vividly beautiful (except on some episodes the art suddenly took a very weird turn, thanks god the style turned back to \"normal\" on the very next episode before I could get used to it). Funny enough, now that I think back and even watched some of the episodes again, it is not elaborating at all. In fact the art style is simple, yet they serve their purposes just right, and with colours. I'd say, they are colourful animated sentences from a book even.\
A book about feelings of love, of lost, of trust, and of fear.\
So, what makes it worth spending roundly 7 hours, give or take, to watch this entire show rather than reading a good book or two? Talking about questions, it seems farfetched that an anime show would give you foreshadowing questions with sophisticated ideas, would it not? Apparently not so, for Shinsekai yori, and that is why I spent my time enjoying the show.\
So, where does this \"wonderful\" story starts and ends? It's quite simple as a matter of fact, it starts with a group of children at sunset where their faces are shadowed by the bright light, and it ends with the same group. With less number. Shadows of five kids, and who've thought, that very same blurry image flashed back to me at the end of the show. Throughout the story, I have become acquainted and come to love their characters.\
Except the part that our main protagonist seems to shred tears very easily. Spoiler?\
Starting from daily school life to a camping week, the flow of the story goes, peacefully. For sure, what would be fearful for young spirits with supernatural powers in the wilderness?\
And the first question came to me after our energetic and lovable characters met the old archive of the old civilization. Ultimately, under what category does Psychokinetic users fall under? The ones who rule above others? The scientists? Or the stray groups trying to survive on their own methods?\
It still gives me goosebumps whenever I think back about that question at the end of the show, for you have also forgot another question - assuming their village is one of them, then where did the other two go?\
But there were no time to dwell onto it, as the show is actually quite fast paced. Contradicting to the type of the show, or the type I would think it is, it is packed with enough actions to even compete with other shounen animes out there. And from these, many events were unfolded. Our lovable protagonists also learned many things, but of course with prices.\
I am not going to talk about how the show has two girls / two boys kissing each other. No I am not, but I have to, since it it with great fear and through painful memories that they built up such bonds, together they would be able to stand against anything.\
And amidst these events, a very strong feeling of regret came to me. Shun, the kid who's the smartest, calmest and collected, departed the living realm while leaving a \"curse\" onto Saki. \"I've always loved you\" - said him, a brief moment before he eradicated his very own existence. Ironically, it was an existence he knew, for he was chosen to read its definition for his classmates and teachers.\
Had enough? Not yet, for that was certainly not the end of the tragedy that was about to unfold. One by one, Saki found herself losing her loved and trusted friends, the people who define her very world, and thus her very existence. Her world, Saki's world, shrunk even more after two more of the people in Group One left - Mamoru and Maria. Not once, but on twice occasions that her love abandoned her.\
Shinsekai yori is a great, a truly amazing show, for it not only entertained but also scared me. What is fear? How it is to tremble in the middle of the night trying to survive? And how it is that when you think back, what you kill feel the very same way?\
Such questions is everywhere in Shinsekai yori, a colourful show about a post-cataclysm world where psychokinetic is a natural ability to \"human\". For who, or what is \"human\", I'd leave that question to you.\

    Part of my effort to recommend (to watch or avoid) every anime I've seen in 100 words or less! This is From the New World or Shinsekai Yori, and this is the most compelling story I've yet been told. \
\"I know one thing: that I know nothing\"\
This anime is unique. An atmospheric piece of Science-Fiction (in the vein of H.G. Wells \"The Time Machine\"), From the New World (FtNW) knows that people are often afraid of the unknown. FtNW takes this to the utmost by revealing its truths to you, and in that revelation, it makes the unknown grow larger. With a compelling narrative where\
          \
        every moment is to be relished, and a dynamic visual direction, this anime creates sequences that crush you and its characters under the full weight of human truths. \

    In this world, everyone is afraid of everyone.\
This is the main message of this anime, a message showing the fear of change.\
This is an anime that is done to reflect, sometimes watching a passage several times to understand the story that is told us. The story is very complete, different races, powers also are well written and presented, only small flat anyway for understanding it, forcing us to look at a passage several times to understand, because of time hopping, or rather what we call \"temporal ellipses\", which show the various stages of what we lived the characters. I give even when a 9/10.\
The characters\
          \
        themselves are very well written, from childhood to adolescence, which is also the main part of the anime. Contrary to what one sees, and Saki Satoru are the only main characters of the anime. The other characters will disappear from the frame of history as you, and you will understand by watching. The concerns that I reproach actually writing characters, two of them, we see no longer suddenly they disappeared, most of them can not speak, what that they became ? You never know. So I give a 9/10 also for the characters.\
The soundtrack for its ... Wow, I think this is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard! It's just beautiful, it corresponds to the universe of the anime, I personally give a 10/10 without having to criticize, it is perfect.\
There are some downturns in history, like any psychological anime, but it's used wisely so that it is neither disturbing nor annoying to watch, I never tired of watching an episode after another, this is a 10/10.\
As usual, I recommend this anime, you make your own opinion, but if you like this anime style, it is for you.\

     The story at the beginning is boring. At the first try I stopped to watch it in the middle of the second episode. However the objective of the 5 first episode is to show the setting of this \"New World\" (as the meaning of the title). Once understood the setting, you can enjoy the anime. The story is based on the novel of Yuusuke Kishi (fiction horror writer). I have read his books and I noted that the flow of his story is hard to understand. He writes his stories with many details making the reader confused. So I thought that the anime version\
          \
        did a great job since it showed the beauty of the story with good musics and arts. \
 The end of the story was emotional. There are many mysteries of the \"world\" that are revealed during the story. It is so good that the supernatural power is well integrated to the setting and you feel that it is part of the life. I highly recommend to watch if you liked animes like Psycho-Pass where the society is criticized by the protagonist.\
I apologize for the poor English.\

    Shinsekai Yori. One of the best anime ever made, in my personal opinion. The story gave a little and took a little from the very beginning that left you wanting more and more and more.The anime was very well done with just a few minor flaws here and there, mostly about little things that don't matter anyway. The story was very creative and very entertaining to watch as all the events unraveled. I really liked how clever and scientifically plausible the phenomenon explained in the anime were.

I quite enjoyed how the anime portrayed the village as a beautiful utopia where there's no violence and everyone's living in harmony, only to reveal later that it's actually a complete distopia after the very discovery of cantus. It showed how well the viewer's entire look on the story can warp into a completely different one in just a few minutes.\
I loved how the main characters thought they were safe after their camping trip only to find out that the adults knew everything. I really enjoyed seeing how the adults changed from caring and nurturing to cruel and evil to finally misunderstood and acceptable because of one amazing woman whose name I'll leave for you to guess. I very much enjoyed how the story toyed with my opinions on who the actual antagonist was until it was very clear how silly I was to consider the people I did. The way the story keeps me anxious and conflicted was incredible.\
The character development was insane. We see how they get over their differences and work together when thrust into a dangerous situation. We see how much they grow from the clueless children we started with to the wizened adults they had to become. We see how incredibly strong they became. The only downside I saw was that we didn't get as attached as we COULD have been to the characters, when in the manga at every up and down my heart would lurch.\
Finally the art and sound were very well done. I enjoyed how well the anime was drawn. It didn't have the annoying thick lines that cartoons generally have and it all just flowed realistically. The voice actors did an incredible job capturing the emotion and nobody sounded particularly annoying. The few inconsistencies were so silly I don't even know how I noticed them. The only one I can think of is a tattoo missing every now and then. Silly \
\
Overall I would give the anime a 600/10 but I can't rate it that high. I recommend the anime to anyone who might be interesting without hesitation. I quite enjoyed everything that happened and how incredible it was. \

    The cover for these series makes me think it's going to be a light hearted story but this really is anything but.  The soundtrack chimes in at the beginning of each episode setting the environment to be mysterious and to have you think there's so much going on in the background that we're not aware of, and that's exactly what's going on.  The art, story, character development, revelations about the world that they now live in (which is 1000 years in the future) were all amazing.  Everything was explained exceptionally from the origin of \"the power\", the impure cats, ogres, karmic demons,\
          \
        and the monster rats.  This was one amazing anime from the beginning to end.\

    This is one of the best anime out there. Watching it is like reading a novel. The anime allows you to immerse yourself and see its world through the characters’ eyes.  \
Story 10/10: Its story is unique and absolutely fantastic. It flows perfectly with virtually no flaws. All you need to know is it set in a far future when there are more than just “humans”. \
Character 10/10: Its theme is “coming of age” so … characters are well made. You see the world through theirs’ eyes and feel what they feel. You may get too connected to the characters that you will feel\
          \
        depressed when bad things happen. It is the only anime that was able to do it to me (on par with very famous novels and movies).\
Art 10/10: it’s an imaginary world, but it looks so real !! The sceneries evoke emotions. \
Sound 10/10: Great and dead on sound effects. It will get you from time to time. \
Enjoyment 9/10:  *SPOILER* “9” because I was sad most of the time and depressed at the end of the series. I needed a bit of stress relief. \

This is where me and him come to a disagreement, for I think there is not enough death and  those who should die don't.\

But those Monster Rats, those guys have it ruff. They are treated as slaves and must fend for themselves when they are threatened by \"invasive\" Monster Rats. They will be killed off just because the humans with power feel like they are not doing what they are told.

Then after they are all killed you find out that they are in fact humans that have been genetically modified and enslaved because those with power wanted to keep their rights to kill them.\

    I found this anime by some miracle: I was reading reviews on Aldnoah.Zero and one of them said \"Don't watch this thing - go watch Shinsekai Yori instead\". Now, whatever you are watching at the moment - go watch Shinsekai Yori. \
This anime is an adaptation of the novel by Yusuke Kishi (go read it). So the story and characters are absolutely amazing. You can figure out what will happen next but it still will surprise you. Characters are believable, their actions can be easily explained and I empathized them a lot. Important thing - people are not overpowered killing machines despite the existence of\

    First off, let there be no doubts that Shinsekai Yori is a quality show, and every criticism levied is done so in the interests of the undecided viewer and objectivity.\
Shinsekai Yori is probably the best example to hold up when warning someone off the \"anime is a genre\" trap.  Because it should not be viewed by people who simply consider themselves fans of anime and manga. Not to say those common elements don't exist, but there is a far better, more descriptive way to explain it.\
Shinsekai Yori is a masterpiece of science fiction.\
That probably won't sit well with some people, but it's the truth.\
          \
        At best, you can just broadly say it is in (more socially acceptable term) speculative fiction, but Shinsekai Yori is the definition of what science fiction is: It uses fantastical elements to explore the human condition in spiritual, sociological, and political ways. \
Once again let it be said, Shinsekai Yori is a quality show. But it cannot be recommended to -everyone- simply because it is a pretty anime.  If you are not a fan of science fiction as a concept, Shinsekai Yori will probably not sit well with you. The most apparent problem with this is the beginning.  It is slow in the terms of plot.  That is because, again, like many science fiction novels, it chooses to focus first on universe building. This isn't any worse or better, it's just the stylistic choice of the novel, and the show sticks to the novel quite well.\
Speaking of which, there are lots of elements that will feel like a book on screen, the least of which aren't several time skips that most television seeks to avoid.\
Even among all these warnings: Science fiction fans who -want- something intellectually challenging may be put off by certain details. These are almost always cultural differences. Without spoiling, but as a general example, whenever the government or ruling body holds a policy that treats people as inferior, expendable, or second-class in some way, in anime it is typical that it slides by without much comment, merely being accepted as \"for the common good\"  (this occurs a lot in Ghost in the Shell). Whereas in Western sci-fi, that is usually the sticking point for most plot twists and paradigm shifts. That is not to say there is not an opinion presented, but it is not -direct-, and that can infuriate some science fiction fans.  So, advice towards them: Go in without expectations.\
It is also science fiction in that the plot is the primary device, not the characters, though they are well developed enough to sympathize with their plight and even pick favorites.\
There is indeed homosexuality presented.  But again it is mostly in a sense of showing how different this society is. On top of that it is not fan-servicey in the least.  In fact, though I am a considerable distance from a yaoi girl, even the boy-on-boy was endearing and tastefully handled, in my estimation. It would do the entire industry some good if more television handled it this way.\
One thing that I can't praise the show on much is the animation. Though I only jumped in around episode 17, I marathoned the entire series in a night. But nothing particularly jumps out at me as a \"moment of badass\" for the series.  Other than the flashbacks during the \"introductory\" phase of the show, which were quite effective and chilling in an Akira tone.\
I will again say: if you are on the fence about this show, it comes highly recommended.  But if you are vehemently against any of these stylistic choices (the sci-fi nature, the novel-on-screen, the plot-as-driving-force) then it would be hard to blame you for not enjoying it, it simply is not for everyone. But neither is The Lord of the Rings, Citizen Kane, or Batman, but that doesn't make them bad.\

    Story - I'm giving it a 9 because the plotline of Shinsekai yori was very unique for a story in the dystopian genre. Throughout the series various events would deepen the plot with a great deal of suspense and drama, it featured many parts where you'd really wonder if the character would make it out alive or not. It also comes to attention that the recommended age to watch this is 17+ and honestly I think it was a very mature anime because all the physiological elements that the characters go through. I have never seen an anime like this where their fictional norms were\
          \
        so bizarre without much explanation.\
Art - The art and character design were very pleasing; again, it was a unique anime. Expressions on characters were portrayed very nicely and it's modern anime art style was memorable and you could tell it was well funded. I must say I really admire the clothing they designed for Shinsekai yori, the uniforms featured in the first few episodes were very cute and other outfits showed a very spiritual style and so on.\
Sound - Soundtracks added a good deal to the suspense and drama, voice actors/actresses did a great job\
Character - We follow Saki Watanabe throughout her life as she goes through being a main character in a dystopian society, there is so so much character development it is beautiful. Many of Shinsekai yori's characters represent different personas or complexes which is admired because all the different ways they coped with situations. However the characters are rarely someone to relate to or honestly appear too strategic at times  \
Enjoyment - Very nice, the story however jumps around the years, I'm not sure how I feel about that yet but there are so many gaps.\
And well I guess some parts are slow with explanations or episode arcs flow into three or more episodes. However this is an anime to be patient with, the later on drama will reflect on their foreshadowing. \
Overall this was a great memorable anime that was definitely worth my time. I'm giving it an 8.5 because they could have brushed up on some of their elements. And I still feel a mental aftershock for I just finished this anime hours ago   \

    Adventure, drama and surprise in every episode\
This anime takes place 500 years in the future, and is about how a group of high school friends find themselves involved in uncovering disturbing secret information about the society they live in. There is a great deal of mystery in the beginning.  Over time the plot develops with quite a bit of drama and further mystery; but eventually the mysteries are slowly solved, but not without tragedy and loss. I liked the pacing and story line; at first things seem quite bizarre but as the episodes wear on, explanations begin to emerge for them and things begin\

    [SPOILERS]\
\9In an interview, EE-sama stated that he considered “Shinsekai Yori” to be the best anime of the year (2013). After watching it myself, I really did have to ask: “Why would you consider Shinsekai Yori the best anime this year?” I can agree that the themes, such as slavery, propaganda/brain-washing, fear/control in society, and group mentality are well-developed. Specifically, the use of the Goblin Rats as a mysterious but logical slave race and the analogy of bonobos for the current human society definitely emphasize how seemingly utopian dystopian it is. \
\9However, many of the major characters, including the main character Saki Watanabe, Satoru Asahina, Maria\
          \
        Akizuki, and Mamoru Itou are unbelievably incompetent (even for 14 year olds) while Shun Aonuma has minimal involvement in the larger story, nearly ruining the otherwise brilliant series. Shun is almost irrelevant because he \"disappears\" halfway through series. Furthermore, he only reappears to fulfill a feared, but almost mythical, existence. Even worse are the reactions of the other characters to his disappearance. Yes, locking away a dangerous being at the expense of that individual's life is very sad but ultimately, there is no other solution. The necessity for such drastic action is further confirmed by the subjugation of the Queens in the Goblin Rat colonies. Although, the protagonists feel morally wrong, being raised in a utopian world without evil has left them unable to take any meaningful action. \
\9In order to explain why Maria fails as a character, we first have to see why Mamoru fails as a character, since they exist more or less as a pair. Mamoru, being less competent in psychokinesis than the rest of the class, has poor self-esteem and tends to break down. This leads to him acting rather quiet and shy. Apparently, being quiet and shy is a possible symptom of being a “fiend”—someone who has the potential to destroy the city. The city leaders’ wariness of Mamoru causes his emotions to spike. Although he was already coping through friendship with Satoru, Shun, and Maria, the leaders’ fear of him increased his own anxiety to breaking point. In this case, it is not entirely the character at fault since it does tie in the theme of fear. However, the speed at which his mental state declines is not only unrealistic, but extremely pathetic. For example, when they learn of the past from the “fake-devil” creature, Mamoru cries that he doesn’t “want to listen to such scary things anymore”.  The information provided by the “fake-devil” was merely facts, or could even be taken as a story. Stories of war and death were not presented with the intent to instigate neither fear nor doubt, yet he seemed as if it shook the foundation of his belief. Such a reaction may be acceptable had the past been explicitly said to be peaceful, but at this point, no mention of the world’s history had been revealed to the characters or to the viewers. Thus, they had no previous beliefs about the formation of their society. Unlike the others, who may have had trouble believing the “fake-devil’s” words to be true, the presentation of new information is enough to trigger a mental breakdown in Mamoru. His weakness in character is his major weakness as a character. \
\9Maria’s weakness as a character is her severely lack of motivation or initiative for any action besides protecting Mamoru. Furthermore, besides her overprotectiveness, she has no other outstanding traits. Her decisions seem to be based only in consideration of what Mamoru wants, which is often to hide away and run from fears and problems. Although she is more expressive and adamant than Mamoru, because of her limited motivations, she is equivalent to Mamoru in the context of driving the story forward. Her reluctance to hurt Mamoru in any way, even if it will help him grow, severely inhibits the curiosity of the group to further their knowledge about their society. She stifles Shun’s, Saki’s, and Satoru’s curiosity by allowing Mamoru’s pitiful state to prematurely stop their conversation with the “fake-devil”.  Her devotion to Mamoru is respectable, but not it forces everyone to become wilfully ignorant of the knowledge the “fake-devil” had to offer. \
\9Satoru is not dislikable, but rather unbelievable. He seemingly changes from a lying, loud, obnoxious sore-loser to an extremely cool-headed and capable fighter. The anime offers no explanation for this change except perhaps puberty, although his character becomes much less irritating. \
\9Lastly, we have Saki. Saki is the worst character, as her inaction allows tension to build and terrible events to occur even though they are easily preventable with her powers. She is exposed to numerous hints of the true state of the city and the world, but does not give potential hints any second though and chooses to ignore it. Her parents reveal the gruesome fact of children being killed by saying that she was the last and that they did not want to lose another [child]. However, she fails to understand the implications. Furthermore, she hears all of the information from the “fake-devil”, yet she takes no actions even though her questions to the “fake-devil” show that she has understood the real history of humanity. She is warned by her father that there would be uprisings from the Goblin Rats, but is continuously tricked by Squealer. The audience can clearly see that Squealer is merely using them as a means to gain more power for his colony, but Saki is entirely unable to deduce his motives even with prior warning. She is also the only main character who is explicitly told of the existence of the Karma Demon and the Fiends. Despite her vast amount of knowledge, relative to other characters, she can only repeatedly say “that’s horrible”. It is true that these events often involved death and suffering, but she cannot or does not extrapolate her knowledge to the present situation. She has many times more knowledge than any other of the major characters, yet she seems often incapable of action or even thought. She also always stops short of any conclusion, correct or otherwise, leaving both her thoughts unfinished and her problems unresolved. For example, during their second encounter with Squealer, it was Satoru that recognized the possibility of the Goblin Rats starting a revolution, while Saki almost reaches the same conclusion but instead denies it on the basis of “that would be terrible”. She remains incompetent until the conclusion of the series when war has already broken out and a fiend is massacring the townsfolk, after which, she finally decides to take meaningful action in stopping the fiend. \
\9However, it is important to note that the characters were raised in a dystopian environment, without any idea of evil or injustices. The “ugly” side of society is kept hidden out of fear and paranoia surrounding the “karma demons” and the “fiends”. From this new perspective, Saki’s inaction can be explained by her ignorance of evil and the inhumane. Mamoru’s breaking point may not be low, but rather the tension caused by the fear and paranoia of being killed is extremely high. It is difficult to fully sympathize with the characters and so the viewer feels substantial frustration at the apparent ineptness of the major characters, which although fits the setting, makes the experience much less enjoyable.

    Hello :3\
Starting to watch this anime, I couldn't deal with what I meet.In the first ser.  I was a bit boring. To begin, I think we should warn people who didn't watch this anime yet, that it will be not unusuall. From the first series, we'll dive into the wonderful world of the author, where we want to stay for long. There are a lot of anime that look easy and fast, but Shinsekai yori this does not apply. This anime has the atmosphere of tension. Probably not many people understand the true pleasure of viewing and many it will seem boring, but I'm\
          \
        sure that there are people capable of the really evaluate this creation. One ser. is able to give us much information, equal to a short film. It should be noted that the anime has a remarkable drawing and a great story. I have not seen anything so amazing and interesting, as the world Shinsekay yori. I hope you enjoy the view and want to stay in this world a little more.\

    Shinsekai Yori is one of those anime that made quite a name for themselves. Based off the award winning novel and being quite high in MAL's ranking it is no wonder everywhere I look I find people applauding this curious little series. The question is if it could hold its own based on this huge reputation.\
Storywise I can honestly say it can, and it even transcended my expectations. While nothing special on the first glance, it avoided all cliches found in anime and then some in sci-fi alltogether. There is no cyberpunk world or space opera trope to be found, no copy paste characters like\
          \
        tsundere or overpowered main character and certainly not any overdone jokes or unfitting fanservice. The most 'fanservice' you'll find is probably in episode 8, which is still very tame to anime norms. I don't even think it counts as such and don't get people are upset by it. When going in I thought of some yaoi-esque material because of what the people who didn't like it said about it. I guess some people exaggerate things very easily. I'm also happy I could actually understand some of the symbolism because while I think the genre Shinsekai Yori is in needs it I am usually too dense to spot any while also understanding.\
Like I said storywise it does deliver, but the art, pacing and sound help a lot. Combined they make for some tranquil yet sometimes menacing atmosphere, and the balance adapts nicely when needed. You'll rarely see such great work in any medium, especially anime. It's especially nice since the soundtrack has no problem standing on its own. My only complaint here is that Saki's seiyuu sounded a bit on the whiny side at times. She couldn't really handle the young protagonists voice very well. It's even more obvious because the other characters had very good voice acting. Luckily they replaced her when Saki matured and in the end she was not worse than for example Satoru's voice actor.\
Saki, Satoru and the others are very nice characters by the way, or at least for a plot driven story. Like I said before you shouldn't expect any of the typical anime character tropes here so they honestly felt as a breath of fresh air. Protagonist Watanabe Saki for example is one of the few characters I would label as a strong woman. It's not because she can hold her own in a fight or is apathic or something. The fact that I call her strong is because while being one of the most emotional characters in the series her feelings never get in the way. People in the series acknowledge this and it even becomes a plot point later on. The other characters are equally likeable.\
With all this you can rest assured that Shinsekai Yori is a force to be reckoned with. Of course I can't speak for everyone when I say I liked this series a lot but if you like science fiction you should consider watching this.\

    Wow, I dived into this anime not really knowing what to expect. It is so dark, deep, moving, and offers insightful critiques on society and morality. It challenges you to question what is right, what is wrong, and what the future of technology can hold. \
Story: It was a little difficult to get into at first because the story revolved around little kids living in a dystopian society. But the anime actually tells the story of their lives from childhood to adulthood. It does it so beautifully. It takes some time to get into and sometimes some episodes are hard to wrap your mind around.\
          \
        But with patience, you will feel that this was a masterpiece as a whole. At the end everything fits together. I usually go for animes with tons of OP fight scenes and powers so I was taken aback by how intriguing this plot was. There are moments of excitement where you just binge watch until 2 am, moments where you are like what in the world is going on, and moments where you will probably shamelessly cry. \
Character: For a 25 episode anime I think the character development is so good. Most times when there are too many characters everyone's story is kind of mushed together and you just forget it. Not in this anime. Each character is unique and plays a pivotal role in the plot of the anime. Every character gets the right amount of screen time to really understand them. That's what makes this so moving.\
Art/Sound: Art is pretty standard for an anime. What i think is absolutely great is the sound. Wow the music is just so suiting. After finishing the series and looking back, the tone of musical choice is very suitable to the underlying message of the anime.\
Overall: Just a really great work. I would not say its my favorite anime but I just love how it pulled on my heart strings without trying too hard, how it remained confusing but not for too long, how it had just the right amount of tender and exciting moments...Well done. Well done.\

Sound - really well used throughout the show. Some amazing OST that really put us into the show's ambience.\
1st ending is awesome, 2nd ending is also very good.\
Characters - I found the character's interaction very interesting.\
Yes, it is true that there is some Yaoi and Yuri, but it makes so much sense! It's not random, it's very well thought.\
Art - The animation is not the best, but the artwork is interesting and nice to watch.\
This anime made me feel a mix of feelings and left me without words\
          \
        after the last episode. I had to take some time to think about it... It is a bit slow in the beginning and you probably won't understand anything, but then, in the end, everything will make sense and you'll probably feel that all the wait was worth it\
So I really recommend you to keep watching till the end. This \"New World\" that is presented to us (incredibly well by this incredibly writer) is something that i think that is not that far from our actual living and we can relate to nowadays...\
I didn't gave it a 10, but it is definitely some sort of a masterpiece.\
Some remarkable quotes from Shinsekai Yori:\
\"We are humans!!\"\
\"All problems come from the human mind. In the mind, one's consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg. What lies beneath the surface... the subconscious... is far more vast.\"\
\"Don't you think we are being treated more like defective products to be disposed of than like human beings? Once the kiln is opened and the pottery inspected, all that are crooked or bear cracks are fated to be smashed.\"\

- Information: it says scifi, but there is maybe even more of a fantasy-like adventurous and journey-like vibe in this series.\
- Excellently built and executed: everything flows smoothly, complex enough but quite easy to follow, maybe slow for some people, but definitely not boring. (Almost) never feels fake or awkward compared to other animes. Very atmospheric and beautiful at times.\
- Excellent landscapes and sceneries, it's just pure enjoyment to watch, builds up atmosphere and fits to the mix.\
- Music: spacious, wide sounding. There is ochestral and metal and some scifi-like too. Big plus for atmosphere and fits well.\
- Sound quality and dynamics\
          \
        are perfect.\
- Animation is not perfect, but it didn't bother me. It's not badly made, but it's simple. Visually characters are simple too, maybe even dull, but trust me, it really fits this series better than generic schoolgirls and -boys.\
- Characters are not extraordinary deep and full fetched, but there are interesting ones too. Still, they are VERY likeable and you care about them.\
- Overall: Well rounded, VERY atmospheric, emotional, story is deep, plot is unpredictable but unfolds smoothly.\

    FIRST, let me start with what I found lacking in this anime.\
When it comes to this anime, I was very iffy about it in the beginning. After watching the first three episodes, I felt that it was heavily reliant on the exposition of the setting (World, history, and nature of the story). While it i understandable why this would be necessary, At times, I was into it because it was interesting, and there were moments when I was wondering what the hell I was watching and why I don't understand a thing nor the reason why they would be showing me all this. After Having\
          \
        watched those 3 episodes, I didn't feel the urge to watch more right away so I had it on hold for a week or so. After deciding to resume because of seeing how this anime had such a high rating, I didn't see much or a change about the way I felt toward what was going on.\
From Episode 1 -9 I didn't feel much enjoyment watching its' slow pace and not understanding what's really going on made my interest die out a bit slowly. From the way it began, I was expecting it would be something like Carrie, where people with telekinetic power lose control and thus gore ensues. During that frame of episodes, it went back and forth between the powers and stories and rat monster creatures, I began to question what the story was really about and felt that I probably wouldn't get what I was expecting.\
The characters weren't particularly likeable, the character development in this anime isn't really well done, I felt nothing for the characters, when some of then were hurting or crying or troubled, I was wondering if I should have felt someway for then, but I didn't because of this lacking factor. A character died and I didn't feel anyway.\
With this anime, you have to be more attentive to all the exposition, because this anime has more talking than showing. I've come to realize, though, that it's somewhat better that they spoke a lot instead of showed us because that left it up to our imagination.. we had to imagine what it was like when they were revealing these events of the past and what they fear.\
SECOND, let's focus and what was good in the end.\
From episode 10 - the end, things began to get interesting. all the exposition and events that occurred in the episode 1 - 9 because to come together and made sense. You will be happy you had to sit through all of that slowness and strangeness and you will realize why it was necessary. There are time skips used more than twice in this series overall and while there is poor character development, you will realize that it was necessary because not all events that happened in the show would have made sense to happen all so fast. Time has to pass for progress to be made through the story, and that's especially considering that planning and executing a revolt or war with the intent to win does not occur over night especially when it comes to dealing with humans that have special abilities.\
\
This anime is definitely and excellent psychological thriller in the end. As it progressed from episode 10 onward I was beginning to feel scared for the main characters' lives, I began to feel anger, hatred, confusion.. I didn't know who was traitor, nor was I sure if what I was beginning to believe was true was even true at all. Most of the times the art was very good, the sound was nice, I felt it went well with the anime. I'm glad I decided to watch it all the way through. I can see why people give it such a high rating. That major reveal in the end though, after that I didn't feel like I was able to hate anyone anymore. I didn't know how to feel after that.\
From Episode 1-4 I felt like I would have been giving it a 6.. from 5-10 I felt that I would upgrade it to a 7 and from 11 to the end I realized that this series was worth a solid 9, regardless of what I felt it was lacking. This anime was worth the watch and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves psychological thrillers.",

    Criminally underrated; with beautiful scenery, a gorgeous score and an absolutely wonderful story. \
First, the plot. The best reason to watch this show. It is impeccably paced, using the first two episodes to introduce us to our protagonist Saki, her friends and the life she knows. Only once we're familiar with this does the show drop the exposition bomb (be prepared for episode 4, I will admit.) This story has two main arcs, one when Saki is a child-teenager and one when the other when she is an adult. The first arc is mainly worldbuilding, and is usually what most synopses of SSY describe. The\
          \
        second arc is, in my opinion, where the real meat of the show comes in. Especially the ending. Good lord, the ending is one of the most perfect endings I've seen in any anime. It's understated, it makes sense in the context of the characters and it ends on a phrase that so wonderfully sums up the series as a whole. I won't dare spoil the ending, go see for yourself.\
The characters aren't at all bland or uninteresting, but some got a lot more development than others. I put the score as high as I did for two reasons: Saki and {The Antagonist}. \
Saki is a wonderful protagonist. As a child she's brash but she's not a universal leader, she's cheerful but can have bad days, she can sometimes do catty teenage things (but then again, they all do). She's a very well-written young character. And as she grows, you see how she changes and she is able to live in this world and have her personal fortitude see her through. \
{The Antagonist}, without giving anything away, is one of the best written and fully dimensional characters I have ever seen. They're a tragic character: they want to do what they think is best but they go about it in the wrong way. They start out trying to be kind and negotiable but in the end feel they can only resort to doing horrible horrible things. The fanbase is mixed about this character and whether they were actually the \"good\" guy, but just the fact that the fanbase is so divided and each side can find hundreds of things to justify their argument is a testament to just how complex and interesting they are.\
The art is a little hit or miss at times, which makes sense as it's animated by the often hit or miss A-1 Pictures. However, while the characters' movements aren't as fluid as other more recent A-1 anime (this came out in late 2012) the backgrounds and scenery are lovely. Also, special shout-out to the costume design. Saki's mom's gardening onesie notwithstanding, the majority of the outfits are very interesting and nice to look at.\
The music is gorgeous. I don't have much else to say about it other than shout-out to the main theme, the Kage no Denshouka suite. Chills every time.\
SSY is based on the novel of the same name by  Yusuke Kishi. Having read most of the novel via online translation, I can testify that this is a direct and faithful adaptation. It doesn't go quite as in-depth as the novel does, but that does not mean by any stretch that the anime is lacking. Consider reading them in this order: anime first, novel as an expansion. \
Overall, I can safely say the SSY is likely my favourite anime of all time. \

    I know that many people dislike this anime for the art or just think it's weird, but if you finish the whole thing it might change your perspective on so many things, like it did for me. Not only does it have AMAZING music, but it has so many emotions. '\
There are times when it makes your brain hurt trying to comprehend it, time when it will make you smile, and times when it'll make you cry when a characters dies. It is my favorite anime, I recommend it to everyone.\
Story:\
9, because it can be a bit confusing at times. It doesn't really explain that\
          \
        it happens about 1000 years into the future but you can assume it is somewhere in the future if you watch more than episode 1. But, it is a very great story and there are a lot of plot twists especially with the romance and such.\
Art:\
10. I love this art, and I think it's outstanding. It is an artstyle that perfectly matches the emotions and you will feel while watching the show if you really let it sink in. Also, it reminds me of Madoka Magica with the characters looking so innocent but being involved in some really dark situations and adventures.\
Sound\
10, from the English Dub. It had really good music (especially Wareta Ringo which is my favorite  song). The voice acting fit the characters well and the background music fit the scenes. Without the music I wouldn't have liked it so much.\
Character:\
9. They introduced the characters, you got to know them, you got to love them, you watched them grow up, and then you watched some of them go (die). It was sad, but it was still great and we'll always remember them and what they did for humanity... I guess.\
Enjoyment:\
10, because this anime is a one-of-a-kind anime that could be described with so many genres, horror, psychological, romance, tragedy, mystery... It is an awesome anime, but don't stop after episode 1 and say you don't like it! It gets way more interesting and there are a lot of plot twists! You'll love the characters, and the story is interesting, so I'd say it's almost a perfect anime! \

    After watching Shinsekai Yori, I have to say it has become one of my favourites. Right from the beginning to the end, I was sitting in wonder at everything that was happening. It is an anime that confuses you right from the start, throwing you into a world that is both unfamiliar and strange, but that was what made it great. That confusion allowed you to be at the same level as the characters, who are also as lost as you are. As the show progressed and information is slowly being known, you are also faced with the horror and shock that the characters are\
          \
        feeling. \
Shinsekai Yori has subtle messages threaded throughout the show, but many pass right under our noses until the very end. It is deep, dark, and dreadful, but thoughtful and insightful. It is a show that you won't understand until the very last minute, when everything is finally revealed. I, myself, had to take a step back after finishing it to process what I had just watched because it was like a big puzzle had been completed.\
Although this anime is great, I will have to say that it isn't for everyone. It has very dark elements, disturbing scenes, and mature content, but it is a show worth watching if one is willing. The characters had great development; they were relatable and realistic, portraying many flaws as humans should be. \
Plot 10/10 - It was confusing, but that was the best part. There were so many little plots going on, but it all worked out to be an amazing ending. Everything worked together, all the events were necessary, and there was not a moment wasted. It was intense, fast paced, and the world was well crafted.\
Though the plot could be confusing sometimes in its nature, the world was not. The rules of this new world were laid out bare for the viewer and made sure that everyone knew how the new world worked and how the system operated. It had a great balance of information and action, which gave the knowledge the viewer needed, but didn't bore them to death. \
Art 8/10 - The art was beautiful and breathtaking. It captured the intensity of the plot and the grimness of the situation that the characters were facing. There were times where the animation went a little weird and a few episodes where the characters seemed a little odd, but overall, it was well drawn. \
Sound 10/10 - The music in this anime was amazing. It complemented the plot well, came in when it needed to come in, and wasn't too overwhelming that it drew away from the show. \
Character 10/10 - From the beginning to the end, we see the characters grow, transform, and be exposed to the reality of their world. We follow them from when they are young to their adulthood, watching at how they mature to the situation around them. It was very well done and I felt a connection with them as we were also put in the same boat, not knowing anything about the world they live in until the very end. \
Overall 5/5 - This was one of the best anime I have ever watched. It was thought provoking, captivating, and it had me in awe the whole time. It was dark and mature, and though it may not be for everyone, if you do try it out, it will definitely be an adventure worth while.\

    If you are hesitating to watch this anime, just realise that it developped in me the same addiction that happened with animes like Steins Gate where mystery and possibilities make you crave to see the next episode and the outcome.\
It is the first Time I ever go to the lenght of writing a Review in English by the way. I have seen a really high number of anime, most of the one existing, that is why I pass my time looking for animes, and at first glance this anime didn't alert my radar. I'm usually more a fan of action anime and I find horror\
          \
        based and drama based animes rather boring, even though I watch them at the end since I have nothing else to watch. Then abandon them at the second episode.\
 That is clearly not what happened.\
Concerning the Story :\
Like most of the people here I believe, I was surprisingly hooked to Shinsekai yori. The way the information is brought to the watcher in sequences, makes it really easy to aprehend even though certain aspects may seem a bit confusing at first or too heavy to directly grasp, with a part of guessing and a part of mistery you manage to square what's happening. The characters, sounds, art and dark athmosphere makes it really easy to get in the boat and journee in this raw distopic world.\
Nothing told seems unconceivable making the immersion easier and as the background is rigorously set, you can extend it in many  rational questions that are most of the time answered at some point. The ending is really acceptable in this optic.\
Concerning the Art : \
The quality of the drawing is not exeptional maybe even lacking sometimes, but, the originality of it and the rawness convey strong tension and feelings, the deepness of the drawing is increased at the right moment to immerse the watcher in the characters state of mind whatever they are.\
The anime is not an emotional lift but it still manage to catch you and bring you down or up at the right moment.\
Concerning the Sound : \
The anime is really spirit oriented and the soundtracks are really emotional/spiritual sometimes even more than the drawings, there are some recurrent songs that take different meanings as the anime proceed, and, they are the songs that have the biggest impact.\
Concerning the Characters :\
I'd say the story is told as an auto-biography , that's why I consider the characters' developpement and deepnesses part of the story-line, they are not some parallel pawns that advertise us, each one of them and their background participate in making the story line progress all along, they clearly all have a role and we don't feel like time or concentration is being wasted except at certain moments where repetitive flash-backs can become boresome and slow somehow.\
I don't know if I really enjoyed the anime it is not an happy story, you don't have fun watching the anime but it was really interesting, really addicting, as the background and characters are brought with a great rationality and darkness around them that feed the mistery.\
I recommend it to anyone as it is not my kind of anime but the immersiv vibe still caught me and I voluntarily let myself transported till the 25th episode.\

    Shinsekai Yori creates an interesting distopian world but it unfortunately runs into a lot of hiccups early on such as having a 12 minute info dump in episode 4. changing art styles for no reason in episode 5 and not knowing how much power it wanted to give it's characters. These issues go away as it goes on but my two largest issues is that some episodes feel needlessly long and rather than building up suspense they just delay what you want to see. The other is that it can be predictable at times building up to events that you could see coming a mile\

    At first when I started watching the anime, I was expecting great things. And there was great things at first. But as I continued the episodes the story turned muddled and confused the heck outta me. Another part that made me drop was Episode 5, where the characters are sent into some wacky meerkat world. It was too big of a change. And the two main leads who are JUST middle-schoolers try to have sexual intercourse. Another huge turnoff was when the art changed drastically at Episode 5. That's not good, I come for the story and nice art, but when you change the art\

    This anime is so unknown and it really needs the credit it deserves. The series is very interesting, with a captivating story and awesome character development. \
I imagine the main reasons people ever look at this anime and say it sucks are that:\
a) There is some shounen-ai and shoujo-ai (AKA gay and lesbian love), but it really isn't anything major. It just shows up in an episode and people kiss each other. It's not the main focus and becomes a bit of a sub-plot later on.\
b) The show frequently timeskips, beginning when the main characters are 10 and then jumping a couple years to when\
          \
        they're 14 and then again jumping later on to when they're 26. Although this does fragment the plot, the characters clearly are developed after the skips.\
I think although the plot is fragmented, it has clearly established arcs and the plot progresses at just the right speed, getting through large amounts of plot quickly but not too fast (like SAO is).\

    This anime called Shinsekai Yori (From the New World), is an anime I just recently finished watching after about a month of watching it between the seasonal anime airing gaps. I must say, this anime is something else. A golden egg among the white, ordinary ones. It really captured the beauty of the world which is quite similar to ours, yet so different (I will not say anything more of that, because then I will get into spoilers). This is one of my favourite anime of all time and I am really glad I decided to watch it, so let us get into the specifics\
          \
        on why this anime is so spectacularly amazing. \
The story- As you probably have read the synpsis for this series, I will not get into that- and instead tell you why the story is good or bad. \
So, to start things off, the story is quite original. A dystopian future set in a world were most people have psychic powers? Count me in. Therefore, the premise of the series really grabbed and took a hold on my curious mind so tightly for me not being able to let go. For most dystopian stories are either just post-war stories with nuclear fallout and what not, or futuristic cyberpunk stories. So, this anime was a breath of fresh air, and that breath of fresh air was truly a ride worth going on. \
The art- This is something which the anime really has done correctly, or rather, one of them. Especially in the beginning, the art direction changes a bit in some episodes, because of them changing art director for some episodes. That might seem like a bad thing, but on the contrary, that leads to some episodes being more art-oriented than others- and since when was artsy a bad thing? But, the episodes still had as much of a stoy as the other episodes, and every episode had their own charms.\
Sound- The sound is something which really contributed to the series tone and mood. I do not listen to the sound all that much, but I could really notice that the sound was very neatly put in the right places to get the right mood.\
Character- The characters in this series are very realistic, and I really love the characters and feel for them in the end. The characters break at certain points and do not break at certain points, and that is one of the reasons why they are very likeable, you can sense yourself in at least one of the characters and how they act in certain situations. Some of them are strong and some of them are weak. Some of them are loveable and some of them are not so much loveable, and you will see that people will decieve eachother quite a bit, mostly for selfish purposes (or I will leave you to think otherwise if you like).\
Enjoyment- The overall enjoyment of this series is a solid nine, because I feel that I could not give the enjoyment a ten, because sometimes the episodes can be just a tiny bit boring, just so little so the enjoyment almost reaches a ten, but falls just so little short from it.\
The overall rating is a ten though, because I belive this anime is a modern classic in the making. \

    One of the most intriguing anime to date. But because it takes the time to setup its own world most people wouldn't stick to the end. But I'm glad I did because underneath the generic character design is a story that must be experience. I hesitated to watch this series for some time despite people singing praises to it. After I finished the series the conundrum presented by it stuck with me for a good week.\
Story - 10\
Absolutely well written story, a well developed world and society. Not only it shows the village daily life but also the ecosystem and transportation of choice that make\
          \
        sense. Every episode builds a steady unease on just how the village is in a sinister tone. When it does reveals itself you can be sure every episode felt just under 10 minutes instead. It throws me left and right as the story presents each party reason for conflict. Give yourself a weekend to watch the initial episodes on you will find the story ahead really worth your time.\
Art - 7\
I respect this series for sticking to the roots of the manga design. But the characters design are very similar and tough to tell who is who unless mentioned in a dialogue. But it redeems itself when it comes to background animation, it is very otherworldly and interesting to watch characters traversing through the environment.\
Sound - 10\
Truly amazing soundtrack that left me mesmerized at the different ost. It fits well into the world of Shinsekai Yori giving it some otherworldly and unease tone. It understands when to use the soundtrack and when to just let the scene roll by itself. Though some soundtrack is repetitive in my opinion I don't mind since you can't really find another similar track on other anime.\
Character - 10\
Again very well developed characters with consistent actions. I may not like some characters in a good way but the motivation make sense . In the end I had doubt on the characters action and understanding a little why they did it.\
Overall - 9\
If you read through all this then I only have to say set aside some time to watch this series. Well worth the time and making you ponder on many civilization issues that still occurs today.\

    Shinsekai Yori is an anime that completely passed me when it originally aired, but I've since only heard good things about.\
After reading the synopsis and concluding that I like the character design (especially the clothes and Queerats in general) I've taken the plunge and binged the show.\
Story:\
I was heavily intrigued by the setting from the get-go and I'll say that I actually still am, as well. The big problem with this is, that the show doesn't make much out of it. The world-building is quite well paced in the first few episodes, often showing flashbacks at the start of the episode to somewhat explain how\
          \
        the setting evolved (or in this case devolved) so far.\
This quickly gets tossed out of the window however, as we get hit with a literal exposition snail only a few minutes in.\
The choice of a boring synthetic robot voice for this snail especially puzzled me, as it's the only stimuli the show gives you for half the episode, other than the kids asking questions.\
The story quickly shifts slowly revealing this about this mysterious and genuinely interesting setting to only being about political intrigue and character arcs, which both fall extremely flat.\
The premise of a totalitarian regime (with literal hypnosis, assassinations and quasi slavery) is too universally disliked for a show that tries to ask a morally grey question. Hearing everyone say \"Squealer did nothing wrong!\", I expected the statement to be ironic, but it turns out that it's entirely true.\
I will now try to summarize the big question this show throws at you, you be the judge: \"Is it morally okay to enslave an equally intelligent species as long as you're more powerful than them?\"\
The twist at the end also does not change anything about this question, if anything, it makes it even easier to answer.\
Art:\
I generally really liked the down to earth visuals as well as the entire setting. My only big problems with the art is that, due to how androgynous most younger characters seem to be, a lot of the characters had a very blatant same-face issue. This was especially obvious due to the amount of close-ups we got.\
Some kudos also for trying a more artsy approach for some scenes, but I think they often fell just a bit short, without real symbolism to properly warrant them.\
Sound:\
The sound really didn't stick out to me that much. They did a really good job of creating an atmosphere for certain scenes, but this also came over as lazy sometimes, to cover up for the poor character writing and script.\
Special mention to both endings, which are very lovely songs.\
Characters:\
This is the big one.\
The characters range from 'Tolerable but lazy' to 'This dude(tte) is literally just a plot device with a face'.\
Saki, the main protagonist, especially seems like she was only included to connect every other character's stories. She doesn't accomplish anything, even though it's established that her powers are average at worst, barely ever takes initiative and once you think about you'll notice that her presence really change anything.\
The only other real character of note is Shun, a prodigy and quite straight-laced guy who seems to get along with everyone, while being a bit distant.\
He disappears during the show because...drama, I guess. That doesn't stop him from still talking with Saki during crucial moments to literally tell her what to do, however. Think Obi-Wan and Luke.\
I couldn't help but groan whenever Shun popped up later one, as I couldn't bring myself to care about him at all and fail to see how any viewer could really see anything in him.\
The characters as a whole don't seem to really grow from their experiences, which make all the character arcs leading up to the final arc mostly useless, save for a bit of lackluster foreshadowing here and there.\
-----\
Overall, I'd call this show a huge missed opportunity.\
I've found myself not caring about a lot of the episodes after the big exposition dump, since the final conflict is hinted at so obviously, which means the only reason to really watch the middle of this anime is if you really like the characters. The dynamics between characters don't really change massively, neither do the characters themselves. The point the anime tries to raise is incredibly stupid in this setting and did not need 25 episodes.\
In general, a good 8-10 episodes could probably be skipped and you'd only miss some very lame character moments and foreshadowing.\
I think I would've dropped this show and felt really insulted by the questions it tries to raise if I hadn't desperately wanted to learn every last bit of the setting.\

    This is my very first review, so I decided to use this opportunity to write one for Shin Sekai Yori.\
I was anxious to dive right into it because it was categorized as a horror , which is one of my absolute favorite genres. \
Story - I will admit that the story started off very slow and reminded me of a Slice of Life, rather than what it was really intended for. But as the episodes progressed further, the story became much more interesting, drawing me into its dark atmosphere. The plot was very confusing for a while because of the unexplained events happening around the\
          \
        characters, but it was appropriate since the events would eventually lead to the mystery of what is going on. \
Art - I have to say that the artwork is one of the best i've seen in an anime in a while. After several episodes, however, the artwork was noticeably different. I was pretty indifferent about the change because I thought it was great either way.\
Sound - The soundtrack is simply amazing and it fit perfectly with the story, drawing me into it even more. At first, I thought it was weird that it didn't have an Opening, but that was immediately pushed aside once I heard the Ending songs. The OSTs are hauntingly beautiful and are permanently ingrained within my mind. \
Characters - The characters are truly what made Shin Sekai Yori an amazing anime. The character development started off weak in the earlier episodes, but at the same time it was believable. This was due to the fact that they started off as children and then grew older as the episodes progressed. Each character dealt with their own personal issues and that eventually led to how their fate was encountered in the later episodes. \
Enjoyment - I highly enjoyed this anime overall. I experienced a mixture of emotions such as happiness, fear, and empathy. With the amazing plot twists, I was constantly kept on the edge of my seat in suspense as my heart raced in anticipation for the next episode. \
Overall - I would definitely recommend this anime to someone who enjoys a good, graphic mystery and enjoys constantly have the hairs on the back of their neck standing up. \

        Normally, I hate all animes because they end and when they do, the endings don't leave me satisfied. In the case of Shinsekai Yori, I was still sad to see it go, but the ending set to rest what the series was trying to achieve from the beginning. \
    We've all had those animes we have playing in the background. We can start the video, leave it playing and go do something else, and come back to find that we could still follow what happened in the time we were gone. Shinsekai Yori is not one of those\
          \
        animes. It has a complex storyline that is driven by its complexity. The character development is an amazing process throughout this entire series and by the time its over, you'll be sad that it ended. Its been 2 years since the anime was first created and it has not lost its splendor. The art takes a traditional manga artwork approach and the sound is very nice. The score compliments the setting and there is one song that is repetitive but you'll find it necessary to the setting. Throughout the story it'll leave you believing you've got the story, but then it'll take a twist and leave you begging for more.\
    Shinsekai Yori has become one of my most favorite animes of all time and I hope it appeals to whoever else shall read this review and watch this masterpiece. \

    I really like when science fiction animme llike Ergo proxy or From the new world are dealing more with the science than with the fiction part of the genre without though forgetting the second part. But in contrast with Ergo proxy (which wanted to play with your mind and for me at least it manages it) Shinsekai yori seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to give to the viewer. And that's the reason that this anime kind off dissapointed me.\
Story: The concept of this anime is fantastic. It wasn't cliche  and it was very unique. It wasn't  dealing with aliens or\
          \
        space but with extraordinary humans and I loved that. But this anime had a huge problem with the pacing. I don't have a problem with slow-paced anime but this anime just didn't decide if it was going fast oor slow. One episode could be slow as hell and the next one would attack you with a mountain of information and strange happenings. So generally speaking while the concept was very good it's deliverance was somehow poor.\
Art: One word spectacular. The animation was so bright and colorful it really drugs you into the anime's world.\
Sound: This anime didn't had openings (except from one episode). But the music was very good the OST's pretty good some of them were classical music masterpieces. The first ending even though it was really weird I absolutely loved it. The second one was fine although I would prefer if they kept the first ending until the end.\
Character: Except from some minor exceptions, I didn't like the characters. I found the protagonists very unreasonable and illogical at some moments especially Saki. But the minor exception was Squiller. He maybe seem annoying initially but trust me this little thing was one of the most completed characters I have ever seen. For him and only I put in the character section a 7.\
Enjoyment: I wouldn't say that I didn't like Shinsekai yori but I certainly didn't enjoyed it as much. There were some times were I was loosing it. The final episode saved it for me with the bitter-sweet ending that it gave us. Overall I would say that this anime was an interesting experience but it could be much better if it didn't try to be so sophisticated at some times. Watch it if you want something different from the usual science fiction anime.\
PS: This anime has  some yaoi/yuri scenes which I'm not a fun to tell the truth but this anime at least had a reason to put them there so don'tbe surprised when you see them.\

    So I decided to make a review on Shinsekai Yori (From the new world). I finished the anime yesterday and I must say really touched me. Why? I will explain :)\
\
Story: 10\
This the story starts a bit slowly and that can make people drop this anime, but I must say if you like mysteries than you should watch it. This anime starts progressing a lot when the 12 year old's goes to 14 year old's. It can be a little turn off with the girls love and boys love, but those so called love won't last long. After episode 6 the story begins to roll.\
          \
        That's when you need to pay attention. Because this anime is not just a some weird story it really is dark and moody. It tells a lot about how humans make things easier for themselves  which makes this story believable.\
Art: 9\
The art isn't very good, but definitely isn't bad either. What made me like this art was the fighting scenes. They were made realistically so that it seemed the children with power were not immortals either. It isn't much I can say about the art it was good.\
Sound: 9\
The soundtracks were made just for this anime. They were dark and moody. They were the ones that showed at the start that this anime won't be pretty. Soundtracks were made really well considering the surroundings of the villages and that mysterious aura.\
Characters: 10\
The characters had developed in the series. You could see the changes when there was a jump from years to years. The main characters were good. Saki(heroin) was not the strongest she cried and solved the problems after that. She is strong minded and persistent. She was a type of anime girl that I like. \
Enjoyment: 10\
I really did enjoy this anime because it left me wondering episode after episode what will happen next. The first ending song was catchy and made me want to look for the next episode. I started slowely and didn't know what to expect, but after it got interesting I watched 20 episodes through one day. I loved it, and the ending was what I wanted. It showed cruelty of humans.\
Overall: 10\
The anime was good, even through it started slowly. I liked it and next day I found myself searching for an anime like this. This anime was unique, the theme children with powers is normal, but the way this anime was presented was a win. I like both the sound and art.  Thats why I give it a 10.\
I recommend this anime to you and I hope you will enjoy just as much as I did :)  ",

    Story & tone: 10/10\
Shinsekai Yori is set one millennium into the future, in something that looks like a Utopia, and where every human possesses psychokinetic powers. The viewers do however understand that something isn’t quite right, from the very start of the series. \
The anime got a pretty slow paced plot, which helps it a lot when it comes to world building and adding a mysterious suspension. It’s a pretty mature show, which is hard for a lot of the typical anime watcher to enjoy. It’s doesn’t have a lot of action or fancy fighting, but rather world building and mature themes.\
The show challenges the\
          \
        viewer both morally and psychologically, and makes it believable. There are no good or bad in the real world, but rather different shades of gray and perspectives.\
Characters: 9/10\
The characters in Shinsekai Yori, doesn’t have as much personality as most fictional characters, but rather more realistic ones. We follow the main character, as she learns the truth in the same way as the viewers do. Most of the main cast can be seen as a medium, to explore the world of Shinsekai Yori. If the characters had too much personality, it would derive from the realism and the main aspect of this show, the world building. However, just like in the real world, there are some characters, with more personality and ambition than others.\
Production value (animation & audio): 7/10\
Shinsekai Yori got a pretty unique art style. It’s by no means very high quality, but it fits the tone of the show perfectly. It got creative designs for a plethora of different creatures, while making the humans characters have realistic, but varied character designs. The animation quality, do however vary, and it even had guest directors in 2 episodes. Animation quality is probably the weakest point of this anime.\
The voice acting fits the characters perfectly, and they never feel forced or inadequate while expressing emotions. When it comes to delivering an atmospheric environment, the music is spot on. With a combination of haunting, thrilling and somber music, it got a great combination of mesmerizing OST. There is no OP in this anime, but the ED delivers spot on, and help you calm down after a nerve wracking episode.\
Overall: 9/10\
Overall, the most important thing about Shinsekai Yori is still its world building, and it delivers spot on. It’s probably the most mature and interesting take, I’ve seen on the fantasy genre. While some people may find the first episodes slow, I personally loved the build up, and the payoff was even better. I’d recommend this show, if you’re a fan of more slow paced story and world building in anime, rather than your typical flashy fantasy show.\

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS a slighty small  SPOILER\
\
Shin Sekai Yori is definitely an alien in the anime genre. I started this series without any expectation. I had actually stumbled upon it by chance and liked the main poster so I gave it a go. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews which I haven't read which speak very eloquently about what makes this series amazing in its own right so I'll try to be as concise as possible.\
Be warned however that if you're looking for something action packed, this is not the series for\
          \
        you. I've seen some pretty bad ratings but reading the reviews which explained them, It just felt like the viewers had given up on the series too soon without understanding what they were watching.\
Shin Sekai Yori is first and foremost a psychological anime which raises disturbing questions to its viewers. It is also targeted to a mature audience, it is important before bothering to watch it. If you're a 13 to 15 years-old, you may be a bit green to watch this not because of the images but rather because of its challenging content.\
Now in more details:\
Story: 10\
In an unknown time, we follow a group of kids in their journey to adulthood. They live in some sort of Utopian society but it soon appears that there's something very rotten underneath though neither you nor the kids know where exactly this feeling is coming from. It doesn't help that even the adults are forbidden to speak about certain subjects.\
About 4 episodes in, out main characters learn of certain truths which will be at the heart of their challenges ahead. \
I found it remarkable how even though most of the mysteries are explained early, the anime makes you change your mind about the disputable choices made by those who created this utopia on several occasions.\
I actually had to take a break from the series after 12 episodes since the series doesn't shy away from cruelty. Maybe I got too invested, but I had a hard time dealing with certain events portrayed and found it particularly hard on the children especially since at that point it was very difficult to understand why such hard choices and decisions had been made.\
Overall, the story's well crafted though I would have loved a couple of more episodes to make the transitions between the different time jumps smoother... But you can't have everything.\
Art: 8\
I really didn't like the character design at first, especially the overly big eyes which totally creeped me out combined with their very skinny bodies... But ultimately it does contribute to the general feeling of unease that transpires through the series. \
I'm also not too fond of the queercat's design. I actually found them pretty disgusting... It's interesting to note that Kiroumaru, although a queercat, has been given a more noble appearance closer to that of humans ( he's also taller than most adult humans when all the other queercats are smaller than 10 year-old children) . This however is not explained throughout the series.\
Overall the art is good, and although I'm not a fan, I've got to admit that it fits the disturbing atmosphere on the whole. It's also interesting how the world of humans is full of vivid colors while those of the queercats is always featured in caves and shadows.\
Sound: 9\
Spot on. Again, I'm not a fan, but it does fit. The crystalline voices also gave me the chills. Even when everything is peaceful, you just get that feeling of general uneasiness.\
Character: 8\
Overall, characterization was allright. I did have a hard time warming up to Saki, the lead girl, because I found her attitude towards Satoru at the beginning of the series too antagonistic and her aggressiveness was never explained... especially since he was from the beginning a pretty nice child who only argued when Saki reacted badly... i.e all the time.\
I also had a hard time warming up to Shun. He was a bit too perfect to be true. All the kids in the group had their qualities and faults but Shun was too mature, too kind even as a young child. That made him completely unrealistic and difficult to relate to in my book though..\
SPOILER\
\
\
\
That made his fate all the more tragic and sad. I didn't warm up to him, but I was pretty affected by the way he left the series. \
\
\
\
\
END OF SPOILER\
\
There's many things to be said regarding the characters... I wish as I said earlier, more episodes had been given. Due to the several time jumps, there are some key relations that evolved without us viewers knowing how it happened. It's understandable in a way, since the story's told through Saki's eyes and their relations though important are not the point of this series but still.\
While I loved Satoru from the start, the same cannot be said about the other characters. It just felt like Satoru and Saki were the most balanced out of the lot: Mamoru is the crybaby, Shun the smart, brilliant and kind one and Maria, the protector of the weak. \
And while Satoru and Saki evolve as they grow up, I just didn't get the same feeling for the 3 others. If I had something to reproach that would be that.\
There's also a bunch of secondary characters that I would love to talk about but that would be useless. Watch the anime instead.\
\
Enjoyment: 7\
\
Objectively, I thought this series was amazing but I can't say that I fully enjoyed it. Enjoying would mean that I had experienced pleasure watching this when I generally felt ill at ease and disturbed.\
Il at ease concerning their society and the conception of a Utopia - a bonobo like society for instance. Do I think it's better to make love not war. Yes certainly. But I don't really like the idea of humans behaving like animals  and making love when they feel stressed. This rejection is also felt by Saki early on but it just seems that as she grows up, she ends up accepting it.\
Love and Sex are totally separate just like with the bonobos.\
There are many ethical questions raised throughout the series... Some can be considered through the lens of this futuristic world... others such as the issue of Speciesism can be directly applied to our current Society.\
There is no good answer to the many questions raised in this series and the anime makes good on showing how the humans, whom Saki the narrator is part of, revels in their cruelty when challenged while being taught to be kind from birth. \
As I typed above, it's interesting how you can't help feeling disgusted by the cruelty displayed to the children who don't fit the mold and then are faced with the dire consequences of an act of kindness. \
\
Will I rewatch Shin Sekai Yori...\
I really don't know. It's different certainly. It's one of these rare instances when I am glad for having had the chance to watch something challenging that takes its viewers and their intelligence seriously but at the same time make me question myself on so many things I feel a bit overwhelmed and I just want to empty my head and watch something stupid.\
Go figure.\
What's for sure though, is that it gives food for thought and that I certainly won't forget it. \
\
Conclusion\
\
Shin Sekai Yori takes its viewers seriously. You're not bombarded with philosophical mumbo-jumbo and philosopher's quotes. It presents you with a Society which faced some challenges early on and resorted to its scientific knowledge to  build a world where violence doesn't exist at a certain price. While the intention was noble, one might wonder if this was the best course of action or if they even had the right to go down that road in the first place.\
I personally don't really know what to make of this but I'm sure that will give room to interesting discussions among anime lovers.\
Highly recommended if you're in to make your brain cells work.\

    I was hooked from the moment I heard Dvorak in the first episode. This show is a great look into humanity and the amazing, as well as terrible, things we can do. \
I started watching it because it was listed under Horror, which I think is a poor classification. Are there times that are tense? Absolutely. On the whole, however, it was not horror in the classical sense. There are moments that are horrifying, but not in the same way. If you want a show that has good structure and pacing, excellent use of the rules of the world and some food for thought, this\

    Short Review of Shinsekai yori .(Mild Spoilers)\
The anime is fine.Suitable only for passing time.Nice story with failed execution,with weird and constant tone changes between funny and serious.Major plotholes and very feministic ideas behind some things.Unnecessary images,flashbacks,visions and time skips.You will find yourselves chasing answers until the end of each episode only to never have them answered.Lackluster ending with no character fullfilment,or even anything gained from their experience.Anime works in a dystopian world of no common sense.\
The only reason this has a 8.5 score its because its popular these days to praise mediocre animes for trying something different and fail to accomplish anything.   \

    Shinsekai Yori............ now where to start!!!!!!!!!\
Well if you are such type of person that likes those series that depict human nature, then Shinsekai Yori is for you. It has one of the best story lines I have ever seen. The story develops very slowly. The first 10 to 15 episodes of  the series might seem boring. But you must give it time. ( I know that for a series of total 25 episodes, 10 to 15 might seem a large number for story development. But if you give it ample time, you will witness one of the best series ever). \
In my opinion, this\
          \
        series actually explains the real reason behind the terrorism in this actual world of ours. This series is a beautiful mixture of fantasy and the history of our world. \
The art is nice. Actually I am not an expert in this regard. But for me it was good enough.\
I also liked the soundtrack. Moreover, character building is also good. I am not going to write about any of the characters because I do not want to write any spoilers. \
I have rated this series the lowest in the enjoyment category. The reason is the same that the initial episodes might seem boring.\
In a nutshell, this is a great series with a great story and very good sound track and character building. Hope you people find this review helpful.\

    In one line, watching Shinsekai yori is like seeing a really obtuse comment - not sure whether it's deliberate, intelligent sarcastic critique, or simply dumb and I'm giving it too much credit.\
Post-apocalyptic screenplays seem to be confined to a line segment - either ultra futuristic or ultra primitive, foreshadowing things to come, SY chose the tiresome pit of the latter - in the first few minutes we were succintly told of the destruction of current world order via the emergence of an elite 0.3% posessing telekinetic powers. The pacing was air-tight, no tiresome exposition (in fact no repetitive openings at all, a GREAT plus!), the\
          \
        mood was estatic.\
And then, like a thrill ride running into a swamp, we were suddenly faced with what appeared to be a typical moe magical-girl high school drama, complete with cringeworthy blushes and \"annoyed\" puffy cheeks. \
So problem no.1 - pacing, like many others have said, some golden moments have no waste to spare whatsoever, only to be clumped in forced slow-paced \"emotional\" scenes of \"character building\", with one exception - episode 4 which is entirely an exposition dump that swamps you with the background mythos, undoing the subtle prodedural glimpses into the past at the beginning of every episode, ruining any sense of mystery they had attempted to build up till that point.\
And I put \"character building\" in quotes precisely because they fail at eactly that - the characters are obtuse, robots of \

    If you really want a good dystopian story, watch literally any other show featuring a dystopian society.\
This show is bad. I give it a 4 for \"decent,\" but this is quite charitable only because I know people will watch this under the belief that it is deep and thought-provoking. However, the only thoughts that provoked me during this show are \"why is the writing so awful?\" and \"why are the characters awful?\" Overall, I didn't really see a point to the story or any *meaningful* or worthwhile message that the writer was trying to convey. And if there was a point, it was definitely off\
          \
        the mark. \
As a quick criticism that doesn't need much explaining, the pacing is horrible. It was a grueling task to get through these 25 episodes. Even as a marathon-style anime watcher I had to give the show multiple breaks before returning to it.\
I think a lot of the writing in this show actively works against itself. In the first two thirds of the show, the story is told through future-narration (telling you the protagonist will come out okay no matter what happens, killing a lot of the suspense), present-tense, and unnecessary flashbacks. This makes the presentation horrid and convoluted. You *can* tell a story like this in some cases, but it didn't work here. Often times some very important events or details are tossed in by the narration but not shown - this is infuriating because I don't want a disembodied voice telling me \"by the way such-and-such happened,\" I want to SEE the characters respond to that information. If a character's friend dies or if said character learns something game-changing, I want to see how they react - this is the most important aspect of telling a story. In the rare event we do see a character react to something on-screen, the response is nothing less than utter apathy. \
I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free as possible, but it must be said that the crux of the show is in the slow reveal of the ugly nature of this world's current society, much like a dystopia. If you're expecting a show by which the characters learn the sinister truth then desire to do something about it in the interest of self-preservation or even altruism, then this is not the show you're looking for! When the whole point of writing a dystopia is to have your characters respond to it, then your characters rarely ever show a meaningful response other than the occasional opinion, then you have wasted the viewers' time. \
The few philosophical talking points in the show fail to be put to good use because they are left in the incapable hands of the protagonist and her friends. Their inability to formulate interesting perspectives or opinions is baffling.\
The one or two good things about this show are told better in different shows, so there's little to no point in watching this show other than to pass the \"I saw it so I'm allowed to have an opinion on it\" bar.\

The end of the first episode is the first brush stroke of a dystopic painting wherein a society is afraid of its own children. But an indecisiveness about what particular horrors in this society it wants to focus on derails that story.\

        about the society she lived in.The era is 1000years into the future from modern time,where humans possess psychokinesis power called \"cantus.\"It is taken place in district in Japan called Kamisu 66,where Saki and the 4 other main character Satoru,Maria,Mamoru,and Shun lived.Story started from her enabling cantus power when she was 12 and graduating from Harmony school to Sage Academy and reuniting with the 4 others.Afterwards,they went to 7-day adventure trip from school,where they learned about the violent past and truth about how their society came to be.From highschool 2 years later,frustrating events started to happen and 3 of them were victims of it.During then,Saki learned that their society is corrupted that is afraid of children and their creativity.If child is given the freedom of imagination,their cantus might go berserk and fiend will born from it,which can burn cities into ashes.Their society's main hidden goal is to mind control everyone's behavior and memories so their cantus could stay under control.However,during the 2nd part of the story,Saki had close encounter with a child that has gone fiend and how she caused mass destruction to Kamisu 66.Her previous events in her childhood gave her enough experience to make valuable decision about how to defeat the fiend to save humanity and help them recover.\
Art 10/10\
The artstyle is pretty simplistic,which is the beauty of this show.The story is pretty critical,therefore simple artstyle helped to balance it out.\
Sound 10/10\
1 of the main theme song is like a traditional orchestra type of song,which is used when a resolve is presented after a plot twist.During moments when something bad was going to happen or Saki thinks that something is mysterious,a kind of creepy music is used that highlights the thrill of the moment.Another ost is \"Going home\" which is used when Saki feels extremely sad after remembering something from the past,giving it a feeling of sad nostalgia.This ost is Antonin Dvorak's \"New world Symphony no:9\" 2nd movement.\
Character 10/10:\
Even though it was from the perspective of Saki,other characters were developed nicely,each with their own thoughts and personalities.But the most astounding character was the villain queer-rat Squealer.Even as a villain,he portrayed every single personality a villain was supposed to have and carried it till the very end.He was cunning,highly intelligent and strategic.His actions easily deceived Saki,but even she failed to go against him,knowing that she was getting played by Squealer's trick.\
Enjoyment and overall 10/10:\
I said before,this anime is a masterpiece.Every time I rewatch it,I can't take my eyes off from it because every single event keeps me engaged with watching the series.Every single episode brings some sort of plot twist. This anime will always be 1 of the best animes in my list.\

    If it feels like it's starting out as a standard 'kids go to weird school to learn psychic abilities', it grows out into so much more. It gets epic in scale, immensely sad and also horribly creepy. \
The use of setting inside Shinsekai Yori is one of it's boons, leaving you a bit uncertain whether this is past or future. It sets up both mystery into the origins of it's world, but also long-term progression in the politics of it's society and relationships.\
The horrifying imagery that's presented reflects a society's downfall as well as it's characters emotional upheaval. It becomes incredibly visceral at times, sinking\
          \
        the viewer deep into the dark mood that permeates it.\

    Have you ever wondered what lies inside the deepest parts of your heart? An unwavering will to commit evil for the greater good? The ability to sacrifice everything you have to protect the ones you care for? Or something much more insidious?\
Story (9/10): Imagine for a moment that a couple thousand people in the world suddenly have the power of psychokinesis, then imagine WW3 where people like you and me, lost to those with PK. Throw in some more fantasy elements and you have the world that this show is set in. One thing I did like about the story is that the characters within\
          \
        in all age, I know that sounds kinda weird at first but when you think about it. How many anime are there where you actually see the characters age? Cause I can only think of this show and 5 Centimetres per Second.\
The actual plot line of the show follows a group of 5 young people as they try to find out the truth behind their village, school, the outside world, and their entire society in the process, and past the first 5 episodes that the show uses to introduce the characters and world, it’s actually genuinely enthralling, but those first 5 episode are a bit tough to get through.\
Characters (9/10): Remember the question I asked in the beginning? That question applies to the five main characters specifically and part of what makes this good is that you get to find out which one of the characters will turn out as what.\
Saki Watanabe: The central female protagonist, and the perspective you get the entire show from.\
Satoru Asahina: Who I’ll call central male protagonist, and the one who fights the most aside from Saki for the truth.\
Shun Aonuma: The most gifted of the five, and the one who makes the first big change in the series.\
Mamoru Itou: The shyest of the group, and easily the most sacred of the five.\
Maria Akizuki: Close friend to Saki, and the most unwitting of the lot. (Watch the show and you’ll get it)\
Again the thing I like with this show is that the characters not only change, as characters should, but they also age along with these changes and to give you an idea, when Saki gives narration at the start of the show, she’s 40 years old. The actual characters at the start are all 12.\
The Art & Sound (6/10) & (8/10): The art of the show is done by A-1 Pictures, and it’s hardly their best in terms of detail. In terms of fluidity and symbolic imagery it’s all the way up there, giving you some rather pretty movement at times and at others you’ll swear that SHAFT did the visuals instead.\
The sound is also very nice, from the voice acting of the main and side characters to the OST, to the sound effects used for certain sequences it’s all very nice. I don’t know what else to say.\
What do you think of this anime?\
I brought the Blu-Ray box set.\
Would you recommend this anime?\
Yes, but don’t watch it unless you consider yourself a veteran, this show for the inexperienced will be daunting.\
Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.\

    This anime kept me interested and wanting more. I did not feel bored throughout the series.\
I felt drawn to the characters and I kept watching to see how their adventures will turn out. Things start out small, but will spiral out of control and their world turns upside down.\
The music is fantastic, I actually listened to the ending song instead of skipping it. Art and drawing is high quality, they didn't cut any corners.\
It also has a Japanese feel to it, as in you can see parts of Japanese society in the village and in the characters. An example is having a strictly controlled society.\

    This anime is truly a work of art.  A near-complete plot that gives attention to all of its components.  I have found myself rewatching episodes just to fully grasp fully what the story is about--including the series.  This anime is definitely an anime that caters toward philosophical viewers, but anyone can enjoy if you want to think.  This anime is capable of truly immersing the viewer by evoking the thought that humans are truly fragile creatures, who are so insecure that they have no choice but to become cynical creatures.  This any questions the fundamental thinking of why people act\
          \

    An unexpected find for me, was bored and decided to check it out on a whim...hooked from the first episode. The art as expected of A-1 pictures is pretty consistently good. \
The music didn't really stand out to me personally, I don't find myself searching frantically for the OST as I do with other anime.\
What I liked?\
Utopian theme.Interesting setting.Special Powers. Interesting characters. I see many people commenting that the story starts off slow, I think its the opposite actually, we're introduced to the basic history of the world and the current state of things fairly early on, there's an entire episode 4/5 that breaks down\
          \
        how the world came to be as it is in the anime in detail. \
What I didn't like?\
The story stagnates at around episode 10, or rather the idea that I had was that the 5 children and the main protagonist  especially would be like a wind of change for their town and the world they live in. But it becomes increasingly obvious that they're just being used to progress the larger narrative i.e we're just seeing their world through their eyes, despite how much they question everything they don't seem to do much to change it.\
The story also doesn't explain what happens to the rest of human society, its hinted that the world population is much reduced but implied that their village is just one of many, we still don't know how life is in the other villages/towns though. \
The sexual themes to be honest were the deal breaker for me though. I know they were following the novel but they should have made more concise pairings int he anime adaptation. The idea that 12/14 yearolds would have sexual relations to relieve stress creeped me out to be honest. I think they could have done away with the sexual angle and just maintained that they were all good friends. \
I'll watch this to its conclusion though as I can't find anyone whose read the novel to tell me how it ends, if anyone knows please let me know.\

    I think that shinsekai youri has a an ironic subliminal messaging thats more of a good feeling sub-message that speaks to most viewers that taking solitude is the only happiness (certain people only find this rarely as myself included.) is when you feel the most whole as a person. These actions of the characters only show another story but its the underlining of it is what makes this show apart from the other ones. Which makes you yourself think not much of whats going on , due to its similar pacing and and development of characters and the mystery aspect that so happens with titles\
          \
        such as When They Cry. In other words to put simply this show makes you think just like all the others from this genera. Like every now and then when watching these you hit an anomaly of sorts and throws you into(force ably by the way) another state of mind, so to think. But does it in such a gentle way when you do notice your not mad or freaked out but in a bliss like state. Best way i could describe it , but not only that you're always wanted to come back to this moment of clarity but these things come far and few between which is why they're so good and special.\

    This is my first review so here I go I really tried to get into this anime but I just couldn't. I had read everywhere that it was so good and I love futuristic anime. I really enjoyed the first couple of episodes but after awhile I couldn't stay interested anymore. Overall I do think the story line and animation was very good. The characters were developing well too but I on the other hand wasn't enjoying watching this. I stopped at episode 9 so of course I have no idea how it ends but I am giving it a 7 because it wasn't bad\

    Reseña en Español al final...\
As always I will split this review in several points: Universe, Character Development, Plot Development and \"Animation, Music, Cast\"\
Universe: The utopian/dystopian universe in animes are not exactly my specialty, but I've seen quite a few stories which treats the same. Yet Shinsekai Yori originality overflows with a timeline (which although is not told in detail) of a series of tragedies that span more than 1000 years in order reach the present moment in history. The society that the author has created, how they live, and the past that they carry on their shoulders has been prepared in a great way\
          \
        in order to match with the development and the conclusion of events in the end of the story\
Character Development: It is perhaps the most developed point of the series. The anime focuses largely on the interaction of the 5 main characters (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru and Shun) as they discover the secrets hidden in their universe throughout the series. The utopian universe that has been created in the series, plus the mysterious atmosphere that is always in stories of small and eerie towns leads to psychological genres hues as the story moves on. Furthermore, while the story progresses it starting to show that these characters begin to relate to each other of the most bizarre ways (women with women, men with men) although this is due to the universe where events takes place.\
Plot Development: Divided in three distinct stages separated by time skips of a couple of years between each one. The events are narrated in past tense by the protagonist Saki as an adult that tells all significant events that occurred from her childhood to adulthood where the story ends. Although the beginning is a bit slow and incomprehensible, from chapter 4 onwards begins to understand some things and at least in my case starts to get interested in how it will end. And even as the story continues to enter in slow potholes, there is always that feeling of wanting to keep watching episodes\
Animation, Music and Cast: A-1 Pictures has always been known for their “all-in” bets with their mega-budgets and animation quality for their “Mainstream” anime, but it’s not the case in the series that are a bit more “hipster” and this happens with this anime, although quality is not bad, being a fantasy world needs a little more attention to detail in terms of CG. Nevertheless I still thought that has an average quality. In Regards of the OST I must say that it does not stand out a lot and that's good for the mystery of the story. Also it lacks of an Opening Song and my personal opinion is a con for this show. Because the Opening Song is an important part of the entire project promotion. Regarding VA’s, there isn’t a super cast, but the selection was correct for the 5 main characters. The best role was undoubtedly the veteran Yoshiko Sakakibara (Hellsing, Psycho-Pass) in the voice of Tomohiko Asahina\
Conclusions: I must emphasize that it is not an anime for everyone; it has elements that not play well with most of people. The universe where the story is developed is a society that homosexuality looks normal, and because of that, many people will run away from this anime. Yet if you are a tolerant viewer and you are looking an anime something innovative and out of the stereotype this is a good option, And more if you already like these genres. (I think so, since I'm not one of those xD)\
With nothing more to say, I turn down my pen (or rather my keyboard) for this week before telling you: Enjoy, Comment and Criticize I'm open to constructive criticism so that together we improve on this work. ^^\
\"The power of imagination is what changes everything\" - Saki Watanabe\
RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOL:\
Como siempre dividiré mi opinión en varios puntos principales: Universo, Personajes, Desarrollo de la Trama y “Animación, Música, Reparto” en un conjunto.\
Universo: Los universos utópicos/distópicos no son precisamente mi especialidad, pero he visto unas cuantas historias que plantean lo mismo. Aun así Shin Sekai Yori, desborda originalidad con una línea de tiempo (que aunque no es contada con detalle) de una serie de tragedias que abarcan más de 1000 años, para llegar al momento actual de la historia. La sociedad que el autor ha creado, la forma en la cual viven, y el pasado que ellos cargan en sus hombros ha sido elaborado de una excelente manera para que concuerde con un desarrollo y conclusión de eventos excelente al final del mismo\
Personajes: Es un punto de los más desarrollados de la serie. El anime se enfoca en gran parte de la interacción de los 5 personajes principales (Saki, Satoru, Maria, Mamoru y Shun) mientras van descubriendo los secretos ocultos en su universo durante toda la serie. El universo utópico que ha sido creado en la serie, más el ambiente misterioso que cargan las historias desarrolladas en pequeños pueblos misteriosos conlleva a que tonalidades de géneros psicológicos salgan mientras avanzan los episodios. Además mientras va avanzando la historia se empieza a notar que estos personajes empiezan a relacionarse entre sí de las formas más bizarras posibles (Mujeres con Mujeres, Hombres con Hombres y una que otra vez Hombres con Mujeres) aunque todo esto es debido al universo donde se desarrolla los eventos\
Desarrollo: Dividido en 3 etapas bien separadas por saltos temporales de un par de años entre cada una, los eventos son narrados en tiempo pasado por la protagonista Saki, ya adulta, que cuenta todos los eventos significantes que ocurrieron desde su infancia hasta su adultez donde concluye la historia. Aunque el comienzo es un poco lento e inentendible, desde el capitulo 4 comienza a entenderse de que va la historia y por lo menos en mi caso comienza a interesarme en cómo va a terminar. Y aunque mientras avanza la historia sigue entrando en baches lentos siempre queda esa emoción de ver que sigue.\
Animación, Música, Reparto: A-1 Pictures siempre ha tenido fama de botar la casa por la ventana con sus mega-presupuestos y calidad de animación para los animes Main-Stream, pero no ocurre así en las series que son un poco mas hipster, y esto ocurre con este anime, su calidad aunque no es mala, al ser un mundo de fantasía necesita un poco mas de detallismo en cuanto a los efectos de ordenador aun así lo consideraría de calidad media. De los sountracks debo decir que no destacan mucho y eso es bueno para el misterio de la serie, La serie carece de Opening y eso es punto que a mi opinión personal no debería suceder ya que el Opening es una pieza importante para la promoción del anime. En cuanto a los Actores de Voz, no hay un super-staff, pero la selección fue la correcta para los 5 protagonistas en cada salto temporal y del resto de los personajes en general. Destacar la voz de la veterana Yoshiko Sakakibara (Hellsing, Psycho-Pass) Con la voz de Tomohiko Asahina\
Debo destacar que no es un anime para todos los gustos, tiene elementos que no caen bien a la mayoría de la gente, el mundo donde está desarrollado es una sociedad que ve normal la homosexualidad, y ya por ahí no le va a gustar a mucha a gente, aun así si eres un espectador tolerante y estas buscando un anime algo innovador y fuera del estereotipo, la trama en general te cautivará. Y si eres un fan de esos géneros anteriormente dichos eso será un plus que le añadirá mas gusto al anime (eso pienso yo, ya que no soy uno de esos xD)\
Sin más nada que decir, Bajo mi pluma (o mejor dicho mi Teclado) por esta semana sin antes decirles que: Disfruten, Comenten y Critiquen que estoy abierto a críticas constructivas para que juntos mejoremos en este trabajo.\

    (mild spoilers)\
There were four things that really stood out to me when watching Shinsekai yori. The first, especially in the beginning of the series, was how much it reminded me of playing an MMORPG. The characters had designs that were similar to characters you'd see if you combined Kingdom Hearts and Natsume Yuujinchou. Additionally, especially in the beginning of the series, the soundtrack is something I'd expect to hear in an MMORPG. That being said, one of the reasons I don't feel like I can give the anime a 10 is because for a while in the beginning of the series, it feels like the\
          \
        plot is connected the same way an RPG would - where in order to get plot, you have to approach characters or complete an event/reach a checkpoint.\
The second was the timeskips. I was not expecting to watch characters grow up during the course of the series. It was really well done, especially considering that the nature of the society allows for a sort-of reset of the characters over time (I never found the 'reset' to be detrimental to the growth of the characters as individuals, and that's a really fine line) - often I find that timeskips leave a lot for the viewer to wonder what happened (e.g. how did they get so powerful), but this is not really a shounen-type show. \
The third point kind of ties into the second. Despite there being powerful espers (some of the art and concepts for the espers and their abilities/training of their abilities is quite amazing) and uncontrollable antagonists, this series never has a shounen feel to it. Characters are presumed to get stronger during the course of the series, and the writers did make it a point to show that some espers are much more powerful than others, but the show never took the direction of 'we have to train to get more powerful than the monsters,' it was always, 'we have to find a way to stop the monsters.' Furthermore, all societies in this show have realistic fears, and they react in a way that's really believable. \
The fourth point ties into the third, while the show's premise is somewhat farfetched (depending on whether or not you believe in espers), the social forces that help to shape the show's theme are very believable, in that they're probably being used right now to shape societies and justify shaping societies across the globe. \

    Honestly I found this anime really disturbing from the first episode. The story was set in future and took me until second episode to figure that out. But from that point on all i had to do was imagine the characters were all in denials and all the plot twists were just like i imagined. What I found unrealistic is that gene modification about not killing their own kind, and the one about sexual modification was amusing but it soon became cliche. It's like writer wanted to simplify romance. It was depressing to watch as every worst predictions of mine (at least to me) became\
          \
        real one by one. Honestly nothing ever surprised me!!! I was interested until I finished watching. But my hopes were all crushed as everything I expected was confirmed without even single addition or loss.\
But I guess that's just me... Make up your own minds about it.\

    So after hearing so many good things about Shinsekai yori I thought I would give it a shot. And after watching it I would have to say that my feelings were very mixed about the show. It’s very weird I never felt this way about a show, everything about the production was fantastic. The art was stylish and the music was just right. But everything else around it wasn't very good. Starting with the characters.\
AND HEADS UP THERE ARE SOME SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
\
THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING AT THIS POINT SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
Characters: 6/10\
     So character development is a big thing in this show. We\
          \
        see how these innocent children grow in a society that alters memories and kills of children as they please in order to ensure the \"safety\" of their community. We see these characters grow and change...or at least I like to think there is. \
     Let’s start with the main character Saki. She is by far the most linear and flattest character I have seen. Here character is as flat as a board. From beginning to end she is the exact same character which makes the show very predictable sucking away the tension? The cast around her was far more interesting. We saw them change as time went on. We saw them rise and fall encounter problems and yet we get stuck with a character whose every action is so predictable. For example let’s talk about every scene where Satoru is about to go into something we know is dangerous. Saki always does the don't go, it’s dangerous, fight with Satoru, and then I am coming with. This exact sequence is basically mimicked throughout the entire series. But one of my biggest problems is the interaction between Saki and Shun. We are supposed to believe that Saki loves Shun. Great!!! But is that the case........In the first 9 episodes we only have a couple of glance, blush and well one scene with them together. And then we get 5 episodes where he isn't even there, an uhh....scene in episode 8, and then we get one more scene of them together, and then finally his death. Now when you look at it where is the love? What this series did was what I felt kind of cheap. We are forced to believe that they are in love. But it is not believable for a moment. They share so little screen time together, have very little interaction that we see, and we are supposed to believe that they are in love and so that will make Shun's death more tear jerking. In my book it’s a little cheap, and the death scene is so bland, but I will get to that latter. Anyways I am just saying the Shun and Saki relationship (whatever was there) was not well done. This is sad because her relationship with the rest of the characters, especially Maria, was very well done. Maria and Mamoru were interesting character and you cared about their departure, there death and what implications their departure would cause. But I felt like the scenes with Maria were the only time we ever saw real emotion from Saki, and she finally broke that stoic mask. Mamoru was the scape goat and you saw he was on the harsh end quite a lot. But you saw him endure and then eventually crack bringing about his own downfall. Then we see Satoru go from being a brash young kid to an adult that is mature yet still somewhat clumsy with his thought. In conclusion we were left with probably the blandest character as or protagonist. Everyone around her was far more interesting and yet we were left with her dominating the story and kind of just ruined everything around her.\
Story 5/10\
If you haven't stormed of yet from this review great cause buckle in cause it’s only going to get worse.  \
When looking at Shinsekai Yori I like to split into 3 parts and go analyze them part by part. Part 1: Summer Camp with Rat Monsters, Part 2: The Coming of Age, and Part 3: More Rat Monsters!!!!COME ON.\
So Part 1 is when they are kids and they go off. And it was great but we saw these innocent kids go off and have their own adventure. But we knew that they would find something that would redefine their whole future and this story. And it’s the origin of the world that they live in. And it’s a good back story and a good cut off of where they get to the important part. And then the rat monsters. If you can't tell I really didn't like them as a whole. Although I felt that they were necessary for the first plot. They could have been left out entirely from part 3 if you can't tell from my titles.  But part 1 yes. A lot of the chase scenes from in this part felt so dragged out and eventually you attention to them kind falters. It isn't about how they are going get out of the situation. It’s more about when the hell are they going to get out. But they finally do after a long breath of rat man politics and all that stuff. But in the end there is one thing that I must say about this part. It was a necessary to bring in the part about the back story and the rat monsters. Because this is a new world that we don't know and the characters don't know. And it sets us up perfectly for part 2. \
Part 2 was my favorite part of the entire series and is why this received a 5 rather than well a 2. This part is where we see the back story come to fruition. We saw them heard about the horrible thing society does and now we get to experience what actually happens. Now back to Shun's death scene as I promised. The fact that he didn't take off the mask and didn't let his power go out of control well made the scene rather emotionless. He spoke with basically a monotone and didn't explain too much. Everything was well kind of normal (at least normal in that world). I felt it would be more powerful to see and understand just how terrible Karma demons. What there power does and why it’s feared so much by society? Because this is the first and only time we come face to face with a karma demon. But nope we are left with just a white mask and \"love\" for this scene. And when he died it wasn't \"DAMNIT SHUN WHYYYY!!!??!?!? YOU ARE LEAVING SAKI!” it was more like \"THE DOG NOT THE DOG, and why shun why?” It just wasn't as powerful as it should have been. Because this story is talking about how corrupted the society is and you have to know the reason. And the Karma Demons along with the psycho killers (forgot the name) are the whole reason why they have such a horrible law that kills off children because there might be a chance. But such an act has to be justified by something. Why do such a heinous act. The Psycho killer we understand. But the karma demon we have learned of only two cases. One is shun and we only saw a fraction of what he could actually do but never knew why he was so feared. And the second was about a person we know nothing about and well was fearful. But nevertheless I had really high hopes after finishing the second part. Because we finally saw the head of the ethics committee. And we learned more about the society itself and now were their chance to change it. But what did we get an invasion of rat monsters.\
Part 3 is the reason why the story score is so low. This drawn out tedious dialogue of rat monsters and other things was just so predictable and tedious to go through. They set it out to be this whole thing were they killed off a lot of the people and the psycho killer shows up and everything becomes even more terrifying, or does it. The biggest complaint about the show is this. If you are making a show where the main character goes through dangerous scenarios and faces problems. DON'T HAVE THE MAIN CHARACTER FROM THE FUTURE NARRATE THE ENTIRE SHOW. By doing this they basically say oh by the way she lives so where ever you think she is going to die she isn't. And that completely sucks out all the drama and tension in this show. When they went into the hospital and the psycho killer was there. You just didn't care because you knew she was going to come out alive and there was no horror at all. I can go on for a while on this part but this review is kind of getting long some let me just put it like this. The whole first and second part of the story set up how corrupt their society, we hear about it and experience it firsthand. So you would think the third part would be about how they would change it for the future so that society would be better. But no we forget about it all together, we get a boring thing with rat monsters, and we get a crap tie up at the end as they try to fumble together a oh lets work towards a better future that just didn't make sense. \
The Good stuff Art and Sound: 10/10\
So I figured I finish this off on a good note. The Art, Music and Voice acting was fantastic. Yes I said voice acting and let me explain. The script was awful the acting fantastic. The script is what made Saki a bland character the acting did a good job but couldn't save the character. Nevertheless I felt the voice acting was done very well. The Music was very good to it was just right and never felt to overpowering in places. And the art, wow is it beautiful to look at. \
So In conclusion let’s end it this way, the production was great the story and script was not good. If I were to make any changes I would have made the show shorter. Some places it dragged and some places were unnecessary. But the biggest flaw with the show is that we spend so much time talking about the wrong within the human society. But our big finale is the problems we had with the rat monsters society. Which I felt was the biggest disappointment. The whole back story and the reasoning behind every decision in their society were intriguing, horrifying, and we cared since it directly affected the characters that we have been with. But to end it on rat monsters was not a great way to end a series with so much potential. \
All in all I thank you for reading my long review.",

  synopsis = "Following a sudden outbreak of psychokinesis in 0.1% of the population, a rapid transformation swept the world. The godlike ability to manipulate matter remotely turned many power wielders to violence, inciting a long period of upheaval. Finally, after a chaotic era shaped by the rise and fall of oppressive regimes, the psychic humans were able to achieve a fragile peace by isolating their society, creating a new world bound by complex rules. In the town of Kamisu 66, 12-year-old Saki Watanabe has just awakened to her powers and is relieved to rejoin her friends—the mischievous Satoru Asahina, the shy Mamoru Itou, the cheerful Maria Akizuki, and Shun Aonuma, a mysterious boy whom Saki admires—at Sage Academy, a special school for psychics. However, unease looms as Saki begins to question the fate of those unable to awaken to their powers, and the children begin to get involved with secretive matters such as the rumored Tainted Cats said to abduct children. Shinsekai yori tells the unique coming-of-age story of Saki and her friends as they journey to grow into their roles in the supposed utopia. Accepting these roles, however, might not come easy when faced with the dark and shocking truths of society, and the impending havoc born from the new world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
