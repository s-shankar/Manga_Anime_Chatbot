    Oh dear Shingeki no Kyojin, where do I even begin. If you've talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What's the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it's on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that's simply because it's stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that's perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin is\
          \
        one of if not the greatest anime to be made. It's not popular for no reason.\
The story is one of the most captivating stories I've ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can't break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother's head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he'd one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he's also something else that could be the key to humanity's survival, but could also be humanity's destruction. \
My 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there's lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \
Characters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki's strongpoint. There's a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There's trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There's comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can't seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he's cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he's still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \
The art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people's eyes as well. A new form of action that's never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They're the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \
Of course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What's so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven't already watched this anime and you're reading this review, then you've clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn't your style of anime. \

    I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don't see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, the\
          \
        difference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don't understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\
In this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren't the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won't do spoilers, it's repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn't they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\
The fact that many people aren't well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn't a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn't to live, but survive!\
And in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \
Then, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that's original and profound ........\
(Hope my english was not so bad) :)\

              Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew to\
          \
        heights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\
          Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\
          This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\
          Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don't enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot's progression and the show's stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you've made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\
          Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\
          On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I'll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we'll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\
          Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he's safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\
          Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show's main character, it's actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can't go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\
         The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity's military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\
         The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa's warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook's best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland's exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren's character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\
         The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I'm being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it's because I've actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I'm one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\
         Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years’ time (which actually isn't that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\
          Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.\

    In the 80's, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan.\
In the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan.\
In the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre.\
And now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again.\
Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I'm not\
          \
        going into details on the plot.\
Before I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\
I have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\
Attack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \
First of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan's soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don't misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don't believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\
The OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \
It is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I'm still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it's part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \
Another key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you've come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It's definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I'm amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \
You won't be skipping that opening.\
In addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you're probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\
That's how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\
Now, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga's author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \
Oh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \
Finally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won't amount to its potential if it doesn't have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn't have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\
This is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It's The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \
In conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \
What kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\
In the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\
Exquisite beyond words.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?\
In summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through.\
Shingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Who\
          \
        are the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren's dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\
Then episode 3 and 4 jump in. It's a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it's dead slow in comparison. But that's ok- it's episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we've all been waiting for!\
Well, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you're baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\
Actually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you're standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\
I like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I'm trying to say (and trust me, it's not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\
Imagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It's a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I'm really not saying you're not allowed to enjoy it because it's shallow and noisy, I'm just saying you shouldn't walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\
STORY- 4 : The story's foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\
ART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\
SOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\
CHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren's constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin's arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa's constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it's just all poorly done.\
ENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let's not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\
OVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don't walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.\

    I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.\
What I've noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review.\
Story: 9\
At its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore we\
          \
        must defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \
Each and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won't be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you'll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\
Like most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it's very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\
Art: 9\
If you have read the SNK manga, you'll know that the art, while it is good, isn't amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren's eye colour, Levi's physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\
And the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\
Sound: 10\
The score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don't recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don't have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\
The openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that's something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you'll be amazed at how great they are.\
And the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I've seen, I've noticed that the voices don't match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don't talk about the dub....)\
Character: 9\
This is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he's just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren's character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \
The personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\
Each character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren't. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\
Enjoyment: 10\
I'm not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I'm not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\
Every single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\
Overall: 9\
There is a reason why this show doesn't score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\
Shingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they're not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\
Like it or hate it, you really can't deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.\

    Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. \
Story: \
Attack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It's powerful. It's grabbing. It does everything\
          \
        an introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story's credibility at times. \
Art:\
Art is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone's own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \
Sound:\
Finally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series's soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \
Characters: \
The main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character's obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don't like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa's obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \
Enjoyment:\
Now we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you're looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you're looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \
With a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best. \

    Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.\
The show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspect\
          \
        of the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\
I'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\
But that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\
Despite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\
Nevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!\

    This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.\
There’s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lots\
          \
        of tears. My friends weren’t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I’ve experienced just from this show alone.\
It teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to “FIGHT!” Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you’re done with it.\
It’s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you’re still living in that universe, even after you’ve told yourself that you’re done with it.\
The concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain – the Titan – is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\
Unlike other villains, it doesn’t want revenge. It doesn’t want world domination. It doesn’t want power. It doesn’t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn’t eat animals. It wants only one thing – and this is just a theory, but it’s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most – to annihilate the existence of humanity.\
Second, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn’t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it’s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human’s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\
The world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\
The humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\
o matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their ‘chaos’.\
Every single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It’s a dark fact I’d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else’s eyes. That’s what’s sad about this whole thing – even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it’s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\
So you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\
The differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don’t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\
And I think that’s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That’s something I don’t usually see in anime.\
You also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\
This made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a ‘high tech’ fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It’s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\
The music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because “wHaT just happened omg” and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists very\
          \
        rarely ever win a battle. Every mission the cast engage in usually ends in a blood bath, but it's not without purpose. The gruesome deaths we witness just cements how high the stakes are in this story, and the determination of the protagonists to push forward is very inspiring.\
Another unique thing about the cast is they are rather three-dimensional in comparison to a lot of anime and manga I've seen. Where I expect some characters to be completely flat jerkasses or emotionless bastards, there's always something that really makes you like them. The series also makes a point of establishing that no matter what you see on the outside, the characters certainly feel and act human deep down. This makes it really heart breaking when you see characters you like die in the line of duty, and only makes you want to see the good guys succeed all the more, which serves to make their victories so much sweeter.\
tl;dr, This series is a must-read/watch. If you have a weak stomach or a phobia for cannibalistic slasher smiles, give it a miss. Otherwise, give it your full attention.\

    It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is.\
But I can't. While I would genuinely recommend this show, I am still a critic. I still have to acknowledge that this show has problems.\
As good as this show is, and it is very, very good, I cannot with a good conscience say that it does not have glaring flaws. The biggest is\

        the simple fact that this show has too much talk. I know that dialogue is crucial to telling a story and developing character, but there is a time and a place for it. There were several occasions where they have a really good story coming up in what should be the very next episode, but the show digs its heels into the ground and spends an entire episode talking about what was coming. It just seems like whenever this show can build up momentum, it feels the need to deploy the drag chute. This show is not nearly fast-paced enough. But this problem also appears within the action. There are so many five minute long conversations, or inner monologues, or flashback sessions smack in the middle of an action scene. The pacing of this show seriously needs work.\
Thankfully, the good aspects of this show trump the bad ones hundredfold. The action is incredible, the art is distinctive, and the voice acting is some of the best that I have ever seen. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it is by all means worth watching.\

    The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? \
The concept of humanity being at the brink of extinction, this is one emphasizes it's fight for survival and the ups and downs of their fight for victory. With the first episode starting off with a great clincher to get you\
          \
        excited for the rest of series, you get a little view of how each character is and their view point towards the situation. \
Due to the story of humans being driven to extinction, you often get an anime that can be a hit or a miss depending on how they unravel it throughout the series. Humans are declining with titans appearing onto earth and they eventually make a wall tall enough to the point where even the tallest titan can't break through. \
With the show being a fight for survival, it does an excellent job actually dragging out the battle to its actual length. With anime these days battle scenes are usually only an episode with the exception of it being mostly dialog. Attack on Titan has arcs of each fight against the titans or progress in the story. You're given arcs that focus on a battle to take back a city, an expedition outside the walls, and even a battle taking place inside their safest town. \
Throughout the anime you get stories of some characters past and they're definitely something that makes each character enjoyable and much more interesting to watch as the series progresses forward. The characters are mainly focuses on Eren, Mikasa and Armin. They're what drives the story and is the foundation for all the events that happen.\
You have the main character Eren, a boy who does before he thinks. This often gets him into a lot of fights and is what drives his friends to do more than they expect they can do. With his mother being eaten in front of him, you get a lot of realism towards his feelings to the situation and an actual reason for his hate rather than the generic hero title.\
Second you have Mikasa, a girl who is brave and does anything to protect Eren. They're not related, but they're brother and step-sister, but act just like siblings. They bicker and often get into fights due to different feelings  and agreements. She's usually level-headed and very mature, but you'll see when something happens to Eren, she breaks down and becomes very agitated. \
Lastly you have Armin, hes the brains of the group and emotional support for both of them. While lacking in physical strength he excels in strategy and decision making. While not being the main focus of the anime, he's probably the character with the most development. At the start hes weak and afraid, but towards the end he becomes mentally strong and definitely a changed person due to the events that occur to him and his friends.\
With anime being military themed, you're given characters who are joined in with them due to squads and become their friends. You have characters who disagree with a lot of what they do, and some that are just like them and get along well. The side characters are also important for what happens and really drive the story with their back stories and talent that they bring to the group.\
Known for having excellent art, I have nothing to say that can disagree with that. The art through the entire anime stays at top quality and even has detail in every aspect of the show. With all the scenery being changed constantly through the battles, you see buildings that were once standing being ruined and detail in everything. You can see the emotion on all of the characters faces as they witness their comrades being eaten alive. \
The scenery seems to be staged in what seems like Europe, you see a lot of forests and old-style buildings. With all the scene changes you can see detail in everything such as trees, buildings and even the clothes that the characters wear. It makes it feel like the Middle Ages or so, with the wool and texture the clothes has.\
Thanks to the theme of extiction, you get 2 wonderful openings to hype you for the anime. With the first half being set around emphasizing their survival, you get an opening that has lots of action and despair to give the feeling of struggle the characters are going through. The second half is more towards the counter attack that mankind has and their subtle victories and their path towards winning against the titans. The opening gives that feeling of excitement and shows their steps to becoming closer to surviving and prospering once again. With battles happening constantly and emotion going across the board with characters dying, or even victory, you get excellent background music to support those feelings even more. \
Overall this anime is something that lives up to its hype and does a good job having a really serious tone, but also giving off some comedy to balance it out. The story is something that has been done often, but this is one that emphasizes humanities survival. The art is top quality and is the best of the 2013 season to make every battle scene beautiful and movements very clean. The characters were all really well developed and really makes the viewer sad when they die, even though they've only just been introduced a few episodes ago. Anyone who enjoys an action or looking for a great anime to pass time, this is definitely worth checking out.\

    Attack on Titan is one of the manga turned to anime on recent period. It is an Action anime with focus on tragedy and very dark tone, yet maintaining some Shonen-esque messages such as trust and overcoming fears.\
Story:\
While the story isn't as rich as other shows in general, it is rather a very fresh take on human tragedy without reusing much of the usual apocalypse elements. There is also much lore in the world to keep creative fans making fanworks and adaptions of the world of Attack on Titan. The thrill element is very high and makes you eager to see what's next.\
Keep in mind\
          \
        this anime covers only a portion of the manga and stops at the end of an arc. You will have to wait for the 2nd season or continue on in the manga.\
Art:\
The visuals are extremely unique in style and well done. The value here nearly matches an OVA/Movie feels.\
Sound:\
People are digging the opening song of the show as well as some soundtracks. However for me it is good but other than the opening, I didn't feel much uniqueness to the soundtracks or specific themes to get attached with. Voice acting is good enough but there is no memorable voice so far.\
Characters:\
There are lots of variety of characters and they have high appealing. However, in term of design and visual uniqueness, it is very limited since everyone is sticking to his uniform. \
Enjoyment:\
The action scenes are well done specially nearing the ending of the show.\
Overall:\
If you are into action, thrill, tragedy and want something that feels new, do not miss this anime. \

    So what on earth? What have I done?\
How am I not able to feel the stun?...\
I will write about \"Attack on Titan\" here;\
but yeah, I'm no fanboy trying to endear\
myself to mainstream now or in the longer run.\
I turned towards this show unbiased\
considering its popularity at highest.\
I wanted to see if this action show at least\
conveys more meanings than being a bloody feast.\
But in the end: people and story at its driest.\
So hundreds of years ago, the humankind\
is letting itself be completely confined\
by dim-witted looking titans there\
inside a 50-meter wall ensnare\
and is now searching for ways to get behind.\
Then suddenly, a 60-meter giant attacks\
and many\
          \
        more titans are making their tracks.\
The wall can't hold it anymore\
and so the humans are fighting another war.\
Their enemies won't give them more time to relax!\
The first few episodes are quite intense,\
experiencing human's crumbling defence,\
getting their normal lives torn up again,\
having to survive in a diminishing den,\
and nearly losing their last kind of sense.\
We follow Eren, who has to sustain\
his mother's loss, indeed a great pain.\
He wants to kick some titan's ass\
and finally falls into the shounen mass,\
always acting like tightened by an angry chain.\
Accompanied by one of the few\
more normal humans, Mikasa, whose true\
intention is to save her Eren\
and so she's getting ears more barren\
despite her strength she would rather sue.\
The third in league, weak fair-haired Armin, stays\
the cowardly one with a frightened face.\
He tends to think far more than others\
but is mostly hindering his brothers.\
He needs lots of time to realise his place.\
So maybe you would think that some other\
guys inside these walls don't try to bother,\
but instead act more heroic inside this hell.\
You see, Commander Levi's the only one memorable;\
he wouldn't even trade his tenacity for his mother.\
All in all, these characters just won't try\
to develop properly and we ask why?\
Why haven't they used episodes five to twelve\
to let them build some features or delve\
into their motivations or what they go by?\
Seriously, you won't remember any other names.\
They die like flies and only the main remains.\
So I really wondered the whole time where\
the more seasoned soldiers would deign to dare\
to get into the fight, but you know what it claims...\
And then, the probably most important thing:\
What are the titans? Ruled by a king?\
What are their bloody true intentions?\
Hinder humanity from some kind of interventions?\
We aren't informed, and that's a serious sting.\
However, the style and art does kind of save all it\
from falling into a much more deeper pit.\
Detailed architecture and nice quality,\
although the animations strive for equality,\
but the art got me astounded, I must admit!\
What you will hear is mostly amazing.\
The music improves the already fast pacing\
but cannot reach my most favourite sides\
like Code Geass with \"Stories\" provides.\
So it's epic, and rather the common saving.\
Special mention for an awesome opening theme\
mixing German and Japanese for deserved esteem.\
It conveys this rather intimidating mood,\
lets us taste of the upcoming action food.\
Believing the whole show's that epic: it stays a dream.\
Now summarizing art and sound: they're nice;\
but paying with a decent story at least twice.\
Man, there are so many episodes for fill,\
the pacing is off, the direction needs skill,\
inferring that eight episodes clearly would suffice.\
Some people will ask how I can say\
this show is average and carried away...\
It has nothing like a memorable plot\
and tends to dramatize quite a lot,\
just not worth for every fan to stay!\
I can't deny the certain amount of joy\
the first few episodes deliver, oh boy!\
But after that, it's nothing new...\
No inspirations I aim to pursue...\
Its part to perplex hardly evens the one to annoy.\
So this practically concludes my review.\
\"Do not believe the hype\" became so true!\
If you like some standard action shows,\
then Attack on Titan doesn't have much to oppose,\
but otherwise it isn't worth any ballyhoo.\

    If you’re an anime or manga patron, you’ve more than likely heard of, if you haven’t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It’s popularity is getting to the point where it’s damn near impossible to say the word “anime” without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? \
Plot: One-hundred\
          \
        years prior to the start of the series, mankind was plagued by their predators, The Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures whose only purpose in existence is to devour humans, despite having no apparent need to eat in order to survive. Humanity was driven to the brink of extinction. The few surviving humans built a society behind 50-meter walls that kept the Titans out. The walls were named Maria, the outermost wall, Rose, the middle, and Sina, the interior. There, humanity enjoyed a century of peace... Until... Our main characters, teenage boy Eren Yeager and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness something horrific... The city's \"divine\" walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother along with thousands of other humans are eaten alive. Eren vows to murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. And so, mankind finds their secret weapon in defeating the Titans... \
First thing you may be wondering, is this anime as epic as everyone says it is, and is it filled with amazing action scenes? Well eh, I guess you could say that it's a tiny bit, not too much, but just a teeny bit ... IT'S DEFINITELY EPIC. This anime's introduction of the 3D maneuver gear was certainly an creative pleasant to the say the least, surprise. The way the characters jump/literally fly from rooftop to rooftop, swinging their dual swords at Titans, screaming their lungs at every second leaves the viewers mouths opened, and their eyes glued onto the screen. May I add that the soundtrack in this anime is arguably the best set of music in an anime ever. It's epic music certainly adds to the suspense of every single episode in Shingeki no Kyojin. The only thing I'd say took away from the EPICness in Shingeki, was that there was awfully too many dialogue scenes... Although some were pretty nerve-wrecking, others seemed to be useless and pointless.\
Secondly... is this plot depressing? Yup. Are there multiple scenes that have brought me to tears? Yup. Have I witnessed characters I love meet their end in horribly gruesome ways? Yup. This is not an anime for the faint-hearted. Shingeki no Kyojin will ruthlessly rip your heart out, throw it into a grinder, then turn it into processed dog food time after time after time ... after time again. This anime is also quite gory, so if you can't stand that, I'd... still recommend you to give Shingeki no Kyojin a try. \
As for me, what I had wondered the most were, is this plot deep (theme)? efficiently written? And enjoyable to watch? Is there an explanation for everything that happens or is it one of those anime that something happens for no reason or leaves me going What happened to the _____ or how did he/she even know _____.\
The storyline itself has no contradictions, is full to the brim with plot twists that are almost impossible to predict. And most importantly, it is VERY enjoyable to watch.\
(Skip if you don't care about historical information + deep themes) Well I will say that the plot has a deep theme. The circle of life and escaping every-day routine and achieving freedom (humans trapped within walls, never seeing the ocean, mountains, volcanoes, forests, plains, and never having an adventure until...) concept is included in the plot. What was also quite intriguing that you probably didn't know was in Shingeki no Kyojin was the use of Norse Allusions. Narrative tales for centuries have, for centuries, been borrowing and re-constructing myths from previous generations in order to create new tales to amuse and inspire. Mythology has been incorporated into many stories to provide emphasis on major themes and create a more complex universe for the reader to experience. “Shingeki no Kyojin” written by Hajime Isayama draws extensive inspiration Nordic myth such as Snorri’s “Gylfaginning” and “Prose Edda,” creating integral elements and parallels within the story by incorporating fundamental Norse ideologies into the fictional universe’s framework. It is these elements of inter-textuality that create a context in which hermetic moments can be experienced, while expressing creativity through the literary tradition of interpretation through connotation. As for the circle of life, humans for once are on the side of the preys. Why is it wrong for titans to eat us, while it's okay for us to (raise and) kill animals in order to eat them? In this world, the strong are the predators, and the weak are the preys. The strong steal all and win all, the weak get stolen from and lose all. That's just how this rotten world (in reality) works. The anime delves into the \"strength\" of humans vs the titans. Escaping everyday routine has been a theme in many famous stories, such as \"The Dubliners\" (read it, very famous). How can a person live when doing the same thing over... and over... and over everyday. How would you feel if you were confined within a small amount of space and never allowed to go outside of that tiny space because you would get eaten mercilessly by a predator out there?\
The art and sound in the anime is absolutely spectacular. The soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin, composed by Hiruko Sawano is (insert the greatest positive word you can think of). The openings were absolutely incredible as well, and I'm sure that everyone, whether or not you've seen the anime has heard of and fairly enjoyed/absolutely loved the opening, \"Guren Yumiya\". I believe it's the most famous anime song ever. The art is fairly nicely drawn up, and the drawn up 3D maneuver gear certainly was well made. I must say in terms of visuals, the titans were drawn up to perfection! Their faces are disgustingly disfigured and what is up their skin/teeth! They look creepy as fuck, which is great! As for the characters, each person was fairly well drawn up... Although I wouldn't say great! and the horses/skies/plains (nature) was absolutely beautiful and realistically drawn. I must mention that the freedom of wing capes were quite desirable, very cool capes/art.\
Eren is anything but a traditional protagonist. While a typical hero is driven by a great sense of morality, honor, pride, or a desire to make the world a better place for everyone’s sake and not just their own, Eren takes every stereotype and crushes it. Having lost his mother to Titian, monsters that he already despised to begin with, Eren’s motivation to join the military and eradicate the Titans are based purely on his bloodthirsty need for revenge, not his desire to improve the world. While it is true that he has expressed that he wants to see the world outside the walls, he didn’t really show initiative (his crazy hatred) until his mother died (although he did plan on joining the recon corps).Perhaps my favorite trait of Eren is that, even though he’s the main protagonist, he is pretty weak as a fighter. That is a quality that makes Eren very real. He’s not an overpowered main character; he’s human. He has powers, but his powers are pretty much the only reason he’s still alive. He’s not some kind of god, and he’s far from invincible. He’s, at the core, just a very angry boy that has lost his mother and wants to avenge her, and he does so with an unbreakable spirit. \
As for Mikasa Ackerman, she is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a near constant stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. Mikasa's attachment to Eren may or not not go beyond feelings of siblings (well, she is adopted). Mikasa is one of those characters that people will love because first off she's beautiful, secondly she's funny and somewhat kind and mean at the same time, and to top it off, and last not but least she's the concrete definition of badass (kicks some Titan ass).\
Last but not least our 3rd main character Armin Arlert, a cowardly smart boy who possesses a sharp mind and a natural intuition for strategy which has proven useful on many occasions. Armin Arlert is a character that some will hate for his cowardice and \"no fightingness\" but others will like because he actually uses his brain, and you have to feel bad for him for being so very human (fear). \
Why did I present dragging info on the characters? Because, their charactistics all add so much to the anime. All the other characters in Shingeki no Kyojin are quite likeable, it's just a shame that a lot of them will die out one by one before your eyes. And of course, I will have to mention Levi because he's obviously the most popular character in Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Well because first of all, he's smart, secondly he's always composed, thirdly he kicks everyones ass, both humans and titans, fourthly he wants to protect people and is in a way a \"jesus\" figure to mankind, and lastly and most importantly, his fetish for always cleaning makes him a hilarious character.  \
Even though the whole concept of naked giants devouring humans sounds a little weird at first, the main idea behind it (that is, humans not being on top of the food chain anymore) is pretty well done and the plot grows into an epic adventure that you would regret not watching. Overall the anime is very enjoyable and although some people may call it overrated (it can't be everyone's favorite anime...) I will tell you that you'd regret not watching it for sure. Epic is written all over the anime.\
Conclusion: I guess it's a bit overrated considering it could become the most popular anime of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as a lot of haters claim it is. I guess the hate can't be helped though since with popularity and greatness comes hate. But, people can have different perspectives on things, that's what makes humans so great right? That concludes my review, thanks for reading!~\

    This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind.  Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had.  Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember.  I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.\
Sometimes animes will fall into the trap of taking themselves too seriously.  The main difference about AOT is that it deserves the afforementioned comment. \
          \
        Humanity is on the brink of extinction, being overrun by several meter tall human-like \"titans\" that terrorize and eat humans for just the pleasure of it.  Humankind has succumbed to building three giant walls to protect themselves against the giants, and all was safe and sound....until the first wall was breached by an abnormally gigantic Titan, allowing the smaller ones to get in and annihilate the city.  Eventually the invasion stopped, but the damage had already been done... The number of casualties was astronomical.  The story continues by following Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military in hopes of avenging the titan's invasion and The death of Eren's mother.  Throughout the series, their efforts are pivotal in regaining a stronghold in the apocalyptic world.\
One thing I love and hate about this series is the character development.  It's just so damn good.  At the same token, it occasionally feels so gut punching when a new character's past is explained, and then they are soon after another casualty in the struggle to survive.  The amount of emotions that are invoked while one watches AOT are tremendous.  I often found myself speaking out loud during a characters close brush with death or laughing during one of Sasha's hungry outbursts.  The story in itself is also unique.  I had been hearing wayyyy too many of the same plots floating around recently, so it was a breath of fresh air to experience AOT firsthand... At the recommendation of so many friends.  \
The art style depicted in this series is also quite incredible.  Influences by Claymore and Casshern Sins are apparent, drawing from past experience of AOTs writer, Yasuko Kobayashi.  I love how dark and gritty the character models can be, and how vivid the backgrounds are drawn.  The music is also epic and fanfareish.  The 2 openings also represent the growth of the story and are both extremely catchy.\
In a nutshell, AOT is an anime not to be missed by any fan, especially if you love action and greatly developed characters.  I can't wait until the second season rolls our way soon.\

    What would happen if humanity was no longer on the top of the food chain?  How would we adapt, and how would our perception of the world change?  Tetsurō Araki came to answer these questions with the release of his latest series.  It is a tale of tragedy and revenge; of uplifting hope and crushing sadness.  A love letter to the struggle of humanity and its destructive nature.  This is Attack On Titan.\
Setting:\
The exact location and time place of AOT is unknown, but based off of the clothing, architectural style and character names it is safe to say that the\
          \
        series is located around Germany and takes place during the 17th century.  Humanity has locked itself away behind three impossibly tall walls named Maria, Rose and Sina.  After the outer most wall, Maria is assaulted and damaged titans flood in, starting our tale of woe.\
Story:\
The story of AOT is quite simple, but not in a bad way.  Yasuko Kobayashi (the anime writer) didn't over complicate the plot with half baked symbolism or conspiracy pandering.  AOT knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn't waste any time getting there.  Don't get me wrong I'm not saying the series is dull, far from it actually; I just find it refreshing to watch a show that doesn't spend the first half trying to convince about me how cool and artsy it is.  I knew exactly what I was getting, and AOT never changed that.  In addition to the narrative, the actual setting is wonderfully crafted.  While removed from reality AOT never strays to far from the believable.  Everything fits from a historical point of view; the powerful religious presence, the centralized political structure, the proper use of period weaponry.  The only problem with the story its pacing.  While fine for most the show it does tend to drag between episodes 10-15.  The show presents our characters with a simple task that takes them far too long to complete.          \
On a side note I found a lot of similarities between AOT and the average mecha story line.  While AOT is leaps and bounds over most generic mechas I couldn't help, but make some connections.  Angry new-comer discovers hidden robot (titan power), uses robot to avenge loved one, fights others with similar robots, gets butt whooped, gets stronger, defeats opponent, rinse and repeat.  I just thought it was an interesting notion.\
Art:\
I'll start off this section by saying that, for the most part, AOT was animated by a brand new studio with no other anime under its belt.  Studio Wit is a surrogate of the well know studio Production I.G.; so its member clearly have experience, but until AOT they had never worked directly on a project as a singular group.  So with this in mind it is literally astonishing how much quality this show has.  Seriously, if Attack On Titan were a fruit it would be dripping with the succulent juices of grandeur.  Most shows allocate their budgets to the most \"important\" parts of each episode, i.e. the action scenes.  In turn this causes most of the scenes involving dialogue and plot development to come off as unimportant and lack luster; when in reality these scene are just as, if not more, important than the ones involving action.  However, the animation for AOT never falters; each scene is given the same amount of care as the others.  In addition, this show has an air of excitement about it.  I could tell AOT was more than just another job to Studio Wit; they truly care about this series.\
Not only is the animation beautiful, the art style itself is brilliant.  The varying thicknesses of black borders around each character and object helps to add an increased field of depth during scenes of rapid movement.  This creates a sense of urgency whenever the characters use their 3DM/ODM gear, only maximizing the excitement the show puts off.  The art of AOT is perfect, literally.\
Sound:\
The OST for Attack On Titan should be used as model to teach young composers about the necessary elements that make up a great soundtrack.  While not perfect, the OST hits every note it needs to, and then continues on to become even better than required.  Even though all the tracks are great in their own right; a few of them managed to reach the \"anime peak of greatness status\". Those would include the two openings of the series.  Which are easily up there with \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Baccano!\" (btw second opening is best....let the fighting ensue).  Sound design on the other hand sits right at the average mark.  Most of the sounds are over used, and were never that great to start.  So, after a while it can leave a bad taste in your mouth.  It works for what it is, but isn't anything to write home about.\
As the astute reader you are, I'm sure you have figured out that I will always watch the English dub if available.  So how is the Attack On Titan dub?  The best way to describe it would be unique.  I say that, because some of the voice actors Funimation picked require a certain taste.  For example, Bryce Papenbrook choose voice Eren in a very forceful manner.  It reminds me how most people sound when they smash their toe; jaw clinched with a slight growl in their voice.  Personally, I rather enjoyed the English dub, but I understand that I am in the minority of this one.  I would recommend to watch the first four episodes in dub, and decide where to go from there.\
Characters:\
In the character department I would compare AOT to the critically acclaimed video game \"The Last Of Us\".  I understand that not everyone is a gamer as I am, but just bare with me here.  The characters in both of these are as unoriginal as they come.  However, they weave such a unique story and have such interesting development, that in turn, they become fresh and a great enjoyment to watch.  Some of the development is a bit rushed at times, but it always comes from a natural progression and doesn't feel forced in the slightest.  As any anime junkie would know, that is an accomplishment on its own; especially in this sea of generic rom-coms and forced love triangles.  My main complaint is the lack of development for side characters.  Some get their deserved screen time, but others only receive some kind of goofy quirk as to be memorable without actually accomplishing anything.  We have potato girl (Sasha), bald dude (Connie) and freckles kid (Marco).  I want to know their stories and what kind of people they are beyond their stereotypical traits.\
Personal Enjoyment/Overall:\
All flaws aside, Attack On Titan is one of the most entertaining shows I ever had the pleasure of watching; I can't wait of season 2 to be released.  The action is exciting, the story is tense and the animation is beautiful.  I give it a rating of Must Watch on my scale of recommendation.\

As usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole.  However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\
As a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.       ",

    I don't think this review will make me very popular, because I didn't really like Attack on Titan. The first time I tried watching it, I found the first episode so boring and discomforting that I stopped right there. However, as the hype increased and people were hailing it as the best anime of the season, I thought I should give it another shot. The next time I tried watching it, I got to about episode 10 and gave up again. It was too much of a struggle for me. Though after 10 episodes I had started to see the value of the show. \
Story:\
          \
        6\
I'm sorry, I really am, but there are fundamental structure and pacing issues with AoT. The basic premise is fascinating—a post-apocalyptic world that was ravaged by an almost biblical plague. All of humanity trapped behind walls that are failing to protect them from the monsters outside—but it's execution is lacking. The world, which appears to be richly structured, is never actually elaborated upon: how did they build the walls? What type of social hierarchy exists as a result of the wall? It spends about three episodes on a single battle and then rushes through the training: we go through 5 years in a matter of 3 episodes and then spend another three episodes on what is about a 4 hour period. \
There are also some bizarre story telling choices: [SPOILERS] the protagonist is dead for two whole episodes and in that time they decide it's the best moment to do a flashback to a different character's childhood, while we're still in the middle of a battle sequence. I don't care about her childhood and relationship with the main character: all of the characters are currently in mortal danger and the main character is dead. This is simply not the time. [END SPOILER] There are also general pacing issues: it feels slow, yet we aren't given time to get to know the characters so when the inevitably die, it's hard to really care. \
The episodes also have a flat out depressing emotional arc. They start with a smidgen of hope that is just continually stomped down until the end of the episode. I'm sorry, but I like my characters to have a win at least SOME of the time. \
There is also something lacking in the Titans as enemies. They aren't smart, quick, or focused. Watching battle sequences with them is like watching a bunch of flies swarm around someones head. It's just not very interesting. \
Art: 10\
The art is outstanding. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's gorgeous. The backgrounds are rich, the motion is fluid, and the characters just look good. There is CG, but it's well integrated, and the colors are appealing and appropriate. The only caveat I might have is that it's sometimes a little hard to tell characters apart (but when there as many of them as there in AoT, it's inevitably difficult). \
Sound: 9\
The soundtrack is appropriate and distinctive, the voice acting is strong, and the sound effects don't sound unnatural. I only knocked a point off because the opening theme is sometimes a bit much (I was skipping it by episode 3).\
Character: 7\
Eren is just not a very engaging protagonist. He's a jerk from the moment we meet him, and it feels like he's a jerk for no good reason. He then \"redeems\" himself by deciding to commit his life to a suicidal pursuit of revenge. I found it's tough to appreciate his character, though I did enjoy his inspirational qualities and his defiance of the hopeless state of humanity. \
The side character come off as rather flat. They almost all fit into stereotypes that have predictable story lines. I do enjoy Jean, though, and I would be curious to see if he becomes the essential ally to Eren that I suspect him to be. \
Enjoyment: 6\
It was fun on occasion, but overall it was not very enjoyable or challenging. \
Overall: 7\
This is definitely a good series—and for those who enjoy dark, battle driven series, particularly fantasy, I highly suggest it (though I warn that I loved Code Geass, another dark, battle driven series, but disliked this). I hesitate, however to call it great. \

    Shinjeki no Kyojin has an intriguing premise.\
In an alternative universe, mankind has been nearly driven to the brink of extinction by giants known as Titans. Those who survived among men built three huge walls to protect themselves from the Titans who want to eat them for some reason.\
So far so good. The components of the anime, however, fails to live up to its premise.\
I will try my best to state my thoughts in an organized and brief way:\
STORY (4/10)\
- The idea of those mysterious creatures is interesting, I guess the writer was inspired by the titan gods in Greek mythology. Not so bad.\
-The first 5\
          \
        episodes started out great. The mysteries hype you up. How were they able to build those walls? What are the titans and why do they devour people if they don't really need to? Where did Eren's father go, and what did he do to Eren? Why do the characters communicate through shouting? Why is Armin such a whiny little girl? Though by the end of the series you still wont get any answers.\
- By episode 6 and onwards, multiple episodes feature the same recap over 5 or 6 times. Another episode was entirely spent on flashbacks that could've been told in less than 5 minutes. A special episode was dedicated to remind you of events that's already been told several times.\
-The story is plot-driven, every event was a reaction to a previous occurrence. In other words, the characters did nothing to produce a situation, neither chose to plan to do anything. They were just responding to the happenings.\
- If you are into cliched motivational speeches, and cheesy dialogues, there's plenty of that.\
-There were only two plot twists and they were so predictable It almost felt like the writer was underestimating the intelligence of his audience. There were no mental challenges only facepalms.\
CHARACTERS (2/10)\
The major flaw. All are empty characters, I couldn't have cared less for any of them. At one point I was rooting for the titans to eat them all. Not only were they stupid, they were also plain and boring stereotypes (using templates is okay as long as you add something that makes them inspiring or distinctly remarkable). Here the portrayals of the characters fell short of the mark.\
We have:\
- The protagonist who keeps yelling and whining all the time, his only qualities are weak intuition, immaturity and anger-management issues.\
- The female lead. She is an inborn professional at smacking down titans that skilled soldiers die fighting. The strong silent type who doesn't seem to have a personality or any interest apart from the male protagonist.\
- Crybaby blondie who did not know he had a brain until it was pointed out for him.\
- A cool neat-freak belligerent asshole with superiority complex.\
- Jean, the only character who was somewhat believable, honest and reflective. Ironically, he had very limited screen time.\
- The rest of the characters were just fillers, not memorable in any way, and thus were merely there as livestock to be killed. \
They tried to present the idea that anyone can die any second but all they really did was adding characters who weren't likable in the first place in order to kill them off immediately to show how serious the threat is. \
ART (10/10)\
Splendid.. probably the only thing I really liked about the anime.\
SOUND (6/10)\
The melodramatic shouting throughout the anime was draining, it's like 'whyy the fuck are you shouting an ordinary sentence??'\
The background music was okay. The opening and ending themes were great.\
OVERALL (6/10)\
Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's good and just because an anime has a lot of bloodshed and gore doesn't make it mature. I felt that the overuse of gore was a failed attempt to shock the audience.. I personally didn't find it disturbing or dark at all since it lacked psychological factors. In fact, It only succeeded in frustrating me whenever I let my imagination beyond the screen.\
Shingeki no kyojin is only good to watch for the action. That's all there is to it.\

    If there was ever an anime experience that would leave you needing therapy, marathon-watching Shingeki no Kyojin is it. Perhaps this is the best way to watch this series; by the end, you'd be so emotionally exhausted and mangled, you'll know what total despair is like. Not since Berserk have I seen an anime capable of utterly destroying... hope. Yet in spite of its soul-crushing hopelessness, Shingeki no Kyojin is entirely about hope. Without it, mankind would have nothing.\
In this world, giants roam the land. These \"titans\" (as it's been anglicised) prey on human beings. They are brutal, violent and unstoppable. Their arrival is as\
          \
        mysterious as their motives. They do not eat to live. They do not eat anything else. They consume human beings and vomit them out. Humans have become worse than livestock on the food chain. At least sheep or cows are eaten for a reason. There is no discernible purpose for why the titans eat humans. They just do, and living with this fear and confusion behind the giant walls of the last known stronghold is the dwindled population of all of humanity. They've been able to keep the titans out for over a hundred years. Life in a cage, but life nonetheless.\
Shingeki no Kyojin begins with the protagonist Eren Jaeger questioning whether this kind of life is worth it. Freedom does not mean breathing boxed in, awaiting death. That's not life and he vows to use whatever power he has to fight the titans. With him is Mikasa, a girl adopted by his family, and his friend Armin. While Eren is strong-willed and rash, Mikasa is calculated and fierce and Armin is thoughtful and soft-hearted; the trio play off one another's strengths and weaknesses in order to survive. And this anime becomes a war for survival.\
Eren makes for a dependable protagonist. He carries the series well, despite having some \"shounen hero\" tendencies but perhaps his enthusiasm is necessary in a world where people drop their swords and flee in the face of danger or who opt to police within the safe walls of the rich inner cities. However, Mikasa is probably the show's great hero. Powerful, naturally gifted and determined, she carries Eren whenever he falls. As he is her only family, she is terribly protective of him. She lives entirely for him, and this may seem to be the only detriment to her character, but her loyalty to him is understandable when you learn of their past. Armin will be nobody's favourite off the bat. Wimpy, small and unable to fight, he has developed his intellect instead. The other characters are well-crafted and have distinct personalities (though they are just as many \"Who's that again?\" ones as well). Some of the stand-outs are Levi, a very short, extremely experienced and talented captain, Sasha, a girl who seems to gladly choose getting punched in the face by her superiors if it means she can get a potato, Annie, who like Mikasa is very strong and capable, and Jean, a spoiled and cowardly soldier who eventually becomes someone whose growth you can possibly be proud of. It's easy to like them... but maybe it's not entirely wise.\
One of Shingeki no Kyojin's characteristics is that nothing and nobody is safe. It is not afraid of itself. It does not shy away from brutalising its audience or characters because honestly, this is a horrible place and time to be alive. It constantly reminds you of human mortality and fragility. Some people might tell you \"don't get attached to anyone\". Sound advice, but you won't take it. The characters in this series are constructed so well that you will root for them as they pick up their swords and then cry out in disbelieving grief as you see them crushed like a mosquito. Blood and then silence. It's not entirely right to say \"nobody is safe\" as plot-immortality applies to certain characters and that is quite evident. Although the anime is going to make you doubt yourself.\
Gone are the anime physics where someone can go flying into a wall and can get up without a scratch. If someone flies into a wall in this anime, that's it. Game over, man. Game over. This is no anime for children; it is a complete bloodbath. It is not afraid to show you crushed limbs, torn-away faces, stinking, steaming bones, people's necks being snapped like chickens. It doesn't shy away from letting you hear screams of people facing their last moment on earth.\
But it's not the violence alone that will sock you hard ones to the stomach -- it's the story itself. The concepts behind what is presented and also actual events will have you reeling. The second arc of this anime more or less will have you screaming \"NO, IT CAN'T BE\". Because you simply don't want to believe what you're seeing or who it involves. The entire series will have you holding your head wondering what is going on. The characters themselves don't really know, and you share that confusion with them. Shingeki no Kyojin's story is by far one of the most creative and well-crafted in modern anime history. It has the right tone, focus and content. It develops surprisingly at every turn. This is an anime you cannot necessarily lay out a trajectory for in terms of what is going to happen. You take every episode like it is tomorrow -- you ultimately cannot know what can or will happen.\
Visually, it boasts some finely animated fight scenes, especially when the soldiers use their gear to go \"flying\" through the city. This gear is pretty inventive and can be likened to Spider-Man's web-slinging. The soldiers train to be agile and precise using this gear as it catapults them through the air. The best users of this know how to manoeuvre throughout a city block, across a titan's back or across the sky as though it were their first nature. The animation makes sure to keep you on your toes during action scenes, angling shots to keep momentum or knowing just how close to do a close-up for the best effect. The dark lines and general colourlessness of the art style keeps with the tone of the overall series. However, you can see where budgetary shortcuts were had, and while nothing to deter from the series, it is not quite perfect. Music-wise, the sound builds on the horror and the dramatic tension, and while some tracks are certainly recognisable as you watch on, they aren't entirely memorable.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is all about experiencing it. You can have time later to think about what's happening or to theorise, but there is no time for that in the midst of watching. There are only held breaths, churning stomachs, wide eyes and feelings of absolute horror. There are times when humanity seems to be getting somewhere, where you think, okay, there's a chance now. Hope. It exists somewhere, as small as it might be, hidden in the depths of crushing losses and corpses and city rubble. It's there, and that's what Eren and his friends will give their lives to find.\

    It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.\
This is a spoiler free review.\
*Story*\
*Insert synopsis here*\
Aside from the monsters being replaced with Titans and the interesting weaponry the people have, we've definitely seen similar stories in anime before, whether it's Claymore, Blue Gender and maybe even Highschool of the Dead.\
Leaving that aside though, it doesn't do a very good job with its narrative. The story relies on coincidences, has forced exposition, uneventful pacing and it also has unexplored themes that are tossed away as\
          \
        soon as they're raised.\
The setting in general is poorly explored. For example, they make it clear that there's a slave trade going on within these walls, but that issue is never raised again. Apparently they also have religious sects that worship these walls as deities or something, but that's never explored either, aside from killing them off in an ironic and disrespectful manner (hah! that'll teach those religious people for having faith and hope!).  There are even social classes among citizens, and of course, the higher the class, the more evil you are (that's how it works in cliché land), but even that is just there to show us what good people the main characters are by comparison.. They also present corruption within the military and competition amongst its different branches. Granted, the latter is explored a little, but the former is hardly touched and is just there to shock you. So despite how rich the setting seems at first, at the end of the day all you will care for is the fight against the titans since the rest just remains background decoration.\
It's a common thing to say that the first episode is Amazing, but I wasn't impressed. To me, the first episode is also the first mistake it made. It seemed deliberately rushed in an attempt to make the audience gasp at the sudden deaths of characters we know nothing about (pure shock effect). \
This is the first mistake because the pacing does slow down significantly later on and I think the first episode was the only one worthy of getting fleshed out more, instead of diving in to the massacre straight away. The rest of the episodes don't even exploit most of their slow pacing very well. It has a habit of slowing down deliberately in order to end most episodes on a cliffhanger. Sure, it might raise the tension, but it also serves to make the series less eventful inside its already limited number of episodes (which means less of a story).\
And maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but the exposition insults me. It assumes I'm a retard who can't put 2 and 2 together and the characters have to go out of their way to explain things about their world that they should already know just by being born there. This show could've had no dialogue whatsoever and I still could've picked up on a great deal of what's going on. So the script just comes off as amaturish.\
And like I said, the story also relies on occurrences that are not very likely, but because it involves the main characters, anything is possible. It's nothing that bad or distracting, but I'm still gonna go on a limb here and say; that's not good storytelling.\
Lastly, it just ends in the middle of nowhere and leaves you with nothing but another cliffhanger (surprise, surprise).\
To be fair though,  the setting is still pretty creative (as unexplored as it is) and it does do a decent job in foreshadowing some interesting plot twists and gradually revealing mysteries, mainly about the Titans. But that's pretty much it and even that is incomplete for now.\
*Characters*\
These are tired shonen characters who are completely out of place.\
You have a Mary Sue who's super strong for no good reason, the smart one and mr angry pants.\
Granted, Eren, the angry one has good reasons to be angry, it's completely understandable. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he is and it's probably not the best idea to have him as a main character since it gets old really fast.\
You also have Mikasa who's an absolute perfect being for some reason (I gave up on questioning it). We can't make her flawed of course since that'd mean she'll have room for character depth, we can't have that. And there's simply nothing to remember her for besides her relationship with Eren, being perfect and her sexy lips. So yeah, a lame character with no development and the most ludicrous backstory I've seen in a while, which also happens to be Eren's backstory. Which explains why she's his pet.\
Nice..\
The third character is Armin, the weak but smart one. I guess he's ok, since he does seem to grow more than the other two.. Aside from that he's forgettable as well since this show's characterization in general is very shonenish and obnoxious in an otherwise dark setting. \"The power of friendship!\" (ok, they don't actually say that, but they come pretty close).\
By the way, these 3 characters are each supposed to complete each other with their traits, which is a nice idea, but that fact is stated directly to the viewer, much like everything else in this series (so much for subtlety).\
There's also another notable character named Jean, who's kinda like the Vegeta or the rival in a shonen series. And much like Vegeta, he's the only one who goes through actual growth and he even reacts to the events in a way that resembles a human being. Too bad he wasn't the main character, he suits the grim setting much better than the others.\
The secondary characters are defined mainly by their quirks or their looks and there are others who are just evil for the sake of being hated by the audience and aren't shown more than once. Many secondary characters aren't fleshed out and the vast majority of deaths in this series are of nameless characters or ones you don't remember. It's understandable considering the circumstances, but that just makes the main cast appear more plot armored than they already are. \
On the other hand, the characterization of common people during the intense moments is pretty decent. Probably a little over the top at times, but I still think it was handled rather well with how they panic and such.\
Overall the characters could've been worse, I mean at least they have character consistency, they are given some focus and I should probably applaud them for not being overly sexualized, which is a very rare thing in anime these days. But I have no clue what people see in them since most of them are pretty simple and feel ridiculously out of place.\
*Art & Sound*\
I'll cover this part more briefly.\
The character designs are kind of unique, I guess. I actually like the thick outlines the artwork has, you really don't see those much anymore.  The surroundings look beautiful, both the forests and the towns. Everything just seems gigantic. The animation itself (while not always consistent) is great and the battles with the 3d camera movement is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Though I wasn't too thrilled about most of the Titan designs, and some are significantly cooler than others.\
The opening song is arguably one of the best openings in recent years, it's just masterful (too bad opening 2 happened midway). Same goes for the soundtrack in general which is beautifully intense and makes everything seem more epic. The voice acting is nothing special and maybe even over the top, but I realize that the script probably told them to scream a lot, which is not always easy to pull off so give them some slack.\
\
*Enjoyment*\
I enjoyed some of it, but from a point on I mainly just watched it apathetically. I do concede that it's not a boring watch, that's for sure.\
*Overall* 6/10\
I've been mostly negative in this review, but to be fair it was still a fine show, or at least passable in some respects and the production values are great. But I doubt it will stand the test of time",

    How does one review an entity such as Attack on Titan? It has gathered a massive following had has taken the anime community by storm. Anyone who calls themselves an anime fan has undoubtedly heard of the show and even those who aren't anime fans probably have seen some kind of merchandise floating around wore by someone... someone like me who has a Attack on Titan backpack. But just because something is popular doesn't make it good. \
PLOT: So humans are now no longer at the top of the food chain and were nearly wiped out 100 years ago of 1000ish years ago (they never\
          \
        really explained what time period it it) so humanity is forced to lived behind massive walls to protect themselves from the Titans, these massive naked human looking monsters that eat humans. We start of to see a young trio of children going about their daily life and thinking about what all kids think of, what life is like outside the walls. More frolicking about happens and sudden a massive titan appears and breaks down the wall. Dozens of Titans invaded kill people and we get treated to one of the most emotionally gripping scenes I've every seen in a show. \
So now our main protagonist Eren and his buddies Armin and Mikasa enlist in the army and go on their journey to kill all titans. This sounds bland but the story is going at a lightning pace that things change very fast and you can expect a twist and turn all throughout the show that it will keep you on your seats begging for more, or for my case, marathoning 10 episodes in a row. The story breaks the mold of generic revenge story and adds things like conspiracy and thriller aspects that propels the experience. However there are some points in the show were you can so glaringly seen them going all like \"This person is TOTALLY normal wink wink\" and the foreshadowing alarms go off, but that never distracted from the overall presentation of the story. Also there is lots of action and fighting stuff which I'll get too later...\
CHARACTERS: \
Our main hero/protagonist is Eren Yeager, a young solider who enlist because he watched his mother get eaten by a titan and wants revenge. He is hot blooded and won't take no for an answer. There's Mikasa who is Eren's stalker/adopted sister/baddass. Then there is Armin who is there to cry, get in the way and make plans for battle situations. Eren is too me at least in the beginning kind of a bland generic character. I've seen these kind of super angry main leads before and most of them aren't interesting. Eren evolves just enough to keep him from being bland. Mikasa is a character that I think is a bit overrated. Before going into this show I read everywhere how Mikasa is the best character ever created and I just don't see it. OK sure is ridiculously talented in combat. OK she isn't a generic tsundere. What stands out to me is here wanting to protect Eren which makes for a lot of speculation as too what their relationship actually is, but Eren is more or less an ass to Mikasa in those situations even though Eren does care for her just not in the same way she does. I'm am really glad that the writers didn't make these two characters love birds as that shtick has been used over and over and over. Armin is the only main character that seems to have a working brain as he doesn't go on titan murdering rampages. He is also practically useless in combat. He comes up with ridiculously complicated battle strategies that seem too always go as planned or at least achieve the objective even after a major fault happens that ends up killing half the squad. Yes this show has the Tomino \"kill em all\" approach to characters. Everyone in this show you like will probably die, that sounds like a spoiler but its not. I had to start telling myself not to like characters because I feared that they would get eaten five minutes later. Having characters that don't have plot armor makes the show fell more action packed that it already is.... and it is. The interaction between the characters is good and a shout-out to Levi.\
ART/ANIMATION:\
Well... My word who is funding these people the Brooklyn Nets? The budget for this show must be endless as I never recall a time when this show didn't look like pure awesome. The animation for this show is simply outstanding, the actions scenes are breathtaking, and when they used the 3D movement gear my God does it look stunning. The art style is rather unique too with thick black borders around the characters and the Titans (some of them) look very disturbing. The scenery is gorgeous and those action scenes.... just so good.\
SOUND:\
THAT OPENING!!! Yea the first opening for this show is amazing. So is the second one. So is the fight music, and so is the dub and yes I said DUB. DUB! I can already see people moving their mouse to \"Not helpful\" before going onto the next review but the dub for this show was done by Funimation and such is of the up most quality. Bryce Papenbrook is great as Eren because no one can scream like him, Trina Nishimura fits Mikasa almost freakishly well and Josh Grelle does a great job making Armin sound like a wimp because that's exactly what he is. Oh and Matthew Mercer is just silky smooth as Levi. Great job Funimation for getting a good cast.\
ENDING (NO SPOILERS)\
The ending is paramount. This story is incomplete but there is a second season coming sometime soon so that makes this section pointless, if it were too end right now it wound be terrible but it doesn't so yea.\
OVERALL:\
Attack on Titan has been the only show that has made me impatient enough to go out and read ahead in the manga. This first season was extremely well done and the series as a whole has tremendous potential to be something very special indeed. I give this a strong recommendation too anyone that likes a good story driven high action series. Attack on Titan is a great watch.\

    Subject: \"Attack on Titan Review: Is It A Masterpiece or A Colossal Disappointment?\"\
Shingeki No Kyojin, AKA, Attack on Titan, is one of the most popular manga series based on the same name that defeated the two best known manga in the series, \"Naruto\" and \"One Piece\". And to be honest, it was indeed gives me a massive, MASSIVE LOVE to this franchise. From start to finish of the first season, I'm very grateful that I've watch this majestic masterpiece that came from the walls of Production IG (Known for the anime \"Kuroko no Basuke\" series). So here is my review:\
Story:\
(SPOILER ALERT For Episode 1)\
So in\
          \
        this story, there was a man named Eren Jaeger who lives within the walls which is protected against the man-slaughtering, humanoid eating \"Titans\". At first, during that first episode of the story, their lives there within those thick walls were peaceful and a happy community with some concerns regarding to the walls and also, to the Survey Corps, a group of soldiers who risks their lives to defeat the titans. But, when a Colossal Titan suddenly came just outside the Wall Maria Section, their peaceful lives turned into real-life nightmare, when that Colossal Titan kicks the gate and entering a small to giant size titans with very disturbing faces. Killing not only the residence within Wall Maria, but also to the Police and Eren's Mother. And with that grim remainder, Eren seeks revenge and he wanted to join to the Military to defeat \"...those M--------ing Titans...\"\
As I Watch this anime from first to last, the main story is very well-written, and it has a very great plot twist that I didn't want to expect, and a very explainable storyline and characterization. And, by what I mean, \"Very Explainable\", it means, literally, this anime is full of talking and less battle and other climatic sequences that really wants to burst your bubble for just a few minutes of talking. I know some of you out there wants a good explanation regarding to what is going on out there, including myself, but there's more time for that, especially on the battle sequences between those Titans. So I wish they could fix that on the upcoming Season 2...\
Art:\
Concerning of their artwork and animation, I think it looks more fascinating and astonishingly splendid when it comes to Titan's Faces and it's pure gore and speed of every animation. I mean, hell, I Don't Even Know What Am I Doing Right Now, Am I Watching an Anime or Am I Playing GTA: Attack On Titan or Assassin's Creed: Attack On Titan right now? It was indeed face-paced animation and I want that element to stay that way in the next installment of the series.\
Sound:\
First of all, the background musics in AoT is giving me goosebumps when that first encounter of the Colossal Titan came to attack the first wall, and that was a masterpiece. Including the other soundtracks during every episodes, and the Opening Soundtrack is also giving me goosebumps. Every single one of those soundtracks were perfectly fit to this anime and that was awesome and stylish.\
Character:\
For the \"Killing the Character\" sequences, I don't know if any one of you watches \"Game of Thrones\" but this anime has that kind of formula, except that they are trying not to kill any single one of the main characters. Only the ones who were related to the main characters or the minor characters of the story.\
And as for the main characters like Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, these three has a well-balanced abilities. Like for example, Eren is a well determined mind with vengeance flowing out on his veins, Mikasa is a femme brutale character with overprotecting love to Eren, and Armin is the weakest man than the two of them but he has the brains. And as for the other characters in AoT, especially the \"Potato Girl\" Sasha Braus (My Waifuu) which has a comic-relief side because of her demand for food, and Annie Leonhardt, who has a mystery behind her serious and emotionless face, the characters are pretty well-developed.\
Enjoyment/Overall:\
I Can't believe that Shingeki no Kyojin was directed by Tetsuro Araki (known for directing \"Death Note\", \"Highschool of the Dead\" and \"Guilty Crown\" anime adaptations). I really have no idea it was him who directed this masterpiece all along. But, anyways, this anime is really gives me some nightmare fuel and the goosebumps that I've seen here. The gore, the blood, the brutalities, you name it. All of these kinda makes me watching a some kind of Horror Movies that is WAAAAAYY more scarier than any other scary movies out there, except they are way more supernatural, and way more awesome than ghosts or poltergeistic ghouls.\
Anyways, despite this awesome anime sequences, they are also some flaws that they must need to rework with, like the \"More Fight, More Gore, Less Talking\", more plot twist, and much better storyline like this anime too...\
So, My Final Verdict to this Masterpiece is a PERFECT 10/10... It was the Best, Gore Festival I've ever seen in this anime. (Alongside, Parasyte -The Maxim-). The minor flaws are just talking, but, in my opinion, their \"more talking\" has sense to it and to the story itself, I would gave that a 9/10 if those talking sequences are just plain \"useless\". But next time, try to make some room for the Titan Fights and Other Plot Twists, alright? I don't want my excitement goes down like I was having my very first sex then  my boner disengaged when we were just talking about our lives with less sex.\

    Attack on Titan and I have a history, one filled with love and hate, a re-watch, and the manga. Of course, it seems the entire anime/manga community (and some outside of it) have an opinion on this show. It’s widely popular and has been so for quite a while now. So, just how does this show about giant monsters that eat people take us all by storm? Let’s find out. Rather, I’ll do my best to tell you why I love it (now). \
Sometime to note is that I really didn’t like the AOT franchise when I first watched the anime. I wanted to like\
          \
        it, but found the whole thing over hyped and too dramatic. However, after I read the manga and re-watched the show, I know have Survey Corps Cosplay and have become a die-hard fan.\
I am up to date on the manga. Detangling my feelings of the anime and manga won’t be easy, but I’ll do my best.\
This review is spoiler free!\
[spoiler=Characters]Characters in the AOT franchise are 10/10, but, when strictly concerning the anime, they stagger to an 8/10. On the surface, the characters come across fairly stereotypical. Eren, the shounen lead, is obsessed with getting stronger and revenge and possess a (seemingly) random power. Dig a little deeper and Eren reverses some shounen lead tropes. I can’t go into details without spoiling major things for those who aren’t caught up with the manga, but trust me: Eren isn’t a typically shounen lead. \
Back to the anime. \
A usual some of the most important lines and little moments that deepen characters aren’t in the anime. AOT characters’ growth is subtle, and the high-paced anime may even include those finer moments but they’re hard to catch amidst all the titan killing action. But, if you compare a character from his/her first episode to his/her last, you’ll see how the story has really shaped and changed the character.\
Here are some pluses. The characters are also relatively mature (as the show goes along. Warning: some start as VERY immature had have a lot of room to grow). Also, the characters beside the shounen lead get to have relationships (that actually change and grow) with each other. Again, it’s subtle. Bat an eyelash and you might miss it. \
The characters make realistic choices. They react and behave like people who live in a desperate and relatively hopeless society. Some of their choices may surprise the viewer and unveil and new layer to a character. They’re not always the decision the viewers may want or like, but it makes the characters interesting and the story less predictable. Many of the secondary characters have unique and distinct personalities as well (this is largely due to the fact that later in the manga their importance increases significantly). Something to appreciate is the fact characters offer different opinions on the situation without the show spoon-feeding the viewer into thinking one view is better than another. Rather, the viewer must decide for his/herself what he/she believes. The show does not give a “right” or “wrong” answer. \
However, a lot of characters get tossed at the viewer simultaneously—and about half of them die. Without knowing who lives to become an important character later in the series and who becomes titan chow, it can be a little overwhelming. This is partly why the first time I watched the anime I didn’t enjoy it. People just kept dying so I stopped caring about any of them. This problem also makes it hard to notice the quiet growth between characters and their relationships. Now, after reading the manga and watching it again, I love them all (I even like the bad guys, or, at least, I find them complex and interesting). \
Another minus: the characters are overdramatic at times (for me). While I feel the desperation and understand their hopelessness, I still roll my eyes once in a while. Before the story has pulled you and before you believe and feel how sad they are, it can be distracting. I’ve met a couple of people who’ve even found it humorous at times (I never went that far, but it did (and in three scenes still does) annoy me). The show really plays it up too. It will show random scenes of grieving families that didn’t appear before and don’t show up after just to prove how dramatic and dark it can be. The world is dark enough that these moments subtract from the show instead of add to it. [/spoiler]\

[spoiler=Story] When I first watched the anime, I wasn’t invested in the plot (this is largely due to the fact I wasn’t invested in the characters). After I read the manga, I flung myself headlong into the story and now read the chapters as soon as I can get my grubby fingers on them. After re-watching the anime, I can say the author has had a plan for series from the start. I missed hundreds of little clues while watching it the first time. Answers to huge questions are right in front of your face (I honestly feel stupid for missing them). Some twists are impossible to see coming and only after you’ve caught up to the manga can you fully appreciate how well crafted the plot is. \
Some things were still extremely predictable in the anime. I’m hardly ever surprised by big “shocking” moments in anything (anime/manga/books/whatever) and saw a lot of things coming. Others have told me that the anime surprised them, and the show does deliberately play on your expectations of a shounen. There are a few moments where it sets the viewer up to believe he/she knows where the story is going only to whack him/her in the face with a quick turn. That was highly enjoyable. \
One thing to keep is mind is the sheer ridiculous appearance of the enemy. Frankly, the titans are some of the stupidest looking villains in a story to date. While terrifying, it’s humiliating to watch humanity get wrecked by funny looking naked giants (a fact even the characters address). Humanity is often compared to cattle as well, which leads me to think the viewer is supposed to find it frustrating and embarrassing to be defeated by such monsters. \
As for the plot itself, there is nothing particularly unique about it. The world feels well explained and detailed. And, better yet, it’s surprising easy to relate too. If you feel powerless, like nothing you do matters and all you want to do is matter, somehow; if you feel like there are problems you just can’t face but you wish you were brave enough to stand up against—then this story will touch you, heart and soul. \
Stripe the story down to its bones and it’s about people struggling to defeat enemies larger than themselves, to face despair and learn how to keep moving. I’m serious here. The characters’ goal is not survival but for their deaths to have significance. In this sense, AOT goes beyond an anime. It reveals the heart of a desperate people and how to never give up. \
These characters have simple dreams and desires batted against insurmountable enemies and stark fear. Such raw simplicity rests in most human hearts, and I believe a lot of people connect with that and turn this story into something bigger. I certainly didn’t the first time I watched it, but I do now. Now, when I see the Wings of Freedom, I see a symbol of hope and determination. I see people who are willing to sacrifice themselves despite their fear and doubt because it’s the right thing to do. I see someone I can aspire to be because theses characters are afraid and angry and flawed just like me. I see heroes I can believe in.\
A lot of the sentiments I’m referring to occur after the Survey Corps appear. I believe the story improves immensely after its entrance. I find the Survey Corps the real heart and protagonist—if you will—of the series. Don’t misunderstand: the individual characters are fantastic, as is the first half of the show. But the Corps is who and what I connect with. \
 A step away from the sentimental and existential-ness of this review, the plot is put together extremely well. It moves fast without sacrificing character development. And you can tell the author has an endgame. He knows where he wants this story to go and is slowly taking the viewer there, revealing one little fact at a time, usually one that only opens more questions (the manga has answered some and created more, but things are starting to congeal and it’s fantastic!)

[spoiler=Art]Amazing. It’s crisp, bold, and brilliant. The fights are brutal and fast and don’t cut too many corners. You get to see the full battle, not two characters screaming “AAHH!!!!!” and then clashing once in a kendo-like strike. [/spoiler]\

+unique style\

[spoiler=Music]This soundtrack makes bells sound badass. It has a variety of sounds and languages as well (German, English, Japanese). It’s creative, intense, and will make your heart pound. I consider it one of the best anime soundtracks I’ve heard.[/spoiler]\

[spoiler=Angles] They put a lot of thought into their angles. I’ll go into detail about a scene here to show you just how much. I’ll avoid names for spoiler’s sake. Character A must pull off a risky stunt into order to protect the walls and discusses the plan with Character B. Character B asks Character A if Character A can do this. Then Character B asks Character A what [he/she] wants to protect. Behind Character B, you see all that’s left of humanity and just what is at stake. Brilliant and subtle, the angles add an entirely new dimension to the show. [/spoiler]\
Score: 7/10\
[spoiler=IntroOutro] The first intro is fantastic. I love it. The second intro first few notes feel like a Fire Emblem theme, but I still enjoy it. The outros for me are interesting because both incorporate the narrative. The first has a rather obvious connection to a character’s growth, motivation, and story (not to mention stunning animation). The second is less obvious, but centers around several theories. And, if you know what I know, does some interesting things with the characters. [/spoiler]\
Score: 8/10\
[spoiler=FemaleRepresentation] This show doesn't have time for romance or gender roles. Humanity has to survive. Gender is hardly even mentioned. No one cares if you’re a girl or boy—it doesn’t matter. Girls and boys are treated the same way. I’m serious when I say gender is hardly even mentioned. There is actually one character whose gender has been unconfirmed because the author doesn’t think it matters. The girls are not sexualized and are just as strong as the boys. And, you usually don’t see this: girls and boys have the same uniform. Girls are not illogically fighting in skirts but also wear pants, which makes more sense to me. [/spoiler] \

+practical armor \

Sub vs Dub: \
I watched the first five episodes in dub and nearly stopped watching the anime. I apologies to all dub fans, but I found the dub absolute trash. Even now I refuse to watch the show in dub. The sub, however, does a fantastic job. \
Warnings:\
AOT is tremendously gory and violent. While toned down from the manga (surprise, surprise), it’s still brutal and graphic. \

I won't go on too much, I just really enjoyed this and thought I'd bump it up this list a bit more. I think this would appeal to many westerners... it's brutal, it makes you think, makes you feel and most of all it immerses you. I've rewatched it through 3 times (once on my own, once with my friends and once with an ex) just for those 3 episodes at the end! Pretty big deal for me considering I usually have to wait at least 2 years to properly enjoy rewatching a show, and\
          \
        I've watched it 4 times within that same space of time.\
Finished this for my first time between the end of 2013 or start of 2014... can't remember when but I've been as eagerly awaiting the sequel (which is out in 2016 :\

    I don't really get all the hype that's been surrounding Shingeki no Kyojin, everyone's just been buzzing about it since it started. Is it the art? Is it the titans? Is it all the senseless killing? Or the story?\
Shingeki no Kyojin is one of those that I like to call as cannon fodder anime, it introduces many characters who's only purpose is to be killed off trying to act as shock deaths and shock the viewer. At the first episodes when the titans attack the city and start stomping down people and eating them it really sets the tone and atmosphere of the series. It\
          \
        shows that titans are a serious threat and they're not killed off easily, they can regenerate and only way to kill them is to cut a piece off their neck in a quite specific spot. First episodes are really great as they introduce the characters, Eren, Mikasa and Armin, and the titans, and clearly show what the goal of the main heroes is.\
Then as episodes go on and titans attack again, and again and again you just start to notice the faults of this... which apparently people do not notice. For one the story. Overall it's ok, but moves at a snail's pace most of the time without any good reason. Many of the unnecessary flashback scenes, or just dragging a scene overly long do not create any better atmosphere or contribute to the story in any way. Some shows like to take things slow but usually they also do that because they want to show maybe the world around the characters or have the characters action tell the story instead of words. In SnK there is a lot of standing around, people just staring with over dramatically drawn serious faces on. It doesn't add anything to anything, it's just padding and filler because the manga isn't that far ahead, and it shows but that's not an excuse for it.\
Another thing I didn't like was that the characters die all the time, everytime they introduce a character you just don't care because there is a high change they're going to get killed to try and shock you. At first, as I said, it sets a tone that this isn't a nice world they live in, they have to live in fear of these monstrous titans that might come crashing through the gates any moment. But after it goes on and on and on with it everytime the titans arrive, it just gets boring and doesn't add anything, again it's just filler and try to make it as gory as possible. Only in the almost last episodes when some people die, not gonna spoil it, does it actually affect the story and decisions of the main character and it feels like it wasn't there just to shock you, it had a purpose and didn't start to repeat itself.\
So I might be bitching about this show a lot, but there are many really good stuff here too. Art style is really good, characters have thick black lines around them and it's unlike anything I've seen. It feels really heavy and characters have a lot of emotion on their face thanks to these thick outlines.\
Action scenes are superb. The soldiers have really unique tool, 3D maneuver gear, that they use to try and take the titans out and can move swiftly in almost any environment that has something to grap onto. The bigger fights with titans are really well done thanks to great animation. Action is fluid and really fun to watch.\
Character progression with the main characters during the first episodes is nicely done, they start as childs and they really show what they're fighting for and why they hate the titans, and what they want to do. Story follows their growth as they start to train to be able to get kill titans. Too bad other characters are quite poorly done.\
I still don't get where all the hype for this came, but I really recommend watching SnK. It's a good show overall, it has its problems that I think should not be ignored, but it's a great action series, but so are many other animes and they don't seem to get this much attention. The last 5-10 episodes were really good though. Eagerly waiting for second season that might take some time because manga seems to be progressing really slowly, and I think they should've waited a bit more with this anime to adapt the manga all at once and really do a greater than great show which I think this could've been.\

    **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**\
During moments of extreme heart pumping excitement we tend to lose all train of thought and rationality. We are blinded by the pure excitement of the moment and tend not to think twice about it. This of course can lead to a false sense of understanding in our judgement. Many adrenaline rush shows can bring on this affect and often lead to many offering immense praise because of it. But what happens when we take a step back and observe the bigger picture, when we as viewers see the forest from the trees. Our once immersive experience can become questionable to\
          \
        what's really presented before us.\
Today I'll attempt to do just that with Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), a show that have garnered international success overnight and become a mainstay in casual conversation among many social groups.  A shounen  that plays out like a seinen in terms of execution, it is easy to see where the appeal for this anime lies. But that doesn't mean the mix is handled with proper finesse. We'll break apart this anime to see where it excels and what hindered it from being better.\
First we'll talk about the areas where this show shines: Animation & Sound\
Art/animation: 9/10\
If there was ever an area that many share similar sentiments about the show, it'll be in regards to its great use of cinematography. The 3D maneuver gear scenes easily draws parallels with the caliber demonstrated in blockbusters such as Spiderman's web-slinging city dive shots. This leads to a great cinematic experiences during these sequences that demonstrate great fluidity and attention to choreography. The show's aesthetics are also worthy of praise as it leads to actions that carry weight behind it, which is made more evident when fight sequences occur. The show also have a good grasp on capturing field of depth by allowing the foreground and background to make a clear distinction. Without such techniques the show can easily become a muddled mess, as demonstrated with people that fail to grasp that like Michael Bay. The love and effort placed into every action pact scene is very evident and one worthy of respect and admiration. Truly top tier status.\
Another notable accomplishment is the shows attention to detail concerning it's world building. Many shounens tend to skimp on this area, with their environment simply being treated as set piece for fights but AOT doesn't leave it at that. Instead it takes the time to properly flesh out it's settings and environment, which allows for easy immersion for the viewer. Drawing inspiration from mid-evil European architecture, this distinction helps establish a sense of identity for the title. Also the arstyle is unique for having heavily outlined characters, whether or not you like this depends on your individual tastes. The titan designs also differ, showing multiple variations. Although it may not seem like a big deal to many, it's certainly better than seeing hoards of look alikes that are mostly common with shows that have this kind of survival setting (Terra Formars cockroaches for example). The color pallet mostly consists of earthly tones with saturated greens and browns. This also helps enhance the medieval setting the show takes apart of.\
Sound: 8/10\
\"Heavy hitting\" is possibly the best way to quickly describe the soundtrack. With larger than life orchestric tracks accompanied with powerful ballads, it works hand in hand with AOT's energetic pace. This gives the show great synchronicity and helps enhance the given scenes on display.\
As far as voice acting goes it seems that everyone only have one tone however...LOUD... and with that it's hard to properly gauge any standouts. All accept Mikasa since being a robot doesn't compute with vocal rage.\
\
Now we'll shine a spotlight on the obvious problems that hinder the show: Story & Characters\
\
Story: 5/10\
The story is fairly standard fare in most post-apocalyptic setups but the setting is where it distinguishes itself.. Humanity is on the brink of extinction due to the attacks of giant humanoid creatures known simply as Titans. Because of their constant indiscriminate attack on humans the remaining members of society take shelter behind huge walls. Very little are known about the Titans which give them an ominous presence and leave us as viewers curious to their true motives. \
Where the problem lies is the direction of the story and how it is handled. The first couple of episodes showed no signs of slowing down and left you coming back for more. But then it went from being powered by Duracell to slowing down to turtle speed, this inconstant pacing really placed a damper on things. Of course since the show like to leave you on a cliffhanger every episode you'll find yourself powering through it anyways. The change of pace wouldn't be a problem if any sense of proper progression was shown, or even if it dedicated that time to fleshing out the cast. But unfortunately that never happens, instead what we get is a plot that aimlessly wonders around with no clear cut goal. But when there was an objective it took entirely too long to accomplish it. A bad example being a string of episodes dedicated to Eren placing a boulder in a breach in the wall. The show takes simplistic tasks like this and stretches it out to an unbearably long time. Sadly it does this frequently which just feels like useless padding to reach the desired runtime length. Also the show opts out to showing us lots of SHOCK FACTOR moments, which just comes off as a cheap gimmick to keep us from losing focus.\
Characters: 3/10\
Possibly the biggest blunder to address that both casual and critical thinkers alike can spot with this title lies with it's poorly handled cast. Needless to say this show has become infamous for its excessive fodder kills. For the sake of not addressing the nameless nobodies that end up dead I'll stick to talking about the 3 main characters.\
Never has a character been as bombastically pig headed as Eren since the likes of Kamille Bidan from Zeta Gundam. And for those who've had the displeasure of seeing Kamille's overblown angst in Zeta, you know that statement alone speaks VOLUMES about the kind of person we're dealing with. Although it should be noted that he gradually become more tolerable as the show goes on, he still remains 2 dimensional for the entire runtime. This is also made worse by the fact that he's plot armored to all hell. The \"kill em all\" kind of MC isn't bad though, as I'll take that over the overused \"self insert\" blank slates we seem to get by the dozen recently. \
Armin is the only decently characterized person in the show and follows the formulaic setup of the \"coward turned useful friend\". Although not original it is still welcomed when the rest of the cast remains 1 note archetypes. \
Mikasa, or the Hax Terminator if you prefer, is very one note. She is portrayed as a Mary Sue which in turn gives her the personality of a brick wall... until of course \"onii-can\" is in trouble and she goes full fledged yandere. They try to explain this away with her backstory but that doesn't change the fact that it feels very forced at times. This gives her a very inconsistent characteristic, making her the worse in the bunch in terms of proper characterization. Just think of her as the \"one woman army\" Titan killer and call it a day.\
Also expect yelling..lots and lots of yelling. If the script was written out EVERYTHING WOULD APPEAR IN ALL CAPS LIKE THIS... Depending on your tolerance for melodrama this can quickly becomes taxing and can also break immersion far too often. This becomes even more apparent if watch dubbed since you won't be occupied reading, instead watching everyone talk like they've never heard of an inside voice before. \
The government and nobles aren't treated with any tact and come across as 1 dimensional villains. The writers don't bother to flesh any of them out and make them evil just so we can hate them or to conjure up forced drama.\
If you over saturate a show with a certain event it ceases to hold any substance. And in regards to death with AOT that's exactly what happens. Outside of our plot armored main characters, all side characters are open season for Titan canon fodder. Sure the SHOCK FACTOR can keep you attentive but it also degrades the show's integrity. You start remembering the characters for how they died rather than who they were. They become apart of the blood splattered decorated background of the show and we are left giving no fucks. It feels rather juvenile and makes it hard to take the show seriously. It's hard to invest or care about a character if they die as quickly as they're introduced. Something AOT seem to fail to grasp.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
All my qualms regarding the story and characters didn't negate my enjoyment of the show. It may have hindered me from taking it seriously but as a popcorn flick this title had me hooked. It gave me that rush I was looking for and the cinematography is some of the best I've seen in recent memory. It's an easily rewatchable show and a highly recommendable one as a gateway for new fans.\
Overall: 6/10\
If you simply seek intense action in a immersive setting look no further. This anime will easily scratch that itch. As entertainment value goes it's truly a roller coaster ride. However if you wanted a well written show you'd be hard pressed finding it here. Under the guise of it's nice setting lies a subpar script that I can't offer any praise too. With that in mind your enjoyment of this titles all depends on how you approach it as a viewer. \
\
For similar titles I recommend:\
\
Sidonia no Kishi: commonly referred to as \"attack on titan in space\" it has truly earned it's nickname. With giant monsters that pose a threat to society, and the remaining members fighting to survive. They are both also chalk filled with shock factor and have a high body count if that's something you seek.\
Shingeki no Bahamut: Genesis : Besides the similarities in name they both share hair raising action scenes, a fast pace when the time calls for it and a cool mid-evil setting. As a popcorn flick you will not be disappointed.\
Claymore: with a similar setting and humanity being attacked by monsters this makes of a decent substitute for fans of AOT. \

    Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin has become one of the biggest anime, at least stateside, over the past few years. Unfortunately many shows that are popular often get caught up in the hype of fans and when people view it when hype has begun to cool down it is often that these shows often get a lot of backlash since they are not as good as everyone who watched it years ago says it is. Fortunately I think that Attack on Titan is well made enough that it will not be seen as trash by viewers years from now when if it does\
          \
        have some issues.   \
To start out with the good the show has top notch production values. The animation stays great throughout which especially shines during the completely awesome and often brutal action sequences that are sprinkled throughout the series. A word must also be said that the show also has a very unique art style with heavy outlines around the characters which helps the show pop out without doing anything too distracting.  \
Despite the oldtimey setting of the show the music often has a somewhat electronic feel to it and while some might be distracted the music really helps set the epic mood and at times can get you pumped for the next fight.  \
While the story is never too out of the ordinary, the world that Attack on Titan creates is interesting enough that you are guaranteed to stay interested in whats going on.\
But everything is not perfect unfortunately. \
While there are a plethora of characters in the show that are often very interesting, most of the cast outside of the main 3 protagonists don't really get enough screen time to get very developed. It also doesn't help that some characters will just randomly die before you get attached. While one of Attack on Titan's claim to fame s the fact that they often murder characters you often don't get enough attachment to some who die in order to make their deaths have as much emotional weight as they probably should. \
The show also has slight pacing problems as the show goes at a almost breakneck pace in the first few episodes until it suddenly decides to slow down. Luckily by the half way point enough happens to make this less of a problem. \
Also while this show certainly tries to be epic it sometimes goes into hilariously over the top territory but not too often.  \
Even with these problems the show is still a great watch. It is quite brutal though so if you can't stand violence stay out. Also the storyline isn't complete yet and at this point a sequel is very likely which is good since I along with many are interested to see where the story goes and aren't willing to read the manga to find out. \
So while it may not be perfect Attack on Titan it seems that it is just too big to ignore and that is why I am happy that it is of a very high quality. ",

    Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) undoubtedly made it as the top anime of 2013. Hajime Isayama’s creation gained fans across the globe with its thrills, surprising twists, and memorable characters. Compared to other apocalyptic anime, Hajime develops undefeatable and menacing creatures: giant man-eating titans --- overgrown human-like creatures that range in size and ability. \
Story (8)\
The suspense is incredible and exciting with constant gory scenes of titans brutalizing humans to the fullest degree, whether it is crushing skulls with their massive thumbs or tearing apart the human body. Combat action involves stunning choreography as armed soldiers spin or fly in mid-air with their 3D\
          \
        maneuver gear before striking lethal blows to titans. Certain circumstances cannot be predicted accurately as SnK shows no hesitation in killing off supporting characters. The majority of the episodes end in surprising and unexpected twists as soldiers fight to save humanity by risking their lives to accomplish one goal: destroy all of the titans. The pacing is steady, allowing viewers to understand the plot and characters with extreme detail. However, the primary objective is too complex to complete in 25 episodes. A cliffhanger ceases the opportunity for more exploration of the titans and other characters.\
Tip: In the middle of each episode is a helpful “Info We Can Share So Far” section. It lasts for less than 20 seconds, so it’s advised to pause and read the info. Most of them are hidden data that are not quoted by characters in the series, including history of the titans and info about the communities. \
Character (8)\
The majority of the characters, including the MCs, have motives behind their actions, and they develop and strengthen after experiencing tragic events. For example, Mikasa’s sole purpose of protecting Eren throughout the series has more to do than just her personal feelings for him. Eren is the main protagonist and has a strong passion to destroy every single titan. He was intolerably whiny and irresponsible in the beginning but slightly matured halfway through the series due to interactions with experienced squad members. He gains common sense and looks at situations from different angles. However, he does not fully develop as his old ways sometimes reappear.\
Mikasa and Armin may appear clingy to Eren at times, but the trio spend much time apart with other characters, primarily during the second half. Mikasa is the strong female heroine who is a master in combat action. She’s fearless and presents a major attraction with her swift moves of killing multiple titans in one blow. Armin showed great improvement in his character. He starts out as a coward but becomes willing to strategize despite his fear. He is also quite the genius and contributes to resolving various mysteries of the titans. Along with Armin, there are many characters who present or develop great charismatic skills. \
The large number of squad members have personalities ranging from indifferent to determined, and they all distinguish with their levels of combat ability and leadership. Some of their attitudes can be hilarious, depending on one’s sense of humor. The anime goes into the past of some of the important characters and highlight relationships between them. It helps the viewer understand the characters and develop a love/hate relationship with them. The only downside is the inability to explore other important characters before the finale.\
Animation (8)\
Production I.G. and Wit Studio did a fantastic job with the animation. The thick outlines displays details within the background and character design. The artwork emphasizes excellent visual effects of combat action and characters maneuvering between buildings, trees, and other landscapes. All of the settings from the cityscape to the forest are remarkable. Character designs are distinct, and the unisex military uniforms reveal great details, thanks to the outlines. Characters’ fear and other emotions are generally shown with black lines drawn on their faces, contributing to the horrifying theme of SnK. The black lines symbolize distress, anger, frustration, etc. Bloody scenes of titans crushing and eating human bodies fulfill in making those primary creatures look terrifying. Titans are drawn as ugly and naked overgrown human beings. Some are shown to be skinless, and the vast majority are the opposite. \
There are a few problems with the art. There's no distinction in gender between the titans. It was not an issue in the beginning, but it later becomes something important to note in the series. Another poor part about the animation are the stills. There are some scenes that are at a standstill with the characters talking like an idle page in a storybook. Other times, there would be fixed scenes with only one or two objects striking attention with movement.\
Sound (9)\
The voice actors adjusted to the characters’ personality, making their emotions and identities suitable for the fearful and serious atmosphere. The stomps and groans of titans presents practicality to the anime’s theme, considering the type of monsters Hajime decided to create. The music from the theme songs to the background is memorable. Background music includes warrior-like songs and sometimes fast-paced or choral music during fights. The entire soundtrack adds a grand quality to the series. \
Enjoyment (9) / Overall (8)\
SnK is one of my favorite action anime, even after re-watching it a few times. In addition to the cliffhanger, I found Eren to be really annoying. There was a scene where Eren hurt Mikasa physically, and I hated him for intentionally harming a lady. SnK’s focus on other characters and increased suspense made it much better. The characters' behavior were humorous at times, and there was always something to look forward to after each episode. As a result, I experienced laughter and shock throughout the series. Due to its popularity, I’m looking forward to a 2nd season and reading the manga in the meantime.\
Overall, SnK has entertaining combat action, surprising events, and remarkable visuals. It provides details throughout the series to keep the viewer current on events, and it gives quite a bit of attention to the characters. Apart from its incomplete ending, I highly recommend any fan of action anime to become familiar with the SnK franchise.\

    This review is spoiler free.\
The name''attack on titan'' might not seem that interesting. At first I thought, giant brainless creatures that eat humans? so what? But then it turned out definitely unregrettable.\
The story is hardcore (I believe one word is enough) and so is the soundtrack. Never have I ever seen a soundtrack that suits the story and the fight scenes that well, it litterly sends chills down your spine, which is why I rated it 10 (and I never give 10). As for the art and the charcters, I can honestly say the design is more realistic than anything else. I remember the first\
          \
        episode left me shaken because of the single thought that this could happen for real. However I hated the fact that so many characters died before we got to know them well. It didn't keep me from enjoying it anyway, though you would rethink the definition of enjoyement after watching this anime. Shingeki No Kyojin is definitely not something for the soft hearted or those who easily get attached to fictional characters (which is nothing to be ashamed of).\
Just to say, you might wanna watch this anime before you die.\

    The first season of attack on Titan was one of the most interesting animes i have watched. A great story with still so much to be discovered. I found that the story represents a racial war. You see the titans almost have no reason to kill as many humans as they do. It represents what Caucasians did to the african Americans back in the slavery years. \
With a great story, exceptional graphics the only place i saw Attack on Titan go wrong was the characters. Now im not being to critical, we can all imagine that we would be just as traumatized and upset as\
          \
        Eren, Armin and the others are due to the fact that there are giant Titans eating all your friends and family. But its just not your typical anime characters. There is so much crying and a lot of the show is characters weeping about how terrible there life is, its just not the anime i am used to. Maybe, in a way thats what makes it better than most anime, the fact that characters show so much emotion. Instead of having a fearless character like Goku or Inuyasha you have characters who are scared and admit their fear.\
Attack on Titan is a wonderful story and I myself can not wait for Season 2. I give the first season a solid 9/10. ",

    Oh boy, Attack on Titan. \
Up front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I'll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. \
Most of the things like character-motivation, their development and the\
          \
        pacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \
Now I know. It is shounen, what do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn't work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no  good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \
I try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews (try to, not succeeding, shut up), but in this case I can't not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode, is. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspect of them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag, than a conflict or a struggle for the character. And that problem encumbers most characters in this show. Their constant one-note struggles and conflicts ultimately do not mean anything because it is all we ever see of them. Characters, besides the plot are paramount for me, which is why it is almost everything I talk about in this, but it is the main point I want to give you an understanding of, so there you go. \
And so people in this show are not remembered for their characterization or their interesting personalities but rather for very stereotypical aspects and their designs, which is very repetitive by the way. It just looks too bland and uninteresting for my taste. They could have at least incorporated a few different uniforms and colors but no, brown it is. \
That could very well be the name of the anime, “brown it is-the anime”, but I digress. \
What looked like something good in the first eight or so episodes came to a grinding hold in the boulder arc, did not really pick up after that and just left me with a great desire of the story continuing like it did in the first eight episodes and not the way it did. The few twists it threw in were nothing too surprising and pretty easy to figure out, if you at least try to pay minimum attention. The last scene at the end failed completely in hooking me for the next season and that pretty much sums it all up.\
It's almost addicting to not care about this anime anymore. Hype didn't last for good reasons. Stuff's painfully mediocre with a tendency to annoy me more than entertaining me.\
OP theme still awesome though.  \

    I've watched a lot of other anime and this still stands as my number 1 top favorite anime.  Story is well written and intense.  Art is a little dull but it is still great.  And the music is beyond outstanding.  I love how the opening themes deliver a great message about humanity.  And the soundtrack playing during the episodes just add to the intensity.  There was at least some character development in it. But I enjoyed every second of it and no matter how many times I rewatch this I still enjoy it.  I also do recommend that\

    Well I've read the manga a while ago, but never did I think it would get an anime adaptation this awesome.\
Story 10/10: Although it does have a few cliches seen in many shonen, it is otherwise completely original, suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your seat every episode. Assuming the anime follows the manga faithfully, you are all in for many incredible twists!!!! Look forward for it, I can't wait.\
Characters 9/10: Although only 2 episodes have been released, the character development is incredible. The 3 main characters should and most likely will be fleshed out wonderfully in the anime (if going by\
          \
        the manga), their back-stories are quite good/surprising/original.\
Animation 9/10: What more is there to say?\
Overall: This anime will most likely be the best of the season, it certainly had the best first episode of any anime I've watched, and there's no doubt production values will be on the high side. Here's hoping for another season after the first 25 episodes! Enjoy watching, it won't disappoint.\

    There's only one possible number to represent Shingeki no Kyojin, and that number is a certain one-digit number between 1 and 10 and is a multiple of 3.\
You guessed it. Six. Or nine, flipped the other way.\
I know you anime whores and die-hard SnK fans are probably sitting in your chairs ready to light torches and grab your pitchforks and form a mob right outside my front door because \"six\" is a pretty low-end score, at least on my ranking scale let alone for a hyped-up series like SnK, but come to think of it, did you come here to confirm your opinions about SnK\
          \
        being 2013's greatest anime show, or did you come here to whine in American-accented Japanese at the next guy that gives SnK a low score because you hate it when people disagree with you?\
I have to admit that SnK, through my eyes, was a decent show at best, decent being the number \"six\". And before you and wonder \"wut skoar did dis n00b giv sao?!?!?!\", let me tell you beforehand, I rated it 8, in my own unbiased opinion. I wasn't excited at all to watch SAO, and I was pretty darn excited to hear rave reviews about this new show that brings Jack and the Beanstalk down to Earth, multiplies the number of giants involved, and gives the humans no beanstalk to escape to safer grounds. It sounds interesting, but was it a good show?\
Six. I'll stop saying that now.\
Story: A fantastic tale about 10-meter-tall zombies eating out every woman and child like certified pedophiles in the world's largest buffet platter with three different types of meals: Outer Wall for peasant's dishes, Inner Wall for middle-class, and the ultimate dessert: the King and his loyal subjects for those fattening delicacies. I believe the first episode gave this story the right amount of pressure to set the rest of the series of events in motion when [literally] the world's largest pop star, Michael Jackson, resurrects as a Titan and has a change of heart to chase after married women instead of children, but a couple of years later, this leaves us absolutely.... nowhere.\
See, I'm fine with that, at least it shows humans are struggling to keep themselves off the main course by avoiding intervention with their larger selves, but what accelerated like a rocket from the beginning has become a race to reach the end as slowly and safely as possible. My grandmother doesn't drive slow enough to keep the same pacing as SnK's storyline, and what should be 24 minutes of giant ass-kicking is in reality 15 minutes of build-up, 5 minutes of something ACTUALLY happening, 1 minute to introduce the cliffhanger, 1 minute for the opening sequence, 1 minute for the ending sequence, and another minute for desperate neckbeards to unzip their pants and fantasize about Mikasa Ackerman being their \"waifu\". That Mikasa Minute usually occurs in-between the build-up scenes, so on the plus side, it gives weeaboos everywhere a chance to wipe their monitors (or leave it there so they can claim to their friends that they also ejaculated on Eren's face).\
Art: I can see why every male anime nerd wants to stick something onto their screens every time the females show up. Shingeki no Kyojin has some of the best aesthetics of an animated series that I've ever seen/heard, from the show's sheer amount of gory content to the snapping of bones (which I still feel). On that alone, I've felt something.\
Character: A good number of the characters make very little sense to me. Armin van Buuren RIAA Multi-Platinum Arlert makes spot-on predictions because he's probably reading ahead in his own manga series. Eren Jaegermeister wants to kill all of the Titans and save everyone, but his indecisiveness causes more people to die, not that it matters that dozens die in his care. Captain Levi Denim claims to dislike pointless deaths, but every time he sacrifices a soldier, he never completes his operation, and when he executes the operation, more people end up dying anyways. That's like telling people you're a green politician, yet the car you drive is an environmentally-friendly Hummer H2.\
We also get characters with very little introduction and very little development, who only seem to fill in the role of creating more pointless deaths. Titans are scary, indeed they are, but are soldiers really THAT expendable? One does not simply self-impregnate, clone, or genetically-engineer new soldiers to fight. Sooner or later, there will be less soldiers to feed to the Titans, but then again, the author could always create new ones out of black matter to keep drawing his fanbase in.\
Enjoyment: Despite what I have to say about SnK, I found it to be an enjoyable watch. It delivers softcore male pornography on a large scale, and sometimes it adds an extra X to the already triple-X rating and exposes what's UNDER the skin for those hardcore biology nerds (I know, it's too intense just thinking about human anatomy).\
When the action sequences come around, they deliver. There's something special about the 3D Maneuver Gear that allows for more dynamic camera angles, giving you that same high-speed sensation the characters should also be experiencing. However, if I could pinpoint my absolute favorite moment of this show, I wouldn't highlight anything involving 3DMG. Instead, I would opt for Episode 8, the underground scene when members of the 104th Training Corps attempt to retake their base. Why THAT scene, you may ask? Because it's more fun discharging your guns in the Titans' faces, and it's better doing it in a group.\
Overall: Yes, I enjoyed watching. Yes, the aesthetics were phenomenal and it did draw me in from the beginning when Michael Jackson went on tour to Wall Maria and ate one of his fans. I thought the action was superb and it was a thrill to watch. But does it make it a great show? In my eyes, not really. Slow pacing, meaningless death, and heavy amounts of build-up define SnK. I know there are people out there who will complain, disagree, and ultimately flame on my profile for disliking SnK, but then again, take this into consideration: I gave this series a 9 from the beginning, and I ultimately decided to drop it to 6. Am I being biased? I don't think so.\
But if you hate my opinion, or if you're hoping to defend the glory of SnK by trying to convert another non-believer to your SnK Fan Club or whatever the hell you'd like to call it, then do me a favor and don't try to shove your opinion down my throat. I've had it happen already, and it'll only tell me how much of a steaming pile of shit you are.\

    I remember hearing about an anime called Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) and it's huge popularity when it's first season originally aired.  Naturally, I looked into it, watching a trailer and reading a description, etc, and found myself unimpressed (even turned off) by what I saw.  Something about those giants with their ridiculous grins and overall appearance did absolutely nothing for me.\
Now, two years later, and a sudden passion to catch up on my exponentially-growing backlog of anime, I finally decided to give this series an honest try.  After all, it must have gained all this popularity for a reason, right?\
          \
\
From the very first episode, I was blown away.  Aside from the giants (or titans, as they are called), I found the artwork and animations fantastic, with the CG interwoven beautifully.  There was an instant, heartfelt connection to the main characters.  And the music was exceptional.  \
I had to have more, and more I did have, finishing the first season in only three days.  Overall, I couldn't have been much more pleased with Shingeki no Kyojin, and regret not having given it a chance sooner.  Out of 25 episodes, I found only one or two of only moderate value, while all the rest kept me on the edge of my seat with a mix excitement, shock, fear, grief, anticipation and awe.\
It didn't take long at all to get used to the odd appearance of the titans, and even came to my own understanding of their purpose for it.  Outside of that, my only real complaints are story-related, in the sense that I just have so many unanswered questions (especially not having read the manga).  But the series isn't over after all, and I'm sure that the majority of my questions will get answered in the next season.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is almost non-stop action sequences and gut-wrenching emotional rollercoasters. Any anime that can thoroughly pull me into its world and make me so emotionally invested in its characters is a success in my book.\
I may have misjudged this anime initially, but next time, when season two airs, I'm going to be one of the first in line to see it!\

Although it is difficult to review an anime after only five episodes, it is certainly possible to make a few observations about it. Shingeki no Kyojin it is a dark, plot driven anime focusing on the battle for humankind very existence, and it's brutal. There is no Moe, no fanservice and aside from a memorable scene with a potato, very little comedy.\
In these first episodes the balance of power lies very much with the titans. Human kind loses; a lot. In fact many have already accepted that they cannot defeat the titans even with their largest armies so argue against even attempting to fight them.Those\
          \
        sent to fight against the titans are as afraid as everybody else, and the anime does a good job of portraying believable human fear in these characters. The characters themselves may not be the most developed but they work well, the main trio being the hot headed idealistic Eren Jaegar, his bad-ass childhood friend Mikasa and the weak but smart Armin.Their designs aren't anything special but that is made up for by the titans themselves.\
There is considerable variety to them, from hulking monstrosities down to smaller almost comically grotesque monsters. Although the titans themselves are beautifully animated and the animation is generally of a very high quality, providing sufficient fluidity in the movement of the 3D maneuver gear, the shows unique art style may prove jarring to some viewers. The soundtrack is another strength of the show, with the opening especially being catchy and fast paced in a way that reflects nicely on the show it's self. \
Shingeki no Kyojin is a tense action packed show that moves quickly and isn't afraid to show violence. It's not for everyone but it provides a cool interesting premise with stunning fight scenes and a brilliant soundtrack. It is something I'd defiantly recommend people to try at least due to it's originally and high quality.\

    For over the past half year, the anime on most people's minds is Shingeki no Kyojin, otherwise known as Advancing Giants and other variants such as The Eotena Onslaught and politically incorrect Attack on Titan. Fanbases were either a hit or miss, and SnK's is a bit of both. We first have the ignorant weebs hyped to the max, making crack yaoi pairings and not knowing that it was based off an original manga series. Then we get the creative ones with badass fanarts from Pixiv, and know how to crack good jokes.\
This anime went bold and decided to create on a whole new animation\
          \
        style, utilizing original 2D art, static, and 3D graphics. By the end of the first episode, people know this anime will go down in history. They hired Hiroyuki Sawano, most famous for his works in Guilty Crown, as their music composer. Yui Ishikawa, a barely known seiyuu, was brought in to voice the main heroine Mikasa Ackerman. Then they built a super team of seiyuus perfect for the roles of each of their characters. The anime took great lengths to give most characters a backstory or a reason for existing in the series.\
In a time of redundant themes in anime, SnK brought in a whole new plot, though most often compared to Claymore. Humanity at the brink of extinction, forced hide behind walls to protect themselves from giants. Mechanisms such as 3D maneuver gears to combat these seemingly invincible monsters was innovative. As the plot thickens, secrets unravel that bring in more questions. It's not just humanity fighting monsters, it's humans utilizing the monsters' powers to reclaim their dominance.\
If the anime was judged by the following criteria of story, animation, sound, character, and enjoyment, all of these would be a 10/10. Now, is this the best anime I have ever watched? No. But ignoring the fanbases, useless controversies about budgeting, and baseless hating on overhyped series, and instead using my own unique judgement, Shingeki no Kyojin is an extremely solid series.\

    To begin, I mostly stumbled across AoT because of its high rating and under that premise assumed that it has to be somewhat decent, which it is. On the whole though, it didn't strike me as spectacular as some people made it out to be for reasons I shall explain below.\
Story/Pace: 3/10\
To be honest, the first couple of episodes had a wonderful fast pace as the main protagonists advanced, more about their strange world and titan relationship was revealed e.t.c. However, like most animes who give it their full right away, it ran out of ammunition very soon and a good 1/3 of all episodes\
          \
        as of ep 12 (I didn't check, so I may be off) were recaps and comparatively generic giant-vs-human action. So while the story was initially very gripping, I spent the last few episodes grinding my teeth, while hoping for something other than human group A being slaughtered by giant group B to happen and was sorely disappointed. If I only had taken into account the first dozen episodes, this would be an 8-9, but given this endless drawing out, the anime really does not deserve that.\
Characters: 4/10\
The characters of this anime had their boons/banes, but by tendency, need improvement. Our protagonists are a bit very stereotypical, but made interesting mostly because they keep dying/almost-dying. Generally, all characters are very dramatic and are constantly on the verge of/at a nervous breakdown. Although this would typically annoy me, the anime does deserve credit for making the most convincing war environment I have ever seen (making it much more preferable to those creepy ones where people just casually brush off that their friends just got butchered). \
This unique aspect does however trip and fall horribly among the sidecharacters, who both spawn and die like flies. They show up and some of them die 3 episodes later which is very realistic, but perhaps a tad too realistic. I seriously struggled keeping track of all of them and at some point simply gave up on doing so. There are a few more important side characters who will likely survive, but on the whole I find that they all lack depth. One sees too little of them and when one does, they are either killing titans or mourning their friends, which makes it hard to learn new things about them and understand them.\
Art: 8/10\
I must agree, that a good part of the artwork in this anime is phenomenally well done. The colours have a nice glow to them and the various phyiscal features are appropriate. In that aspect, the anime deserves substantial credit. I did however, notice a number of moments where the animated component was missing and the characters were shouting at the top of their lungs while statically standing there. Other scenes on the other hand move incredibly smoothly, so it seems a bit lazily done at times. Still on the whole, very good.\
Sound: 7/10\
The music of the anime was decent and created an epic feel for the combat scenes. This has however, been done thousands of times and it didn't really stand out among the other animes that practice this. The voice-acting is harder to judge as I am not fluently Japanese, but seemed appropriate. On the whole the sound is good, but nothing special.\
Enjoyment: 4/10\
I did enjoy the beginning of this anime, but it then quickly became disappointing due to aforementioned reasons. Towards the end I just felt like skipping ahead to where something interesting was revealed, but the anime ends with ultimately telling little more than what can be garnered from the first few episodes. I did also enjoy the titan fighting, but can say that the 1st titan fight was substantially more impressive than the 30th and as that was the content of all of the episodes, I bored quickly.\
Overall: 5.2/10\
On the whole I feel a bit bitter about the plot's speed, but for those who enjoy  action with high-definition picturesque imagery and epic music, I would recommend it. If you care more about a deep plot with lots of mysteries, don't bother.\

I try to at least be as objective as possible with these reviews, but in this case I can't not mention the constant annoyance the main character and his constant angsting about the things that happened in the first episode. Jesus Christ, his whole existence revolves around angst. Realistic portrayals of characters do not just use one aspect\
          \
        of them and blatter us over the head with that non-stop. There needs to be at least one high-moment to correlate all of the low moments. If he is in constant angst-mode and always shouting, it becomes meaningless and more of a joke or a running gag.\
Now I know. It is shounen. What do I even expect? But the straw of thinking too deep into it doesn't work this time, because even when you scratch the surface of these characters, they still seem to be completely uninteresting. There is no concept worth exploring here, no good idea hooking you to the adventure and what is there, is boring after a few episodes. \
Most of the things like character-motivation, their development and the pacing just seem quite off. The characters like Eren, Mikasa and Armin are completely one dimensional and void of almost any interesting aspect. \
Up front, the more time passes between me, having watched the show and now thinking about it, the more average it becomes. I came to the conclusion, that the show severely lacks memorable moments. Many may call BS on me for that, but really think about it. Excluding what happens in Episode eight...I think, there was almost nothing for me to remember fondly. I'll say, that upon first completing the show, I quite liked it and would have even called it good, but that is just not the case anymore. \
Also as enjoyment it's quite nice, but \"Enjoyment\" rating shouldn't be one of the aspects when making an impartial review and this is pretty much why 99% of MAL reviews are bad. There's plenty good stuff you could watch instead getting into this. After 1st season It gets insufferable -opinion even among the fans- so if you like action scenes just watch an american movie already. \

                          \
    Hello Lucid here,\
So like many I also watched Attack on Titan. Wow this anime is so intense it reopens what anime is about and I want to focus on the emotion in this anime. Cause this anime has tons of it.\
Story:\
The story is original, as in that It has an unique setting. This world they live in is a hell and no one knows how it ended up being this crazy. So we as a viewer also don't know how all of this happened and why it's happening. Thus the basis for the story is set, we live in a world of fear where we\
          \
        are protected by huge walls from Titans that want to murder us and destroy us until none of us are left.\
Now this anime starts with the Titans breaching the wall and it sets the story in motion. Our main Protagonist now has a reason to fight these titans with a hatred not even Lelouch could match.\
So we see these kids who join the Army and become fighters against the Titans. But what this anime does different than any other anime where the story is driven by revenge, is that it's so realistic. Now I'm not saying giant Titans are realistic but giant Titans fighting people who are but insects to them, well if you ever stepped on a bug how often did it fight back succesfully?\
So we enter this world we know nothing about and we only see the POV of the main Protagonist who's only wish is to kill all Titans. So we are limited to  what he knows. And as the Story moves onward we learn bit by bit more and more about the world of the titans and how it all started. \
Here I have to say that all of this happens in an extremely slow tempo but it never bored me. Yes every episode ends with a huge cliffhanger so at the time I watched it I had to wait a week before finding out. And even then an episode could not even reveal what happened the week before. So if you can be patient like I am this anime will be the anime for you.\
Now the Story is still vague and since I don't want to read the manga I don't know what is going to happen in season two. But that doesn't matter the first season of AOT was amazing, an adrenaline ride full of emotion. Where no one is safe from the wrath of the titans! (don't watch that movie it blows.)\
So the story is hard to judge, the synopsis is great and creative and this world is amazing with lots of detail. But yea until we get the answers I feel like I cannot judge an incomplete story.\
Characters:\
Well here is where AOT shines. The characters: So much emotion has been put in these characters. We actually see fear in this anime, something most anime don't seem to know. Characters are actually so afraid that they abandon people instead of playing the hero. People get confronted with themselves and trusting others becomes very hard. We also see the burden of these decisions come back to haunt those who made them. We see people cry out to the gods to bring back their loved ones. People scream out of fear or sadness in a way I want western movies to show us more. More is more in this case when it comes to emotion. But it's never to much, the emotion is never at a level where it becomes weird or unrealistic. No the emotion here is what I expect when we are confronted with our biggest fear: Death. How many will cower and how many will stand up in a failed attempt to save someone.\
Yesh the Character development is rich, it might feel slow as with many of these episodes but it's there, it's subtle but I rather have it slow than hasted. People need to endure a lot before they can change and our main characters are young, therefore the confusion in their actions is what is so great about this anime. It shows a world I would never want to live in.\
Anime often offers a rich world that even though there is war, murder or agony you still want to be part of it, play the hero and look bad ass while you do it. Well forget that with AOT no one wants to live in that world, there is no place for heroes, acting like a hero gets you killed. No this world is fear and survival there is no time for happiness not when you're up against giant titans.\
Now as I said the Characters are rich and well drawn out. There isn't a single person I hate in this anime, they don't feel cliché and they act never out of their own line. \
Sound:\
Sound/Music, is simply amazing in this anime. Might I also add the lack of sound in some scenes makes the scene so much more intense. Yes this anime will shiver you with their use of sound fx and the music will push your adrenaline to a new level.\
Art:\
Now this is a beauty. The Art is AMAZING, rarely we see an anime this nice. Just look at some screen shots and you will see why this anime is living up to it's hype. Yes the Art adds all that is needed to make this so intense. And maybe best of all are the Action Sequences, I think that if we had this anime four years ago we wouldn't of had this kind of sequences it's perfect, just watch the official trailer and you get what I mean, it is as if you are flying with them and that is where I leave art at.\
Overall:\
Yes this anime brought me so much joy, It's intense, it will bring you to the edge and even throw you over at some times because you cannot hold in. You want to scream like they do, you want to fight and punish like they try and in the end you just want to look away and cry. This anime gets weirder and weirder as it progresses and the story becomes more and more intense, and even when we don't know what will happen next it's still an awesome ride that everyone should watch.\
Happy Watching :)\

everything about this anime screams originality. It is seen as one of the best recent animes and it is one of the best right now.\
the story is basic and easy to follow\
the art is cool and doesn't leave a lot of action or gore to the imagination\
the soundtrack is awesome beyond belief\
the characters are all interesting and realistic as only two recruits are fearless, all the rest piss their pants when a titan is near, this is the realism of a war that is not expressed enough on those that fight with no original intention or with see themselves as perfect soldiers only to\
          \
        die in the first 5 minutes of combat.\
it is one of the most entertaining shows around and always keeps you on the edge only being dulled by repeating episodes but always ends with an acceptable ending to the series of episodes.\
if you haven't watched this TV series WATCH IT NOW!!!!\
everyone I know who has watched it love it and always leaves me thinking of other ideas that the show has brought and shown on a bloody platter of body parts.\

    There’s a current trend that favors dark and edgy stories such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and so on. Anime, being no different, saw the much anticipated release of Attack on Titan which is based on the manga of the same name. Given the astronomical amount of hype behind the series it certainly had a lot to live up to. That said, the hype was understandable as Attack on Titan seemed to have everything going for it, being produced by Production I.G., having top notch production values, and most importantly having a promising premise. Even I was taken in as seeing the trailer\
          \
        alone was enough to make me watch the series as it aired, something I don’t normally do. \
Attack on Titan follows the story of Eren and the Survey Corps as they fight for survival in a world where monstrous beings known as titans terrorize humanity.\
I absolutely love the premise of Attack on Titan. It’s definitely something that stands out and is at least somewhat unique in a sea of all too similar anime. Yes, humanity fighting for survival against monstrous beings has been done before but one could hardly accuse Attack on Titan of being generic. That’s unfortunately where my praise ends for the series. While the plot isn’t generic, almost everything else certainly is and it's not long before the show turns into glorified torture porn. The majority of the characters feel like little more than cardboard cutouts, including the protagonist. This is a huge problem in a series where death and survival are the main aspects, and a character’s death has no impact unless the viewer is attached to them. \
Without spoiling too much there are one or more important characters that are introduced and die within the span of a single episode. The scenes are presented as if they are supposed to be dramatic and full of emotion, yet these characters are barely shown in the one episode they are in creating a weird contradiction. With little to no information on them it’s hard to really care either way, and important characters should not be merely thrown away to establish tone when there are tons of other more effective ways to do so. \
Eren is the typical Shounen hero who has one emotion, anger, and only one way of expressing himself, yelling. Combined with his arrogant attitude and knack for fucking things up regardless of his big talk, Eren can become a very annoying character. It would be one thing if he learned from his mistakes, or if other people reacted appropriately to his continuously bad decisions but this never happens in the series to any meaningful degree. Something that also cheapens the impact of all the death in the series is Eren's ability to shounen his way out of death and other various situations on numerous occasions because, you know, good writing is hard to do. \
Mikasa is Eren’s sister and plays the part of the super cool heroine of few words. She succeeds at everything she does because she has a nice ass and is pretty hot despite her manly abs. This is otherwise known as being a giant Mary Sue. I guess one could argue her weird and unhealthy obsession with her brother Eren is flaw, but given the backstory behind it just comes off as pandering with undertones of incest. I guess it's okay though since she does look good in those tight pants.\
The rest of the main cast consists of various other trainees and the Survey Corps. They aren’t really memorable and I couldn’t name more than a handful of them even if my life depended on it. There’s Armin, he’s not so good at fighting but he’s smart or so I'm told. There’s Jean, he’s kind of a coward that only looks out for himself at first but later grows to have more leader like qualities. There’s Levi, he’s kind of like Eren's mentor and a male version of Mikasa except for the part of wanting to bang Eren, well, unless the shipping community has anything to say about it. \
There are a few characters that I felt were somewhat more interesting. Sasha probably has the most personality out of all the characters and is at least likeable. There is also a Survey Corps officer who has an obsession with studying the titans who also adds much needed personality to series. I am conflicted however, on one hand the comic relief these two characters provide make them at least likeable but the comedy in Attack on Titan is so silly and contrived that it interferes with the otherwise grim atmosphere and messes with the tonal consistency of the show. I don't have any problems with a show having some contrast, but it should be appropriate to the show and not take the viewer out of the story. A good example would be Paranoia Agent, there is an episode dedicated to three people trying to commit suicide that is quite humorous but stays in tune with the show's dark tone while also making for interesting social commentary on Japan's high suicide rate in real life and plays into the overarching themes of the series. It is natural and fits the show with its dry humor, in comparison Attack on Titan literally pulls you out of an serious scene for a cheap laugh, like Armin and Reiner gawking at a pretty blonde girl while they are running for their lives. \
There are some other problems, such as pacing issues where the series just grinds to a screeching halt and drags on for a fair bit. A lot of other parts of the story dip into shounen levels of silliness and predictability. I’m still not entirely sure how the transformation aspect of the show works either, besides something about biting your thumb while you have some kind of goal in mind or something very ill thought out and almost random. I suppose these are things that aren’t meant to be looked into too deeply… or at all. The dialogue is also bad with the characters having to explain every little thing they do or have an internal monologue every five seconds. It's all these things that add up and really take away from the show. \
I have to give credit where credit is due, and the production values of this show are damn good. The art and animation are nice and fluid, with the art style itself being very distinctive. The characters have an unusually thick border that outlines them that I don’t really care for, but other than that I found the art in general to be outstanding. Character design is pretty good even if the characters mostly wear the same military uniform they are unique enough, though I'm not quite sure how they move in those ridiculously tight pants. The technology is pretty neat looking as well, from the 3D maneuver gear to the box cutter swords. The music is decent, if not somewhat overrated. It’s all fittingly high energy and I don’t have a problem with it. \
By now it’s no secret that both the anime and manga versions of Attack on Titan are sweeping successes. Damn near everyone has watched this show, including people that weren’t particularly big on anime to begin with. While its success with the mainstream market is commendable I can’t help but feel disappointed with the actual content. Much like other popular shows currently airing, I can see Attack on Titan riding the hype wave with the support of the casual market for as long as it can. It doesn’t help that the creator is prostituting the series with several spin offs, a live action movie, and even going as far as to change the original ending to pander to fans. It’s a shame really, I had high hopes for Attack on Titan but a few big missteps crushed those. Regrettably I think Attack on Titan will be a story of what could have been instead of what was. \

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\
\"Sind sie das Essen? Nein, wir sind der Jäger!\"\
This German phrase, which roughly translates to \"Are you the prey? No, we are the hunters!\" Is a term that people who have watched this anime are all too familiar with by now. Attack on Titan (a.k.a. Shingeki no Kyojin) is to 2013 what Sword Art Online was to 2012; a show so hyped that you can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't at least heard of it. While I haven't finished watching SAO, I am well aware that the majority of people feel it was ruined by the hype. Does AoT fall\
          \
        into this same category, well, honestly, no. I don't think it does.\
Story: 8/10\
In an alternate universe, humanity has been nearly wiped out after the appearance of a new species of beast whose sole existence seems to be eradicating humans; the titans. Titans are massive, mysterious creatures whose origins, method of reproduction, and true motivations remain completely unknown to humanity. The humans have retreated into 3 circular walls that are large and strong enough to keep the Titans out, but for how long? \
AoT gets major props from me for creating the darkest, most convincing, most tragic war environment I've ever seen in a TV show. The sheer amount of suffering, physical trauma, psychological trauma, and portrayal of devastation is so horrible and disturbing that it is beautiful. If you like watching happy-go-lucky, feel-good anime, this show is NOT for you. Rule number one of watching AoT is to NEVER expect something good to happen. Doe it seem like something good is about to happen? Well, something bad is probably about to happen. \
AoT really manages to create an atmosphere where the viewer is viciously cheering for humanity to prevail, and that is no easy task. And of course, that just makes it all the more devastating when that character you were finally starting to like gets eaten. The storyline is extremely engrossing and interesting, but due to the fact that the story is incomplete (hopefully season 2 will be announced soon), I can't give it 10/10 or 9/10 in good taste, but AoT is very much a plot driven anime.\
Art: 9/10\
Very detailed and stylized. Style is something that is very hard to explain, but it fits the atmosphere perfectly. I loved the art.\
Sound: 10/10\
EPIC soundtrack. \"Epic\" is an overused word, but all you have to do is listen to the opening to know that this show is just EPIC! The voice acting is stellar as well.\
Characters: 7/10\
Seeing that this is an anime that is not finished, it makes sense that a lot of the character development is also unfinished, but the main characters are all intriguing. \
Eren, the protagonist, is headstrong and reckless, but also very compassionate. He has a fascinating and tragic backstory (that the show still hasn't completely told), and his internal struggle between either sacrificing his humanity for the good of his race or maintaining his humanity and saving every individual he can is very engrossing and one of the show's strong points. Eren is clearly a round character and I like him quite a bit.\
Mikasa is Eren's childhood friend, and to say Mikasa is protective of Eren is an understatement. She has no family left, so Eren is the only thing that keeps her going any more. She is by far the best fighter out of all the recruits and is a total badass when fighting. You can't not love Mikasa...\
Armin, also Eren's childhood friend,  is a frail boy who isn't much of a fighter, but possess great strategic intellect. He has proven to be one of the show's more dynamic characters as he breaks out of his shell as the anime goes on and realizes that he isn't as useless as he thinks he is.\
Levi is a BAMF. That's all you need to know.\
There are also tons of intriguing side-characters, but I wouldn't get too attached to them if I were you. NOBODY in this show is unkillable, except probably Mikasa.  Don't be surprised when a seemly major character gets eaten in the blink of an eye. AoT really keeps you on the edge of your seat in that regard. If the show was complete and the character's development was finished, characters would have likely gotten a 9/10 or 10/10.\
Overall: 8/10\
So far, AoT is the rare case of an anime living up to the hype. With an epic plot, complex characters, badass art style, and an epic soundtrack, AoT has the potential to be something really special, but lets wait for the end of the second season (which will totally be announced soon) and it's ending to draw any conclusions.\

    So, SnK. Undoubtedly the most popular show not just of spring and summer 2013, but of 2013 as a whole. You can't go on an anime related site and not see it, and it's very likely to pop up in discussion. Hyped to high hell by almost every anime fan out there. But does it deserve all the attention it gets?\
Story: 4/10\
The premise was great, and had me quite interested at the start. The idea of humanity fighting for their life against an unfathomable opponent who popped out of nowhere is quite interesting. But did the anime deliver? I'm afraid I'd have to say I\
          \
        was slightly disappointed. To start with, it damn interesting. Titans attack, mass panic, humans forced to retreat, great; Interesting. What wasn't so interesting were the episodes which followed.\
While the scenes with titans in them were intriguing, and at best enticing, everything in between seemed like filler. At one point I even recall the cast spending 3 entire episodes discussing moving a boulder, how to move a boulder, and the main character angsting over turning into a titan in order to move a boulder. I'm even partially expecting the OVA to be about the boulder.\
Art: 3/10\
I mean, come on. Am I really supposed to rate it higher than that? The animation and art in this show was incredibly lazy. The show was chock full of still shots, some of which lasted for over 5 seconds, and panning over motionless scenes, without the characters moving a muscle. A lot of powerpoint-tier animation in there as well. The character designs weren't terrible, but they definitely weren't marvelous either. I also am of the believe that the show's artists were having a contest to see who could make the most ridiculous looking titan, which, in all honestly, could be more entertaining than the plot progression of the show at times.\
Sound: 6/10\
No complaints here. I do feel like a few sound effects, like the titan-transformation, were repeated, however.\
Character: 4/10\
No one really stood out for me. The only character development I can note is if they were about to die, and in most cases they did, so they're dead anyway. Minus points for having a main character who's entire personality was REVENGE and I'M GONNA KILL THEM ALL, and a female lead who's motivation consisted of protecting the main character. Bonus points for Jean.\
Enjoyment: 6/10\
It's not all bad, I actually enjoyed the show a little, although it did annoy me at times when literally nothing was happening. But, I won't deny I found the show overall entertaining, but most definitely not on the level a lot people seem to. I'm honestly baffled by how this show became so popular as I can only fathom it as slightly above average at best.\
Well, that's all. Overall, I'd say that The Eotena Onslaught is a decent show, but don't go and watch it expecting a masterpiece.\

    Popular anime very rarely receive balanced reviews, which is a shame, because they often set themselves up for a balanced judgement. You either get people worshipping the ground that it would walk on if it hypothetically grew legs and start walking, or people throwing so much crap at it that it becomes in serious need of a shower. Shingeki no Kyojin is no different in this regard, but almost uniquely among recent mainstream titles it's actually deserving of much of the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, you can still expect a balanced review here. This certainly isn't the life-changing and complex masterpiece that\
          \
        many people will promise you, but neither is it as shallow and bland as a lot of shounen anime prove to be.\
When examining the story, it's best to get the flaws out of the way first. Shingeki no Kyojin is predictable. Very predictable. In fact, the final 2 arcs hinge upon an important mystery element, and if you haven't worked out the big twist almost immediately, then you must have already kissed your braincells goodbye. It certainly does have surprising elements, but when the progression of the plot becomes dependant upon a major story twist it starts to become a little obvious how things will turn out. A second key issue that the series suffers from is a lack of engagement around the mid-point. I'm talking about the \"Battle for Trost\" arc, when I simply found that I no longer felt emotionally invested in the story, nor did I particularly care about the conflicts of the characters. One suspects that this is a side effect of the conversion from manga to anime (though I can't be sure, as I have not read the manga). Shingeki no Kyojin tends to place a lot of dramatic flare on events but the action and development that take place in this arc were perhaps not entirely suited to the impactive stylistic elements that we witness, and it all starts to feel a tad inane.\
Now, it's important to note my use of the phrase \"impactive stylistic elements,\" because when I say that Shingeki no Kyojin has dramatic impact, I mean it. It might not be the most amazingly well-written anime in history, but it certainly ranks among the most absorbing as well as the most intense. It builds a rich and complex world with an interesting society and carefully crafted history. We see the structure of the military, the social class system and the lives and attitudes of various demographics clearly laid out before us even when they are not necessarily integral to the plot. It makes it believable, and that makes it absorbing, and this in turn can make it both gripping and powerful. When the action hits it's a cathartic experience, riddled with brutal violence alongside the typical OTT flash of the shounen genre. It looks good and it hits hard. When it slows down to prioritise drama, it generally feels personal and relevant (with the finest example being the finale of the \"Expedition\" arc). The characters do feel a little static unfortunately, but there's some nice development thrown in that hinges upon decent character conflicts and interesting backstories. At times however, it becomes apparent that several characters are forgotten throughout the course of the story, though it is entirely possible that a continuation will expand upon these unfortunate victims of limited season length.\
Highly stylised while still showcasing normal anime conventions, the art and animation are entirely deserving of all the praise they get. The animation has weight and the aesthetic is effective and unusual. At times, and most often when the show slows down, inconsistent character models become noticeable, but not to any concerning degree. And if we're talking sounds, then it's damned close to perfect. Fantastic musical score and great voice acting. Whatever you think of the story, you'd be wrong to call Shingeki no Kyojin anything other than a technical masterpiece.\
Not much else to say, so I'll leave you with this closing statement: watch it. Even if, like me, you tend to adopt the attitude that because many people lack critical judgement it means that most mainstream anime aren't as good as popular opinion might imply, at least be open-minded enough to appreciate the possibility that, just this once, the majority may be right.\

    *This is one of my first reviews, so let's see how I do, shall we?\
Attack on Titan, possibly this year's most popular anime.... and surprisingly, one of its worst as well. Although being immensely popular, Attack on Titan does not live up to the reputation that so many believe it does. Yes, the action and excitement are all very easily seen, yet the predictable/cliche story and the absolutely horrific characters makes this the SAO 2.0. In short, do not expect to be blown away by any means, in fact, prepare yourself for a rather emotional and boring ride that will make you wonder why you\
          \
        are still watching.\
 To begin with, let me clarify by saying that this won't be an extremely long review, as it has only been six episodes, but I will still mentions as many things as I can for now. \
Story: The story in AOT revolves around a world were humanity struggles to survive against giant, genital-less Titans. While the story is fresh and includes very nice aspects, the predictability of the story is insane. It is incredibly simple to point out what will happen and when it will happen, and there were almost no surprises that ever arose from watching. Also, the story has some very weak spots, but now it seems that most shows rely on intense action and gore rather than the simplistic aspect of continuity. Furthermore, the show focuses on the aspect of throwing a lot of blood around to make an attempt to affect the audience, when it actually fails to influence any sort of emotion to come forth. Thus, I give the story 6/10 for being good and new, but incredibly boring.\
Art: The art is actually one of the positive points in this mediocre anime, specifically when speaking about the Titan's ruthless smiles. Other than that, you have smooth action sequences and very gory scenes that couldn't have been more bloody. 9/10\
Sound: Opening's great. I don't approve of the ending though, and action sequence tracks are pretty good. 9/10\
Character: Now, AOT makes a fairly silly attempt to draw in their audience through rampant emotions, namely, Eren. Eren would be described in anime as: \"The Little Train that could.\" This emotional roller coaster of a character fails to use logic at any given moment, rather, Eren relies on iron strong determination that will somehow be able to physically harm these giant Titans.  He is more childish than any other character and has no actually talent. Yet, this boy will miraculously save humanity, you can bet on it. Furthermore, you have the useless Armin, the unnecessarily complicated Mikasa, the potato-eating, unneeded comedy relief in Sasha, and a whole gang of terrible characters that meet the bare minimum for supporting characters: being alive. Although, people have been able to turn away from these hideous creatures that are our characters, and focus on the \"fantastic story and action\" which doesn't exist. Overall: 2/10\
Enjoyment: If you watched Sword Art Online and loved it, it is merely because you enjoyed it, more so than critiqued it. AOT is the same. In terms of enjoyment, it is great, but in terms of critique, its flaws can be spotted everywhere. So ultimately, it is up to personal preference. While I want to say it will get a 9 for enjoyment, the utter disgust of watching the characters and cliche story makes me want to give it a 5, so 7/10.\
Overall: Attack on Titan fails to reach the standards that have been set for it. The story is rather cheesy, and the characters are a mess. AOT ultimately shows that an anime will not simply be great because it shows death and blood, rather, it needs a balance of characters, plot, and theme to get the job done. Hopefully, AOT becomes better, because right now, it deserves a 6/10. Nothing special, unless you are easily entertained by puerile attempts to become one of the great anime.\
I'll write another review for this after the season is over, but for now, AOT is a letdown.",

    Please read the Review first before marking it as “Helpful” or “Not Helpful” \
One thing I´ve been noticing in the past few years is that new anime releases are lacking on originality and a serious plot, so when Shingeki no Kyojin or if you prefer Attack on Titan first came out I had all sorts of mixed feelings towards it, but this feeling of relief was always present on me.  Attack on Titan is one of those anime that even non regular anime viewers praise, but does Titan lives up to all its Hype surrounding it or it just stays as Attack on Hypu?\
Setting/Plot:\
          \
        7.5\
I will try to not drag out for too much in this part even though Attack on Titan has a very big premise, when humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain because of what they refer as Titans who resemble giant people varying from 4m class to a big ass 60m class have putted humans at border of extinction. Now humans only option is to live cornered in this 3 gigantic walls Maria, Rose and Sina. This situation creates a lot of limitations for humans such as their resources and their live space. On a first look the plot doesn´t look that amazing or original, but it doesn´t just stop there as the majority of people think, no, the world of Attack on Titan is much bigger than that delivering complex themes such as new religions, monarchic government, new social ideals, etc.  \
So the anime follows Eren a kid that has always been curious of the outside world, he has always had this motivation to join the Scouting Legion, accompanying him there´s Mikasa and his friend Armin. When suddenly a Colossal Titan appears with what they call the Armor Titan breach over the walls that have protected them for their whole lives, letting minor titans enter the wall and start chaos, the outcome of this event had Eren seeing her mother get eaten by a Titan which starts Eren journey to obliterate the Titans!\
Art/Animation: 8.5\
I personally was a bit concerned with this at first; Attack on Titan was produced by Studio Wit. As a new studio it’s usual that they start with less ambitious projects and I was preoccupied if they could handle a promising show like Titan; they went totally beyond my expectations! \
Don´t get me wrong, it had decent animation, but when it needed to exceed their potential they did, that´s why SnK has God given action scenes! \
As it for the artstyle I can say it has a different aspect looking a bit more cartoonish than most of the anime, I´m not saying this is good or bad it just depends on your taste. Also this combined with a world filled with medieval atmosphere does work pretty well. The animation is one of the remarkable things about Titan, with this you can notice their high production value played a great part on the anime because if just help to deliver the viewers a more realistic environment to what´s happening. \
\
Soundtrack: 9\
You know that a soundtrack is good not just when it helps building up the atmosphere but when it becomes memorable, that is what attack on titan OST´s delivered to me. The OST does not reach the “eargasm” levels for me but it surely is one of the greats.  I also have to give them props for the voice casting, it just was right on spot with honorable mentions to Kamiya Hiroshi casting for Rivaille and Inoue Marina casting for Armin both with remarkable performances, being honest the whole cast has done an amazing performance!\
Characters: 7\
Now I come to the weakest part of the anime, I will just limit myself to talk about the main cast not because other characters are not important or I dislike them, is because anybody aside from the main cast of characters can die, even the coolest character if he´s not from the main cast he´s probably just there for the meat fest. This is really sad because there´s much more cooler characters the anime can focus on that don´t get that much screen time =(\
Eren Yeager: Eren is our lead protagonist in the series, starting out being a character with a great determination that also felt very cliché with this “I´ll swear vengeance “thing. Although he has a great determination he sometimes turns out to be useless at times, even though he has this special something inside him……. \
Mikasa Ackerman: Probably the best out of the three leads, Mikasa, is presented to us as a strong character not just physically but also emotionally. She also has this abnormal attachment towards the main lead Eren. She also takes part on some of the best scenes of the anime, just portraying how epic she can be.\
Armin Arlert: Last but not least we have Armin, which for me is the one who gains more development throughout the anime being from a total pussy to a mastermind who leads important operations for humanity.\
Enjoyment:9\
Attack on Titan surely shows some remarkable work in a lot of its categories, but still is not perfect as people claim it to be it does enough to keep you eager to know what will happen next! Attack on Titan does not lifts up to all its Hype but this doesn´t mean that it fails to do a remarkable and enjoyable anime!\

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is perhaps one of the most overrated shows I have seen. Don't get me wrong, it is well worth your time, it just has been overblown by fans whose previous anime experience is most likely limited to Naruto and Bleach. Naturally this is all my own opinion, and feel free to completely disregard it. \
Let me get one thing straight though, this show is an excellent gateway for people trying to get into anime. If you know someone who wants to get started then this is perfect. \
Right so the story and setting are as follows. In a\
          \
        world that resembles medieval Europe with little sprinkles of Steam Punk throughout, humanity has been forced to seclude itself in regions surrounded by heavily fortified and immense walls up to 50 meters high. Why you ask? To protect themselves from the Titans, giant docile humanoids that simply eat all humans they encounter and no one knows why. These Titans range in classes of  sizes with some being only 5 meters tall to the special types like the Colossal Titan who himself reaches up to 60 meters. \
So one average day where no trouble could possibly arrive from, the Colossal Titan and his friends the \"Armored Titan\" and the rest of the titan gang destroy the wall guarding our main protagonist Eren Jaeger's (pronounced \"Yaeger\") city and basically makes him have a bit of a difficult day to say the least. From here on he and his two friends Armin and Mikasa vow to destroy all Titans while they still live by join the military.\
While the story and setting are indeed very intriguing and keep the viewer guessing, they suffer from some pacing issues where something that seems to be important gets disregarded and other events drag on for a bit too long in my opinion. I watched the show as it aired and the animation studio behind it \"Studio Wit\" did a great job and ended each episode with a cliffhanger making the week between each episode a tense and one that could not go any faster. However, there were some times where these cliffhangers felt rather cheap as the next episode would quickly wrap up the issue within the first  minute or so. \
I have to give props to the manga writer Hamjime Isayama for creating such a fresh setting that really pulls away from traditional fantasy. The 3D maneuver  gear which the military use to fight titans are awesome gadgets that provide some of the best scenes in the show. Also the constant oppressive feeling that Attack on Titan delivers really succeeds in making you anxious about the future for this show. Hope always seems to cave in on itself. \
My main issue with Shingeki no Kyojin is its characters. Going on the internet one will see that many fans of the show compare it to \"Game of Thrones\" for the show's ruthlessness regarding character deaths. This is true and in my opinion is meant to commended, however for that to be effective, one needs to care about the people dying. In all honesty I couldn't give a damn about the characters in this show, none are in any way interesting or go outside the common stereotypes found in anime.\
 In the 25 or so episodes of the show, the characters and their motives don't change since the first 2. Even the three main characters can be summed in one sentence by the end of the show. Eren is pissed off and hates Titans cause they killed someone precious to him. Mikasa is obviously in love with Eren and wants to protect him. Finally Armin is a guy too scared to fight first hand but has excellent strategic plans. \
The other side characters are barely worth a mention, even Levi who all the fans seem to fantasize over for being \"badass\" is just a sadistic douche. Admittedly he does demonstrate some serious ass whooping skill in the show, and that I have to give credit for.\
Without naming anyone, a person dies fairly early on in the show and every other character kept going on about how they miss them and they shouldn't have died. Truth be told, I didn't even know who the hell they were till much later in the anime. \
I sincerely hope season 2 of Attack on Titan develops these characters more.\
Okay so enough hating on AoT for now, lets talk about the positives. Well for one, the art and animation. Studio Wit are a brand new studio whose first production is this show. I can only say that they must be comprised of artistic gods! The animation here is seriously the best I have ever seen in any anime. Many people complained about still shots being used during episode downtime particularly early in the show but Wit make up for it by delivering some of the most spectacular action scenes I have witnessed. There is something truly jaw dropping about seeing people zip around cityscapes in their 3D Maneuver Gear. I cannot compliment the animation and art in this anime enough.\
The music is also excellent. Composer Hiroyuki Sawano (also composed the soundtrack fro Kill la Kill) does an incredible job of emphasizing the setting with sombre and slow melodies accompanied by a some beautiful german singing to elevate the darker scenes in the show. Some pumping electronic sounds mixed with grand and epic choirs also get the hairs on your back standing for the more action heavy scenes. \
All in all Shingeki no Kyojin is well worth your watch. While I don't think the characters will find their own space in your heart (not with Eren's constant whining), I do believe you will have a great time with this show, especially is you are a lover of action. I myself am incredibly excited for season 2 and severely hope that they fix up some issues with the plot and characters then. \
If you are going to watch, avoid the manga spoilers like the plague! \
Thank you for your time.   \

    One thing I would like to say before anything else, don't believe the hype.\
Starting off with the story. I find this right here to be half and half. As far as the background and history shown, and the world that was created I think it's really good. I liked the idea of humanity living behind walls, drove to near extinction, finding the overall story of the world to be pretty original in anime. However, on the other side, as far as the actual, episode to episode, overall story of the season... I find it to be very lackluster. The show forces shock value down your\
          \
        throat, showing mass death almost every episode, to the point where it seems like the makers don't know how to tell the story without throwing genocide or murders in every other episode. Aside from the forced shock value; there is barely anything worthwhile that happens in the story for the first season. Not to mention most of the season is composed of two 8+ episode arcs, which are very drawn out. I could go into much deeper reasons, but don't want to spoil anything.\
The art style and sound are both pretty decent. I find the art style pretty unique, although when it comes to the sound, aside from the first opening of the series I find the remaining themes pretty generic. The first opening does pump you up and in my opinion blinds people into thinking the show is going to be \"super epic\".\
Now for the characters... I am not kidding when I say that the main characters in this series are complete crap. Eren is definitely the most boring main character, compared to a lot of others; I hated Sword Art Online but I thought even Kirito was more interesting than Eren. All Eren does is shout and preach, like he's the center of everything but has barely anything to back that up. And aside from his titan-related trait there's nothing else to him. I find Mikasa an empty character who only lives for Eren, who makes it seem like she can't even think for herself without him there. The only thing she has going for her is bad ass action scenes with her, which delude people into not looking past that and seeing a shallow character. And then there's Armin, who is a complete pussy and useless for the first 7-8 before he slowly starts becoming useful; most of the time he's shown he's either whining or showing how incompetent he is. He does get better down the road, and out of the three characters his is probably the best.\
Attack on Titan is apparently hailed as \"The Best anime of 2013\" and some going as far as saying \"The Best Anime Ever!\" When in reality, no. A lot of its' fans make it seem like that you have to fall head over heels for it, and act like if you think it's bad then you don't know what good anime is.\
Not saying this isn't a bad show, but I find it majorly flawed, and wish that more people would sit down and really think about this show before they praise it like they do. In my honest, serious opinion, I really am concerned about people who claim it to be the best anime of 2013.\

    First impression must be good. They always seems to be important because it sticks to memory and after that you'd want to keep going. I have observed this and know it to be true. This reality does not exempt the world of anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime so it stands to reason its first episode must have a big impact. And with its animators bringing the big guns, possessing marksman-like talents, their aim was true and definite. Literally, I was blown away. Nope, not the wrong expression there. Literally and I mean I was literally knocked off my seat at that first scene,\
          \
        to be more specific, that first scene where they were spinning to increase momentum and put weight in their blades. Yup. It stuck on me. That scene was real time and it should be that way. The more real the scene doesn't really mean it's going to be good, but it's sure as hell more frequent than not give a shock and impress its viewers. And the pauses. That slow mo button pushed at that exact moment to be the most awesomest (yes, I'm aware it's not a word. It seems it's most appropriate in this circumstance) action pose was just right. No more no less.\
I have known some that say they'd prefer a manga and not its adapted anime because it doesn't take much time, tickles your imagination, and it's just going to be the same if not changed in preference to the masses or make rushed endings. That last part I really hate. I think the time you'd spent is wasted if the ending turned out to be rotten like a century old apple. It stinks and viewers, I assumed wouldn't like a stink'n ending. This is just basing on the probability that a rushed ending makes a more likely bad stories. This is true to writers of books, to be precise those discovery writer types.\
== Story ==\
There is a tie in each episode. Since they follow the story line in the manga version, there is a continuous flow of scenes and like any other greats, there are always flaws, especially in a series. It lengthens. The words are long. Sometimes necessary and sometimes, to my opinion, not needed to say since it is so obvious. Like any young adult/middle grade types, the adults are useless. Well, apart from the main characters, pretty much all have no sense. The government, the citizens, some parents are made to be like babies that shows no common sense, making conflicts to our heroes in this post apocalyptic world where there is a desperate need of supplies and with monsters close at their fences, they become desperate, but of course, this exempt our heroes. No. They provide the sense like any other. But see. Here is the brilliant part. The writer created a grouping. The group where our heroes would end up is where its members would more like have the heart, compassion to its bros and sisters. \
I suspect there is still a second season. I hope. Since it's in demand, I assumed and the adapted manga is an ongoing magnificence. So the ending is not really the end of it. But, oh boy, that last bit. if you stay and watch at the last second, you'd get goosebumps. More so if you haven't read the manga.\
== Art ==\
I'll make this short. The art is just right. I have a feeling that this kind of style is destined for this series. But above all else, to me, it is the eyes that gives the most impression of all. In desperate situations, viewers would only look in the eyes to determine that deep despair that they most would likely feel when a 100 foot behemoth opens its jaws to swallow you whole. Or that hope for a faint chance that would get you out of that morbid situation. The eyes was a definite factor to me. It's not like those anime that gives importance to style so don't be expect'n one. Even without the hairstyle and fancy clothing, I always seem to identify them. Hinting that there is a faint difference on their noses, mouths, shape of faces, hair, and height, viewers is less likely to be lost.\
== Sound ==\
Without fail, among almost all of its cohorts, this anime has good soundtracks. Though I have a little qualm in this regard. When there are monsters chasing you or some-like situations, it is normal, even expected to shout till your throats spasm. What I didn't understand is why would a person shout so loud when explaining his/her ideals, or wants, that to my impression, seems like a sound of being tortured, talking to their torturers. It was unreal. This instance happens a lot. Perhaps, I think more likely, it is to impose the emotion of the character. Less is more and this happens if it is within the bounds of common sense. My message to writers/directors. Go beyond the tradition, the accepted. More likely than not, the unpredictable and the new will impress, especially in the entertainment business.\
== Character ==\
The hero is rash, stupid, and a hard-worker. He is determined. To avenge and rid their world with these giant parasites. He had a hard life, among almost all of the characters in this series, but even that, he has retained his humanity. He would save and be important like any other main character in any series would be.\
The girl who follows the hero around (TGWFTHA.. hehe.. I just remembered, her name is Mikasa) is quiet. Silent but deadly. A talented girl that is most effective in killing not only the monsters, but any other living thing that inhabits their world. She pledged to stay and protects the hero, since sometimes, he is irritating and stupid. There are many other strong women that is focused in this series, a sure way to aim for all viewers.\
As the story moves in an exhilarating but sometimes boring phase, both would grow. They would change as their environments change. \
== Enjoyment ==\
Though the ingredients are just right to create that addictive taste, I was kind of hoping for a bit of romance between the characters. Not only from the change of pace of death/hopelessness, but also for an even more interesting interaction between them. Sure there are hints in it but come on, most viewers are teenagers. And when I say hints, from what I remember, I believe it is more singular. Hint. And even that, it was barely noticeable. \
It's kind of like a Jurassic park, being that the characters are always chased, more or less, but instead of running for their lives, our heroes are running to fight. 'Tis memorable since without a doubt, the series is at the top of my list.",

    Before I actually write this review I ought to confess that I'm a humongous fan of the series and might be slightly biased.... \
Story:\
In the very first episode you get a false sense of being eased into this world nice and slow - getting informed of the characters' situation and a quick introduction, but before you know it a plot twist slaps you across the face so hard you can feel through the season both directly and indirectly. \
And about the plot - its somewhat simple yet eternally fascinating and intricate - ever evolving, you never know everything and it's certainly unpredictable to a frustrating\
          \
        extend, you never feel safe for the characters.\
It's not a cosy story, even though there are somewhat tender moments, this is a violent shounen and one of the very best, action packed and in your face. The plot is amazing.\
Art:\
The art is fantastic. The way the characters fly through the air and slice through their enemies is animated beautifully despite the gory nature of it. Of course these are the scenes that have been prioritised there are the ones that are less important visually where background characters etc, might look slightly funny, but it isn't really important or noticible. The scenes that you take not of and truly remember are remembered for their gorgeous animation.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack is amazing and fits the series so darn well. \
The German bit of the opening is so appropriate considering there is a rather large chance that the characters might be in Europe (where Germany takes up quite a large chunk, so who knows ?) and it gets you so pumped for the plentiful action scenes. It really sets the mood very well throughout the series, so well that it feels completely natural to hear the orchestra blasting along the soldiers flying through the thick woods.\
The japanese voice actors are quite suitable for the characters too, I've enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and listened to it more often than I'd like to admit. \
Character:\
All the characters are so different and diverse, from Marco to Erwin, Levi to Hanji and Eren to Bert etc. It is so wonderful to get to know all of them, slowly fall in love with them and watch their loved ones die around them and fear for their lives too. Each character is completely unique and the characters are one of the best strong points of the series.\
To begin with I wasn't sure how I felt about them all, but after about one or two episodes with them each I fell head over heels. The character gallery is wide too, including lots of varied and strong women, though unfortunaly there is a lack of POC, an uncomfortable trend in anime. However some people view some of the characters somewhat stereotypical, I think that's only a first impression sorta thing, dig a little deeper and you'll find them all to be truly unique. Their enteractions are also precious.\
Enoyment:\
I've rewatched the series four times in the last three months and I plan to continue rewatching it again and again untill the new season comes out in 27 years. I enjoyed every bit of it.\
Overall:\
I enjoyed every bit of it. Love it.\
All the different components play well together and makes for an excellent show, very recommendable !\

    This is an anime I at times loved and others hated.\
It has a great sense of timing, there's some fantastic \"OH SHIT!\" moments and it's not afraid to just dump all over the middle of someone's power of friendship speech. Whenever this anime is about the titans it's a really good anime, the sheer unstoppable force of them combined with the mystery of who or what they are and how they came to be carries the anime forward.\
Unfortunately the writing is dire. Absolutely dire. In episode 4 the writers actually have a character tell us what the personality traits of the characters are. That's right,\
          \
        they've done such a terrible job of getting this across that they just come out and tell us. You're so uninterested in the fates of most of these people because the anime spends no time building them up or ensuring you get to know them, and the action is less because of it.\
It also suffers from endless internal monologues. The writers will just not shut up and show us something, they need to have someone sit on screen for three times as long as necessary and think it at us. In one scene one character monologues about how another is pale and breathing hard. It's insulting. It's a goddamn visual medium but rather than show us these things the writers vomit their awful dialogue all over everything.\
Unfortunately this bad writing takes its toll and the anime rather jumps the shark around episode 10. An intriguing ride up until then though, with some moments good enough to compensate for the writing.\

    Well, I bought into the hype. This show lives up to it.\
Story: The world in this anime is amazing. A weird Middle Ages-type world, weird humanoid things running around eating people, weird cord-type devices used to move around like Spiderman? It's immersive from the start. The explicit material is insane and puts you on the edge of your seat--I gasped plenty times throughout the show, just for how brutal and insane the gore was. Also, this anime deals with an extremely mature storyline that seems to come out of left field (**SPOILER:** Mikasa's backstory), which I thought was a nice touch. Every episode of this\
          \
        show is completely interesting--perfect for a binge watch, though it moves kind of slowly towards the end. The underlying themes of corruption brought into this show at the end, which will (probably) be expanded on next season, made the show just that more interesting to me. Only one bad note--the military formation stuff got really confusing to me, but without going back to try to understand much of it I could still decipher what was going on.\
Characters: The characters in this show are mostly one-note and can be identified by one or two characteristics that they stick to in each episode: Eren is determined, Mikasa likes to save Eren a lot, says \"EREN!\" all the time, and is badass, Sasha likes food and is nervous, etc. I don't think this anime really *needs* a ton of character development, THERE ARE GIANT SKINNED HUMANOIDS EATING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. This is a story-driven anime, though I will admit if there were complex characters it would push a wonderful anime into \"best anime I've ever seen\" territory.\
Overall: Immersive story, gore and twists that will make you gasp and/or scream expletives at the top of your lungs, but one-note characters and some slow episodes.\

    This is by far the most overhyped anime I have ever seen. Before you fanboys attack me, overhyped anime does not mean it's a bad anime. It means fans exaggerated the status and quality of the anime by saying \"Greatest Anime Ever\" which is not. I admit, I love the show but it's not the greatest anime in existence. \
(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\
\
Story: (8/10) (SPOILERS)\
The story focuses on Eren and Mikasa as they witnessed a colossal Titan appear out of nowhere and started attacking the walls. The walls that have kept them safe for over a hundred years have now been\
          \
        breached and smaller Titans have flooded the city and started attacking the humans. \
Now here's the reasons why I love the show. My first reason and very top reason is the fact that this is set in the post-apocalyptic world, where humans (mostly the Scout Regiment) are fighting the Titans and trying to bring their world back. Secondly, it's not just a simple \"Humans are defending against the Titans\" concept. Who knew there would also be humans who can also transfer into a Titan. That Human Titan can either help the human race or obliterate the human race. It makes the show even more exciting to watch. My third and final reason is the fact that the show is not afraid to kill off characters. I mean it had a few cliches were someone will save that character from being eaten but for the most part, you know that they're going to die and they're not coming back. \
Now, the story pacing. Some might disagree with me on this but to me, it's messed up. The first 5 episodes, it was jumping around in years then later on, the pacing was normal, then the pacing went incredibly slow. By the way, I don't mind the time skips at the first 5 episodes because I understand that they were showing us (the viewers) how Eren is going to become a part of the military. Anyways, here's my problem with the story pacing. The 1st half seemed like a normal pacing to me. The 2nd half, however had the worst story pacing I've ever seen. It's too slow and it dragged on forever. The objective was to go to Eren's basement but it somehow turned into a Female Titan interrupting that plan for no apparent reason and this is where it dragged on until the ending. Why did she do that? I have no idea and this is where I'll switch subjects and talk about the plot holes. \
The show has a lot of plot holes and I'll give out a few of those plot holes. Where exactly did the Titans come from? How were they born? How did Eren's dad developed that \"Titan\" syringe and why did he give it to him?  How and why did Annie had the capability to transform into a Titan? If my theory is right, is the Colossal and Armoured Titans humans too? And so much more that I can't list them here. They better fill them plot holes at the 2nd season. Let's get back to the slow pacing shall we? I don't mind slow story pacing but if the show is not going to reward you with the knowledge that you gathered then you might as well not make the pacing slow. What are my thoughts about the ending? It was rushed, it ended in a cliffhanger and I was a bit disappointed. How about the plot twists? Yea, the show failed on this one. It was very predictable. One example is when Eren \"died\". I already knew that he didn't die because what show would kill off its main character very early in the series right?. Another example is when a mysterious Titan saves Mikasa and fights another Titan. I already knew it was Eren because of the hair and it's the only logical choice I have. Want another example? How about the Female Titan? I knew it was a human because she showed intelligence but who? I thought it was either Mikasa or Annie. I saw Mikaka fighting one of the Titans and my only choice would be Annie. When they revealed her true identity. I was like \"Wow, what a surprise\" with a sarcastic voice. \
\
Art/Animation: (9/10)\
The animation is very well done. The way they animated the action scenes, it  was great. It's very fluid. Especially when they use the ODM gears. Better than Spiderman. The character designs were also well done with some few minor flaws. How about the Titans design? My god, whoever designed the Titans, give this man/woman a medal. The first time I saw them, they were batshit creepy. \
\
Sound: (10/10)\
No doubt, a perfect score from me. Why? The music used in the fighting scenes are so well done. Both the openings are very well done. The 1st OP is awesome and the 2nd OP is great. I still prefer the 1st OP though. The 2nd OP did depressed me quite a bit. You'll know later on in the review.  The voice actors. I watched the show in English Dub so I have no idea how these characters sounds like in Japanese. One word. Masterpiece. Eren's VA which is Bryce (who also voiced Kirito from SAO) is so good. The way he screamed in agonizing pain, the way he shouts out of anger, perfect. I don't know who voiced Mikasa but great job to whoever voiced her. It perfectly fitted her character.\
\
Character: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\
This is where the show kind of failed. As much as I loved the characters, there was a lack of character development. Eren stayed the same and Mikasa stayed the same. You know what, pretty much most of the characters stayed the same. Some of the characters were bland (not all) and some of characters are clichèd. Some fanboys might think that I hated the characters because I rated the character section 7 but I don't. I DON'T hate the characters because they were interesting to me. Like I said above, the show is not afraid to kill off it's characters. Most of the time, I would be shocked (only for the first 10 episodes) because one of the characters that had the potential to become my favorite character gets killed off. There is at one point where a set of characters from Levi's Elite Scout Regiment (Eld, Gunther, Levi, Olou, and Petra)got killed off by the Female Titan (Levi wasn't killed). Now, this is the point where I got depressed and felt sad for the whole day because they were the best group I have ever seen. I don't care if the Titans kills some of the characters because they're a bunch of cowards but these guys......why?\
\
Enjoyment: (10/10)\
After watching the first 8 episodes of the series, I already know I'm going to rate my Enjoyment a perfect score of 10. I was always on the edge of my seat every single episode and I never felt bored(except the ending). Everytime I see the \"To be continued\" screen, I'm like \"Noooo!!!\".\
\
Overall: (8.8/10) ----Rounding it to--(9/10)\
Like I said above, this is the most overhyped anime I've ever seen. People were telling me \"This is the best anime ever\" or \"Best anime in existence\". I can't believe I believed these people. Sure, I love the show but there is no way in hell this is the \"Best Anime in Existence\". I still recommend that you watch this show because it's jam packed with action and some emotional scenes but please, don't believe the hype like I did. Now my thoughts about this anime. The 1st half is perfect but the 2nd half.....I was a bit dissapointed because it dragged out for way too long and they never really achieved their goal.\
\
Pros:\
-Great Story\
-Great Animation\
-Perfect Soundtrack\
-Emotional scenes can sometimes hit you\
-You're always on the edge of your seat \
\
Cons:\
-Little to no character development\
-Bland and cliched characters (not all)\
-2nd half's pacing is way too slow\
-A lot of plot holes",

    Just like a lot of people I suppose, I watched SNK to see what's the big deal about, as it wasn't in my list that season. \
It starts out with the shock factor. I thought, even though this isn't my kind of thing, I could maybe watch it for the suspense. But then it got into long cycles of boring and in my opinion, poorly executed character development scenes. As far as the story is concerned, I wouldn't say it's the most complex or sophisticated one, but they played the suspense/shock card very well, and it is something that can obviously attract a lot of\
          \
        people.\
This anime has very well crafted action scenes. However, because of that, most of the other scenes are poorly animated, to the extent where it looks like a student's flash animation project at times. Even putting that aside, I think the style of the animation as a whole is not particularly creative.\
It is obvious why SNK is so popular, but it doesn't do it for me. I would say it's too much style over substance, and not meaning the animation style.\

    If you are looking for a light-hearted, revolving around boobs, sugar coated anime. Fuck off. This is one of the most harsh animes I have seen in a while. People you are introduced to are slaughtered, and these \"Titans\" are pure evil. From the first episode the Eren (Main Character) was traumatized by the giants, he has been acting purely out of guts and vengeance. Everyone fears the Titans and almost all run from them even if they are soldiers. Eren is an exception, his vow is to kill all titans and reclaim the world for the people. He has no natural talent but he\
          \
        survives sheerly off of determination and remorse. If you want to watch a badass gorey anime, look no further. The fighting system in this anime is extremely clever and original, I have never seen anything like it. It's no simple sword, gun, or magic anime; these people use technology like no other to fight the giants, although they must be skilled with the equipment. The animations are great, the art is different but not in a bad way, after one episode of this anime I grew attached to the main character, and every ending of an episode makes me want to watch the next episode more than the last one. Overall, this anime is probably the greatest i've watched in a long time, IMO this is better than SAO already(SAO was amazing).\

    The best way I can think of describing my experience with this show is that I found it profoundly uninteresting. So much so that I find myself in a position of being genuinely unable to understand why it is so well regarded. Which is unusual for me - I can usually understand the appeal of something even if I don't care for it myself.\
Perhaps the biggest issue that I find with it is that the cast consists largely of shallow stock characters. For me this is what really kills the anime, I think. I just couldn't find it in myself to care about anything that\
          \
        happened because of them. This wouldn't necessarily completely sink an anime on its own, though it would have to have some pretty significant strengths in other areas to make up for it, and Attack on Titan doesn't seem to have any. The story of a young man being given responsibility over the fate of mankind due to a plot contrivance giving him sole access to or rare talent in some kind of great power is a very common one in anime, and within the first season this show does very little to mix it up at all. The tone is pretty consistently bleak, with levity being rare and unfortunately rather poorly implemented when it does appear, but for an anime that's so lacking in depth or original thought this just serves to make it even more boring. \
Its being so depthless and unoriginal is exactly why I find it difficult to understand why people are so interested in it. What about this show makes it apparently so much better than the mountain of other anime that have used the exact some concept and used it, to my mind, just as well? I suppose it could be the fight scenes, which are fine, though not particularly noteworthy if you ask me. Or perhaps the consistency of tone, which is honestly rare in anime and consequently kind of refreshing even if it doesn't really help the show much. But then I guess that the reason I'm writing this is because I don't know why this show is popular, so I certainly don't have any confidence in either of those guesses. If you enjoyed this show, don't hesitate to tell me what you thought was good about it. I'm honestly interested to know. For now though, I'm scoring it a five out of ten - I'm completely apathetic toward it. Because it does nothing at all unusual it can neither be said to be at all good or really at all bad. It's just mediocre, which when you get down to it is really the worst thing to be. I certainly don't intend to watch any future episodes of this anime.\

    Neon Attack Genesis on Evangelion Titan, or “Our Lawyers Made Us Change The Name of This Show So We Wouldn’t Get Sued”\
A deconstruction.\
Preface:\
You see, a guy named William Shakesman once said, “brevity is the soul of wit”, so I’m not going to waste anybody’s time with a garbage two sentence “OMG THIS IS THE BEST ANIMU EVAR I HEART EREN SO MUCH 10/10 EVERYTHING” review.\
Nope, you fanboys want the truth? You can’t handle the truth. But I’m gonna lay it out here for you anyway. \
I’m going to break this thing down into three parts. The “tropes lifted from every zombie media Setting”, the “cliché\
          \
        Characters”, and the “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling”. \
-----\
The Trope Filled, Every Zombie Media Setting\
A while back, monstrous humanoid giants hell-bent on destroying humans struck. All but a few thousand humans were wiped out, waging a futile war against an enemy they neither understood, nor knew how to fight. Present day, there's one human settlement left, protected by three 50m high concentric walls, the largest among them 300 miles across, making it about the size of Germany. \
Okay so, a little more info on these human killing giants, right? Because that was pretty vague. They have 3 qualities. \
1)\9They kill and eat humans. They do not need to eat humans for sustenance, they just do it because the plot demands it of them\
2)\9Nobody knows where they came from, or why, and it doesn’t matter. I’m sure there will be some BS pseudo-scientific explanation for their existence later, because these type of shows ALWAYS take one of three paths: \
-----\
1.\9Scientists did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It’s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that’ll fool the teen demographic\
2.\9A Wild Virus Appeared! Some mutated microbe that’s unaffected by any drug affects all but some small number of populace who, by plot convenience, don’t contract the illness\
3.\9Who the hell cares! Zombies are here and we have to shoot, maim, kill, and destroy them to survive! \
-----\
4)\9They are notoriously hard to kill… you can hack and slash on them all day long and they’ll still swat you like flies. *whispers* wait, I’m getting some breaking news. You can KILL them by attacking the neck/head area, just like some other TV shows and movies involving the undead… hmmmmm\
Titans are just zombies. Face the facts. This is a zombie show. It premiered during the height of zombie craze, and through shrewd marketing and an impeccable sense of timing, a hit was born. Did it have to be substantive? Heck no, all it had to do was prey on these little fragile children’s emotions and “OH MY FEEEELZ” by killing off a few characters that we still know nothing about, nor formed any attachment to, along with throwing in a Gary Stu blank slate of a main character onto which these angsty teens can project themselves. \
-----\
The Stupid Setting Part II\
Oh wait, did I say Germany? It’s plainly obvious that AOT is ripping off any and everything late medieval German Gothic and Renaissance styled architecture. Oh, and if the names and races of the characters didn’t give it away, I don’t know what would. Eren Jäger? Braun? Bertolt? Kirstein? Zoe Hänge? Also, it’s quite amazing how these characters all speak fluent Japanese, given that they’re all, except our token Asian character, Mikasa, German. Now wouldn’t that be an innovative anime- one with Deutsch spoken and subtitled in Japanese? \
Now that I’ve started listing names, it’s time to get to the \
-----\
Cliché Characters Section! \
We've got the not-so-subtly named main character Eren I'm-Going-Kill-Titans-Don't-Tell-Me-What-To-Do-You're-Not-My-Dad Jäger, who's hell-bent on the destruction of the oppressive titans who show up to wreck his life... talk about teen angst, sheesh. Eren’s sole means of expressing himself in this show is “GRRRRUUUAAAAHHHH I hate titans I’m going to kill them all!!! (in order to keep X tragedy from happening again, because remember kids, NO shonen protagonist is complete without family tragedy!)” \
Wait, where have we heard this before? What’s that? Every shonen series ever? \
Let’s take a small cut from the block of trope that makes up the shonen genre, shall we?\
Rin Okumura: “I’M GOING TO KILL EVERY DEMON, AND SATAN TO SAVE MY BROTHER!”\
Kazuto Kirigaya: “I’M GOING TO KILL ALL THE BADDIES TO SAVE MY FRIENDS!”\
Ed/Al Elric: “WE’RE GOING TO KILL ALL THE HOMUNCULI AND SAVE EVERYONE!”\
Shiro Emiya: “I’m not going to kill anyone, but I will SAVE EVERYONE!”\
Ken Kaneki agrees with Shiro, and they meet up with Shinji Ikari to hide. \
-----\
Mikasa My-Plot-Armor-Is-Stronk-But-My-Sword-Arm-Is-Stronger Ackermann is our leading lady. She personifies the Silent Strong type. She only says two lines in the whole show: “Eren you idiot, I always have to save you because you’re the main character and you can’t die!”\
And “Why did I sign up for this job, again?”\
-----\
Rounding out our trio, we have He-Man's midget brother, Armin I-Use-My-Mind-Not-My-Muscles Arlert. He’s also hiding out with Shinji and Ken.\
When someone dies in this show, it’s like watching someone kick a little puppy. They show you some little scene about the character and their life before, and how they’re never going to go home to hug mom and their fish are going to starve now because they’re not going to be around to feed them. We never get any attachment to characters who die because they’re never given enough screentime to be relevant, or anyone we should care about. Of course, nobody that matters to the plot dies, either. \
-----\
\
Just when you thought this was about to get into some “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling!”, HERE COMES THE “Circuitous, Shonen Storytelling!”\
Attack on Titan isn’t a 700 episode series like Detective Conan or One Piece… yet. With this pace though, and the ever intangible, nebulous goal (straight ripping off the fantastic David Fincher movie, “Se7en”) of “WHAT’S IN THE BASEMENT, MANNNN?” Otaku on Titan takes a turn for the molasses. \
When it isn't taking a 3 episode sabbatical of dialogue (in typical shonen fashion), the show does move pretty quickly… to boredom. If you’re not getting angsty teens shouting at each other over why they have to kill stuff, or that they don’t want to do it anymore, or crying over their lives; it’s them killing stuff, then crying about their lives. \
I didn’t forget to remember to mention that AOT is just a cheap ripoff of Neon Genesis Evangelion, did I?\
Plot basics: \
1)\9Humanity fights an enemy it doesn’t understand, is whittled down to a tiny populace, and is poorly equipped to handle the threat, until one day… A HERO EMERGES!\
2)\9Hero has daddy problems. Hero’s female sidekick(s) also have parent problems\
3)\9Hero loses loved ones which causes them to have to fight, even if they don’t want to\
4)\9Conspiracy!\
-----\
Here it is. I committed the ultimate sin and rated the beloved Attack on Titan a 5. \"Why? why would you do this, LawlMartz?\" \"Why would you give Shingeki no Kyojin a paltry 5 and not the 10 it so effortlessly achieved and deserves??\" they ask me. To this, my answer is simple. “Children, Attack on Titan is like any movie made by Marvel/Disney recently- sure, it's fun, it looks nice, and the masses love it, but at the end of the day, you didn’t see anything new and it didn’t leave a lasting impression on you, other than how immensely angsty it was.”\
Attack on Titan is honestly just too vanilla to really hate. It borrows from countless other shonen before it, and puts all the tropes in one pot, and comes out the anime equivalent of a hot dog… pretty good if you have no expectations or never had one before… but then you want something better afterwards.\
Let’s just call it Otaku on Titan and call it a day. \

    \"Attack on Titan? Overrated!\" or \"Shingeki no Kyojin? More like crap!\" Do your friends say that? Mine do. Words can't describe how much I hate them for it. This anime is a masterpiece, and anyone who tells you otherwise either hasn't seen it or \"saw it\" but really wasn't paying attention. Now all I have to do is convince you to start.\

STORY: 10/10\
The story is quite simple actually. Predators called the titans have exterminated the human race and the rest have moved behind walls in order to survive. The human protagonist is curious about what is outside the walls, and someday wishes to go there.\
          \
        One day, a colossal titan knocks down the wall and he realizes what a cruel reality is. So he joins the army to help exterminate these monsters. All is going well, or not well, because humanity is being pushed farther and farther into the walls. THEN THE PLOT TWIST HAPPENED. No spoilers, but if you were caught off guard like I was, you know what I mean. Then, just as you think everything is going to go well there is ANOTHER ONE! The story is epic and was fairly original at the time, but those plot twists brought it up to a 10.\
__________________________________________________________________________\
ART: 10/10\
Not only is the animation crisp and impressive, the drawing style is very bold and stands out compared to your average anime, on top of fitting the dark atmosphere. I have no complaints.\
__________________________________________________________________________\
SOUND: 10/10\
The voice acting is outstanding, and it truly brings the characters to life. The music is literally flawless, besides unmemorable ending songs. The rest far outweighs that though.\
__________________________________________________________________________\
CHARACTER: 7/10\
The characters are the one spot where this anime isn't outstanding. I don't mean the characters themselves though, they have done nothing wrong. All unique and memorable...ish. Well kind of memorable. It's not their fault they were born bland. I mean, I get where you're coming from, and it definitely makes it more epic with out long pink hair everywhere. But the characters are stuck with 4, maybe 5 at maximum different hair colors, and they all have similar styles. Sure, you can tell them apart, but nothing makes them stand out, and you will probably only remember the three main characters and fan-favorite captain Levi.\
__________________________________________________________________________\
OVERALL: 9/10\
It's really too bad the characters weren't memorable, that's not something you can fix with season 2. However, I still eagerly await a sequel to this great show!\

    When I look at the rankings of this anime, I am quite surprised. I was almost certain based on the praising reviews that was going to be a great anime revival show. I thought wrong.\
Highlights:\
START: extremely strong start, such a powerful first episode that immediately drew me into the show.\
PRODUCTION: very well done, no question about it. If there is something good to say about Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin it is certainly the animation, music and sound. Crisp and perfect. The animation has entirely no flaws, and the background settings are gorgeously animated. The music was another great aspect of the show, setting the\
          \
        correct tone at all times.\
Lowlights:\
CHARACTERS: super cliche, especially the main three characters: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. The reason that they are cliche is because all they do the entire show is talk about how much they want to eliminate the Titans, not how they would do it, but merely that they were going to with no possible ideas of how. Another thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was instead of cooperating and working out tactics of eliminating Titans, all I could notice about the conversations were that it seemed just like a “who can wear out their voice enough until they can’t talk trash about the enemy any longer” contest.\
FOCUS: based on the ending of the series, I came to the conclusion that the first 15 or so episodes were a pointless plot. There was a new goal to accomplish after the first 15 or so episodes, and that was what remained entirely in the show.\
PACING: slower than a three-toed-sloth. I could not watch full episodes at times because it got so repetitive and boring.\
MORALS: the show has no message, unless you count “when you get invaded by giant stupid naked people, fight back.” The show pretty much seemed very anti-peace, even at the end.\
So if you want to see a highly produced show, go for Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin. However, if you are destined to watch an anime with greatly developed characters and a pointful plot, I wouldn’t recommend this one.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, the anime that has brought forth a new wave of anime fans and stormed the anime world when it debuted in spring of 2013. An anime that was quickly subbed and added to Netflix after it's airing, that has gained the attention of thousands of people who normally do not watch anime. It has sold extremely well in Japan and the manga has profited well in the States as well. This must mean the series is something revolutionary and a game changer for all anime after it correct? After all it can't all be hype, there has to be some serious substance\
          \
        behind all of this right?\
Most fans will tell you off the bat that it is not like other series, that it is heavily violent, shocking, and sometimes horrifying. That it is a world full of interesting characters and sudden death at every turn. And all of that is true...for the first five episodes. After an introductory which I would say is worthy of the praise it gets, the series seems to fall apart extremely quickly and after it's smash beginning has so substance left to support itself afterwards. \
I'll spare a summary of the story as it's almost hard not to know what the story is about by this point. I'll give you my thoughts on it in one word: Horrendous. To call the story mediocre would be too much praise. Out of the three main characters only one stands out as anything special, that being the character of Armin Arlert. However as interesting as he is compared to his two other mains, he is given significantly less time on screen to showcase this than the other two. The characters of Eren and Mikasa are without a doubt two of the worst characters ever conceived in any work of fiction. I would attempt to discuss their personalities but there is little to nothing to discuss. A standard cardboard box has more depth to it than those two, and would probably make a better lead character as well.\
Ignoring the horrific set of main characters, the supporting cast is dotted with traces of what could be interesting characters, but there is never enough time given to them to let that shine through. They glimmer with hope that Isayama's writing could be something other than pathetic and are one of the only things keeping SnK afloat in an ocean of fecal matter. \
The story itself must have been written by a fourth grader at best. The \"plot twists\" (even calling them that is a stretch) and sudden character death are all presented in such a shallow way it is often hard to care about any character that dies or any new plot development (hint: there are none, the manga is good at one thing and that is providing hundreds of questions and not a single answer). The entire pacing of the series itself is some of the worst I have had the displeasure of experiencing in years. The plot itself goes from moving at a sluggish pace and solving nothing, to a break neck speed where a character is introduced one chapter only to be killed off in the next one. \
The art and animation jump between not bad and hard to even look at. The character designs suffer an often same-face syndrome worse than Araki's recent style and excluding background shots, the art is subpar at most and there is much more to be expected from a studio like IG Production. Their is a constant reuse of animations and scenes to such an extent that anyone would has this displeasure of watching more than one episode in a day would find incredibly bothersome. Reusing an animation once or twice is forgivable and almost expected, but to the extent they are reused in SnK there is absolutely no excuse.\
The sound design is the only thing I can find hard to complain about, in a series where everything is so awful it is hard to even say something comforting about one of it's only good points. Which is an absolute shame as I can say the OST is probably the only thing to ever get from the anime at all.\
My final verdict on SnK will be a series of questions to ask yourself before watching it. Do you enjoy awful characters that have no depth and lack the personality of even a desk chair? Do you enjoy wallowing in absolute shit? Do you have any other reason to watch this other than to laugh at how utterly irredeemable it is? There is not a single good thing to say about the series other than that the first few episodes are \"not bad\", apart from that it would hurt to attempt to say anything good about this series.\
If you still believe you should watch this show, may God have mercy on your soul, for you are going to need it. \

    Attack on titan\
Story- The story follows humanity’s struggle of survival as it hides behind the safety of 50 metre high walls that has protected them from anthropoid beings known as titans for over 100 years. These titans are mysterious in origin and are massive in size. Their only goal is to kill humanity for seemingly no reason. After 100 years of peace, a breach in the outer of the 3 walls caused by a mysterious, previously unseen 60 metre tall titan pushes humanity to a desperate situation. \
We thus follow the story of 3 teenagers, Eren, Armin and Mikasa and how they fit into this\
          \
        chaos. The first few episodes provide the viewer with an entirely new experience that will shock and change all you will naturally expect from an anime. \
The first 7 episodes were pretty much the longest Holy shit!!! moments from what I have currently seen from an intro. But after this initial promise, the actual story unravels.\
 Once everything settles down, the pace slows right down, the standard array of stereotypical characters are all introduced in 5 minutes and the story no longer develops. Humanity must kill the titans! Yup. That’s pretty much it. The very nature of the enemy limits the story to just that, the titans can’t talk, they have no morals. So all this anime can ever be is how Eren kills the titans. This is so unbelievably one dimensional it’s a joke. With only one end goal, there can only be a series of extremely predictable single battles against the titans. And all of these suffer some serious pace issues. In the middle of a fight, the anime would stop to hear everyone’s opinions. Or it would decide to watch countless flashbacks of traumatic family events. With the clear attraction of attack on titan being on the action, why bother showing this after we are all so pumped up?\
 I have also read the supposed ending of the attack on titan anime series. My armpit has more creativity than that. Message me if you want the details. 4\
Art- this section is the most controversial in my books. Whilst the artwork is undoubtedly superb, i.e. the fight scenes and the environments, the underlying language of the artwork is flawed. Attack on titan is, as far as anime can be, very gory. People’s heads and limbs are flying everywhere. But fighting these grotesque beings are a group of 3 teenagers (of which Armin is apparently a boy) who all look like they’ve just worked out how to use a toilet. It’s like watching ash ketchum go ‘fuck you charizard!’ and watch him proceed to break his neck. It’s confusing. The design of the titans are, maybe intentionally, grotesque. But I am sure that there are better design potentials here. I’m pretty sure I saw Nicholas cage as one of the titans. 6\
Sound- the soundtrack is amazing. Suitably epic and upbeat. But there is no other dimensional quality to the soundtrack. Even when the main character’s mum dies, an epic fight song is playing. The anime needs to learn, even in an action led story, more than action can exist. The beauty of friendships are poorly conveyed through the music for example.  The voice acting is the most over the top voice acting I have ever witnessed. It’s not, ‘can you pass me the water’, its ‘ (with lines and explosions encircling the character) I have failed you mother!!! I need the water to save my friends and to kill the titans!!!!!! Calm your tits already. Blimey. 7\
Characters- defiantly not the strong point of attack on titan. The main character literally just wants to kill all titans to avenge his mother. A far more powerful character, Mikasa, starts of wanting to protect Eren, yet by the end, she wants to protect Eren even more! Wait, what? The only development we see is of Armin, who starts from a complete wussy to what you expect from a main character. All other characters just fulfil the stereotypical archetype that the writers have fallen for. It was so disappointing to see this after seeing such a unique beginning. 4\
Enjoyment- suffice to say, I did not enjoy attack on titan. I spent most of the time being frustrated by how slow it was all moving and how childish everything was. I was pulled in by the overwhelming popularity and amazing action scenes. What I was met with was a very childish attempt at making gore cool. Providing a lame excuse for teenagers to create a lot of carnage is not a good story. As awesome as the fight scenes were, they cannot make up for how immature it all is. 4\
Overall- I’m really sorry for all the attack on titan fans reading this. But I am 18 and I have outgrown this senseless, immature and shallow genre. Whether I recommend watching it, I would actually say yes. The first 7 episodes are actually amazing. But the initial rebelling against the norm was quickly ignored and it drifted back to an average anime. 5",

    This will remain one of my favourite animes of all time. I don't care for those people who say that this anime is 'too mainstream to watch' or 'this anime is really overrated', because you know what? Shingeki no Kyojin is mainstream for a reason. It is flipping fantastic, and here's why.\
Story: 10\
*This is based solely on the anime, not the manga*\
First episode: Perfect. From then on, it just got better and better.\
The story is is so well done. It is unique, it's horrifying when it needs to be, it's tragic at all the right moments, it's intense, and it's not even over dramatised, because\
          \
        who the hell wouldn't be crapping their pants if their entire world was under attack by flesh eating giants? \
I absolutely loved how scared this anime made me feel. Enjoyment-wise, I think I liked the first half better (second half is still great). It was humanity against the Titans. Even though it was hopeless and impossible, it made me hold onto that tiny bit of hope they had. \
There isn't anything I have to complain about, because I see no flaw here. The only concern for this anime is their new upcoming season. If this is based closely to the manga I might have to change my score to a 9... I don't really like the path they headed down :(\
Art: 9\
Wow wow wow. This style was something new to look at. Attack on Titan didn't follow the typical anime art style, that's for sure. For some reason, a lot of the characters actually somewhat look westernised. I mean, you can clearly see their noses, and strong line art. For some, this may not be their cup of tea, but for me personally, I didn't mind this. (Maybe with the thicker lines I did), but honestly, there was more to this anime than just its appearance.  Now, as for the action scenes: Amazing. When I first watched this, I was so very impressed. It was fluent and really really well executed. I wish I had 3D gear.\
Sound: 10\
I think we all know, and no-one can deny, how great this soundtrack is. Even if you hate Attack on Titan (boo why?), you cannot deny it's amazing soundtrack. It's catchy and it's good. I have the entire soundtrack on my phone, and it's OP is basically my alarm in the morning. It makes me think I can conquer the world or something.\
Character: 9\
All the characters have substance. Even the ones who are not main even seem too. They are all frightened, and fear controls them. Gosh, it feels so realistic at times.\
The character's loss of faith or fear, created in such an intense atmosphere. You never knew who was going to die, which always kept me on the edge of my seat. In this anime, I felt as though no character was safe.\
Eren is probably the most determined blood thirsty protagonist I have ever watched. I love it/he's a bit too crazy. This boy needs to calm down. I'm just waiting for the moment when he realises that perhaps Titan's aren't the real monsters, that really it's just people.\
Mikasa perhaps isn't really the 'strongest' character, as to be honest, we have all seen characters similar to her before, but nevertheless, she has a good backstory explaining the way she is.\
As for Armin and Jean... SUCH CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. A+ in that department. Not only that, but as I said before, this anime illustrates everything really realistically, and their change in character just makes so much sense. It's actually so believable.\
Overall: 9.5\
What I would say that this anime lacks is humour. Sounds weird because this anime is meant to be a real serious one anyway, but at times, I wouldn't mind seeing them find some happiness in the darkness. We all know that it is depressing, constantly living in fear, but the only sense of humour we receive is from Hanji. This of course is just me being picky, because honestly, I accept that there is probably nothing funny about Titans.\
Anyway... As I have constantly been praising, just know that THIS ANIME IS BRILLIANT. Unless you really hate blood and gore stuff, or only like light-hearted animes, maybe this isn't the best choice. Honestly though, I don't think I have met a person who has actually straight up said to me that they DO NOT like Shingeki no Kyojin 100%. \
When people say 'it's overrated'. I see the cons too, but this doesn't take away from the entirety of the anime. \
Also, don't not watch it just because it's 'too mainstream', because... Really? \

    I've been hearing a lot about this anime and how popular it was, but I never really wanted to watch it because I am really reluctant when it comes to shounen anime. Pretty much the only shounen anime I've ever enjoyed was Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Death Note (I'm also starting to get a little bit into Assassination Classroom), but considering the huge fanbase that this anime built, I decided to take a crack at it, and in my conclusive overall review, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the coolest and most creative anime I've ever watched. \
Story: 10/10\
I've seen so many anime with\
          \
        top-notch plots, from Death Note to Hunter x Hunter. One thing AOT never holds back on is action. I can imagine how difficult it is for writers to create a solid plot that's overwhelmed with action sequences, but AOT maintained itself beautifully. The writers did an excellent job showcasing how threatening the Titans are. They may be giants that seem like they could never keep up with the heroes' speed and agility, but their surprising intelligence is what helps them completely overwhelm humans, making them worthy villains. I actually thought that this anime was just going to be a \"bing-bang-boom\" action show with barely any real significance at all, but the show's drama, characters, and background stories are what hit me harder than any action sequence ever did, even though I'm quite a sucker for some solid action. As I started watching AOT, I got quickly interested in it with it's driving plot and amusing characters, but out of any other episode in the show so far, episode 5 hit me the hardest and was what drove me to watch the rest of 1st season as quickly as I could. The episode was a pure shocker. It's basically one of those episodes that makes you wonder what will happen next, and it's really up to you to find out.\
Character: 10/10\
The characters really drove this anime. Like Hunter x Hunter, not a single character is bland. In my mind, a bland character is basically one that gives you no feelings or overall emotion. In AOT, we get characters that make you happy (humorously), angry, or bewildered. Another trait that AOT has similar to HxH is the main character. Unlike most anime where the MC is always the smartest and the strongest, in AOT you get Eren, who's is passionate but hot-tempered, emotional, and not always 100% right. That trait really adds more realism to anime and keeps it away from the cartoony side. Even secondary characters get major roles, which is really what any TV show or film really needs to succeed. I really enjoyed the roles of each character, especially the ones who were mostly there for some comic relief (Sasha Blouse, Hange Zoe). One character I've enjoyed watching the most was Levi, mainly because of his pure intelligence, high skill in combat, calm personality, and his father figure-type relationship with Eren.\
Art: 10/10\
As far as I know when it comes to anime, AOT has very unique art direction. The characters are heavily outlined and colored very dynamically, which is very amusing to the eye. The animation is really at its best during action sequences as it is crossed with traditional hand-drawn animation and CGI, which is something you don't see very often in anime. The animation is fluid and smooth and the camera movement is very dynamic. I really enjoyed watching characters fly around with their 3D maneuver gear. The ceaseless fluidity of the animation really drove every action sequence and is something that will catch your eye in an instant.\
Sound 10/10\
I don't really pay attention to sound effects in anime, unless it's obviously bad, so I'll just rate the music. What you would expect from any action anime is some epic music. Some action anime rely on heavy rock or metal for action sequences, which are mostly decent to listen to (Fairy Tail). AOT relies on a variety of music categories, such as vocal rock, hybrid orchestral, and traditional orchestral. The hybrid and traditional orchestral music for AOT caught my attention the most. I really enjoyed listening to the OST and ED music and I've taken a special liking into Guren no Yumiya (theme song), E.M.A., and the Levi vs. Female Titan theme.\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Attack on Titan has taken a special place in my heart. With its knockout action sequences, intense drama, amusing characters, epic background music, and unique animation, it quickly made a spot in my top 10 anime list, and it's just the first season.\

    It took me a while to start watching this for some reason. Finally got into it the other night, and I'm really not sure where all the praise is coming from. By episode 14 I was thoroughly engaged with the story and the characters. Sooo, what happened? I don't know the exact episode, maybe 16 or 17, but this show comes to a grinding halt. The story literally goes no where, the characters become stale and boring, and the main character, who was a thorough badass, actually regresses into an indecisive child. The show also has no ending. I mean I understand if they're planning\
          \
        another season, but even so, it just ends abruptly with no resolution whatsoever. They throw a subplot in that occupies that last 5 or so episodes, and it goes absolutely nowhere. It was quite frustrating, as it all seemed very irrelevant.  \
It was a good show, but not great. It didn't deliver in the end, as the story never really progresses once Eren joins the Survey Corp, and the characters never really go anywhere (and actually regress). There is only one really great scene in the second half of the show (church getting stomped on), and while it does deal with interesting themes, it's not enough to give it more than a 7.\

    The fact that so many bloggers still name Shingeki no Kyogin “the greatest or most significant or most influential\" anime series of 2013 only tells you how anime still is from becoming a serious art. Anime critics have long recognized that the greatest anime series of all times are Neon Genesis Evangelion and CardCaptor Sakura, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Other critics rank the highly controversial Aku no Hana over classic anime who were highly popular in courts around Japan. Teenage bloggers are still blinded by commercial success: Shingeki no Kyojin\
          \
        sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. True anime critics grow up watching a lot of anime of the past. Shingeki no Kyojin fans are often totally ignorant of the anime of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Shingeki no Kyojin did anything worth of being saved.\
In a sense Shingeki no Kyojin are emblematic of the status of modern anime criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena and too little attention to the merits of real anime. If somebody composes the most divine anime seires but Crunchyroll refuses to hype it up and stream it around the world, a lot of bloggers will ignore it. If every teenager on MAL hype up an anime series which is as stereotyped as one can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said series. This is the sad status of modern anime criticism.\
Shingeki no Kyjin sells not because it's the greatest anime series of the decade but simply because it is easy to sell to the masses: it has no difficult content, it has no technical innovations, it has no creative depth. It's just a bunch of gritty 3-minute action scenes which teenagers like to overhype and rave about how \"epic\" it was. If somebody had not invented \"Shingeki no Hype\" in 2013, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial anime which is mediocre at best.\

    I'd like to get the negatives out of the way first as they were few and had minimal affect on my pleasure experiencing this anime.\
The anime has moments where the action stops, the characters start to have epiphanies. Having epiphanies are not bad, nor is thinking about changing the way they think, act, behave. The problem is doing in the middle of battle. In the middle of battle your teammates, friends, family are continuing to die and struggle, and you also have a higher chance of dying with titans around. Some stand around giving up, and I guess I can see how that is realistic\
          \
        but my idealism is getting the best of me. When they are making decisions to join military branches, before battle deciding to fight or flee is where these thinking segments are best.\
The three main characters are to extreme (although I can see how it makes it more enjoyable, again minor negative). Yeager, Eren the screamy, head first, if he wasn't a main he would be dead in the first episode. Ackerman, Mikasa the amazing. she is perfect, is exceptional at fighting, supportive, will stand by your side no matter what, strong willed, smart, beautiful. All great things and would make it more believable if she had at least some flaws...when they showed her back story I understood why she became strong willed and became so supportive and protective of Eren but again she is exceptional in combat, is intelligent and they don't show how she came to acquire those things. Eren for example grows to become smarter and stronger by taking up challenges and failing before growing as a person. Arlert, Armin was portrayed as a pathetic character and to extreme in the pathetic range. Thankfully they gave him some love and he is actually a cool character when you get into the show more and more.\
 I'd like to repeat that these are minor things and I see how having the characters this way would make for a more enjoyable experience and I'm okay with that. The rest of the characters are awesome too, they have quirks and their own personality which makes the anime a good experience.\
Story is interesting. Humans are living behind 3 walls, the outermost is Wall Maria; the middle wall is Wall Rose and the innermost is Wall Sina. You want to know why the titans are killing, eating the humans. You want humanity to fight back and win. Every time the episodes end you want to know more. What will happen next? The world created for us is quite large, done well and has plenty of descriptive details. The effort and time put into creating this believable world is what makes the show amazing.\
Art/Sound was beautiful, pleasant to experience.\
This Anime has a very high rewatch value, a pleasurable experience, it drives your curiosity, satisfies your primal side to fight and survive, engages your brain when you see the strategies involved and touches your heart, feeling for the characters when they lose parents, friends, titans or when you see the closeness they begin to form as they grow and fight together. I will be adding this anime to my life library.\

    When I first saw this anime, I was utterly blown away. Not only did it prove to show that there is still hope in the anime scene not disappointing you with redundant, repetitive, milked out fan serviced themes but it does so with a main character that happens to be the least irksome to one's taste.\
The story talks about the last remnants of humanity cooped up behind amazingly huge walls protecting them from gigantic monsters known as Titans. You are introduced to the main characters: Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert who are childhood friends that innocently dream of going beyond the walls and\
          \
        discovering the real world out there (just like any kid would!) This peaceful setting is disrupted when, out of the blue, a huge 60 foot Titan peeks from behind the 50 feet walls right at the puny humans and goes ahead to kick the gate that is sheltering humanity from the woes of the outside world that the Titans inhabit, wide open. \
This is where the story starts to unfold around the mystery surrounding these Titans and why they are adamant on \"eating\" humanity as a whole.\
All throughout every episode you will find yourself attached to every single character from here onwards. Some unceremoniously die, some have naive thoughts and goals to what they should do in life,  some want to take the easy way out of their strife, and some just go with the flow because they don't think they are strong-willed to fight back. All in all you will be attached to characters that exhibit real human qualities.\
Simple concept for a story, isn't it? Nope it ain't.\
This isn't your run-of-the-mill monster/horror/doomed humanity anime. People fail to realize that the Attack on Titan setting is exactly the same setting we all live in our real lives. It reminds you that anyone who is bigger, better, and stronger will not only devour you whole, but will also devour your entire dreams, hopes, and future with it.\
And this main character, Eren Jaeger...this kid, you actually root for this wide eyed enthusiastic little bugger - who adamantly with all his heart wants to turn the tide whether it be for better or for worse. He knows that he has to FIGHT in order to go anywhere in life, and he isn't letting these monsters ruin his will to live; his will to take matters into his own hands.\
It's very rare to have a character pump you up. It serves to show how willpower alone can do wonders - even if you are only human.\
The art is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are so vivid and you honestly can't get enough of the lush background scenes. The action sequences were awesomely superb, especially with the surprisingly fluid 3D Maneuver Gear sequences. As for the characters the first thing you will notice are the EYES. They are so vividly colored and illustrated you can't help but find yourself drawn to them.\
The music is simply outstanding. It fits very well with the mood of the story. Starting from the opening sequence to the ending credits. The BGM and SFX were especially very well placed whenever a character is seen flying around using the 3D Maneuver Gear. The ambiance and that feeling of dread that emanates from the music captures you from the very first episode. Honestly, if anyone hates the music I will royally Jaeger your ass!\
Unlike the manga, the anime didn't do justice or make way for any sort of character development. First timers wouldn't be THAT drawn to the characters from the get-go. But the development is still there, you just need to look closely. Yep, closer....OH there it is!  I do hope that everyone reading this review would give them a fleeting chance if any. If you're still not convinced, then go ahead and read the manga. You will be equally blown away, anyways.\
I haven't enjoyed an anime like this in a very long while. As I said in the very beginning of the review, animes nowadays have only cliched themes and seem to just bring out a yawn rather than any hint of interest. I've been so picky that I almost did not watch Attack on Titan (*GASP* the blasphemy!) \
It epically portrayed a lot of simple concepts and elements that are most importantly HUMAN. It teaches you how easy it is to have hope inch further and further away from your grip and how easy it is to just give up. Though if no one around you is willing to stand tall and face adversity, it doesn't mean that YOU have to be scared out of your wits too.\
I urge everyone to watch Attack on Titan...then go ahead and read the manga, because if you'll be as hooked as I am then I'm sure you wouldn't even be able to bear waiting for the second season to come around the corner. \
Happy Jaegering!\

    I must say I was disappointed with this one. After all the hype I expected something good. The show resembles Claymore in many, many ways which is the main reason I watched it but while Claymore scores lower, I still believe it to be superior in every way. \
As far as the story goes, it's very basic. Giant people and that's about it.\
The character's are the worst part of the whole anime bearing little to no personality and being annoying and/or useless almost all the time. They have this overly dramatic monologues and are constantly stalling the pacing with their \"going insane\" or \"I am\
          \
        so shocked\" dramas. While you expect them to react like this, it wears off very quickly and becomes irritating.\
Where it succeeds is the action. Great art and good fight scenes but even these suffer from the ever so often staling of the character's reactions.\
Overall, I truly believe this to be over hyped and overrated but if you are willing to sit through it for the fights scenes then more power to you.\

    Story - what I like - the premise 'humans vs giants' is simple on the surface but oh so damn complicated actually.  It's never just about fighting man-eating Titans.  The good guys also have to keep rich idiots in powerful political positions happy while using equipment with real world fallibilities.  (This is probably the only manga-anime that I can recall with swords that not only get dull but dulls quickly.)\
What I don't like - there are times when I wish that humanity isn't so goddamn stupid.  Am not talking about the good guys, but the rich powerful idiots in charge in\

        particular.  However, I'm tempering this complaint because corruption and decadency is very depressing true in real life.\

Character(s) - what I like - it has succeeded where most horror-suspense stories fail.  It made me care about characters who will most likely die.\
What I don't like - death flags everywhere.  People die and die gruesomely. Try to not get (too) attached to any of the characters. (Really, don't.)\
---\
Art - what I like - though the manga is infamous for having rough art (you can tell cause the mangaka kept on apologizing about it), the anime has gorgeous art and animation.  In particular, the battle scenes involving those jetpacks-webshooters.  (The animators researched by watching The Amazing Spider-Man in 3D.)  \
What I don't like - there are definitely times when you can tell that the budget is very stretched.  Hopefully, these will be improved in the bluray-dvd releases.  (They better be.)\

    Shingeki no Kyojin or as it is more commonly known as Attack on Titan is undoubtedly the most hyped anime of the spring season and arguably of the entire year The hype for the show had already existed before the show even aired it first episode and it only shot up from there. This begs the question is Attack on Titan really the show that people notably fans of the show make it out to be?\
The show opens up as humanity is being driven to the brink by man-devouring giants known as the Titans. Mankind has survived by caging themselves within a walled city in\
          \
        order to distance themselves off from the Titans. When the Titans eventually do break into the city, our protagonist Eren Yeager vows to avenge his mother who had fallen prey to the mankind’s predators until every last one of them is dead.\
I came into show not knowing what to expect from the show. I have heard of the manga but I didn’t really think of anything of it at the time. I was initially unaware of the hype surrounding the show so I basically went into a show with a clean slate. \
Judging by the first episode alone, the show looks to be a promising series. The introductory episode is pretty good and does an adequate introducing you to its world and characters. The animation was gorgeous especially during key moments in the episode. The music was a good with special mention going to the show’s first opening theme, “Crimson Bow and Arrow,” by Linked Horizon that really does get you pump up to watch the show. The Titans are especially intimating with their grotesque designs but I would care for more explanation that hopefully latter episodes elaborate upon.\
The show continued to impress with it aesthetics. The show always brimming with energy from its fantastic score to its very fluid animation. The score is helmed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano who has his hand on other popular anime such as Guilty Crown, Blue Exorcist, Gundam Unicorn and among many others. He is one my favorite musicians to come out of anime and he works never fails to impress. His score makes the show a pleasure to listen especially during the various high-points throughout the show. \
The animation is handled by both the up and coming Wit Studio and the more well-known Production I.G. They animation is fairly consistent which always a plus. What makes animation in this series really stand out is the use omni-dimensional maneuver gear which is particularly interesting and make for some very dynamic fight sequences. The animation team really put their best foot forward doing sequences involving the usage of them.\
I can’t really vouch for any of the voice work mostly because I am not particularly well-versed in the Japanese language but to my eyes the voice actors all the good with the material they were given. I have to give special mention to Yuki Kaji who voices our protagonist Eren. He never fails to make him sound especially creepy during those certain moments later on in the show.\
However a show cannot stand own through these merits alone. If you begin to look past show’s more shallow aspects then you start to see that this show may not as good as it is made out to be.\
The show had already grabbed me by it interesting but not entirely original premise. The world is under the heels of natural predator makes for a great atmosphere and is one of the finer examples of a dark fantasy in recent memory. Needless to say the Titans, the series’ antagonist, behave very similarity to zombies. Thus making the show feels as if you’re watching yet another spin of the zombie apocalypse which everyone has probably seen before. This is probably why the show has much mainstream appeal as the zombie apocalypse genre is quite popular here in the west. This aspect makes this show great for the casual view I guess.\
There is one area which the show really lacks and is its characters. While the show’s many characters are quite colorful, they are pretty flat and don’t really step out the boundaries of being mere archetypes. \
Eren is yet another clichéd shonen protagonist who is defined by little more than his conviction to exterminate the Titans. While his convictions are understandable considering what he has been through but that is all he is. Despite all of his talk, he mostly all bark and no bite. Of course he get is obligatory shonen power-up and everyone turn to him to do anything noteworthy. However, he is hardly the ideal shounen protagonist. There really is special about him save for the fact that he is dangerously determined. His aforementioned shonen power-up doesn’t win every battle and quite frankly does more harm than good. Above all though, Eren is just plain scary so much so that it actually becomes a plot point. \
Lastly, He is really same person he was as the beginning of the story to the end. He character doesn’t really get much in the way of character development. \
The a few other notable character notably Mikasa who would be a strong female character if there was more than her character than her obsession with Eren. I know Eren helped at a key moment in her life but that all she cares about really. She really isn’t shown caring about anything else. It is almost a bit creepy. It got to the point that various characters in the show have taken note of this. Of course she is hold her own quite well but I really wishes she was wasn’t over reliant on Eren.\
Then with have Armin who acts as sort the brain of the group. While Eren relies on sheer willpower and determination, Mikasa relies on her practical skills, Armin relies on his smarts. Despite this he really does contribute much to plot and is really just sort of there. At time when he does get to use his smarts, it really only there to point out things that are rather obvious and anyone with a brain could probably figure out.\
There are other notable characters include as Jean who unlike our protagonist actually develops over the course of the story and Captain Levi who is a genuine badass but even they are truly notable. \
The rest of the cast can pretty much be summed in a little more than few words. They are very one note and thus aren’t too terribly compelling. Most of them quite forgettable besides for less than a handful of the cast\
Often character dies dramatically mostly redshirts you are supposed care but since we know so little about them are we as the audience are meet with is indifference. This show runs on a shock value to reel in viewers week by week which by itself starts to irritate you after a while making it less and less shocking each time it happens. It starts to become a regular occurrence.\
The show’s pacing is notable for being absolutely horrendous. The episodes are often accompanied but rather lengthy recaps of the episodes before often being three or more minutes long. There are several scenes which notable padding where things are taking much longer than they should. There are several episodes where little to hardly anything happens until the very end of course. It is not as bad as some other shonen but still quite notable. That brings to me to yet another point.\
The show is a shonen through and through despite the show’s overall dark and brooding atmosphere. The show attempts to tell a mature story with the inclusion of more mature and concepts that one can rarely in shows of its genre. The show is rather violent and grotesque for a supposed children’s show. The fights especially between the titans are quite brutal.  However the show simply comes across as pretentious as tries to be more than what it is. The show frequently plays up some the more tired shonen trope and clichés. In the end this only serves to hinder the show overall.\
On the surface, the show looks pretty it really is but when actually start to look inward you’ll find the show is quite ugly. Attack on Titan is by no means a bad show. It is certainly an entertaining show. It was fun ride to watch it week by week. It certainly fares much better than most of the anime to come out the spring season. That and unlike many popular shows of its kind its hype is not entirely unwarranted. There some good to be had here. \
However despite all of this is not a particularly smart show. It has all the making to be a great show but what it fails at is certainly its execution. This is a reason why this show has garnered so much hype as most viewers aren’t willing to take time to dissect it and only appreciate show at face value. Regardless, I will say this I would recommend this show but it is neither the best show of the year or what people make out it be. If you need a new show to check it out then this is certainly up your alley. \
It is a good show that wants great show but make a more than few stumbles on the way. It was fun ride though and I will be there when the inevitable second season heads our way.\
Pros:\
+Dark and inventive world\
+Setting is certainly intriguing\
+Likeable and varied cast.\
+The music is fantastic and well-orchestrated. Does well to set up the mood of the show and highlight the various high points in the show.\
+The animation is high-quailty throughout and especially scenes involving the omni-dimensional maneuver gear are very well-done.\
Cons:\
-There are some scenes where the animation is less than stellar though it isn’t enough to ruin the whole experience.\
-Horrid pacing which cause the show to drag numerous times during the show.\
-Relies heavily on shock value.\
-Most of the character is rather flat and one-note. Thus making it hard for viewers to care little or nothing at all about what happens to them.\
-Despite everything it does, it still a clichéd shounen which holds it back from it true potential.",

    (A.N. Reviews are my personal opinions, these aren't coming from an objective perspective where I try to look at the anime critically. I just want to jot down my thoughts on somewhere where I physically can't lose it)\
♡\
First things first, holy shit the art is so amazing and meticulous I have absolutely no words for how well the animators and artists did aHhhhh.\
Okay, so, I'm sure like 99% of the anime fandom has seen Attack on Titan, otherwise known as Shingeki no Kyojin. The story, season one anyway, follows the life (sort of) of Eren Yeager who, by the way, has like the most beautiful\
          \
        eyes on the face of the planet, along with his two friends Mikasa and Armin.\
You're introduced to these three characters first and a bunch others in the long run, all of whom you should not get too attached to for even a second.\
Like Akame ga Kill!, this anime will like ruin you and your ability to trust so don't get a t t a c h e d.\
Okay, for real though, the story itself is purely unique and takes place in a dystopian society where, in a nutshell, the fittest survive. There's like a complex living structure and stuff that's mapped out by the government but you can find that out after you start the series.\
The art, like I said, is simply gorgeous and very detailed. Not a single one of the characters look the same, unless you count some of the corpses (hahaa..... too soon?). The soundtrack, aka the opening, closing and ost are all a wonderful listen. The opening was actually my phone's ringtone for a while- LOL.\
I really enjoyed this series and enjoyed watching a genuine character development throughout the anime, which was accompanied by a fast, yet steady story progression. I think that, if you can stomach the gore, Shingeki no Kyojin is a fantastic watch that everyone should consider watching.\
Just...don't have a light stomach!\

                        \"Shingeki no Kyojin\" or \"Attack on Titan\" (AOT) has received praise from both critics and audiences alike. With this in mind, I decided to watch it and was seriously disappointed. Although AOT has incredible artwork and highly developed characters, it fails to deliver a good story. The plot itself is actually interesting and has a lot of potential to be really good, but the anime drags on and on, taking several episodes simply to cover one battle or one plot point. Furthermore, each plot point\
          \
        doesn't add much to the story itself, by which I mean it only adds more questions and gives no answers. A story needs to give answers to the questions it asks or that it invokes, otherwise it leaves the audience (or at least it left me) feeling let down. \
                      Also, despite the fact that the characters are highly developed, I personally found it hard to care that much about them since most of them end up dying rather quickly, making all that development pretty much pointless. This also made me feel rather uninspired whenever a character gave some inspirational speech or rallying cry because even when they do that, they end up getting slaughtered.\
                      Lastly, the excessive amount of emotional scenes took away a lot of their intended effect. I found myself thinking \"yes, yes, we get it, can we move on now?\" whenever these drawn out emotional scenes appeared simply because there were too many of them and they really desensitized me to the very real emotions that were present.\
With those things in mind, I will admit that the artwork of AOT is incredible, using a unique style and taking full advantage of certain elements present within AOT's unique world to create some very powerful scenes. Also, although the characters feel a little disposable to me, The characters are still very well developed and relatable. \
So it ultimately comes down to what your looking for in an anime. If your looking for a good, full story, i would recommend you pass. But if your more into artwork and character, then you definitely need to watch it.\

    Attack on titan is a normal action shonen.\
This show is a reflection on how the standards of violence these days have gone up.So  much Death and Gore scenes fill the screen.\
Shows like Naruto and One piece have considerably less.\
That is where the popularity of this show lies,the animation for the titans,the 'viral misleading\" op.and the death and gore.\
Characters are rather simple.No development.\
Eren our preaching screaming hero.Mikasa our Mary sue who loves Eren and Armin where pointing out the obvious makes him smart.Everybody else exists to just die to add to the death scenes.\
The training arc was a disappointment,instead of showing me how they will\
          \
        approach the titans in practice(that scene where they did only occurred in theory),shows me a faulty gear arc.\
That first  op is very very, misleading,most of the Titan killers wouldn't even dare\
to approach them,Some would even stand still and monologue for no reason, Some would even SHOOT themselves out of fear.\
Except for the one and only from the training arc, Mikasa, who lives only for Eren, can kill Titans\
This show is no special symbol for Female empowerment. \
In others words these people don't value their own lives and training,their deaths are meaningless.\
Our main character becomes a Titan to save the day.Armin was always smart,so his first tactic did  not show anything new to him,overshadowed even.Humanity vs titans?\
Don't get me started on the Salute to save Eren,that certainly was \"forced in\". There was no thinking process involved and no link to their bald boss  dude shown before.\
Then Titanman goes into moral contemplation mode,needlessly for one episode and plugs the hole.\
Learning that the titans are inactive at night was drilled into me due to their dragged out episodes.\
And yet for their next expedition they travel in the DAY to find a female titan and not even go to the obviously advantageous basement as originally planned ...\
Some would say would it be difficult to see at night.But who in their right mind would rather face an ENTIRE ARMY OF GIANTS.Even if the shows pulls the exceptions out of the blue, it would be rare and they would have strength in numbers.\
At least somebody other than Mikasa could kill the titans,Levi and some in the elite squad. \
Of course they lost to Evil Titanwoman.\
Coming back to the city only to beat her in the end.With some new burning power by the main lead.Took them long enough to figure out it was Annie,thanks to Captain Obvious Armin. \
This show has way more questions that answers which is a bad thing.The the story destroy itself over time?\
This is just cool to look at and just for the action.This is neither a masterpiece nor a savior,its typical.All this show did is swap the romantic comedy genre tag for the Action.\
The writing is on the same boat.OK to watch just for fun.But going too deep into it is a bad idea.\

    (This is my first review, so bear with me.) \
Spoiler free, although you should know the story by now.\
Coming from such an intense and thrilling manga series, the anime adaptation for Shingeki no Kyojin had quite a lot of expectations to live up to. I believe that it has met them in high standards. \
Story: 9/10 \
What I admire most about SnK is its ability to successfully and carefully demonstrate the notions of war and conflict. SnK is able to portray the many aspects and themes of war and conflict such as futility of war, human sacrifice (by this, I mean sending countless men and\
          \
        women to battle only leading to their inevitable death in the front lines), glorification and romanticisation of war by those who know nothing of the harsh realities of it, personal battles of the individual (this especially evident in Eren's development throughout the series), ethics and morality, as well as the negative consequences of war on the lifestyle in the home fronts. All of this set in a fictional Western European world. I recommend reading the poems of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon to further appreciate the brilliance SnK has achieved to explore the previously listed themes. \
Art: 9/10 \
The art was definitely candy to the eyes. It was satisfying to see incredible battle sequences between the army and the titans. I particularly loved the attention to detail in animation of the 3D Manoeuvre Gear. Character designs were also to be applauded for. \
Sound: 10/10 \
The voice acting cast are to be commended. Being a big fan of the manga, I was impressed with how fitting the voice actors were for their characters, especially for Eren and Hanji. \
The soundtrack to this anime is brilliant, one of my favourites. Hiroyuki Sawano does an excellent job to just intensify any scene. A few tracks in the German language just add onto the atmosphere to the setting of the anime, giving the audience a more thrilling experience.\
Also, both opening sequences (especially Guren no Yumiya) by Linked Horizon may be one of the best opening sequences ever. The songs were so catchy and while I usually watch through all OPs of any anime I watch, it should be illegal to skip SnK's openings (and endings). \
Character: 10/10 \
Similar to the story section of my review, I admire how SnK has been able to successfully show how war and conflict impacts the individual, in more ways than one. It was interesting to see how the events of the story affected each character and how it adds to their development. You have someone who struggles to find what is right and what is wrong as well as having an enormous amount of responsibility on their shoulders. You have someone who excels in learning and sensibly adapts to any situation. You have a strong willed, stereotype breaking, and brave female who is able to find strength in the worst of times. Then you have a few characters who lose their humanity, in order to save humanity altogether. As well as the relationship of the characters amongst each other, the titans, the townspeople and the mysterious father, it is a well-balanced group of characters. \
Enjoyment: 10/10 \
I thoroughly enjoyed this, more than I thought I would. Each episode leaves me emotional and wanting more. The pace of the story, especially in the second arc, was done well. \
Overall: 10/10 \
I can't say anymore for this anime. It was just brilliant. That's all there is to it. \
Personally, I'm a big history buff and because of that, the whole notion of war and conflict in this anime was very pleasing and satisfying. SnK achieves so much in such little time it has and I commend it for that. Depending on how the series will end on Sunday (I have a few guesses), it has a lot of space and opportunity to continue onto a second season which I have no doubt would be as astonishing as the first. \
I definitely recommend this series to anyone and everyone! \

    Plot/Story-line: 9/10 I love the plot. One question will always pop into your head. Why? The anime leaves you guessing and wanting more. Which is good. It's not funny. It has its little funny moments here and there. But those are very rare moments. It's more dark and deep than funny. If you're looking for a funny anime, you've come to the wrong place. \

Art: 10/10 Beautiful, beautiful, and gorgeous. The animation is so good. Props to the animators. The manga has pretty good art too. \

Sound: GREAT sub AND dub voices. The emotions are good. I prefer the dub. The soundtrack is SOOOOO good\
          \
        too. The song in episode 13 though.  \
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Characters: 6/10 They don't have really memorable characters. YET. Armin is a little annoying. Mikasa is like fuck everybody else, I only care about Eren. It's like everyone can die for all she cares, as long as Eren is okay. Eren is.....Eren. Hopefully season 2 has better character development and in the manga. There's like ZERO character development. \
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
Overall: 9/10 It's really good. I love the gore. It could be better though. Make a little character development, make some characters less annoying and self-centered, and we're golden. ",

    Shingeki no Kyojin, otherwise known as Attack on Titan. Now throughout the months before I watched this show I have heard so much good said about it, as in one of the best anime's in the past few years, but, I do not think so at all. Though this show had outstanding visuals that I agree are better than all of the anime's I have seen to date, It has more faults than goods. I will explain why below.\
A world where ferocious creatures known as Titans attempt to eradicate humanity who are safely put behind the 3 enormous 50m Tall stone walls (that also reach\
          \
        below bedrock level), Sina, Rose and Maria. Maria having a circumference of 1570.8km (I did the math) with Rose inside Maria and Sina inside of Rose. Not even going to bother calculating the length of them, I can't be bothered. Anyway, the story takes place around a young man named Eren Jeager and his struggles among his companions to fight off the Titans.\
Before I go into negatives, I want to point out the positives. Visuals and animation style are perfect, could not be happier about that. The level of epicness does not cease to amaze me. The way the Titans are depicted and how the humans perceive them is extremely well done, they truly do make the most frightful enemies in Titans. They are unstoppable, absolutely terrifying beings with nearlly zero weaknesses. Well done, and for this I give you an instant boost to 10/10. \
Now to the negatives.... oh the amount of potential, the amount of plot wholes is just staggering! First thing I thought of was, where did the walls come from? How could anyone make them? Especially if all this started only a century ago... It would have take a millennium to make it in the first place, that is without the distractions of constant Titan attacks that would have wiped out humanity within an hour of even attempting to build the walls... where did the Materials come from? \
As for all the other more obvious questions that were brought up throughout the series. None of which were answered either... The show seemed to drag on secrets and appropriate information without telling us anything. Where did the Titans come from? How do people turn into Titans? What's in the basement? What happened to Colossal Titan and Armoured Titan? Who were they anyway? Why did his dad keep that a secret? \
WHERE DID THE WALLS COME FROM! WHY! HOW! WHY! HOW!\
Not only that, but from watching it I could just imagine all these wonderful story arcs and possibilities that were just thrown out the window and instead of answering all the relevant questions in the back of my mind, they just went on to do something equally and completely irrelevant. \
Also, though the visuals were stunning, they were the same! The environment only ever changed once. From cities of stone and the wall, to empty grasslands and some forest, that still looked exactly the same no matter what angle you put it on.... \
Character development. You mean, see this pretty person, HA! Jokes! they all died. I think this show tried to hard to be epic and sad when it killed people, which it does a lot. Average episode death count is estimated around 500. I wasn't connected to any characters, in fact I couldn't care less about them, which is (ironically) sad because I think the show tried to make you feel sad when they died. I just ticked my list, \"Oh... so he's dead, oh and so is she... oh and that guy too\". Why is it that none of the characters despite Armin develop or even change throughout the entire series? And I didn't even like that guy... Should I also mention the constant flashbacks and monologues? Like seriously, they are good every now and then but not every 5 and a half seconds...\
I could go on and on for a little more but I think that's enough ranting for now. Starting from it's positives, the only reason why I continued to watch this show, I give it a 10/10. But when it comes up to everything else, it drops to about 6/10. So much potential, and absolutely no questions were answered, and the world hasn't really become any safer. \
If you like to watch something that looks pretty and has a cool world setting, this is the show! But if you don't want to pull your hair out from frustration for 8 and a half hours, I suggest you steer clear. \
Overall, 6/10. Good, enjoyable, but frustrating with too many faults to count\

    Why Shingeki no Kyojin might not be the epic you were expecting....\
And why it might be.\
Shingeki no Kyojin or, Attack on Titan was produced by the powerhouse studio Production IG in the spring of 2013. It was instantly a smash success even gathering attention for the casual western masses. By now the summer of 2014, there is even a Hollywood movie in the works.\
This review will solely focus on whether this anime will meet your understandably high expectations. For some of you it might, for others like myself you might be left scratching your head. Let me make myself clear before I begin however. I\
          \
        in no way disliked this anime or, have any ill feelings towards it. I rather enjoyed my first time watching the series all the way through, I've even read the manga in between my first and second viewing.\
With that all out of the way I'll begin!\
;Story~!\
The story of Shingeki no Kyojin isn't a hard one to grasp. Humans fear Titans, Titans eat Humans. Admittedly there is a little more behind this including an intriguing enough mystery. Though you rarely get enough bones thrown your way throughout to remember there is a greater mystery. \
The story all revolves around Eren Yaeger, a understandably pissed off young man. His goal is to kill all of the titans and trust me, he means ALL of the titans. The story starts off very slow but it doesn't take long for shit to hit the fan.\
Overall this story had potential but I think a lack of execution in a lot of areas hinder it. Especially the pacing. \
Rating: 5\
____\
;Art/Animation~!\
As expected from a studio like Production IG the animation is top-notch. Everything looks like it is high quality which I feel greatly enhances the series. The characters all look exceptional to decent, the titans look morbid and creepy (with the exception of that horrible kawaii titan), and the battles scenes are absolutely bananas. \
While Armin's haircut makes him look like a dork this still passes with flying colors.\
Rating: 8\
____\
;Soundtrack~!\
This was easily the best thing of the whole series. And it was probably one of my favorite soundtracks from last year. It did leave you feeling like what was happening on screen was a big deal. The soundtrack actually made me feel really emotional during scenes, the scenes otherwise never would have made me feel in such a way. The soundtrack played a huge part in getting me through my first watch content and with little complaints.\
For a soundtrack to do all of these things is very special. \
Rating: 10\
____\
;Characters~!\
This has to be the most frustrating part of the whole series for me. I'll focus on the central characters before giving an overview.\
I'll start with our main trio of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. All of these characters were painfully one-dimensional. And I don't accept Mikasa's backstory at all, I know it is fiction, I know it is anime, but in a world grounded by brutal reality I can't suspend my disbelief for Mikasa. By all accounts her parents were normal human beings, she transformed at the flip of a switch to a killing machine? I can't buy it. She also has the personality of cardboard, I felt absolutely nothing from her. And when I say nothing I mean nothing, no suppressed feelings, no real desire, she was just there. There to be the badass protagonist really, very much a female Levi. They're pretty much the same person. Admittedly I find Levi much more interesting though we are given little to nothing about his character, which is a problem that plagues the series.\
Armin while having the most potential of the three is just typecast as the cliche crybaby coward. If you want more prove look at the American voice actor chosen to play him, Josh Grelle. *Shudder.*\
Lastly is our main protagonist Eren! Once again it just feels like he is making up the last third of a trio with set cliche personalities or lack there of. Most of the time I just found him to be a nuisance while trying to watch the series. Annoying main protagonists aren't uncommon now a days but Eren Yaeger is very tiresome after a few episodes.\
Now as I said some characters I found interesting or with potential. The best among them being Annie Leonhart and Jean Kirstein. I understand perfectly well that some of these characters are going to be titan food, but why not develop them before then? It felt like none of these characters were properly constructed. From the bland personalities to the lifeless dialogue, the writing in this wasn't at all what people give it credit for.\
Rating: 3\
____\
;Overall~!\
Would you be surprised to hear that I enjoyed the series?\
It isn't exactly deep or, thought provoking still I found it to be very fun. Honestly it doesn't have a lot going for it aside from epic eight episode long heart pounding battles. But what is so wrong with that? \
Does it deserve the hype? \
With the dub coining it \"the Japanese, Walking Dead,\" I think saying it does from my point of view would be laughable.\
Do I get the hype?\
I certainly get it. The soundtrack is enthralling, the animation is quality, the surprising moments really get you. I understand why there was so much hype surrounding this series. \
If you are like me, you might be looking for the deep masterpiece of a story everyone has told you about. You won't find it here.\
But~!\
I certainly recommend it to those who don't mind shutting their brains off to enjoy a hell of a ride. \
For that I give Shingeki no Kyojin a solid...\
Final Verdict: 5/10~!\

tl;dr:\
The good: equally detailed characters, stunning aerial animation sequences, great production value\
The bad: imbalanced pacing leads to brain-dead story; lack of content given its 25-episode run\
It seems Japanese animation has its first new foreign ambassador since Naruto: Shingeki no Kyojin. Browsing through my Facebook I see friends who have never watched anime before asking others, \"Have you seen Shingeki no Kyojin?\" Or better yet they would follow up with, \"What other anime should I watch?\" Yes, Shingeki no Kyojin has done it. It has expanded beyond the niche anime community in the western world and captured the attention of young adults. Different from the\
          \
        shounen predecessors before it, Shingeki no Kyojin offers a sample to the West of the grimmer side of anime. For those of us here, it beckons a question: is Shingeki no Kyojin a satisfying entree for first-timers and regulars alike, or is it simply an appealing appetizer that is greeted with a hunger-derived passion, which once subsided, no longer tastes as appetizing? \
Shingeki no Kyojin's story starts at what seems to be humanity's final years. After the unwelcome intrusion of giant man-eating guests (Titans/Kyojin), the remaining couple thousand of humans reside in a central location enclosed by a series of three circular walls. Decades have gone by with no problems, and many humans spend their days content. Those that are not satisfied living their years as sheep, tend to join the survey corps of the military - whose duty is to reclaim land in the name of humanity. If you've seen Sword Art Online, it's the same situation: either stay put and accept your fate, or venture out into a losing battle and die with your dignity. That is the gist of Shingeki no Kyojin's setting, though it should be said that the Titans are not the only enemy to humanity. Just as with any other period in history, the number one enemy to humans are humans themselves. The inner ring of nobility is corrupted with greed, stirring trust issues between the government, the military, and the people. \
The main character, Eren Yeager, has always detested how weak humanity has become. He strives to join the survey corps so he can see the outside world and fight to reclaim humanity's dignity. The offensive survey unit has thus far fought nothing but losing battles with massive casualties. It doesn't help that the only intel humanity has on Titans is that the backside of a Titan's neck is it's only weakness. Will Yeager's conviction be enough to sway the tides of battle? \
The details put into each character, and the interaction between these characters, is the strongest attribute of Shingeki no Kyojin. If a face is given a name, it is backed with a fair amount of background information and personality to brighten it up. Time is taken to flesh out side characters enough for you to care about them, even if they never actually do anything significant. This forte of SnK would have done wonders if paired with a good sense of mystery and suspense. Sadly, that's where the show begins to fall short.\
Several later episodes are centered around this one mystery about an individual's true identity, which builds up to a climax with a \"shocking\" plot twist. Or, that's what the writer/director was hoping for at least. Anyone who is paying a child's level of attention to the show easily could have drawn such conclusions on their own. It's a shame since time was given to develop side characters. If the story was not so obvious, discussions in-between episodes would have been more entertaining as viewers tried to connect dots and form theories. \
This issue is rooted in a larger problem with the pacing. Try to recall what it was like when you first drank alcohol and how quick it was for you to feel the effects. Now compare it to your most recent drinking session where you probably got full before getting anywhere past tipsy. What if your tolerance levels jumped straight from your first session to your most recent one - would suck right? This is my feeling about the pacing in SnK. It kicks off and builds up so much intense adrenaline so quickly, but then suddenly flat lines. Several episodes (or drinking sessions) later, you're offered another enticing serving. Sadly, your body no longer gives a shit despite all the flashing lights and pumping music. \
Many fans argue that the discrepancy in pacing is due to the need to develop some story. This defense does not really fit with SnK though, since battle scenes have shown to be packed with much more story development than the cease-fire periods in between which merely trudge along. By the end of the show, none of the important questions are even answered. What a generous reward for sitting through a 25 episode series that could have been condensed into a 2 hour movie. \
Let's get back to what the show does well. The aerial animation sequences where soldiers are zip-lining at fast speeds, dodging buildings and Titans, and then going in for the kill are exhilarating. The soundtrack complements these scenes nicely, with its booming orchestrated jams and \"oooh AHHH\"'ing vocals. The sound effects emitted by the Titans, such as their steaming bodies, bone gnashing, and daunting footsteps, are well recorded. The production value is definitely high across all fronts making the action scenes the best I've seen all year.\
There is a lot of potential for SnK to be just as amazing as its action scenes, especially since it has a great cast of characters. The heart of any anime though is the story, and the various limbs paired with that heart are the characters. Shingeki no Kyojin's heart succeeds in pumping blood out to all those limbs, but severs its veins barring any characters to contribute its role in the system. The disruptive pacing and lack of content in SnK also leaves a lot left desired.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, better known as Attack on Titan, is at the moment the third most popular anime on MyAnimeList. But does it really deserve all the attention it's getting? \
Not in our opinion. \"Shingeki no Kyojin a 6/10?\" Yes, it could have been so much more than it was. Read all about our reasons in our review.\
~Story~ 5/10\
The plot had a lot of potential, however this show is the definition of 'wasted potential'. The second cours of the series wasn't half as good as the first one. We assume you all already know what happens in this anime, because pretty much everyone on MAL\
          \
        has already seen it (unless you've been living under a rock). So we're not going to tell you everything that happened, but we're going to stress the parts that we liked and the parts that we did not like. The story starts (for those 0,0001% who haven't seen this anime: spoiler alert) when enormous Titans invade the city where our main characters live. One of them then eat the mother of our main-main character. The entire audience already knew the mother so well, and everyone was so attached to her... oh wait. We only knew her for about 17 minutes. So it had close to no impact on the audience. The only person who was impacted was our teen-angsty main character, who becomes even more angsty in the progress (\"must... kill... all the titans!\"). Our heroes decide to join the Survey Corps and there they meet lance corporal Levi, arguably the best character of this show (at least he was in our opinion). For about 4 episodes we watch the struggle of mankind against the way stronger and overpowered Titans. But then... plot twist! Our teen-angsty main character somehow acquires the power to turn into a Titan. This ruined basically all battle scenes for us, as they became predictable and boring (our human-titan would always be able to win somehow). The struggle of mankind against the way stronger Titans turned into the struggle of our protagonist against another human Titan. Who could that be? Anyone with more than one brain cell could see, after about three seconds, who she was. Of course we're talking about our beloved Female Titan (spoiler alert) Annie-chan and of course it took our heroes 10 episodes to figure it out. This is exactly why we didn't enjoy the second half of the series in the least, because it became oh so predictable. The second season of this series is due to come out this year (if it isn't going to be delayed again) so we can't say much about the ending yet. Except for the fact that it's very open.\
[CONCLUSION]\
This series has an awesome first half, but it collapsed in the second one. It collapsed like Wall Maria collapsed because of the power of the Armored Titan. Also, the 'mystery' of the Female Titan was plain stupid.\
~Art~ 8/10\
We can all agree that the art in this anime was beyond awesome. It was very modern, and the battle scenes were very graphic and realistic. Also, we loved the animation of the 3DMG. There's nothing much we can remark on this aspect of the show, except for the fact that it was awesome. \
[CONCLUSION]\
The art in this show was amazing.\
~Sound~ 8/10\
Sie sind das Essen und wir sind die Jäger... I think even a reasonable amount of non-anime watchers have heard this sentence at some point in their life. And of course we love the opening as well. It was epic, bombastic and fitted the show. The second opening (which sadly got a lot of hate because it replaced the first one) was great in our opinion as well. The endings weren't that special, but they worked. The OST's in this show were amazing. We loved the battle music (e.g. The Reluctant Heroes, Vogel I'm Kafig). So again, nothing of importance that was bad about the sound.\
[CONCLUSION]\
This show has some awesome soundtracks and openings. There wasn't anything special about the endings, but it would have been more bothersome if the OST's were annoying, as those are the soundtracks you listen to when watching the anime. Luckily, they were awesome.\
~Characters~ 3/10\
So this is the aspect where the show is really weak. Let's start with our protagonist, Eren Jaeger, as we already said, the angstiest teenager ever. His life goal is to destroy all the titans and, ironically enough, he becomes a Titan himself. This could have led to him struggling with his beliefs, but instead he used it as his advantage. There was some logic behind this, but the directors could have done a lot more than this. He is a bland, angsty protagonist, and in our opinion, one of the worst characters in the show. Then there is Mikasa, the overpowered adopted sister (who of course has a sad backstory as well) of our protagonist, and with a little bit of training she manages to become stronger than soldiers who have been fighting titans for way longer than she has. Why? Because plot convenience and tragic backstory powers. She also has a crush on our bland protagonist. She is an overpowered love interest, nothing more and nothing less. But sadly enough for her, Eren has more interest in killing titans. What a pity.\
Then there's Armin, a smart but weak whiny best friend. He gets a proper amount of character development, and he's by far the best written character of the three main characters. It's just that he is very cliche, we've never seen a character like him before in a show... right? And then there is Levi. Levi is just epic. But not epic in an overpowered way, like Mikasa. Jean Kirchstein, who has a rivalry with Eren, which isn't a cliche either. Oh, and then there's Annie, whom we actually don't know much about, except for the fact that she's the Female Titan. Last but not least, there's Marco. But he wasn't half as good developed as he could have been. Haha.\
[CONCLUSION]\
The main three characters were poorly written, unoriginal and bland. A few of the side characters were pretty interesting, but the ones who really were, didn't get a lot of screen time. Good job writers.\
~Enjoyment~ 7/10\
This show is about humans killing enormous monsters with some sort of advanced bungeejumping ropes. Of course we enjoyed this. It was epic, but superficial. If you look into this show deeper, you'll find out that it doesn't go that deep. The story and characters were bland and poor, but the fights, background music and of course the art were great. It's certainly not as good of a show as some people make it out to be, but it definitely isn't as bad as some other people state it is. So if you want a simple show with some epic fights: look no further.\
[CONCLUSION]\
The show is superficial, but still enjoyable. \
No, this show isn't worth the title of 3rd most popular anime on MAL. But it certainly is an enjoyable show with awesome art and sound. If the characters had some proper development, this show could have been a lot better. Peace.\

Shingeki no Kyojin is the 12th best and 18th most popular anime ever. This might sound sarcastic, but hear me out. \
The idea is simple, yet the best ever because no one has done it before. Titans want to eat humans. Humans don't want to be eaten. Insert shit tons of action and blood and other cool shit ??? == anime of the century. \
The story itself is about this guy Eren who wants to\
          \
        beat some titans ass. 5 episodes later he beats some titans ass. 10 episodes later everything is titans ass, and I don't know what the fuck, but it's pretty good. There is also this 9/10 chick Mikasa who is pretty, then cute, then sexy, then slutty, then hot. So the series definitely has character development.\
The adaption relies on production values and yelling. We have action scenes, fight scenes, titan ass action scenes, titan ass fight scenes and action titan ass fight scenes. Blood, gore and flying body parts. Hot chicks, cool badass characters, insane and out of a mind coolfucks who are ON OUR SIDE. Ridiculously evil villains and faggots who just won't learn before main character kicks their ass! This is what I call quality entertainment. \
The voice acting is bloody impressive. Eren yells louder than any other  shonen protagonist. He has ideologies and people need to hear it. I personally love these scenes. It's not that the loudest voice is always right, but when someone cares to shout it out loud that loud, you just gotta admit that the man has a point. \
The music is fucking A. Even Mozar would say so. Whoever created the first Opening song is genius for writing a song which goes perfectly with anything and everything. This could be the OP of every anime and tv series ever made and people would say; Oh, boy, that is very fitting song. \
Shingeki no Kyojin creates what all people who work in the entertainment business aim at: entertainment. Not just any entertainment, but some serious titans-ass-getting-beaten-while-blood-flies entertainment, and that's why it is the 12th best anime ever. \

    Attack on Titan Review:\
I was well aware of the hype this show had gained in its first few episodes back when they originally aired. When it was already in the top 10 on MAL before even a quarter of the show had happened, I was actually annoyed. I thought: \"How dare people disrespect all these great shows by giving something that isn't even finished a higher rating.\" However, after waiting for the show to finish so I wouldn't have to endure the grueling torture that waiting for a new episode each week, I must say.... This show is fucking brilliant.\
Story 9/10:\
You all know the premise\
          \
        of AoT's story. Humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction by giant monsters called Titans and all those people who remain live inside these giant walls. Then one day a big ass titan decides to kick a huge hole in one of the walls and the titans once again begin wreaking havoc. In steps the main protagonist who has had some sort of traumatic experience due to the titans, and BAM, you have a story of a kid trying to avenge his mom and save the world. I know lately the post-apocalyptic setting has really been beaten to death primarily due to the Walking Dead's success, and quite frankly I was getting sick of it. On the surface, this does seem a lot like another zombie show (albeit with giants instead). But in reality, this show takes a well-known premise, and absolutely masters it. By focusing on the harshness of death, and not just killing people to kill people, the show shines. The show has a very dark tone. Plans rarely turn out good, and never end up perfect. This high level of despair mixed with small amounts of hope really match the setting and are a perfect tone for the story.The first few episodes are BY FAR the best start to a show that I have ever seen. Attack on Titan doesn't hold back an inch and thrusts you into the intensity of the story from episode 1. If you are someone who hates a show that ends every episode with a cliffhanger (think Code Geass), then you will not like this show. But for those of you who love sitting on the edge of their seats for a 10 hour marathon session, get ready to watch this show. Another extremely important part of the show's story that helps it stand out, is just the setting in general. The humans really do seem like they are caged in within the walls and lack freedom. Add on all of the hierarchy and corruption within the walls, and the world alone is an extremely intriguing place. Add on the constant fear of a Titan invasion and the world really becomes a place that you just don't want to live in. As for the ending, it was relatively satisfying, and did a nice job of setting up the second season. Obviously, it is too early to tell if there will be any plot holes, and it can be assumed that all unanswered questions would be answered in season 2. Overall, the story was brilliantly done and is the best in the \"post-apocalyptic/monster\" genre by far.\
Art 9/10:\
Attack on Titan has a very distinctive art style. The character outlines are thicker than normal, giving them a strong definition, and is a unique trait to the show. Titans were also very creatively made, looking similar to humans, but with larger heads and the creepiest facial expressions known to man. However, more parts of the art were the representations of the world and events in it. First off, the characters are all from a slew of different ethnic backgrounds, ranging from German, to Japanese, to Swedish, to who knows what. But the characters all had traits in their design that helped identify where exactly they were from. Also, the world itself was very well thought out. The inside of the walls are filled with bland colors like brown to represent the despair and cage-like atmosphere of the place. What was most impressive were the action scenes and what came with them. The scenes with the maneuver gear were absolutely stellar. A balanced blend of cg into the scenes really helped the fast paced nature of the maneuver gear shine. The blood and just shear brutality of the violence was also some of the more effective gore I've seen in anime. Attack on Titan shines in the art department for bringing such an intriguing world to life.\
Sound 9/10:\
Much like with the art department, I was blown away by the soundtrack to this show. Not only are the intros and outros all fucking amazing, but so are the rest of the songs. There is a solid balance between instrumental and vocal tracks, and they are all used with perfect timing with each scene. The music greatly helps change the mood of the show, especially when they want us to feel upbeat and hopeful for the characters... only to later kill all of our hopes and dreams. I really don't know what else to say about the OST besides that it is bloody fantastic. Once again, I am no expert on Japanese voice acting, but they were all good enough to not make me laugh or scoff at their performances. A trend is forming here, the sound department also gets an A.\
Characters 9/10:\
Here is where some people may disagree with me. A lot of people think that the main three characters, and maybe even the side characters, are too one dimensional to be rated this high. I completely disagree. First, we have Eren, who's mother is eaten in front of him when the Titans breach one of the walls. This traumatic event is one of the key motivators in why Eren wants to join the Survey Corps and kill the Titans. However, he has also been strongly influenced by Armin's interest in the world outside of the walls, and hates the feeling of being fenced in like cattle. Next there's Mikasa, Eren's adopted sister, who I believe is one of the best female characters in an anime to come out in a while. In a world where 99% of female characters are injected with Moe-roids or are tsundere, a character like Mikasa is refreshing. I understand she can seem insane when it comes to Eren, but try to think of it from her perspective. Like Eren, try to imagine having your family get brutally destroyed in front of you. After losing her first family, all she now cares about is protecting her new one in Eren, even if it means losing her life. These two characters show how much traumatic events can effect people, and how far they will go because of them. Armin is another main character who gets some criticism due to him coming off initially as a pussy. But Armin grows throughout the show, and learns that he's not as useless as he once thought. Really, all the characters (who survive), change and grow from where they were episode one to the end of the series, and that is what makes them special. Another huge part of what made the characters great though, was the attention put into the side characters. Every character has a back story, has fears, has emotion, personality, and everything else that could make them easy to relate to. Side characters in this show aren't just there to be killed off (even though ANYONE can be killed), every person is significant in providing insight into how brutal the world really is. Whether its the fear they have after seeing their first Titan, or the despair they feel when their best friend dies, the characters all display human traits, and aren't just there to be there. The side characters drastically help provide depth to the setting, displaying all of the selfishness, corruption, despair, and hope that the world they live in contains. Something random that I noticed during a big battle scene, was that when buildings were being crushed, and havoc was wreaking in a city, they didn't just show buildings getting destroyed like they do in most shows/movies. They actually showed the bodies of people in buildings flying out, the blood spilling, and just all of the real, disturbing stuff that you would see if something like this were to happen. The main characters were easy to sympathize with, and most importantly, the others were treated as people instead of objects, and that is why I gave this section such a high score.\
Enjoyment 10/10:\
When a show makes me SHAKE while watching, I know it is intense. There have only been two other shows to make me feel this much anxiety and excitement, those being Code Geass, and the 2nd half of Steins;Gate. The thing about Attack on Titan though, is it takes the action from Code Geass, and adds the psychological aspect of Steins;Gate, making one hell of a ride. I feel sorry for those of you who watched this show on a week to week basis, because basically every episode ends with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. Marathoning this show is really the best way to watch it, and its pace makes it feel more like one big movie than a tv show.The world and characters made me really think about what I would do in this situation. Attack on Titan really hits all the marks in the Enjoyment category: intensity, emotional impact, humor, wtf moments, etc. The only thing it really lacks that I really enjoy is a romance, but with it exceeding so well in every other aspect, I truly enjoyed this show as much as most of my other favorites.\
Recommendation:\
+.2 Buy it\
Buy this show. Actually, I would wait til season 2 airs and is over, then buy both of them regardless of how good season 2 is. I'm not saying that because I'm confident s2 will be great, but more because I'm gonna hate waiting for season 2 to come out. I just wish season 2 was out already! The anticipation is killing me!\
Overall 9.4/10:\
Attack on Titan is a work of art that deserves all the praise it has been getting. Both action packed, and thought provoking, the show is truly amazing. By no means am I declaring this show the greatest of all time like many seem to be doing. But Attack on Titan is nothing to be laughed at. Honestly, anyone who says they didn't like this show is probably trolling. After all that writing, I'm not sure what else to say besides \"This show is fantastic, stop watching porn and go watch this!\" All I can say is that I hope that Attack on Titan can be wrapped up in two seasons because I won't be able to handle the suspense of waiting for a third season.\
The Verdict:\
An intense ride that blasts off from episode 1 and never looks back.\
Pros:\
+ Intriguing setting/concept\
+ Death and gore is purposeful and powerful\
+ Fantastic OST\
+ Amazing action scenes\
+ Characters are extremely human\
Cons:\
- Unanswered questions left for season 2\
- Main characters can appear 1 dimensional\
If you liked Attack on Titan, watch...\
Fullmental Alchemist Brotherhood:\
Both shows are intense and action packed, with the main male leads both being primarily motivated by the deaths of their mothers.\
Spiderman:\
maneuver gear = web swinging\
\
9.4/10 - Brilliant\

    A lot of people hate SnK.  Half of them just don't enjoy it, and half of them are just bandwagoning.  Personally, I love the show.  However, I could understand how somebody might not enjoy it.  Here's my breakdown:\
Story: 8\
I gave the story a 8.  I know it falls into the whole post-apocalyptic-future-where-humans-have-to-survive-against-horrible-monsters cliché that's really overdone in TV and movies today, but I really enjoy the setting.  The plot is pretty good, with some titan fighting and some internal affairs within the walls.  It doesn't pull a Star Wars prequel trilogy with the non-action stuff and make it\
          \
        boring, so that's a plus, and the parts without action and excitement are pretty minimal.  The pacing is nice as well.\
Art: 9\
The visuals are very well drawn.  The animation is very crisp, and you can almost feel when the 3D maneuver gear pulls a character somewhere, or when a character cuts the back of a titans neck.\
Sound: 10\
The show has an epic soundtrack to compliment the action, and 4 amazing themes (2 OPs and 2 ending themes for the recap movies) made by Linked Horizon.  Amazing music all around.  The sound effects are very nice as well, from movement with the 3D maneuver gear to the sword slices.\
Character: 6 (Minor spoilers for the first episode or so)\
A few of the characters are well developed, but Eren through most of the series is a pretty unoriginal character.  He keeps whining about trying to kill all the titans to avenge his mother and everything.  The other characters are pretty interesting, even if they are clichéd six ways from Sunday.  Levi is the strong silent type who is a germaphobe, Armin is the weak 3rd wheel always being saved by his friends, Mikasa is the protective older sister, etc.\
Enjoyment: 10\
The fight scenes are fun as hell to watch, and the other stuff is engaging.  You want to know what's happening inside the walls when others are fighting titans.\
Overall: 9\
Overall, I enjoyed the anime even with its flaws, and can't wait for next season.\

    I usually do not overlook popular anime in my time because I hated overrated shows with fan service, dull action scenes, stupid harem, cliché characters, flat plot with hideous endings and the same theme over and over again. Originality must be a priority to storytellers, writers and whatnot; however, some just never learn to see that way. I never intended to watch series that exceed 200 episodes that leads to nothingness and endlessness. It seems that the plot remained unfinished by adding fillers and a large amount of recaps. Animes like Naruto, One Piece, any more never ends any more. In my case, I do\
          \
        not watch them because of reasons like too many episodes, fillers, overrated, hentai and a lot more. \
Shingeki No Kyojin has been a well-known anime of 2013. My friends and classmates are all talking about it. Social Networking sites share its photos, quotes and captions. Some would even start buying its merchandise. I had doubts about it but because I was bored and curious by its title and art, I eventually dipped in to its mud of adventure; thus, taking a long ride of a new mysterious story. \
Imagine yourself reading a book in your room or watching anime or doing chores then suddenly a huge man-like creature appears and grabs you by the hand and intends to feed on you. The plot can immediately be caught on its title, “Attack on Titan” which obviously means that characters will kill titans. But what are Titans and their true nature? The story remains hidden unless you watch the anime. On the other hand, it’s not only about attacking but there is a subplot too. Friendships and families will be broken. Chances of survival are risky in this anime. Choices and decisions will be hard to make. It is a bit unexpected because you will wonder if they will live or if they are going to defeat the Titans. I give the story a 9.7 just because the ending is a bit flat and there are major points that were missing. It is also lacking its comedy factor but I think that’s why people love this show. It sticks to its plot and it is so serious that you will get hooked by it without thinking that it is a detective themed anime. Let’s just hope for a second season because we really want to know the mystery behind the Titans. \
Art is just beautiful. It’s not the typical wide eyed anime characters with big head and super thin bodies and shitty moe. It is just astounding and unique. Not all graphics can be this good. Dark outlines and creative backgrounds are maintained in this show. Trust me, you will be indulged. \
The music is quite creative. The main theme is like the Sound of Silence kind of tone because of the god-like humming. There are English lyrics in the background music as well which makes it memorable but in my opinion I didn’t really find the Openings and Endings interesting because they may be related to SNK’s aura and story but I just can’t help but think that it lacks its WOW factor. Voice actors were full of emotions so no questions asked and no problems there either. \
I can see why they like this show, the characters were well written and made. They were all emotional human beings like us. I mean, who wouldn’t panic after seeing your parents being devoured by giant creatures. Creepy, right? Some characters are undeniably crazy and have different personalities that I know you guys would love. Main characters were likable. I specially loved Eren Jaeger because he is the realest man I’ve ever seen in an anime show. He isn’t a pretender and he fights for what he believes in. Other than Eren, Levi is also one of my favorites. He looks cool and he isn’t overreacting. Also, Mikasa and Armin are lovable too. It’s funny how these characters act like true human beings with feelings despite the fact that they are works of fiction. I didn’t hate some of the characters but hands down to the antagonists because they were despicable. \
I enjoyed this anime even though some episodes were boring and episode 13.5 was a replay (blow off). I like the fact that it proved that fan service isn’t needed to make an anime fun to watch. Action scenes were high appreciated in this show. It was totally uncalled for. I never would have wanted more action in my life. It was nothing I could ever imagine. It was better than I ever expected. I expect that it was a total let down and that people are being overrated but I ended up eating my words. It is also good that it stick to the story and that romance isn’t the target of the show. I just wanted a better ending that’s all. \
Overall, I was fascinated by it. To those people who still haven’t seen SNK should be literally eaten by Titans. It is by far the best anime of 2013. I say that even though I haven’t seen all the anime aired in 2013. I would be happy if everyone would watch it so if you’re reading this review, promise me that you will watch SNK.\

    This is my first review on this site, so please be kind. No huge spoilers below, but I am talking about the series as a whole, so read at your own risk.\
Story - 10\
This is what makes SnK so hugely compelling, at least for me. The world is wonderfully conceived and it shows – we're given extra information on eyecatches about the history of the walls, the functioning of weaponry, the breeding of horses, the layout of towns, and anything else that might ever interest the viewer on top of and reinforcing anything contained in the actual episode. These factoids do wonders to establish a\
          \
        sense of place and of culture, to make the lands within the walls so much more real. Pains are taken to establish the antiquity of the walls and the history of the settlements within them. The three military groups that protect humanity are given more backstory than some of the characters, sometimes through little things like naming the main characters’ graduating class “the 104th Trainees Squad” or an exploratory mission “the 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls.” This establishes a history and lineage that make for an engrossing viewing experience. Overall, the world of SnK is among the most fleshed-out worlds I've encountered in all of fiction, and it sucked me in effortlessly.\
As far as the actual story goes, suspense is certainly not hard to find, and in fact might be overused. I know others appreciate how fast-paced the show is, but I felt it to be a little too rapid, perhaps trying to cram too much story into its 25 episodes. The suspense is built quite well, with just enough foreshadowing to instill a mood (usually dread) in the viewer without beating him/her over the head with it (though the cliffhangers do get old after a while). Characters are brought in and out of the plot deftly, but only sometimes is the vast reserve of supporting characters juggled effectively (see below).\
The setting and plot intersect perfectly in that the ultimate goal of the protagonists is to uncover the reason for the appearance and existence of the Titans, which drove humanity inside the walls and is the cause of all the other differences between their world and our own. That lofty goal often takes a back seat, however, to intervening events and restrictions -- some from outside the walls, some from within.\
Characters - 6\
This is the back of SnK's neck -- that is to say, its weak spot. As some other reviewers have pointed out, there is too much passage of time and too much bickering among characters for there not to be more development in them. In the moment, the characters are incredibly relatable, in that the Titans put intense fear in them, fear not only for their lives but also for their families, their hopes and dreams, and humanity itself. The development of the characters, however, leaves a lot to be desired.\
Eren, nominally the main character, simply doesn't develop. He is known for his catchphrase \"I'm going to kill all the Titans,\" which he utters at least a dozen times over the course of the series, nearly evenly dispersed from the first episode to the last. His character blew me away for the first 6-8 episodes, but after that the unyielding and indomitable determination that makes him so compelling a character began to wear thin, and his approaching every situation (fighting Titans, recovering from wounds, eating soup) with the same reckless intensity borders on the absurd by the time the series ends. About 2/3 of the way through the series, there is even an episode in which we are initially led to believe he had changed and began to trust his peers and superiors, but later he throws that out the window and decides to just try and kill things instead.\
The characters introduced with the Survey Corps don’t really get backstories, and as such aren’t very compelling. We are supposed to see Levi as reticent and mysterious when he is first introduced, when really the viewers are just left in the dark because of receiving absolutely no information about him. That's forced mystery, which is a poor substitute for the real thing. Similarly, Erwin is cast as noble and brave, but comes off as imperious, because he commands absolute obedience and we never quite know why. We know Hanji’s research, but we have no idea how or why she ended up as the Corps’ token scientist.\
Meanwhile there are two dozen other characters milling about, some of whose names you will forget until they get eaten or suddenly become relevant to the plot’s progression. Notable in this category for me is Jean, who is boring, plain-looking, and forgettable even as he interacts with the main characters on a regular basis.\
The only character that genuinely grows is Armin, who is paralyzed with fear at the beginning of the series but who gradually develops confidence in his own physical prowess and especially his tactical brilliance. In doing so, however, he becomes a character on par with seasoned military commanders, which strains credibility. Late in the series Armin has virtually no flaws, like Eren's other sidekick, Mikasa. So we are left with our core trio – one character who keeps giving in to his main character flaw, one who overcame his, and one who never had one. Real compelling.\
If you are watching SnK to be entertained, the characters are perfectly serviceable. But if you are watching to have a little think along with your entertainment, they are kind of a letdown. The plot loves to play head games with the viewers, but the biggest trick it's playing on us is making us think these stock characters are worth biting our nails over.\

I will leave better assessment of this to others, as I am of the \"if I don't notice it, then it's good\" school of art appreciation. It's a beautifully illustrated series, but I'm an uneducated buffoon who couldn't tell you why I think that. As I noted above, however, I think several of the minor characters don’t look distinctive enough and are therefore difficult to remember. \
The sound is also good, but I can't speak much to it. Both OPs are in-your-face and inspiring at the same time. The second is just good but the first one is outstanding.\
Enjoyment - 10\
Overall - 9\
This is a hugely entertaining series and probably my new personal favorite. I’m willing to overlook my misgivings about character development until I see the second series that it seems certain we'll get fairly soon (and read the manga). I think this is the kind of show that’s in it for the long haul, and I’m hopeful that what I perceive as a lack of development is actually just really slow development. But character problems or no, the engaging world of SnK is well worth your attention and the roller-coaster story will keep it until the very end.",

    I really hated this anime before. I'm so glad I gave it a second chance. Now, it's one of my favourites.\
Story: 10\
The story is set in a dystopian world where giant human-like creatures (Titans) try to annihilate the human race. One day, Titans invade the main character's (Eren) district. Because of revenge, Eren strives to eliminate all Titans. At first, I didn't really like the story. But as the story developed, I got engrossed.\
Art: 10\
The art was beautiful. It showed their expressions very clearly. The landscape and bird's eye views gave me a clear picture of the setting. The characters were also nicely drawn. The\
          \
        colours were realistic--not too colourful. And may I just say--Levi was sublimely drawn. I can see why people like him so much.\
Sound: 9\
The voice actors/actresses did an amazing job bringing their character to life; I'm talking about the Japanese version. The voices suited the characters well--not one was out of place. The first OP and ED were awesome-- the visuals, and how the visuals went along with the beat of the music. However, I gave it a 9 because of the second OP; I just think that it was too happy/hopeful for my taste. Nevertheless, I just prefer the first OP than the second.\
Character: 10\
The characters were unique, and they all had their own little quirks. Their personalities went well with the art. Most of them were badass-- they're just so cool. Need I say more?\
Enjoyment and Overall: 10\
Though I didn't enjoy it at first, I'm glad I gave it a chance. I think I'm going to be obsessed with this anime for a while. \
Ultimately, this is a great anime.\

    I like that when I turn on MAL, I see all of this critical acclaim going to one particular series that has stirred up a lot of hype and praise for being bold and original, while also pushing the boundaries of what an anime could be. Some people decided to rate this one series a 10 because of the first 5 episodes, and how it shocked them to see how the main character supposedly dies in battle from the latest Titan attack. Others try to sugarcoat the hype it receives, claiming that. \"Well, it is the best series I've seen all season, so it defiantly\
          \
        deserves all the acclaim.\" Well I hate to break to you guys, but this is by far one of the most mediocre and overrated anime series I have ever seen to hit the big screen, or in realistic terms, my computer.\
So where to begin with this review? How about the first five episodes? That defiantly deserves some mention, considering how a lot of people point to those episodes as to reasons why it deserves the acclaim it has gotten. And, if I have to give credit where credit is due, the first 5 episodes were the best in the series. That however doesn't say much for the remaining episodes though. \
The idea of a human race trying to survive the apocalypse by building walls to avoid superior beings is an interesting concept. It gives the audience a sense of danger and fear for the characters fighting to survive, as they are mostly inferior and ill-equipped to fight these Titans. We want to see them win these nearly impossible battles, by strategizing their attack and working together by building bonds and trust with one another.\
However things take a turn for the worse, starting off with episode 7, as the series brilliant pacing and engaging story starts to take a nose dive (episode 6 was more of a character-building moment for Mikasa, but I'll get into that later). My problem with episode 7 and most of the other episodes, is how slowly paced they  were and also how they were not ass engaging as the previous 5 episodes. It slows down, and doesn't advance much of story, as characters go through tedious monologues about how scared they are or the most recurring response, \"What are we going to do?\" How about you fight, instead of standing on a building for an entire 20 minutes contemplating your death!\
 This can also be said about the mediocre standoff the main characters had with the Survey Corps, when the Corps were trying to decide if they were friends are foes. I found myself laughing at how long this took, while in real life, this situation would've been taken care of in 5 minutes, not 22. \
Alright, alright enough with these pacing issues because if I continue to talk about these issues for the other episodes, I could take all day, but I'm sure you all already get my point. Now to move on to the most annoying aspect of this series; the characters. \
I find it insulting that a series like this with the amazing production values it contains has the least interesting characters I have ever seen. Eren is cliché and generic compared with other shonen characters in the past. His goal, which is cliché itself, is to destroy all the evil in the world, which are the Titans. You may say that Eren has every reason to feel this way, since he saw how his mother was brutally murdered, but even this idea is overexaggerrated, especially in the next to last episode when it takes him yet another full episode to realize what he's fighting for. Btw, if he also wants to help save humanity, he shouldn't try to destroy an entire city in the process when fighting titans, killing innocent civilians. Of course there's that whole Titan transformation Eren goes through, but I'll get into that later.\
Then there's Mikasa, the love interest to Eren. You may think I might like her more because she's, you know, smart compared to her other colleagues who are all idiots, and also because she has a very traumatizing past. However after episode 6, there's not much depth added to her character, excluding the idea that she's a really badass fighter who's good at chopping off the fingers of Titans. Her love for Eren is also overexaggerated as she seems to also make stupid decisions when defending him. Yes I know Eren helped save her in the past, but I wish the series had given her more than being a life-debt to Eren.\
And of course, there's Armin, the worst of the three. The reason I say that is not only because he's a whiny little brat, but also because  I can expect his character development from a mile away. He starts off whiny, scared and useless, then starts to work with others to defeat the oncoming evil, while also delivering cliché speeches to stop the stupidity of the other members of the Survey Corps. I soon realized that Armin should've had a different role in the series, a strategist who helps plan the attack on the Titans while leaving it to the Survey Corps to fight. He should just stay the hell away from fighting because he is completely useless and is also a liability. Don't believe, just ask Eren, oh wait! The fact that he's even in the Survey Corps baffles me because he has no fighting ability at all.\
And finally to explain what really did the nail in the coffin for me; Eren's transformation into a Titan. Some people believe bigger is always better, but this is not necessarily the case. As I said before, I liked the idea of the human race having problems fighting the Titans and losing to them because they were inferior to them in size. This creates tension and a sense of danger for them, as you don't know what will happen next. When Eren transforms, all of that tension and danger is gone as he goes through a rampage killing each Titan one on one. It destroys everything that made the first 5 episodes so good, and burns its way though an entirely different path that is least interesting. It's like someone handing you the answers to a test before you take it. You don't have to worry about a thing, just follow along and everything should be ok. There is no longer any more excitement or engagement in the series. You expect the expected, and you're left feeling bored. \
Yes this anime has great animation. Yes it has great music. Yet it's lacking substance and a reason to care for what goes on in the story.  \

    Every once in a while a show comes along that everyone is all gun ho on. This show is often not what everyone expects. After 15+ episodes the hype train turns sour. Then the bandwagon starts jumping. Then the show ends. It's MAL rankings have dropped significantly. The spoilers become jokes. Everyone puts it behind them as a mediocre series and all is forgotten. Usually I am able to avoid the hype train but on this one occasion I was approached by someone very close to me about this. \
Attack on Titan is a major letdown. The initial episode is great. Jaw dropping massacre and\
          \
        an immediate introduction to the cruelty of this world. This ladies and gentlemen is how you sell people on your show. The problem is that AoT refuses to let up on the gore. Episode after episode AoT is littered with brutal imagery simply for shock and awe. This doesn't go away until nearly the end of the series. Once its been established it doesn't need constant overselling. Far to much time is spent trying to sell the viewer on what they are watching rather then telling a story.\
Eventually AoT does get moving on the story front until it jumps over years in a single episode. Time constraints do limit what anime can do compared to manga but considering the speed of the series later on the jump is unjustified. What stabilizes everything is something im going to call the first event. Something happens that completely changes the premise of the show. From this point on AoT is something that is theoretically worth watching. It may not be the most entirely unique thing out there but it's entirely watchable. The downside is AoT would much rather show images of people leaning against walls than actually doing things so it spends allot of time wasting time rather than working with their new premise.\
It turns out there's a reason for that though. Despite the fact that the premise of the show has already changed once, AoT starts dropping the least subtle hints in the world of anime, that the Titans are not the real enemy. This is the worst part of AoT so far. There is no reason to go on a conspiracy train when you have a solid engaging premise right in front of you. It puts some serious dents in the show when what the show is supposed to be about is not what the show is doing at any point. Attack on Titan seems intent on, episode by episode, trying to introduce a new plot hook each time as though its viewers wont be back next week. None of this pays off in the end when AoT expects everyone to be surprised by the secret that everyone already knows.\
What really crushes Attack on Titan is the second event. To this point AoT has been a series crushes any hope at every opportunity. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. The one shining beacon that gives a sliver of hope is our hero. Then the second event happens. Immediately everyone is shocked by the reveal. Taking a step back however brings the logical implication that everything is over. At this point the show might as well kill every character in it, drop the mic, and go home. There is no recourse. Everything that happens after this is an arbitrary and pointless endeavor. Attack on Titan has no reason to continue save for becoming overly increasingly stupid.\
Ultimately Attack on Titan is pointless. Hopefully it does not get a second season. Hopefully the money goes elsewhere. Hopefully someone learned something from this. Watch if your really bored. Don't be surprised if its not stisfactory\

    Been a while since I'm addicted to an Anime but this been driving me crazy. Before taking this to my to watch list I was like, eww the cover is a huge dude with no skin on the giant wall, what so great about it? Then I just bypass this. But my freaking friend won't stop talking about it every time we hangout, and convince me to watch it and also to write a review about it.\
Before we start this is my first review on MyAnimeList, and thanks for your time reading this.\
Story (9/10) : This is the kind of anime that you can't predict\
          \
        what next episode going to show next. The story already building since the 1st episode and wanting you to watch. Based on the faith on humanity, titans are locked outside of the city with the giant wall built few hundred years and suddenly they broke the wall and start rampage the town with lots of satisfactory bloody death scenes. This is just the 1st episode! Seriously, except for Gantz, which anime at the start have a massacre killing spree? \
Art (8/10) : The art is very solid. Overall environment is well drawn. The fighting and flying/jumping scene is just top notch. However, the hard outline on the character is just not my cup of tea. They should have easy on the outline, may be is just their style of drawing, but I feel lighter outline will be better. I think majority of the viewers are OK with this thou.\
Sound (10/10) : This is the best strong parts of this anime. First is the opening theme, is just epic! Well designed PV that doesn't show much of the story but still show the acting scene and some character introduction and weapon are hinting in the opening. Endings are great with a softer style. The soundtracks are just right on the spot, abuse of rock and electronic BGM is just fits into the show.\
Character (8/10) : Well developed from the beginning and slowly evolved to the main story. However, some character gets strong attention in the beginning but ended pretty early which is kind of waste as they have strong personality and good supporting role. \
Overall (9/10) : It won't be my all time best anime, but it will fit on my top 10 Anime all time due to solid production and unique storyline. This anime has set a higher benchmark of the future anime with almost perfect in every aspect. \
Thanks for reading and I am sorry for my grammatical error since English is not my mother tongue. I have some experience in writing review on other anime site but that was long ago, and currently I'm having strong passion again in Anime. I'll be writing more review in the future, and please enjoy your anime!\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is the shows which constantly receives high end ratting not only on MAL, but all around internet and is almost constantly praised as one of the best anime ever (or at least, so far). \
So, what is the best and most amazing thing about the show?\
Death of the characters.\
Entire show basically runs of the initial shock factor built around psychical intimidation of the viewers by suggestive themes of gore, agony, despair and death. Most characters die horribly screaming and pissing their pants while being torn apart and eaten alive by giant monsters and show creators didn’t spared any expense in filling the\
          \
        show with this kind of scene to attract every kind of sadist weirdo anime community have to offer. Even though I cannot deny the fact they are very good in making suggestive scenes and psychically intimidating the viewer, but it’s not enough to make a show good if only thing authors do is to revel in top-end gore. It may be realistic, considering the real history of human race filled with wars, but it certainly isn’t entertaining or it shouldn't be.\
In time, you stop to care about the death shows display as you are completely dulled just like the character they introduce late in the season. Suggestive scenes which shocked you first doesn’t mean anything to you any more as you stop being influenced by all that bloody carnage authors throw you again and again. \
\
Apart of that, show doesn’t have anything to offer. \
Story is nearly pointless. It doesn’t matter if you have titans, giants, zombies or tentacle monsters from outer space, only important thing is they kill people and you are probably expected to enjoy it. Story and setting serves only purpose and that is killing character. \
How possible a medieval society built a walls higher than skyscrapers? Doesn’t matter, giants break in and kill people. Only weapon society created is steampunk spiderman gear with retractable blades? How this suppose to be realistic or effective? Don’t ask, most important thing is that things deliver characters to their early demise and you can enjoy their death in hands of ever hungry monsters. How come main characters are nearly immortal and superior fighters always out of the danger while lifespan of average fighter counts in split second? Not to mention that plot relevant question as origin of the titans or what is hidden in that basement are never answered as writers were obviously too busy to kill the side cast. \
Character development? No, we will rather show you death of another random guy.\
And if story really need to follow the [i]Everyone Dies[/i] scenario, why we have three main character who are nearly immortal or do take plot armor to the letter? \
Well, because you need them around so story can show you … more side character deaths!\
 After an initial shock and raising a lot of question, it forgets about everything and undergoes a very strange pacing when they skip entire weeks of years just to show you … another side character death, another suffering, another viewer intimidation. \
In the end, enjoyment of this story is near nil for a viewer who isn’t latent sadistic psychopath who revel is seeing death at least in animated form.\
Story and plot losts itself at cca episode 2. Drama is there, but build only on suffering. Nothing nice even happen. Characters either die or are plainly annoying… \
I went through the story to the end, hoping for either come conclusion or anwers which would give this massacre some meaning in the end, but it never came. While I must admit show had the potential in making me “expecting something” I have to say I would be best if I’d never watch the show. ",

    What do you get when you combine the following and have it licensed by none other than Funimation Entertainment?\
- A concept that allows for battles of epic proportions to go down\
- Absolutely gorgeous art direction\
- Flawless animation done by none other than a company like Madhouse, Bones, or Production I.G\
- An enthralling soundtrack that never ceases to get the blood pumping while also sending chills down your spine when the moment calls for it\
- An English dub with great actors such as J. Michael Tatum, Mike McFarland, and Matthew Mercer on-board\
Ordinarily, you'd have something that would have me squealing like a pig in excitement (i.e.\
          \
        FMA Brotherhood, Hellsing Ultimate, Stand Alone Complex). Unfortunately, horrendous pacing and an extremely unlikeable lead character (along with some other problems) ruin what ultimately could've been an extremely enjoyable experience. Would I say that it's the greatest anime ever? Hell to the fucking no. Would I say it's trash? I know I've said it in the past when I was a hypercritical little shit starting out on MAL. Of course, now I would say that it's fair enough. There was some good, a lot of bad, and a lot of frustration to be had but in comparison to some of the other crap that exists, Attack on Titan isn't deserving of anyone's visceral hatred.\
But before I get into this review, a question: why do people like post-apocalyptic programmes so much? While everyone's reasons can and inevitably will differ, the reason why I like post-apocalypse as a genre boils down to one thing: survival. Think about it: you have something like a cataclysmic nuclear war go down, what's the end result? The world as we know it is down for the count and humanity is no longer at the top of the food chain. The thrill that I get from watching a post-apocalyptic show or playing a post-apocalyptic video game comes from watching someone make it through this new wasteland, never knowing what's going to go down next.\
Unfortunately, this leads to quite a few problems on my end. The biggest problem that I have with post-apocalyptic shows is the fact that all too often, they try to build up the suspense but they spend too much time talking and then the show quickly becomes tedious rather than enthralling. I don't know about you, but I don't really find the idea of a bunch of people huddled around in cramped quarters repeating the same shit we heard over and over again exciting. If I go into a zombie flick, I want to see some fucking zombies getting their heads blown off.\
No matter which way you look at it, Attack on Titan is pretty much a medieval zombie apocalypse, just replace the zombies with man-eating giants. Of course, I knew that from the very beginning but I was willing to overlook since the trailers and shit that I saw on YouTube made this show look like something that is a definite \"must-watch\" and this shit's on Netflix, so I pretty much have no excuse. So when I actually got around to watching the pilot episode of Attack on Titan, I've got to say that Wit Studio and Production I.G REALLY had the set-up perfect. \
We start out with an image of a titan peering over the wall, the music is all intense and lively, and then it cuts to some dudes on horseback that are about to kill a titan which perfectly transitions into the first opening sequence of the show. Do I really need to go any further with the show's first opening? I swear, it's something that NEVER ceases to get me pumped for some mind-numbingly awesome action sequences. Fucking hell, it's no wonder this show is so popular.\
Unfortunately, the good stops there and doesn't come back until the last 5 minutes of the episode because absolutely nothing of substance happens. Yes, you heard me right: for a good 15 minutes of the first episode, nothing of substance happens. How could this possibly be so? Well... Attack on Titan was adapted from what is primarily an ongoing battle shonen manga which is probably its biggest flaw. When you get right down to it, action mangas tend to blow through a LOT of pages that are spent depicting large-scale battles in every chapter with little to no dialogue (ref: Gantz).\
Adapting an ongoing battle shonen manga is a difficult endeavour because you always run the risk of padding and of course, much-maligned filler episodes. Wit Studio and Production I.G mostly side-stepped the filler episode problem by limiting themselves to adapting the first eight volumes of the manga. Unfortunately, the time that was allotted for Attack on Titan was far too large for the material it was trying to adapt and as such, it ends up resorting to padding so that it can fill out the episode length. Guess how Attack on Titan likes to fill out its episode length.\
Does Attack on Titan further elaborate on concepts brought up in the manga? Does it give screen time to characters that were underdeveloped? Will it allow us to see certain characters in a different light than the way they were portrayed in the source material? Hell to the fucking no. Attack on Titan offers nothing in the way of adaptation expansion and instead relies heavily on repeating the same shit that we've heard over and over again. This is the same trap that programmes such as The Walking Dead have been falling into for years, constantly trying to build up suspense but failing to do so in the process.\
To make matters worse, the pacing in Attack on Titan is absolutely atrocious, almost to Michael Bay levels. Some moments progress ridiculously fast while other moments slow down to a grinding halt. There's absolutely no consistency whatsoever. Just to put things into perspective, the two biggest arcs in the series (Attack on Trost and Expedition 57) are 9 and 6 episodes respectively. I honestly don't give a shit about what you say but the amount of time spent for the result that we got was far too much, especially given how much was adapted from the manga. What's so bad about a 1-cour season, anyway?\
That's only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on for hours about all the faults that SNK has with its story but that would be too much work on my end (especially for something that's probably going to be mass-downvoted anyway by butthurt fanboys). I do understand why people keep giving Attack on Titan shit for not going further with the concepts and shit that it brings up, but let's be real here: this is an adaptation of the first eight volumes of a battle shonen manga. World building wasn't really on the cards to begin with, especially if we're this early in its run (it DOES publish on a monthly basis, after all).\
I'm sure that in due time, all will be revealed to us. Attack on Titan's manga sales have topped One Piece's in Japan and it's been like that for a while (if I'm not mistaken). It's inevitable for there to be more adaptations of Attack on Titan in the coming years. There IS a second season announced along with two recap movies. Provided that the aforementioned three are big enough hits in Japan and the manga remains a bestseller, there's bound to be an adaptation in the works that will hopefully explain all this stuff (assuming that the second season doesn't do crap in that regard).\
I can definitely understand the praise that people give this show for its story since it is a fairly intriguing concept with less-than-stellar but still relatively enjoyable execution, but I CANNOT say the same about the characters. When people tell me that Attack on Titan has some of the best characters in all of anime, I just want to know what kind of mind-altering drugs they're on. Don't get me wrong, Attack on Titan's characters aren't horrible. Rather, it's just one bad apple that REALLY spoils the bunch. I'm of course talking about Eren fucking Jaeger.\
I can forgive the fact that the military enlists teenagers in their ranks, given the circumstances that humanity has been placed in. I can forgive that a lot of the secondary and tertiary characters are more or less forgettable since they're just going to be eaten anyway so why bother developing them? What I CAN'T forgive is the fact that despite all the circumstances that Eren is given, I cannot find the smallest modicum of sympathy for him (or even one redeeming trait). Eren is your typical, hot-headed battle shonen protagonist in the worst possible ways.\
Let me make one thing clear: I don't have much of a problem with hot-headed lead characters in shows I watch or manga that I read. In fact, they occasionally have a certain charm to them (ref: Inuyasha and Kyo Sohma). This is because I can find something redeemable about them. In Inuyasha's case, he's an obvious male tsundere who cares about his friends and can hold his own weight in battle. In Kyo Sohma's case, he's also an obvious male tsundere who cares about his friends/family that I find incredibly empathetic to say the least.\
I have absolutely nothing of the sort to say about Eren. He's one of those loud-mouthed and hot-headed battle shonen protagonists that's all bark and next-to-no bite. He's also one of those protagonists that just does not know when to shut up (and it doesn't help that his voice in both the Japanese AND English dub is extremely grating). Any time I see him on screen, I'm begging whatever God there is to just make him either shut up or get smacked around some by Levi (the courtroom episode is my favourite since Levi brutally beat up Eren and I found it RIDICULOUSLY satisfying).\
I also don't like how his goal is so vague to the point where all he really wants to do is \"kill all titans.\" I don't know about you, but I'm REALLY sick of characters who have ridiculously large goals/ambitions like becoming the very best, like no one ever was. It also doesn't help that he becomes some kind of pseudo-Messiah because of some \"hidden power\" people found out he had toward the middle half of the show (around the Attack on Trost and Expedition 57 arcs, coincidentally enough). Do I even need to explain why this is bullshit? Seriously, do I?\
Jean, one of the few secondary characters whom I've grown to like would've been an infinitely better protagonist and could've given a much needed sense of realism that the show desperately needs. Rather than some ambiguously vague goal like killing all titans, his goal was initially about self-preservation but over time, he's come to change his views and has proven himself to be a capable tactician. The same can be said about Armin, but he starts out as a spineless coward who wants to prove his own worth. Unfortunately... he's one of the characters who repeats a lot of the same shit everyone else says thanks to all the constant padding that this show suffers from, but I attribute that to the source material more than anything else.\
That brings me over to Mikasa. A lot of people say that she could've been a much more competent lead role, but I'm not too sure. Mikasa for one thing is a combat prodigy who's emotionally dependent on our little Scrappy-Doo of a protagonist. While she certainly is entertaining, any character development she could've had over the course of the series is instantly hindered by her overdependence on Eren. Yes, her backstory was certainly shocking and got me to see her in a relatively new light. Unfortunately, her overdependence on Eren pretty much leaves her stuck as this Mary Sue/possible yandere-type character. If you were to remove those two aspects about her character and kept everything the same, she could easily be written out of the story and not much would change. Hell, shit would actually be a lot better now that I think about it since she won't be around to bail Eren's ass out of stupid situations. But I digress, for it's now time to move over to the production values.\
While Wit Studio is a relative newcomer to animation, it should be noted that a good portion of their staff came from Production I.G, and I.G themselves co-produced this series. Can you really go wrong with a company whose resume consists of visual masterpieces like the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise and Guilty Crown? Even if you don't like the story or the characters, there's no denying that it's a real treat for the eyes. The medieval setting his handled beautifully, the action sequences are flawlessly animated and nothing short of entertaining, and what's more is that it has this relatively unique art style where the colour palatte adds an orange hue to almost everything and  all the characters, titans, and such are drawn with thick outlines. Some might not like it, but I certainly do. \
If I really had to lodge one complaint with the art/animation, it's with the designs of the eponymous titans themselves. Unlike a select few titans (i.e. the Colossus Titan, the Armoured Titan), almost all the titans in this show are basically naked humanoids with really bizarre facial expressions. Am I supposed to find this shit terrifying? Yeah... no. I'd love to say that they look retarded, but that's an awful way to describe them. Let's just say that unlike the creatures from Gantz, Berserk, or Parasyte: The Maxim, the titans in Attack on Titan are NEVER going to haunt my nightmares. I really hope that there are more titans introduced with unique designs in the coming chapters and second season, since the Colossus Titan and Armoured Titan look REALLY good.\
Sound-wise, the OST was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano whose resume consists of programmes such as Aldnoah.Zero, Blue Exorcist, Guilty Crown, and Gundam Unicorn. Say what you will about the shows he's worked on, but I can safely say that this man knows how to compose an enthralling soundtrack. If you want any examples, look no further than the iconic first opening theme song, \"Guren no Yumiya\" by Linked Horizon. It sets the stage perfectly, and while the actual substance of the show varies drastically from what this opening leads you to believe, it never ceases to get my blood pumping and make me anticipate what will go down next. I have just as much praise for the rest of the OST, so no complaints there.\
Unfortunately, there has to be that one glaring flaw which mars something that could've ultimately been flawless and that is Eren Jaeger, specifically his voice actors. Eren is an annoying character so I can't hold too much against the VAs who portrayed him, but my GOD do their voices give me migraines whenever I have to hear them (specifically, whenever Eren is shouting). It's especially worse in the English dub, since Bryce Papenbrook (who is a decent actor by the way) CANNOT shout for shit without making me wish I had ear plugs. The rest of the English dub is surprisingly well-cast and acted, but it's just that one little detail that makes beg whatever forces exist in this universe to end my suffering.\
On the whole, Attack on Titan is a mixed bag. I was able to get some decent entertainment value from all the action sequences and the concept was handled well enough for me to not get bored for too long of a stretch of time. Unfortunately, the flaws that Attack on Titan has are far too great to ignore and yet somehow, the diehard fans defend this show to their graves as a masterpiece and the \"critics\" tear this show apart as worthless garbage that should never see the light of day. I honestly don't reciprocate either of those feelings. At its core, Attack on Titan is simply a dark battle shonen series that takes itself a little too seriously but at least it does some stuff right. Hopefully, things will get better in due time, but this first instalment of the franchise is a less-than-ceremonious start.\

    So this is kinda my first public review. \
As it is evident that this title is filled with most of the flaws, I am crossing over to it immediately. \
-The biggest drawback of this series are the characters, none of them actually has quality, I have no desire to worry or connect with these characters in any way.\
What writers usually do is create a protagonist and make the audience worry about that person, so when we find that character is in some trouble, we can actually take care of him and what is going to happen to him, and this is not the case in\
          \
        this anime.\
-The next drawback, which is also extremely large, is pacing. \
Too Much Talk, Too Little Action, one of the many examples is when Eren finds that he can turn into Titan. Commander Pyxis gives him the goal that one of the holes made by the armored titanium clog with a stone, believing or not it takes 3 fucking episodes to do it. \
Such pacing is the result of an animator/editor making these scenes feel longer than they actually are.\
Many take in defense that this is his first work, and from that side they want to make it easier for some critics. However, just because he is an amateur, that does not mean that we can not show obvious mistakes, and Hajime Isayama makes pretty bad decisions about writing during this series.\
Attack on Titan is a show that had the potential,but  having a good story does not bring you automatically to the highest score, you need to earn it. \
Apart from all the bad things mentioned, as a plus there is concept, action and animation, theme as well as music.\
Finally, Attack on Titan is an extremely overrated anime, although it's actually a piece of garbage, it's not the worst anime I've seen, but it's sad to see how people call this the best anime and how much praise it actually gets. ",

    Around three months ago a friend suggested it to me , truth to be told I wasn't very intrigued by the sound of it . A bunch of people living inside some walls and getting eaten by enormous human-like creatures called Titans. All I saw was death and angst and wasn't up for it. I could never been more wrong . Once I started the series , there was no stop to it and so I managed to watch 22 episodes ( not all of them were aired at that point ) in only two days . But what makes it so good ? Sure\
          \
        there are a hundred animes with similar plot : a determined yet inexperienced protagonist going up against the bad guys ,knowing he has not chance against them.The will and determination gets him through the day along, of course, with his royal friends that make sure to keep the him/her in the right path . Sounds familiar ? \
Story (8/10)\
I'm not going to say that it's plot is the breakthrough in the history of the anime nor I'm going to disagree with those who say that Snk's plot is not that special. Yes , it's pretty simple . The human race is on the brink of extinction and lives under the constant fear of giant , human eating creatures called Titans . Eren ,the protagonist ,after his first encounter with them vows to kill every last of them and so the story begins . As you can see it's not much,but the way the story unfolds only raises you more questions than answering the ones that you already have.It makes you question every single thing that you took for granted since the begging. The motives and morals of the characters will only make wonder even more if the things you believed so far to be true are true indeed .Maybe there is a more complicated reason behind the things that happened ( not just Titans eating humans ) , maybe the true enemy is not the one that we think it is . What is the nature of the Titans ? They couldn't just simply exist out of nowhere, could they ? And let's not start about the basement....\
Art:(9/10)\
Beautiful detailed scenery with just the right colours ,that's all I'm gonna say . One thing though that caught my attention is the art on each character . No one looks the same ,we have short characters with intimidate,sharp eyes,others with big,expressively eyes .You can actually tell from their features their origin , for example Annie( Russia ), Eren( Germany ),Mikasa (Japan ).I may be the only one to believe that, but it seemed worth mentioning .\
\
Sound (9/10 ): \
\"Sie sind das essen und wie sind die jaeger !\"I don't think this needed a better introduction,an epic opening song for an amazing anime .In fact both openings songs fit perfectly and their synchronisation with the openings are just amazing.Now, the rest of the soundtrack is just breathtaking and well made and the voice acting is quite fitting .It won't disappoint you.\
.\
Characters (10/10)\
The first thing that comes to my mind as to why Snk makes the difference is how realistic it is when it comes to the characters.While talking to a friend of mine about how underestimated the trio ( Eren , Mikasa , Armin ) is , she said something that can easily explain my point . \" The thing with Armin is..I really know how he feels \"  That's it ! Simple as that ! All the characters in this show are humans above all , no one is super strong or invincible. They cry , they live in constant fear even though they don't show it right away.They hate death and how they've been forced to live.They get injured and it takes actual time for them to recover. Even the strong ones die and their deaths are made in a way to show  that no matter who you are or what you've been through you die like everyone else .The deaths in this anime are so quick and uneventful that you start to wonder if it actually happened , because lets face it \" There is no way he/she would have died like that .It would have taken more to kill her/him \" No ! everyone is human and die just as easily.  \
\
At first ,most the characters would seem like the typical anime characters. Specifically referring to the main protagonist of the story Eren Jaeger.At first he seem to be the cliche anime character who lost his family and vows to get revenge on whoever did it, something that have been used so many times before that got old already .I don't completely disagree with that opinion, but as the story unfolds I can assure you that his character is far more interesting that you originally thought. This goes for the most of the characters in the story who appears to be one sided and typical at first but  more complex and unique later on , including the characters that seem to be \"bad guys \" in the story.\
\
Enjoyment (10/10)\
Something refreshing about Snk are the battles .I haven't watch that many anime in my life , but one thing that couldn't escape my attention was the pattern that most them seem to follow  Let's give an example : the anime character (possibly the protagonist) faces an enemy believing deep in his heart that he is going win .Later on releases that it's almost impossible to do so, as the enemy is too strong for him , but doesn't give up for the sake of his friend , family, loved one etc. At the crucial moment when he/she is about to lose/die something magically happens (possibly a flashback or someone shows up ) and the character suddenly rises up and defeats the enemy while saying some interesting things about the power of will or friendship or love . I'm not saying that this pattern can't be found in Snk , but it's nice to see that not many of the battles scenes are like that .Most of the battles in this anime raises many questions about humanity and moral ambiguity and it reminds you the condition in which those people live : fear and war . There is death everywhere and it's not something that you can oversee for that sake of the living .Of course the protagonist survives along with the few characters that we are familiar with,but it's not at any rate a victory .\
What I love the most in this anime is the intensity that some scenes hold .The animation , voice acting and soundtrack are combined in such way that will leave you completely amazed and could easily bring tears in your eyes.I'm sure those who have already seen the anime will understand to which scenes I'm referring to and surely Mikasa's voice saying \" My life has no meaning anymore . What's keeping me going ? \" following by Eren's voice \"Fight ! \" will surely have crossed your mind.\
\
Overall (10/10 )If you haven't seen Attack on Titan I suggest to go watch it!\

    Another show of the femenist agenda and japans' twisted view of the world. This is show about the huge naked men trying to eat all the people and the women who fight them. Also it has some stupid message about strong and weak people that makes no sense. Why do it make no sense? Let me tell you about this ridiculusly violent show.\
The story is just what I said, bunch of naked giant and women acting like men. This is all it is, just humans fighting against naked guys. Lots of characters get eaten for dramatick effect. They force some message between strong and weak\
          \
        survivals in there, but it's really stupid when you truly think about it because by that logic they should just let the giants win, right? They just hungry, they just doing what they're supposed to! Maybe humans finally get what they deserve and Im supposed feel bad for them? Not much story here, the story is just bobsessed with killing everyone. Im serious, people get eaten, stabbed, shot, everything short of having a wild badger or angry phallus thrown at them can make people dead in here. Brutal and not for the faint of heart.\
About the character: remembur when anime had strong men in it? Not any more because now they're all weak and whiny while scrawny women are strong for no reason. Everyone in this show is either whiny or strong or a jerk. Everyone is violent and they just want to kill everything. There is nothing else except a potatoes girl who ruins the feel of every moment.\
Art looks good, but is mostly just drawn naked men because the feminist agenda is obssessed with rape and afraid. The author should look into therapy or read Frued because she's obviously suppressing something. Colors are great and animated well, though. These women know how to make things pretty.\
The music is also good, but adds stupid chanting to make things seem epic. The sounds for the giant angry men is also scary and almost makes me want to protest and get a support groop, too! Why can't we be equels all Im saying!?\
Overall, if you're a woman who doesn't understand Frued and likes lots, and I mean lots of violence, you'll really love this show. If you're a man who likes to think sivilly and looks for good story you'll hate this show. \

    this show is a pretty typical action show, but it does have its upsides.\
The plot is essentially everything changed when the firenation attacked.  Be prepared for time skips that are pretty irrelevant and could have been summed up within a five minute prequel at the beginning of the first episode.  They seem to have taken manga to anime to heart in its entirety, and so pacing that worked well in the manga doesn't work as well in the anime and tends to drag it along.\
The art is rather sub-par at some points and great at others.  Its a weird blend of 3d\
          \
        animation and 2d, but it tends to work nicely in most scenes.  However, when characters are standing there and the thick lines contrast against the nicely fine lined backgrounds, it tends to be a distraction.  The titans are probably what stands out the most as something really well developed in this anime.  They look grotesque, you don't want to look at them because they are so uncomfortable, and that's AOTs main saving grace.\
The characters are a mix of good and bland.  The main character is a typical naruto-type trope, dim witted and pretty useless until they've written themselves into a corner and then he's just the man you need.  His two best friends, sakura(armin) and sasuke(mikasa), are also pretty just as stereotypical.  A lot of characters they dont really develop and then end up having something awful happen to them a few episodes later, leaving the audience really confused with how they're supposed to feel.  Its like an action anime trying to become a drama and its doing so very clumsily.\
The pacing is also rather interesting.  Minus the unnessecary time skips, you also have a lot of black and white in one episode.  Characters will gain courage, something happens, characters lose courage and everything is back to point a.  In an episode this will happen about two or three times, which is odd considering how short the episode lengths are.\
Another small saving grace is the fact that what's going to happen in the end is pretty obscure.  You can't figure it out exactly just by watching the anime, even though im 90% sure its going to be the colossal titan appears again and then ~*~something really cool happens~*~ but because its so hard to guess, it makes watching somewhat worth it.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin (also known as Attack on Titan), is an outstanding anime with a very interesting story line and very likeable characters. My personal favorite bring Sasha Braus a.k.a. Potato Girl who is probably the funniest character in the show, if you've seen her you know why ;-) The manga is also really good too, so I'd definitely suggest that too.\
\
Attack on Titan takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humans where driven to near extinction by a race of giant, hulking beings known as Titans. For some strange reason they exist for the sole purpose of devouring as many humans as they come\
          \
        across. They're nearly unstoppable for the only way to kill them is to cut through the nape located in the back of their neck which is nearly impossible for soldiers to get to. In order to reach this spot, the humans developed the 3D maneuver gear which allows the wearer to navigate quickly in a three-dimensional space. However, even with this technology the Titans are too overwhelming for the humans to fight so they decide to take refuge behind three giant walls (outer: Maria; middle: Rose; innermost; Sina) inaccessible to most Titans. This allows mankind to experience one-hundred years of peace. \
The story revolves around Eren Jaegar, a young boy who aspires to one day travel outside the sanctity of the walls and explore the vast world located in the Titans territory. One day life for all man kind changes as we know it. A giant Titan measuring at about sixty meters smashes a giant hole in the wall, allowing access to smaller Titans who quickly storm in and devour every human in site. Eren along with other human survivors flee to Wall Rose for refuge. \
After losing his mother, Eren decides to join the military so that he can one day join the Recon Corps and take the fight to the Titans in their own land. His best friend Armin Arlert, and adoptive-sister Mikasa Ackerman also decide to join the military in hopes of turning the tide for man kind.\
Characters:\
Eren Jaegar- After losing his mother, Eren decides to join the Recon Corps in favor of his own personal vendetta and also to explore the outside world. \
Mikasa Ackerman- After losing her parents, Mikasa is taken in by Eren and his family and she and Eren develop a sibling like bond with one another. She graduate top in her class in the training corps and is a prodigy when it comes to fighting Titans, even surpassing elite soldiers.\
Armin Arlert- Him and Eren have been best friends since childhood. After losing his grandfather, Armin decides to join the military along with Eren and Mikasa. Armin doesn't possess the battle prowess of Mikasa or the sheer bravery and tenacity of Eren, but he makes up for this with his great intelligence. \

    i believe attack on titan to be the best anime of all time. It has great characters, has no cliches, an intelligent plot, and a brutal setting that doesn't conform to the typical \"characters always win, friendship\" because anyone can die in attack on titan.\
the characters in this anime go through very intense psychological trauma, stripping away their personalities turning them into some brutes with development that leaves the viewer very sympathetic and at the same time terrified. eren is an intensely emotional main character who's life has been devastated by the titans and has a seemingly futile quest for revenge that threatens to endanger\
          \
        the lives of his friends mikasa and armin. mikasa is possibly even more broken than eren, after certain circumstances she has come to view eren as her only hold on humanity, and seeks to protect him. armin of course is very empathic as well, and reacts to the situations he's placed into like a real kid would; but still manages to find courage within himself, a great character.\
the side cast is amazing as well, with memorable and awesome characters like levi and hanji zoe\
the story is brilliant, juggling military campaigns and the survival of those within the walls with the mystery of the titans, i can't say much more with spoiling things.\
music is exceptional and quite outstanding, providing adrenaline rush to already spectacular action scenes.\
overall attack on titan is my personal favorite anime for it's sheer entertainment value and not so shabby story and charactes, i highly reccomend this show to everybody.\

    Okay, here we go. This might not go well for me.\
I was honestly very disappointed in this series. The trailers had me so excited, and the brutal concept was something that I was really looking forward to. Then the first episode aired. It was perfect. Dark, dreary, violent, and opened up so many questions and possible outcomes for our 3 young heroes. I couldn't wait to continue.\
However, that was where the enjoyment started to take a swift decline. Each plot twist added was, in my opinion, more ridiculous than the last and that took any and all seriousness away from the story that it could\

        To say that Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyoujin) is the most popular anime of 2013 is an understatement. The hype and popularity surrounding the show is much like its iconic Colossal Titan, a massive juggernaut towering over all the other anime that came out this year. And not without good reason, few shows can match Titan for sheer adrenaline fueled gut-wrenching entertainment. It is a hard-knuckled actioner that doesn't hold back any punches, as it beats the audience into a state of shock and awe. The show is bolstered by its grandiose bravado, massive scale, ruthless twists, and broad\
          \
        appeal. It is not wonder it grew to such great popularity instantly. However, that does bring up the eternal question: does the show live up to all the hype?\
Attack on Titan is a show so popular that its plot hardly needs to be summarized. The premise of mankind being forced into hiding by a monstrous and mysterious foe that threatens its extinction is hardly an original, but it is a tried-and-true one which instantly hooks the viewers' attention. Attack on Titan uses this premise as the foundation for a harsh and merciless yet endlessly interesting world with a lot to explore.\
The setting is fantastical, with unbelievably humongous walls which encompass the surprisingly vast human territory, which is divided into 3 sections. Despite this grandeur, the world feels grounded by a sociological edge. Humanity has grown use to being confined within the protection of the walls; complacent and afraid to venture outside to reclaim the world they had lost to the monstrous titans. Even within the walls, there is a pecking order, with the richer and more privileged having the protection of the inner walls, Rose and Sina, while the less fortunate only have the protection of the outermost Wall Maria. This, of course, has disastrous consequences when the walls are breached. The world is so expansive that the eye-catches before and after commercial breaks feature snippets of information that couldn't be worked into the main narrative.\
Along with these grand settings comes a humongous cast of characters; which largely works to the show's benefit, though not completely. Having such a large cast of characters establishes just how tremendous the struggle for humanity's survival is. Seeing so many named characters in risk and at the mercy of powers greater than themselves, the fact that the survival of the human race is at stake really hits home. It also illustrates how small these characters are in the face of this conflict. Characters die regularly, their lives often being snuffed out in inglorious desperation. The dead are grieved by those close to them, and treated with indifference by the bruised masses, who are too busy dealing with their own pain and loss. This disheartening depiction of battle and death is in stark opposition of the idealistic heroism depicted in most shows aimed at the shounen demographic, making it strikingly unique. Of course, the downside is that a lot of characters get barely any development. For as many characters as there are, very little of them are actually have a prominent role; most just feel like background (albeit sometimes quirky distinctive background) or body fodder for the titans to munch on. The sheer volume of characters makes it difficult for in-depth characterization for much of the cast, which is a shame because there is some potentially great characters that just don't get enough screen time. Still, the way the show uses its high body count to accentuate the desperation and tragedy mankind faces makes it hard to complain.\
Our protagonist, Eren, of course gets the most screen time and focus. In many respects, he's a typical shounen lead; driven, idealistic, and quick to fight. Personality-wise, he can come of as somewhat monotone in his single-minded goal of killing titans, but it's justified given the tragedy he suffered at the hands of the monsters. He can at times be overshadowed by the more colorful personalities in the show, but his anger and determination make him a logical center for the series. His burning desire to destroy the titans and overcome the complacency mankind has fallen into is at the heart of Attack on Titan, and becomes a particularly potent focal point when Eren develops a power that makes him both a subject of persecution and mankind's best chance of survival.\
The other two most prominent characters are Eren's childhood friend Armin, and adoptive sister Mikasa. Of the three of them, Armin is the wimpy kid, but also the smartest. Unlike fiery Eren or stoic Mikasa, Armin is lacks confidence at the beginning of the show and is convinced he is a liability, being physically weaker than most of the other characters. As the series continues, situations arise in which his strategic and negotiation skills become vital, and Armin becomes more confident in himself. It's a tried-and-true method of development, and it works well here.\
Mikasa is the strongest warrior of the three, and arguably of the entire show. More importantly, though, is her fiercely protective nature, especially where Eren is concerned. Being as strong as she is, Mikasa puts the weight of her comrades squarely on her shoulders, and has a strong sense of justice. Despite this, she is more pragmatic that Eren in her values, which coupled with her over-protectiveness causes them to clash. Her almost maternal instincts and some more intimate moments make her distinctly feminine, something that fiction (all fiction, not just anime) often struggles with. Some jaded viewers might see her attachment to Eren as the overused 'brother complex', and there is certainly more than a little ground for such accusations, but they're likely brought on by overexposure of the trope through anime more than anything else.\
All of these things give weight and substance to the show, but what really makes Attack on Titan an entertaining watch is its unstoppable momentum. Yes, there are some pacing issues; arcs stretch out for episodes and episodes in a series that only has 25. Yet every episode leaves an insatiable desire to see what will happen next. Director Tetsurou Araki has all but mastered the art of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The show truly feels epic with its crushing bombast, fantastic action sequences, and Araki's signature booming direction. The show is hardly subtle in its heated confrontations and moments of overwhelming despair, but it really doesn't need to be. This is a show of great stakes and big emotions; the kind of show overblown dramatics were made for.\
Production-wise, Attack is really quite impressive. Wit Studio, a subsidiary of Production I.G., does some great work bringing the vast world to life. The walls that enveloping the human realm are enormous, imposing structures. The over-crowded stone cities, military grounds, and long stretches of rural areas are well detailed; each having their own distinct atmosphere. Character designs are strikingly different from most anime, with sharp facial features and a European ethnic flavor, with Mikasa being the only character of Asian descent. The titans essentially are giant naked naked people, but genuinely are grotesque and intimidating. There are times their faces can look silly, though (i.e. the infamous moe-face titan) The few special titans look particularly nasty with their fleshy, skinless appearances. There are moments of obvious budget restraints and even a few sequences that are glorified slide-shows, but they are easily forgiven by the mind-blowing, movie quality action sequences. The music is equally as impressive: well composed, bombastic, and entirely fitting for the show.\
So, to answer the question from the beginning of this review: yes, Attack on Titan does live up to the hype. Granted, it isn't exactly a flawless masterpiece; it certainly has a few rough spots, including a very open ending. However, it wholly delivers on the promise of being an incredibly entertaining post-apocalyptic bloodbath of epic proportions. Furthermore, it has more than enough substance and emotional girth to elevate it well above the normal bloodbath. This is a great example of what this kind of show can be; a courageous struggle in the face of insurmountable odds. \

    Attack on Titan wasn't an experience that made me violently ill, but after feeling like I'd been a victim of a bait and switch conspiracy I was less than pleased. \
Our story begins with a BOOOOOOOOOM, suspense! A monstrous creature suddenly appears to attack -human city- as civilians look on helplessly. Cut to a group of men, fleeing a very giant, very  naked, and very sexless human-like thing. Utilizing their \"maneuver gear\"  an apparatus that contains many hooks and winches that works like the Steampunk jet-pack you wished you thought up,they prepare to do battle...\
   Then the plot gets underway. We\
          \
        are introduced to a young boy named Erin (Eren...?) Yeager, and his adopted sister, Mikasa. They live inside the outermost wall of the great human city, built to protect the population. Along with his friend, Armen, Eren aspires to greater things and the thrill of adventure outside his boring life. The appearance of aforementioned monster leads to a fatal attack on the outermost wall, and Eren's  fate will be forever changed.\
Not nearly as neat as I usually like a BRIEF summary, but if you ever pictured humans battling giants with little more than pluck and a slim chance you will be treated to an awesome viewing experience....for awhile.\
The first half of the season goes over Eren's transformation from a boy to a young-adult/man. This is enjoyable to watch, and is nice and straightforward. And then the story forgets that, though audiences may not catch every single detail in  every moment of an episode, they still need a recap that has to last what feels like a sizable chunk of an episode. Coupled with the \"philosophy\" that it smacks you in the face with, and tortuously predicable elements that are unnecessarily drawn out,  the story quickly peters out. \
The visuals are great! It's not a kiddie-friendly show by any means, and oh boy do I like to see some well-animated gore and viscera. Too bad they can't shut up half the time and just le-\
Audio is also above average. Catchy opening, suitably grim tracks coupled with lots of military-esque fanfare. \
Characters....\
Not necessarily \"stock\" but the show seems to switch gears between the genuinely unique and interesting persons to the less-so far too often. I didn't feel like much of the characterizing of red shirt's really helped the atmosphere of feel, and without divulging, you end up with a lot of time that ends up equaling head-scratching \"what?\" afterwards. The Team Four Star parody is gut-wrenching funny after you've seen the first three episodes; THAT I recommend at a 100/10. \
Did I like watching it? For a little while, yes. The fun in the series is action scenes. The combat is tense and gripping, but arrayed as to keep you aware of whats going on all around. Where the series falters is where it tries to dress itself up to be more than brutally violent. After hearing the same exposition over and over and over again, I was disenfranchised and bored. Season Two to the rescue perhaps....? Only time will tell.\
Overall, I felt cheated by instant gratification for Godzilla-like antics with a little more at stake. At first I felt the series played it straight and was thus open to jokes at it's expense, but it delivered on the action so i was content. When I had to listen to the soapbox dialogue I felt cheated, and only compelled to keep watching in the hope that I'd get some over-the-top antics next. \
Watch it to see what you think, but It'll take a colossal promise of quality to get this reviewer back in the mood for more Attack on Titan. \

    First of all, been on MyAnimeList for a while now but never bothered making an account. This anime finally convinced me to. Minor spoilers...\
PS: This is coming from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the manga.\
Shingeki no Kyojin was hyped for a while, but it was still met with the skeptical question of, \"Will this really live up to all the hype?\" In my case, it's exceeded my expectations. The first episode took off with a blast. The plot and setting were very simple -> We are the last remnants of humanity and there are tons of man-eating killing machines outside of these walls.\
          \
        Eren is your typical stubborn, headstrong, yet at the same time admirable protagonist, so he didn't seem very out of the ordinary. Mikasa, on the other hand, is a complete badass. She is cool, collected, and isn't made as an outlet for tons of fan service. In fact so far, this show has received spectacular ratings without ANY FAN SERVICE AT ALL which is very impressive. Anyway, the first episode introduced a lot of the story in a short amount of time including: the central conflict, reason to hate/fear the Titans (Eren's mother being killed), foreshadowing (primarily the mystery of Eren's father), and not being afraid to go completely out of the ordinary (taking down two walls in one episode!). \
The other episodes built up adequately, going through training, backstory, more characters introduced etc. and then skipping to when Eren and the crew are about to graduate from their military training as the top of the class. The fast-paced buildup was great, leaving no room for fillers, and everything exploded again in episode 5. By the time episode 5 came around, I was completely hooked. I, like everyone else, usually skip anime openings after watching once or twice just because it gets tedious, but I've seen the opening to this anime every single new episode that came out because A) it has a great soundtrack and B) it hypes me up lol. But yeah, episode 5 gave the audience a sense of, \"Eren and these guys are going to completely kick some Titan ass and shit's gonna go down.\" To be honest, I was completely expecting him to. Then out of nowhere, like in episode 1, AGAIN the enemies seem impossible to beat. When Eren rushed into that Grandpa Titan's mouth to save useless Armin, I didn't feel like he was actually in any danger despite losing a leg and w/e just because the protagonist always winning has become the accepted norm. But NOPE!@%! When Grandpa closed his mouth it was gg. That was by far the best anime moment of 2013, probably even 2012 just because it felt so unexpected. Props to the original creator for not being afraid to be different and step out of the bubble. At the same time, I was worried for how the series would progress from such a dramatic change but some people who have read the manga told me they either loved the progression or hated it so we'll see...\
Episode 6 was just a Mikasa flashback that had that awesome \"Get baited noob\" moment but it was mostly just more explanation, nothing really crazy... still decent for a flashback. So far, this series has had a FANTASTIC introduction because it is so unorthodox, out of the norm but can pull it off, gorey-but-not-excessive, and brim-packed with action. Of course, a great intro doesn't mean it can't suddenly dropoff at any time *cough* SAO *cough*, but it certainly has the potential to be the best of 2013, maybe even compete in all-times. I'm going to not read the manga just to experience the full effect of the series, and I would encourage others to do the same for those who haven't already. I'm looking forward to it's success~\

    Spoiler Alert\
Humanity is contained in one small area surrounded by huge walls. In the past, humans used to be free but it was brought to its knees and driven close to extinction when a certain animal became the predator. Titans. For years the humans were safe, until the titans struck down against them. A few youngsters join the Survey Squad which one objective. Freedom.\
This anime is action-packed and has the potential to release an evolved form of adrenaline. From the first episode, you will feel the difference between this anime and the other action animes. Gory at some parts, but its not the blood and\
          \
        violence that makes this anime great. It's the knowledge that anything could happen at any moment. It's unpredictable.\
I gave this story a 9/10 because I feel that there is a lot of things are remained unanswered. These \"holes\" in the plot will be filled in during the next season.\
Overall I gave it a 10/10 because the art is amazing. From the first episode, I fell in love with the way the titans were drawn. It wasn't incredibly scary, but it was rather creepy. In Japanese, I would say kimochiwarui, which is a mix between creepy, weird and gross.\
I recommend you watch the first episode at least, and see if you like it. The story will escalate a lot from the first episode.\

    I feel like writing this review can go down in two ways. I either end up castrated by AOT's loyal but crazy fans for not giving it a 10 or People try to listen to some helpful criticism that the show can improve upon. I don't think that this show is the greatest show ever made but I also disagree with the people who think it's absolute garbage. It definitely ain't no Fairy Tail that's for sure.  This is an depth analysis of what AOT does particularly well in and where some of it's faults lie.\
PROS:\
1.CONCEPT/ATMOSPHERE\
What the show does exceedingly well in is it's\
          \
        overall concept and atmosphere. The concept of zombies walking among us is a very popular and entertaining idea. Although, over the past 5 years or so it's begun to lose a lot of it's steam due to how much it was overused. For me personally, I've never been a big fan of zombies. There just brainless clones who add nothing to the overall plot (look to the Walking Dead as an example). Here however, there are 15 meter intelligent monsters roaming around. We become the bottom of the food chain, us humans are mere ants to these monsters. The f*cked up facial expressions of the titans is an act of pure genius. The titans don't fade into the background like zombies would, they CREATE the atmosphere and keep us feeling enclosed and helpless in our tiny little towns.\
2.PREMISE\
The first few episodes of the show are all excellent. In just 5 episodes, I felt hopeful, depressed, angry, sympathetic, relieved and utterly terrified. When an anime can do this, you know you've found a keeper. It's compelling and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the most part.\
3.ANIMATION/SOUNDTRACK\
 Not to mention it's spectacular animation, from 2 titans fighting to the death or zip wiring from building to building like Spiderman, it's animation is leaps and bounds ahead of any other anime that's for sure. Mix this with an excellent soundtrack and you've got some of the most entertaining moments in anime.\
CONS:\
1.FORMAT/STRUCTURE OF PLOT\
The problems that I came to find in AOT usually go unnoticed because it's mesmerizing animation keeps you distracted. Somewhere along the way ( roughly around episode 10) the pacing of the show starts to slack quite a bit. However, I will not dedicate this review to talking about the pacing as it is common knowledge at this point. I will however talk about the plot's main objective for the first season. The goal that is set up from the begining of the show is as straight forward as it gets. Get to Eren's basement as it will \"solve everything, it will all finally make sense cliche\". This is fine and all but wait did we get to the basement? Is it because a certain manga has reached that point either? Well, guess what? I don't care. An anime should be able to stand on its own two feet. Just like a tv show doesn't need it's book material all the time ( Game of Thrones). The goal was set up for the first season but was left unresolved and now continues to the second season. A manga can do this, an anime cannot.\
2. KEPT IN THE DARK/PREDICTABILITY\
This brings me to my next point: it's absolute refusal to tell us ANYTHING. Now don't get me wrong, I love theories as much as the next guy. But, when a show tells you nothing but clues and possibilities, you feel like someone's scooped out your eyeballs with a spoon. Even in the final episode, when we think we'll learn SOMETHING, it completely f*cks us over and says,\"Maybe in 3 years time, guys. Not like it matters anyway cause you'll keep crawling back for more\". And we will. Every single time, you assholes. I also found the \"twists\" to be quite predictable. Like you can tell by just LOOKING at them if you know what I mean.\
3.CHARACTERS\
Possibly my least favorite aspect of the show is it's characters. The three main are okay at best but fail to really stand out. Eren, is your typical hot headed teenage boy who feels life is unfair. Not to mention his extreme psychopath tendencies. The kid seriously needs to visit Dr.Phil or something, cause I always get this creepy vibe off of him. PRO TIP: NEVER listen to Bryce Pappenbrook's horrible english version of Eren. Don't ask.\
Mikasa annoys me to an even greater extent. She is made out to have literally zero faults and is absolutely perfect at everything. People seem to think she's the best female character of all time, give me Motoko from Ghost in the Shell anyday.  The fact that she is untouchable on the battlefield only disintegrates the danger of the world and makes it look like a cheesy story of heroism instead of the gritty and dark world it is. With her past being a typical \"boy saves girl and gives her a home cliche\" also downgrades her character. Then there's Armin, who is the kid who's bad at fighting but incredibly intelligent. Do the writers think that being insanely intelligent is more humane than being insanely good at fighting? The answer is no as both are as unrealistic as the other.\
As for the supporting characters, they only appear when it's necessary to remind you of their existence. Some are good like Jean but others like Ymir have me wondering, \"who the f*ck are you?\". The show has become notorious for killing it's characters mercilessly. A fact that is untrue unless you are supporting characters. Oh, and if you're Marco. Then you're f*cked. When you start asking yourself \"who the hell are these people the show keeps saying are dead?\" It can really show it's lack of focus on it's supporting characters.\
OVERALL:\
I realize that this may look like a whole heartily hate this show. This is untrue as I do think this show is GOOD and definitely not bad. I just believe it has A LOT OF POTENTIAL and can be so much more than just GOOD if it just fixes these faults next season. With it's excellent concept, animation and soundtrack, it needs to work on it's format of plot for each season, give us something to work off, add more depth to main and especially supporting characters.\

    Perhaps what more than anything characterizes Attack on Titan is the same which characterizes the eponymous villains as opposed to ordinary humans, namely overabundances. There are so many promising concepts, mysteries, interesting characters, so much excellent music and well-done action. Yet even so, at the end of this first part of the story, one doesn't feel quite satisfied. Many shows complete their stories after 25 episodes, but at the end of Attack on Titan we don't really know anything more about what is going on than we did seeing the main character and his sister in the beginning, as children, awing over the part of\
          \
        the military they would join as grown-ups. New questions are being raised up until the very end of the last episode, while few previous are resolved, and thus it's difficult to see it all as anything but a beginning.\
It's an outstanding beginning though. The animation occasionally suffers too much from cost-reducing stills, but the 19th century-looking world of Attack on Titan is vividly brought out, and the visuals particularly impressively manage to make the many characters easy both to remember and love. The powerful soundtrack also deserves special mention, even if the opening and ending songs of the second half of the show do not stand up to the ones of the first half, but I guess that's just an excuse to skip them and get along with the story quicker. \
In a way, it's pretty silly. Humankind lives behind colossal, dam-like walls after giants began attacking them, and it's up to young, attractive, but all very idiosyncratic people dressed in dark green raincoats, carrying something like steampunk jetpacks, to hit the giants not necessarily stopped by the wall at the back of their necks, their only weak spots. What makes the story gripping, aside from the many awe-inducing action scenes the plot justifies, is some of the ingenious ways the concept is put to use to create rather original situations, but just as much the meticulousness of the plot's execution. Few proper war films manage to even get close to the dread Attack on Titan associates with the giants after only a single episode, partly in thanks to the almost surreal ridiculousness of their appearance, but also by the willingness to confront the characters fully with the brutality of conflict, among other things by unexpected killings. Yet it's perhaps a six-episode arc of the series, taking place entirely on the move, that manages to impress the most in terms of construction. All these things make it easy to forgive the occasional outrageous plot manoeuvres done to keep the show's pace as high as it is.\
In the end though, it's hard to say what to make of Attack on Titan. At this point it's not even quite completely obvious what it is. While the show's mysteries and characters are probably its most interesting aspects, the focus on action of the last episode makes one wonder whether perhaps it's really first and foremostly about this. Then again, maybe the plot cash-outs are being saved for the upcoming movie. What's in any case quite clear about Attack on Titan is that it's a fresh breath of air in the shonen genre with a promising future hard not to look forward to.\

    I wonder, why is it that today's audiences are so invested in stories that center around people suffering through harsh trials that, more often than not, showcase the worst aspects of this world? Is it some sadistic pleasure at seeing others jump through flaming hoop after flaming hoop, despite deserving better? Is it some internal relief that we get, knowing that regardless of our own lives tribulations, that it's possible for others to suffer far worse than us? Either is possible, but i choose to go for a third, more positive option. Through these works, we see the best of humanity in the worst of\
          \
        situations. Whether it be Battle Royale, Game of Thrones, or, for this review, Attack on Titan, we see a strong sense of will, determination, and faith, that shines in the center of the worst the world has to offer. But, with so many of these kinds of stories out there these days, what makes Attack on Titan stand out from the crowd to gain it the immense popularity it currently has?\
Story (8/10)\
In an unknown part of the world, during an unknown time period, colossal monsters called Titans, whose only purpose in life is to feed on humans for pleasure, have taken the place of apex predator and forced humanity into hiding. With only a small percentage of humanity left, they build walls to surround cities in order to keep the Titans out, and live their lives trapped, yet alive. But after 100 years of not seeing a single Titan, a colossal Titan kicks the wall in and sends the outer layer of the city into panic. In the frenzy, one boy named Eren Jaeger, watches first hand as his mother is devoured by a Titan. Driven by rage and a desire for vengeance, he joins the Survey Corps with his childhood friends, Mikasa and Armin, to fight against the Titans, and satisfy his thirst for retribution, and find freedom beyond the walls they've spent their lives trapped in. Attack on Titan is a classic tale of overcoming trials to find what you desire, but, where most of these tales often chart the progress of their goals, Attack on Titan follows a \"one step forward, two steps back\" program. It seems that the closer Eren and the Survey Corps get to rising up against the Titans, reality always follows to rub just how hopeless it is in their face. Question after question arises, with no answers in sight, and by the end of the series, humanity has yet to take their step towards defeating the Titans. Normally this would all be very frustrating, if it wasn't for the fact that the story never just strings us along. It is a hopeless situation, and the characters actions towards rising up are never completely in vain. It's a story about overcoming suffering, regardless of how futile it seems, and charging forward with nothing more than hope, which is enough to make a compelling, and somewhat optimistic series for people to find themselves invested in. Sadly, Attack on Titan suffers from being an unfinished show, ending on a cliffhanger and leaving it's audience unsatisfied. Considering it's success though, a second season should be on the way as soon as there's enough source material to work off of. Unless, that is, Studio Wit all of sudden starts hating the oodles of money the show has put in their pockets.\
Art (8/10)\
Attack on Titan was done by Studio Wit, a subsidiary of Production I.G, and their first major work. The art in Attack on Titan is eye-catching to say the least. The backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, implementing the CGI to good use for the buildings, and vibrant forests for outside the wall. The character designs are worth noting as well. Seeing as the setting has more German influence than Japanese, the characters are designed for a more Western look, putting aside the show's token Oriental, Mikasa. What's more each of the characters are outfitted with thick black outlines, giving the shore a more comic book feel. Though the most notable thing about the designs, would have to be those of the Titans themselves. Their bodies are, large and misshapen, with sickening flesh tones, but the faces had a bad habit of getting more and more ridiculous as the show went on, to the point where the Titans were more laughable than intimidating. As for the animation, it looks absolutely marvelous when it wants to, implementing a three-dimensional style to match the humans maneuver gear, not to forget about the splendid choreography that goes into using said 3-D maneuver gear, making for some flat out gorgeous action scenes. The rest of the time though, the animation can be quite lazy and often lags. That's not even bringing into account the times when the show would decide to stop the animation all together to implement still screens. It's not a bad looking show by any means, but it could've looked better. Of course it could've looked a lot worse too, if not for three simple words. Tetsurou Fucking Araki. Simply looking at his track record, comprising of Death Note, High School of the Dead, and Guilty Crown, tells you two things about him. The shows he directs look really good and usually end up being huge successes. Araki often implements a style of bombast and erraticism, taking complete advantage of the animation medium, and simultaneously creating copious amounts of online memes, providing his shows with free advertising. While Attack on Titan isn't as gorgeous as Guilty Crown, or as stylized as Death note, his directorial style still provides enough passion and adrenaline to take this show's visuals to new heights.\
Sound (9/10)\
The OST for the show was done by Hiroyuki Sawano, whose previous works include Blue Exorcist and the aforementioned Guilty Crown. The show itself is a driving force of adrenaline and blatancy, so what better to suit it than heavy dramatic sounds, fully orchestrated with the obligatory choirs, crashing down on you while one of the characters charges off dramatically to go decapitate a Titan. Outside of the action, the show is complimented by vocal chorus pieces to suit the more moody and less intense scenes. Of course, you can't talk about Attack on Titan, without talking about it's openings. One of the things that sold Attack on Titan to so many people right off the bat, was it's first OP, Guren No Yamiya by Linked Horizon, which soon became an overnight internet sensation with hundreds of parody videos. To be honest, it is kind of as good as people say, but that shouldn't detract attention from the show's second opening, Jiyuu no Tsubasa, also by Linked Horizon, which is just as good if not better than the first opening. \
Characters (8/10)\
One of the bigger criticisms of the show is about it's cast of characters, where the words, undeveloped and bland most often appear. I'm going to respectfully disagree. Attack on Titan is not a complex show, nor does it ever try to act like it is. It's a straightforward action/adventure show meant to touch base with it's audience's own humanity. So doesn't it seem fitting that it's characters do the same? After all, sometimes simple characters are more effective than complex ones, especially when the point of these characters is to bring out human traits that the audience can connect with. There's nothing wrong with complexity in characters, and some shows even manage to blend complexity with humanity. But there are plenty of cases where a story might focus more on analyzing a characters inner workings that they come off as unnatural and robotic. In a 25 episode anime, where the themes are about the inner will and determination of humanity, simplicity works better. Eren is bitter and angry at the Titans, yet still desires freedom and the safety of his loved one above all else. Mikasa wants nothing more to protect Eren out of gratitude and love, gained from his part in providing her with a new life. Armin wants to find the courage within him to use his own abilities to assist his friends in the hope that they may someday live in peace. It's hard not to feel sympathy for the characters of this show, even those that don't necessarily deserve it, because the emotions they feel are justified and honest. Not to say they didn't need development, and some got it. Eren eventually learns to put his anger aside so it doesn't get in the way of what's important. Armin learns to put his fear aside so that he can use his intellect to help out. Jean decides to end his own selfish streak and step up as a leader for his fellow cadets. Not to say the cast doesn't have flaws. While i will defend Mikasa as a great female character and not just some emotionless guard fog, but she is a bit predictable after a while. Plus there are plenty of characters like Sasha and Connie which have yet to get any real attention outside of comic relief to bounce of the main characters. I've read the manga, so I know whether or not they develop, but this is a review on the show, so i'll be judging the characters on what they are, not what they could or will be. Still, Attack on Titan does give us an engaging cast to resonate with, whether it be their desire for vengeance, for freedom, for reason, and, of course, to protect what they hold dearest. Some people may criticize the simple designs for these characters, but i can't help but prefer humanity over complexity. \
Enjoyment (9/10) Overall (8/10)\
The question i expect to hear at least once after posting this review is, \"does it live up to the hype?\" and, quite frankly, it doesn't matter. Hype is a result of the community not the show itself, so to say something to overhyped or overrated is not a flaw of the show, but your own personal flaw. I hope that you can ignore the hype, and decide for yourself whether it's a show deserving of it's attention based off it's own quality. In my opinion, it kind of is. Attack on Titan is a thrill ride of action, impact, and pure enjoyment. It may be unfinished, but it was clearly planned with a second season in mind, which is all but confirmed, and will most likely clear up any loose plot threads and unresolved character arcs. I won't dismiss it's flaws, but i can look past them to see a quality show, one that i can recommend for all anime fans. Anyways, that's all for now. Til next time. \

    If you have ever dreamed about fighting giant beings, anywhere between three to fifteen meters in height, then this is the anime for you. \
There are many people out there that will tell you that Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is overrated. And then there are those who are complete fanboys/fangirls and think that Attack on Titan is the best anime of the year. As for me? I am apart of the latter group. I may not be a complete fangirl over Attack on Titan, but I can give credit where credit is due. Anime this year... for better words has been rather\
          \
        lackluster. The winter (2012/13) and spring anime for 2013 wasn't as great as seasons that came before it (with a few exceptions of course, namely being Hataraku Maou-sama). With that being said, I felt that we really needed something great to come out, so that anime fans like myself wouldn't lose interest. \
Story - 8.5/10\
The story of Attack on Titan might not be the most original ever told. Looking around the media you see it being done all the time. I mean, if you're looking for a story about a group of people forced to fight against the things trying to kill them, then go watch the Walking Dead or something, because you have your typical zombie movie/TV show. What makes Attack on Titan special is the way the idea of having to fight for freedom is presented to the audience. How many giant people eating titan animes/TV/movies do you see floating around the market? There is really only one answer. Attack on Titan makes itself feel unique and new, which is surely hard to do in any piece of media. \
Art - 10/10\
Production I.G really did go all out on this one, which one can easily tell by the first episode. As most people know or should know by now, the anime is based of the manga by the same name by the mangaka: Hajime Isayama. Many people have criticized Attack on Titan for its art, or rather it's art style. Sure, the character designs doesn't look like the typical art you would find in a romance comedy anime that is being produced by J.C Staff. But there is something unique about that art that you start to love. And unique is something Production I.G does very well. CGI is one of the main factors in Attack on Titan's art. Used in almost all 3DMG sequences, the use of CGI adds a freshness factor to the anime. Often CGI is something that is used in anime, and used very badly. But Attack on Titan uses it to its advantage in order to enhance what is being watched.\
Sound - 11/10\
Sound is definitely one of the best things about Attack on Titan. Ever since the first episode, the opening theme 'Guren no Yumiya' as become somewhat iconic in Japan and even in the west. Obviously so from the amount of parodies there are. Linked Horizon, the group that preformed both 'Guren no Yumiya' and the second OP 'Jiyuu no Tsubasa' did a great job with capturing the mood and atmosphere of Attack on Titan. It's not hard to see why the sound is so popular. With the music being composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, the same mastermind who brought us the OST for animes like Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, fans could expect nothing less. The OST for Attack on Titan is nothing less than beautiful. \
Character - 8/10\
This is without a doubt the weakest part of Attack on Titan. With a lot of anime nowadays having characters that forward the plot in no way shape of form, Attack on Titan seems to be a breath of fresh air. All character's seem to have there place within the show, not just thrown in to be comic release or there simply for fanservice. This is definitely a high point of the characters, with the low point being the cliche and sometimes overused tropes that a lot of characters seem to be based around. This is quite evident in Attack on Titan. The main character is somewhat annoying, even a fan of Attack on Titan could tell you that. He's the hot-headed (a part time) brooding guy who doesn't seem to be good at anything. Then you have the other main character, a female who has the same personality as character such as: Rei Ayanami from Evangelion and Yuki Nagato from Haruhi Suzumiya. The silent, strong girl seems to have become a common character archetype throughout the years, but you can't help but love that character because they're so awesome. So while there are many faults on characters throughout Attack on Titan, there are so some great characters in the mix.\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
Now this is a category that is different for everyone. Some people will hate the anime and some people will love it. It all has to do with personal preference. As someone who has read the manga, I feel as though this adaptation was done right. It didn't 100%  follow the manga right down to its last feature, but who really wants that anyway? It's like going to the cinema to see your favourite book that has been made into a movie. Changes had to be made and somethings had to be re-ordered. Attack on Titan is no different. The manga doesn't matter though. There will always be fans that won't read the manga, and as a stand-alone anime, it was done really well.\

Story:\
The story while being unique in it's own little way is pretty generic shounen absolutely no surprises.\

None of the music really got me in the mood you know what I mean if you've watched an actual good anime before.\

    My favorite anime ever. Literally. Just watch it.\
From the very first episode they're able to set the tone which I really like. This anime lays it down for you from the start. You're able to see how heavy this anime can get from the pilot, which I think is great because I hate stories that only get interesting like halfway through. I'll admit though, this type of anime isn't for everyone. I recommend getting to like episode 4 and if you're still not hooked by then, it's probably not for you.\
The characters in this anime are great and the storyline is awesome. I was hooked\
          \
        from the start to the finish; I didn't feel like there was a dull moment in this series. I felt sometimes Eren got a bit annoying, but it wasn't so much so that I disliked him. \

    Depicting a world in which the remaining human population seals itself into giant walls to protect against the giant Titans, Attack on Titan focuses on the exploits of young hero Eren Yaeger desiring to destroy the giants to avenge the slaughter of his parents by them. Early episodes of the series are solid in setting up the show's premise as they explore the pasts of Eren and Mikasa and elements to the world of the series such as the importance of the Walls and the harsh training and physical conditioning that those in the Recon Corp armies go through in order to fight the Titans.\
          \
        Also in many instances throughout the first half, the series was effective in setting up tension and suspense from humans whenever the thought of their survival or a Titan encounter had them fearing for their lives. Titan's first half set up some engaging plot twists, such as a shocking development with Eren, that would have you believe that this would be an epic of a series.\
Sadly as the show shifted into its second half, things start to go downhill with the plotting quality of the series and much of this has to do with the fact that the manga source material of this series is still ongoing. Much of the second half of the series focuses on matters concerning the Female Titan and the series started getting into the bad habit of slowing things to a halt with its pacing. The effective use of mood conveyed from earlier episodes in the series becomes greatly exaggerated here as humans scared witless of the Titans or a certain major character angsting over internal conflict over a revelation with the Female Titan became irksome at many points for my enjoyment of the series and seemed to only be implanted to drag the series out. Worst of all, the series left plenty of questions unanswered concerning the motives of certain characters and factions, as well as elements to the world of the series that Titan alluded to yet never bothered answering. This, again, comes from the manga source material of Attack on Titan still being incomplete. Also while Eren and Mikasa get decently fleshed out, much of the cast to Titan are sadly underdeveloped in background and personality beyond whatever eccentric or stale personalities they are shown to have throughout the TV anime's run.\
For visuals, Titan was pleasing for the most part. Scenery shots sported vivid color and plenty of detail, with human character designs given similar treatment. The designs of the Titans are perhaps the visual highlight of the series being grotesque and well-detailed in their massive designs. The animation features nicely animated battle scenes involving the Recon Corps use of their Maneuver Gear as they move through closed-in areas like forests and towns while battling Titans, with the occasional clashes between Titans tossed in as well. Such scsnes serve as the animated highlight for this series as 3D animation and camera movement is used to depict the fluid movement of Titans and human soldiers moving about using their Maneuver Gear. This nice animation does come at a price as moments outside of these animated sequences feature still shots, speed stripes, characters moving while background movement is still and other animation shortcuts to conserve on budget for the more visually intense moments of the series.\
Overall, I must admit that Titan is perhaps my biggest disappointment of a series thus far this year. While having a nice start in setting up its premise and having many nicely animated sequences with Titans and soldiers moving via their Maneuver Gear, the series suffers greatly in its second half with dragged out developments and unanswered questions over the bigger picture of things over how and why things were taking place in the world of the series. Had this been animated close to or well after this title's manga source material was complete, then Attack on Titan could have been better in its quality and not leave you hanging over what was going on. \

    There's little avoiding the fact that Attack on Titan is undeniably an incredibly popular and loved anime; the show was a smashing hit at the time it aired and that hasn't stopped since. If anything, the show is even more popular than ever before, with season 2 being arguably the most anticipated sequel in anime history as a whole.\
That being said, this isn't a review discussing it's influence on the anime fandom, but the show as a whole.\
Heads up, this review contains spoilers for the show. You have been warned.\
Attack on Titan's premise is gripping and easy enough to understand; humanity has been driven to\
          \
        the point of near extinction, and are enclosed within certain \"walls\" where they can live generally (though not completely) unaffected by what is happening beyond the walls. \
The story is filled to the brim with interesting subplots and its themes of humans facing off against titans and to a VERY limited extent existentialism are perfectly valid.\
The main issues that plague Attack on Titan are presentation and pacing.\
For one, the story loses a massive amount of its tension early on when Eren becomes a Titan; the viewer assumes (correctly) that Eren becomes untouchable, and the story stops being \"Attack on Titan\" and switches gears to \"Titan fights Titan\". The climax of the show similarly feels devoid of tension for this exact reason, and I found myself feeling cheated very quickly into the story.\
Pacing is another thing Attack on Titan doesn't do well; the animators wanted to make everything as intense and adrenaline pumping as possible, and to a large extent they definitely succeed. On the other hand, certain arcs (the boulder arc is particularly guilty) feel dragged out, mundane and irritating, with no real feeling of tension or consequence. This works against the show's advantage, since the plot regresses only to move forward to the exact same point we were in before; some may argue that, well, that may be the entire point of the show and that presenting it that way adds to the narrative and makes us more sympathetic to Eren's perspective...but that's something I'll come back to later.\
Speaking of that, the characters are a massive mixed bag. On one hand, we have characters who are legitimately interesting like Mikasa or Armin, who constantly develop and move forward and whose perspectives are very frequently challenged by the evolving (or in certain cases, devolving) setting. Armin's growth in particular was interesting and captivating, changing from a relatively scared (some people would argue even cowardly, though it's justified in this kind of setting) person who didn't actively participate in fighting to a strategist who was the heart and mind of the group. He's easily the best character in this show.\
Mikasa is a solid character, though her character arc feels cut short; specifically, when Eren dies and she decides to move on past his death and continue fighting rather than take her own life/allow herself to be kiled. It's solid characterization, but feels redundant after we know that Eren is alive and well. It wasn't a massive breaker in the show, mind you; she clearly becomes even more rigid and serious about fighting afterwards, so it's not like it was for nothing, just a wasted aborted arc.\
Side characters are one-note and/or practically memes at this point; potato girl, psycho girl and everyone else (I can't even remember their names for the life of me).\
The only one that truly stood out and deserves full praise is Levi, whose ideals and perspectives are fully fleshed out over the course of the show. His character backdrop and development make sense, he's consistent and interesting; of course, the fact that he receives a lot of development in the OVAs rather than the show proper can and should be regarded as a flaw, but he is the character that is the most fun to watch in this show and the reason I kept coming back (the infamous scene in episode 22 in particular I consider a favorite of mine) to the show. \
The greatest downfall to this show is ultimately the fact it has an incredibly weak lead: Eren. Eren is a painfully average lead, and his development is irritating to watch simply because he legitimately has no idea what the consequences of his actions will be. He feels no real guilt over his actions, yet the other leads clearly follow him for some undefined reason, and nowhere is this better exemplified than in a certain scene where Armin is thinking of a strategy to fight the titans...and for some reason, Eren and Mikasa show up in a vision, encouraging Armin to fight on. By the way, this is the first time we see Eren ever encouraging Armin, as they have literally nothing in the way of a character interaction before that aside from exposition and him saving Armin from bullies in Episode 1.\
This is what irritates me the most about this show; there's such a massive whiplash between how the characters feel about events that happen, and how you, the viewer feels about events that happen. There are literally dozens of characters, but chances are that you only care about a handful of them, which doesn't help especially when characters react to them as if they've known them for years (which admittedly, they did) and you knew them for...an episode.\
It's not all bad though; the second half isn't as intense, but is also much more intriguing compared to the very bare-bone but more intense first half. I have (ironically enough) a personal preference for the second half, if only because it focused more on the characters I liked more *cough* Levi *cough*.\
Artwork looks stunning and very distinct from character to character, and I have no real complaints here. Where I do have complaints, however, is the titans' designs; it's a massive mood whiplash from the rest of the show, and a lot of the time their movements look silly and even funny, which breaks immersion and takes the viewer out of what's going on.\
Another issue I had was how the characters had these bizarre black lines drawn around them; it was annoying to look at and felt like the characters weren't part of the setting or show itself at times. Some would go so far as to argue that it may have been intentional, but I just found it annoying.\
Animation is absolutely stunning, with an amazing and consistent quality that doesn't go down as the show continues...now that the blu-rays are out. The original release of the show actually did not look as good, and even had incredibly bizarre moments that can only be described as derp faces.\
The soundtrack is excellent though not my personal favorite out of Sawano's record (that honor goes to the Gundam Unicorn soundtrack). The openings and endings are excellent and a joy to listen to, though I personally prefer the second opening over the first; it felt a lot more epic in scale, and the animation that follows it looks absolutely stunning (which considering the show, is saying a lot).\
Voice acting isn't as consistent as I'd like in either track; on one hand, the Japanese voice over feels over-acted and over-dramatized, but the English voice-acting, while still really good, doesn't have the same passion as the Japanese voices. A personal preference to which one is better, though I lean towards one or the other depending on the voices.\
Overall, I enjoyed the show quite a bit, even if I don't consider it as great as many people claim it to be. The show is the very definition of a popcorn flick and is incredibly entertaining to watch, not to mention being the very kind of show that's so perfect to introduce someone to anime through. It's a solid show, but not one that is so great as to burn someone out if they watch it; it can appeal to both mature and not-so-mature audiences, and can certainly prove that anime is a vast enough medium to explore.\
I recommend the show purely for that as well as the high entertainment value. It's definitely worth the watch for what its worth.\

    Attack on Titan is a series that is held in very high regard by the majority of the anime community, thus I found it a little strange how I struggled to finish the series for so long. This series  found itself fluctuating between my on hold and watch list, and for quite a while it found itself on my back burner due to its quite abysmal pacing through its first half and the large amount of one dimensional characters. However the series truly does shine during its very well done action sequences and how it is able to create an interesting world. There will\
          \
        be some spoilers in this review.\
The story of Attack on Titan is fueled by a lust for revenge by our main character, Eren Jaeger who wishes to kill all the Titans. This is his defining trait, and drives him to eventually enlist in the military and join the Recon Corps. I wish I could say that is character is fleshed out more as the story goes on, but he is mostly driven by his desires for justice and revenge and sees little developmental change from the start to beginning. The story creates an excellent atmosphere of hopelessness right from the beginning, and is well done through the savage depictions of violence by the Titans and the twisted horror that is often seen on the faces of characters as they attempt to fight in vain or survey the death and destruction around them. The narrative then shifts introducing us to an ensemble cast of characters and focuses on their training as they attempt to join the most prestigious ranks of the military. \
Almost all of the characters can be summed up with one quick sentence, such as Mikasa who, really likes Eren and is one of the top recruits, she is able to cut down Titans with ease. Her fondness of Eren is her only defining trait, it is the reason behind almost all her actions and in fact her screaming \"Eren!\" could be argued to make up a healthy amount of her lines. Armin is the physically weak but smart kid who comes up with the majority of plans that the group uses, and befriended Eren because he used to stick up for him when he was bullied. Almost all the characters are fairly one dimensional, except for Jean one of my favorite characters from the show who goes through a fairly significant change in his outlook as the show goes on. I also wanted to learn a lot more about Annie and her motives, finding her to be an extremely interesting character to watch, especially as the show continues on.\
The story progresses very slowly, the battles are stretched out over several episodes and are sometimes inter-cut with a lot more dialogue than necessary. This sometimes makes the series really feel like it's dragging on, and the reason I had trouble watching the show. It felt the battle of Trost was simply never going to end, despite the fact that there were a lot of interesting developments and some excellent battle scenes, as well as a great veil of despair and hopelessness that surrounded the human's as they fought the Titans. This leads to one of my biggest problems I had watching the series, the fact that Eren has the ability to turn into a Titan. This negated the air of despair that the series had so intricately crafted and gave our main hero a super powerful form that instantly turned the tide of the battle. Also when we watch series there is a degree of believability that we all have, and I found it difficult to believe that even in the fantasy world of AoT, Eren could turn into a hulking giant simply by biting his thumb. I would have much rather have seen Eren and humanity struggle and fight against these unstoppable foes rather than gain such a game-changing ability. \
I found that the second half of the series solved some of the pacing problems of the first with the introduction of the mysterious female Titan, seeing such a powerful enemy and the vain attempts to take it down drove the feeling of desperation that humanity is feeling. Having a set goal in the second half helped drive the narrative forward and it was highlighted by some great action scenes, as well as some well though out plans that are able to be triggered. The death and destruction that humanity faces is once again brought front and center, and is what makes the series so interesting as humanity faces a clearly superior foe. The series really hits its stride when it shows the psychological as well as the physical effects that the Titans have on the population, and crafts an interesting that leaves you wondering about the Titans, the walls, and makes you questions if humanity will be able to overcome its slow extinction. Attack on Titan sports some top notch action this is only amplified by its haunting soundtrack, and sets up an excellent atmosphere and world for the viewer to enjoy. However it is bogged down by slow pacing and a large cast of one dimensional characters, which isn't always a bad thing, but I expected to see much more significant development with the main cast. Overall the series is an intriguing one that is highlighted by some fantastic action, but will try your patience as the narrative crawls along.\

Well, this is my review and i deem it to be as objective as possible, i know every spectator and reviewer of this anime mostly very satisfied of this anime and im like that too.\
But some consider it to be so perfect and exaggerating it like doesnt have any minus at all, yes some already bored and suck with it seeing age of anime turned out to be fapper, maniac, lolicon as anime grow by flooding us with kawaai shoujo, loli, boobs, ass everywhere and im agree too. As shingeki no kyojin bring anime world different aura with tragedy, action oriented anime, but\
          \
        while its genre so fresh still it isnt perfect and many can be improved further, to review one anime from objective side, one must compare and inspect it in the same genre area, one anime cant be good simply because its \"unique\" genre among \"mainstream\" genre.\
At first, as many of you can guess im sure, there are many many and many unexplained mysteries left behind. Since this series started with its first episodes until last episodes, question, mystery, my talking in my head grow like exponential curve and there is no explanation till the end. How the fuck is titan created? Who created titan? what for? how the hell are 3 walls created that protects mankind? how suddenly there are 3 walls while mankind under constant attack from the titan? where the hell is eren's father? after this 5 years whats he have been doing? and so much and many more.\
Almost no possibilities for this anime to have its second season makes it worse and all question can be answered from its manga cant answer such damn thing because this is anime review not its manga review, therefore its different thing.\
While its fulfilling the hunger of action-oriented spectator to their satisfaction, so much best graphic action scene, still it fails to cover overall storyplot become its very very major drawback thus fails to consolidate it into perfect anime.\
Yes, it is too much action-oriented without good story cover.\
Well next, i dont know if this is just me but i think i hate it where only half of the whole series truly gives us fighting-titan scene, where almost the other half contain internal-mankind fight.\
Ok now at first its telling us \"hey im action-oriented anime\" and next it contains too much internal affair not the breathtaking and ejaculating fighting-titan scene. If im not mistaken, fighting-titan scene bombed at early several episodes and waning toward several last episodes, the only titan in several last episodes mostly just that female-form titan.\
But, really, the most dissapointing point still its lack of story. Really it had twenty five full of episodes dude, you have so many tense and horrific action scene, so many review scene, but cant ended up with even slightest idea to cover many question spectator had in their head.\
In the end, it results as a ridiculous ending, with nothing as conclusion, with so many unanswered remnants. As i watched its last episodes, im like \"WTF, its last episode already? its ending already?\" its like the beginning of the real storyplot and you ended it already.\
You could cover up the whole stories in the last few episodes like Guilty Crown, it wont be long really, or if the manga series still didnt go that far you could made an alternate ending to fill the curiousity, instead you go to high school of the dead plot path where the whole series\
just serve us with only early fighting-titan scene and how people depressed from the incident with nothing as solution or history how all happened until the end.\
Art : 8\
Well for full action-oriented anime in medieval era, nothing more can be expected from the art, its magnificent, truly breathtaking fighting scene that makes you ejaculated and the fact that the enemy is monstrous titan with upper hand from mankind always makes you amazed not to forget that 3d manuver geared badass flying over skies everywhere is so stunning.\
Sound : 7\
Dont wanna tell you, but this is another lack from shingeki. I wonder why i always play Guilty Crown backsound Bios_MK+nZk in my head everytime i see shingeki fighting scene, and i know the reason its because shingeki lacking appropriate backsound and fail to make spectator fully immersed in its scene and sure all op and ed is not..satisfying.\
Character : 8\
Well to tell you the truth, i love its 3 protagonist, they are not perfect, they have their own weakness, their own strength, and they are filling each other's gap and hole. At the front, Eren have the biggest sense of judgement, have the biggest willpower, while lacking awareness, exploded and unconscious, and of course dont have the top skills, as standard in almost all male protagonist in every shonen anime. At the right, stand kawai shoujo yet deadly Mikasa and..hard to believe but i guess she is the most inhuman of the 3, average sense of judgement and willpower despite having top-notch skills, and i can say she can oppose the entire world and doesnt give a damn thing which is right as long she can be with Eren :D go go ErenMikasa, everyone know you love Eren so much since childhood until now (that scarf is the proof!!) but unfortunately the series doesnt permit another romance scene :(. And at the left, trustworthy Ermin is the best observer, analyzer and strategist despite having low skills and low willpower but gradually growing as series goes on.\
Enjoyment : 8\
With all its weakness and drawback covered with its plus, i enjoyed watching this series so much. Well they said personal enjoyment cant always be related to its objective view.\

    We all know what’s lying at the very top of Mount Hype right now: Shingeki no Kyojin or in other words, Attack on Titan. Sparing you from the generic “It’s regarded as a masterpiece, but is it? We shall see with this review,” kind of intro, I’ll tell you that no, it’s not a masterpiece but it’s not terrible either. \
Story:\
Right away the story starts strong with a darker and more epic atmosphere, already backed up by its interesting premise. The mood was already set from the beginning but this show didn’t feel like it was good enough. In a way, the mood and atmosphere\
          \
        in Attack on Titan is like fog: the staff keep making the fog thicker and thicker until you can no longer see the surroundings.\
In other words: The mood and atmosphere are so focused on that it gets in the way of the story. Although the story is still there, it likes to show despair over and over when it is no longer necessary to show it. Almost everything has to go wrong with a few exceptions so the story has to continue, people must die and we must always see them die or be told about how terrible it was until you get sick of it and we must always see people almost going insane with all this.\
It is understandable that all of this happens in this kind of story and I don’t think everything should’ve been more positive, it’s just that I would rather see plot progression than despair. You could try to tell me that this was the show trying to be psychological and that it was not the atmosphere but that would still be badly executed because it accomplishes nothing and we get to see nothing in the minds of the characters.\
Not only that but this show also loves sidetracking. The first few episodes had a visible goal but somewhere in the later episodes it is sidetracked by an event of the plot that wasn’t as important as the goal presented before, and that important goal was never reached. With that, the more interesting questions about the story were never answered and only raised more questions. \
The final episodes of the show confused me further. Although they made me realize that this part was more important than it seemed, it failed to tell us more than that and in the end we’re left in the dark about all the more important points of the story. But that’s only about the story, we haven’t even gotten to the characters yet.\
I liked the concept of the Titans but unfortunately we got to know anything interesting about them because of this show’s thing for sidetracking. One of the only solid things about this anime is its world-building as we got to see how their society differed from ours with its separate walls and districts to the roles of the various factions of this series. The fact that their culture was different from ours was obvious and I liked it.\
The ending was very open: a second season is definitely expected from this. If that’s not the case then the ending is terrible. Only the part I mentioned above was “solved” (if you consider a final fight as solved) and the first goal we had in sight was barely touched upon.\
Seriously, if this doesn’t get a second season I will take one point away from the score of the story.\
Character:\
The fog does not only affect the story: it especially affects the characters. The characters are so drowned in despair that I end up forgetting about them in the sadistic show that is Attack on Titan. This show loves showing as much despair as possible to the characters, and the only ones that have some sort of depth are only some the characters that matter (the ones that were focused on throughout the show; Jean, a supporting character, had a surprising amount of focus so I'm considering him as an exception that I won't mention here). Those that aren’t even supporting characters usually lack common sense and possibly sanity, being suspicious of everything and anything and having lost the ability to see something convenient and be clever about it.\
By episode 13 my brother had even forgotten Eren’s name! We (my brother and I) could barely keep track of the names of the supporting characters and the show assumed that we had that good of a memory when surrounded by so much despair. There were so many character deaths that they pretty much became meaningless and by that point we were pretending that we knew the names of the characters and that they actually mattered. It’s hard to root for humanity when it mostly consists of idiots that don’t have the ability of rational thought and are possibly insane. I know I repeated that but I really want to emphasize this: Humanity was too stupid for me to care about whether they survive or not.\
Before I make a ten page essay on how I thought the characterization in this show was not good, I’ll talk about our main characters or just the characters that matter overall, starting with Eren. Eren seems to be the angrier version of a shounen protagonist, having his focus on his revenge and anger towards Titans but also his desire to protect his friends. Because of this, he was never that interesting and all of the things happening to him just hinted at how special he is but we never get to know why because of the abrupt ending. \
As most people might agree with, the most interesting character is definitely Mikasa but I ended up liking Armin more instead. He might seem useless in the beginning but he seems to be one of the few people in this world that has intelligence and common sense while there were many situations that could’ve gone worse (because I can’t say they went good since that’s almost impossible in Attack on Titan) if it weren’t for him being there and giving the characters a plan to follow. All in all, he had the most development in the show which is an outstanding feat considering Mikasa and the fact that there is barely any development at all.\
When I said that Eren was special, I didn’t mean that he was the most special because Mikasa is introduced as being stronger than Eren right at the beginning of the show. She’s calm and stoic and she’s usually the one that keeps Eren in line. It’s pretty bad that in the later episodes, whenever I expected her to do something she would be absent or wasn’t able to since she was one of the better characters.\
The last character I want to talk about, although you might not think he’s important, is Levi who I kindly renamed Dick.\
…What? It’s a name! Isn't “Captain Dick” easier to say than “Captain Levi”? Anyway, his personality is pretty similar to his name and he’s also a clean freak and blunt. I didn’t hate him, and I still don’t understand his popularity but that’s something else. It seemed like he would barely matter at first but in the later episodes he was practically Eren’s pep talker, like the ones that say the crucial words to the generic shounen protagonists and it gets on their heads, that kind of thing. I have to admit there wasn't as much development from him but there was foreshadowing so I thought of that as a miraculous plus.\
The important and supporting characters are passable in terms of making the plot move forward but that’s not all a character should have. The cast was large but not really that varied in personality with only a few exceptions, most just fading away into the fog and only seen when they die but by that point, I already forgot about their existence. I do have to admit that the mystery behind who the antagonist was in reality was really well done until the final episodes when they literally gave it away.\
At least they gave it (the antagonist since I don’t want to give it away) depth but it was only in the final episodes where it was pretty much revealed although it’s depth nonetheless so it’s a miracle in my perspective.\
Art and Animation:\
I really like the show’s art style with actual noses (YES!) and fitting with the overall atmosphere of absolute irrefutable despair and the titan’s designs were really good. Although I do have to ask, why do they all have to have rape faces? I was told that they were meant to be scary but I only laughed my ass off as I saw them over and over, is this considered bad character design? The Titans always look so ridiculous too…  I don’t really have a favorite character design so I guess I’ll say it was good and shut up about it.\
The animation was pretty good… Pfft, who am I kidding, just look at them talking while they spiderman over trees! The rest was pretty solid though.\
\
The Sound:\
The soundtrack fits really well with the show’s overall epic and serious atmosphere, excluding the despair of course, but I have to admit that I barely noticed it except for that one soundtrack that has the loud female vocals but I don’t find it to be as good as the others. Despite my words, it is a very good soundtrack. The openings and endings of this anime are so good that I cannot pick my favorite out of all of them. They are that good. They are dramatic and epic and they all fit with the show perfectly, it’s absolutely impossible to choose.\
\
In terms of voice acting, I was quite surprised when I found out that Mikasa’s voice actress Ishikawa Yui (In the eastern naming order) didn’t have many roles. She did that role so well that I just thought she was a mainstream voice actress but I guess not. She definitely needs more roles.\
Enjoyment:\
This is definitely an enjoyable show… Or that’s what I would say but I didn’t enjoy it that much. If I weren’t with my brother watching this and making fun of the fact that we barely knew any character from the show and giving stupid nicknames for them I would’ve dropped it after a while. It might be that action is just not for me but there isn’t that much action so I can’t really give that as an excuse.\
It was definitely the despair. The oh so predictable and oh so annoying despair. The lingering fog of god-awfulness, if that’s even a word. You know when you can always predict that the shounen protagonists will win and everything will be alright? Reverse that and you have the mist. Nothing will be alright but it will end up being solved because the plot has to move on. It was so predictable in that aspect that every time something would happen I would have to go like, “Of course, it’s Attack on Titan after all…” with an apathetic face.\
Overall:\
Attack on Titan has been considered to be one of the best anime ever but it’s average at best, though it certainly deserves its hype more than the previous hyped show (I’m looking at you SAO…). Its story can hardly stand out due to the awful amount of unnecessary despair getting in the way and it sidetracks into something that wasn’t even fully solved to begin with, though it was very good at luring you in with its premise and strong start. The characters drown in despair, lacking depth and development with the exception of the most important characters and don’t even get me started on Humanity as a whole.\
The music and visuals were very good but they couldn’t really carry the show anywhere because of the fog that is despair. My enjoyment was low but I can definitely understand why many would enjoy it. I can definitely expect a second season though and when it happens, I hope everything is solved there. I can recommend this to fans of more serious shounen and action and I guess those that don’t think about details as much as me.\

    Although its good entertainment, Kyojin is far from stellar.\
The story, after a great 1st cour, hits the familiar ceiling that all survival anime inevitably face. The story becomes repetitive, falling into the cycle where the characters run, fight and then reflect on the damage. There was no real plot development or revelations about the titans, and no matter how many characters-I-don't-care-about they killed, I felt indifferent. I felt that this anime tried to dress up weak story arcs and pointless characters with the amazing animation, which was sometimes over the top. There were times when I was sat in awe at the fights, but just\
          \
        as often times when I was thinking \"wtf, he only bit his lip\", or \"wait, he only put a rock back in the wall\". I also felt there were pacing issues in the second cour, with the painfully long expedition resulting in the introduction of new characters and last minute character development with only 1 episode to go!\
That said, I did thoroughly enjoy the 1st cour. From the groundbreaking first episode to the amazing fixing-the-hole sequence in episode 13 (ott but I loved it!), I felt it did a great job at establishing the terrifying power of the titans and raising questions about their origins. I loved how the animators made the titans' movements fast and childlike; it made them grossly realistic and more frightening than if they had just been overwhelmingly huge. The sound was awesome, especially the 1st opening and ending themes that suited the show perfectly! \
Hopefully the second season will answer the questions the first season failed to answer and no more time will be wasted by Eren's frustrating inability (by his own decision or not) to become a titan when his comrades are dying around him. Id really love to see Kyojin return to focus on the main characters and the mystery of the titans for season 2.\

\"I'm going to kill all the Titans!\"\
Why, of course you are.\
\
\"Zombie\" is a genre. It's not survival horror, it's \"Zombie\" respectively. This is because Zombie follows a completely different set of rules, tropes and clichés, while survival horror is a vague category that could really be much broader. Shingeki no Kyojin is not a horror show, not a serious Seinen, or a well written show. It's a disappointing mess of a Shounen zombie show. \
To qualify as a Zombie show, several plot points are required. You need a menace/zombies, the survivors/prey of the menace, as well as a location where supplies are limited or scarce.\
          \
        The Titans, humans, and the 3 walls fit under these points. Congratulations, SnK qualifies in the preliminaries. But does it hold up? \
Absolutely not; SnK completely lacks the themes that make a Zombie media good, or at least entertaining. It's predictable with a lack of tension thanks to plot holes, Gary Stu protagonists who for some reason can't die, and no direct relation to what’s happening to the characters on the screen. The main selling of a Zombie media is emotions akin to fear or anxiety. Basically never knowing who's going to die, or how and when people do die, it should mean something, since you as the viewer feel a connection as if you were surviving with that person all along the stories direction. \
Now you'll say, \"But people die in SnK all the time! Have you even seen the show?!?!?”\
People don't die in SnK, cardboard backgrounds SHAPED like people die in SnK. These \"people\" have no memorable names or development going for them, just one trait that you remember them by; like black kid or short kid. These \"people\" die like frogs in a grinder, for nothing more than mere shock value, which is an ironic saying because there is no value in it at all. \
The main characters that have names, but not any actual depth mind you; don't die at all. They are beaten, eaten, and torn, yet they still live. Why?\
Because Eren is Naruto. He's going to save the day, defeat the enemy, keep his friends alive, and obtain a secret power that makes him near invincible (a terrible shounen trope). He's a bland and unlikable shounen protagonist straight from the box o' clichés, written by a third grader in purple crayon. He also has his girlfriend who is super strong, and together they can take on entire titan armies. This reincarnation of Jesus is what breaks the whole atmosphere of a Zombie show. Zombie shows are supposed to bring out the human aspects of its inhabitants, mortality being a major theme. Having a Gary Stu with more plot armor than a castle has bricks, breaks the human formula.\
My biggest problem with SnK is that it has the nerves to use the, \"IT HAPPENED OFF SCREEN\" tactic. 5 years of training that's supposed to make everyone stronger? Skipped, and even with this aforementioned training, hundreds die on the FIRST mission. 20% of the population dying? Skipped dawg. Titan behavior observation? Haven't seen him. All these plot points could be used for character development, a concept unknown in SnK. \
And don't talk to me about the pacing. This show takes its god damn time on absolutely the most irritatingly absurd predicaments. Eren and friends spend an entire episode (That takes an eternity mind you) about to be fired upon from his allies, all for them finally to come to the conclusion that they should ask their allies not to fire. What?!?! Anyone could have done that without a second thought, and it wouldn't take them Armin's \"special tacticool talent\", which by the way, doesn't exist. He's just a useless whiny annoyance, but at least he's under human restrictions, unlike Mr. KILLALLTITANS.\
The menace of a Zombie show usually has a set of rules that are observed by the characters and then exploited in order to survive. Example, zombies are attracted to humans to eat. While a few general rules are known about the Titans, every different Titan acts randomly. Some Titans are slow, sluggish and easily killed; while others jump super high and grab you lightning fast with their mouths. Some Titans can run faster than humans with gear, and then again some can't even walk properly. The only explanations we ever get, is that any Titan that acts differently is an “abnormal.\" Thanks to this asinine bullshit, not only are the humans broken, but the menaces are as well!\
On Music and Animation…\
A very solid sound track; all that can be said is that it's wasted on SnK. The animation is poor quality with 50 million stills in every episode. No such praise is deserved in this category.\
As a reminder, SnK is a SHOUNEN, when it could very easily be a quality Seinen with its original exposition. It’s majorly disappointing that all this potential is to go to waste. SnK might look good in comparison to other shows it’s competing with, but a rock isn’t a diamond just because it’s surrounded by dirtier rocks.\

    It's kinda ridiculous, actually, how I gave everything a ten in this review.\
...Nope, it's not- SnK deserves an eleven.\
I haven't even seen the last episode yet (blame procrastination), but this is by far the best anime I've ever seen. There's no fuckery with random plot twists (otay, the Female Titan was NOT a random plot twist), the raw emotion completely gets you, and the sheer brilliance of the plot and characterization is stunning. It's a masterpiece.\
The only thing that really sucks? That there won't be another Shingeki no Kyojin. That no game or movie can do it true justice. That this can't last forever.\

    This anime is popular for a reason, its flashy, the animation and music are great, the fight scenes are stylish and on the surface level it seems really cool. With that out of the way, I HATE this anime, when I was watching it I literally wanted to punch my screen. The First thing that pissed me of were some of the characters, most of them are mediocre to slightly interesting, but some are awful. The main character is alright, but Mikasa is a cold soulless husk created so that the writers could have someone to kill a titan if they need it. Armin is\
          \
        AWFUL, anytime anything gets even a little bit tough he literally falls on the ground and starts screaming about how he \"can't do it\", and ends up getting like 3 people killed in the process. This might be ok and completely believable if he did this a couple of times, but he spends the whole show doing it. I've never hated a character more. The rest of them are pretty generic tropes like most anime, but some have a couple interesting things about them. The dialogue is a joke a lot of them time, I understand that these people have seen some shit and are facing death, but COME ON. Most of it is people standing around, complaining, yelling, arguing, and accusing each other of stuff. Meanwhile, everyone around them is dying and they just start arguing about nothing. Not to mention the insane freak out moments where they streak the animation and shake the screen around. It was INFURIATING. But that's not all, next we have the story. I admit that the original premise is interesting, but they spend little time on it. Most of the story is about humans attempting to do something and then failing horribly. You know how in comics and stuff the good guy always wins, and so you never actually feel tension for the situation? This show is the exact opposite, the good guy always loses, they literally can't do anything right. If somebody gets in a bad situation then you know they are dead. Even worse, the writers pull like anti-deus ex machina stuff out of nowhere just so that the humans will lose. So even if things seem alright, nope, somebodies probably going to die. The soldiers are completely useless and die all the time, except for a few badass type characters who fly through titans like nothing. The pacing is terrible, with the first few episodes flying by and being really interesting and then nothing happens for like 7 episodes. By the end of the anime you have learned NOTHING about ANYTHING interesting in the story. They present to you a couple of mysteries in the show that you think will be interesting when they get to them, but they don't even try to progress to some and the writers come up with a way to crush any efforts to get to others. The only reason this show gets a 4 is because the production was very good, but damn this show did nothing but make me angry after the first few episodes. Proceed with caution.",

    This anime is 10/10 OUTSTANDING. This is on the top of my favorite anime list. Everything is perfect and literally I think there is no flaws. I'm totally in the hype for the second season coming up in 2016. I hope the next season will be just as good as the first one. Because if it isn't as good as the last then many people will be disappointed. I might as well watch the whole entire 1st season to refresh my mind a bit before the second season actually comes out! But seriously I love the story in this anime, so far out of all\

    If you hate reading long reviews, I'll make this short and simple. Attack on Titan is an amazing anime and I loved every second of it. SPOILER FREE!!!\
Story: Absolutely an amazing storyline. You have these human eating titans that has forced humanity to hide behind walls for a century. If you think the story is this simple, you have another thing coming. There were a ton of \"HOLY ****\" and \"WTF IS GOING ON?\" that you just have to watch and experience the mind blowingness for yourself.\
Characters: Our protagonist, Eren, is determined to kill every last titan after a horrible incident. You become attached to\
          \
        literally all the characters (except Armin at first) and the show is super messed up by just having characters introduced and to die in the next moment like swatting a fly. There were times where I would have an adrenaline rush and going \"YESSS GO!\" and times where I just felt so sad and like \"NOOOOO!! WHY!!??\" \
Art and Sound: Absolutely amazing animation. Especially in fight scenes. TOTALLY EPIC!!! Loved the intros and music choices in different scenes. All great!\
Enjoyment: Need I say more?!? Absolutely hands down amazing! Must watch!\
If you haven't seen Attack on Titan yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. One of the best I have ever seen. \

    What is the most popular anime of 2013? Attack on Titan. Before I started watching, I read so many reviews, heard from my friends and also received so much praise that its one of those \"absolute\" must watch anime of last year. Yes, I did enjoyed it, but to an extent.\
This review will contain spoilers. You've been warned.\
Humanity have been overrun by the so called \"Titans\"(to be frank, they are nothing more than just giant, naked zombies) and humans have built huge walls, confining themselves within. Obviously, peace within the city didn't last forever and soon, titans managed to find their way inside. That's the\
          \
        gist of the story. I'll admit that I find AoT's story a bit more unique than the usual, which is a good thing. Ecchi(which is something I hate) which is a very common part of anime these days is nowhere to be found in AoT, and yes, that's another good thing. The initial story seems rather interesting and believable, until one point in the series, it becomes garbage. AoT does have it good and funny moments, even despite it being so serious most of the time.\
SPOILERS: One part of the story which I disliked; after the titan-transforming power has been introduced into the anime, it caused the downfall of my own personal viewing experience. While some people called it cool and epic, but its ridiculous in my opinion. Not to mention, even with a crappy explanation to back it up. How did Eren get it? It's nothing more than a dream of Eren being injected by his father. Truthfully, I would have preferred if Attack on Titan story's should have went without all the transforming crap. Though, Annie has it too, and it makes me wonder why is she the only female titan in the anime. But seriously, titan-transforming Power:RUBBISH. Also, I might add that, the outcome behind the Colossal titan and the Armored titan remains unsolved. What happened to them the end of the anime? Amusingly enough, the face of the Colossal titan suddenly appeared at the ending which could mean potential for another season. SPOILER END. \
Another weak aspect of the show, are the characters; namely Eren, Mikasa, Armin. Naruto Uzu- I mean, Eren Yeager is one of those characters out of typical shounen anime: always preaching and talking about exterminating the titans(believe me, you'll hear him repeat it a LOT of times its aggravating). Mikasa could've been a cool character; beautiful, strong, regrettably her main role is like being Eren's babysitter. Lastly, Armin is....well, you know, another Amano Yukiteru clone. The three main protagonists are terrible. They're not the worst protagonists I've seen, but man, I honestly didn't like them. Instead, I was more interested in the supporting characters a little bit more than the main trio(Sasha, Jean, Levi just to name some) but none of them still far enough for a personal favorite. Still, I'll admit that, seeing some of the \"good\" characters die a meaningless death got me quite teary eyed. The characters tend to show realistic reactions during certain situations, though few of them are truly unnecessary and overdone in some cases. \
AoT also tries to increase the tension or the \"shock-factor\". Unfortunately, seeing random characters who are nothing but Titan fodder is one of the cheapest ways to do it. By even adding some edgy and shaky camera views and angles, I have to say, they were trying too hard and sometimes the scenes that were SUPPOSED to increase the tension, end up looking bad.\
What AoT does better at are the music/sound,visuals and the action. They are all...decent at most. First, the action scenes, you can't really go wrong with AoT's action parts. It's does a decent job at getting the viewers' attention to some fast-paced and edge-of-the-seat battles. It still continues to baffle me that the soldiers are able to move fast even carrying all that equipment; the gas cylinders, the three dimensional manuever device, the blades, etc. It just seem difficult. \
Sound wise, The OP is great (Guren no Yumiya, I've listened to it countless times) and some nice soundtrack kicks in whenever the battle heats up. Voice acting was good, nothing much to say about sound. \
The overall animation quality is good, although from time to time, I find the thick black outlines on the characters quite unappealing. There are several occasions where the characters looked poorly animated and terribly drawn. \
In the end, I have so many mixed feelings about Attack on Titan. I enjoyed some aspects of it and also hated some parts. It has its fun moments and it does better in other key areas such as sound and animation. But, the characters and several areas of the story ruined it for me. Dedicated action fans would definitely love AoT. Still, I truly can't recommend AoT for the serious viewer. If there ever be a second season, I don't mind watching it.",

    OKAY!!! SO, finally finished the series.\
Impressions: Great Entry Level Anime that appeals universally to pretty much anyone and everyone. \
Story began with the first two episodes giving me high expectations. For me, this was one of the strongest beginnings to an anime since Gurren Lagann. Eren was perfectly set up to be the archetypal Beowolf Character. A hero who trips and falls, but finally finds victory in the end. What they did that was clever was they separated the hero archetype into three different characters instead of shoving all of the traits into one. \
Eren = Force of Will\
Armin= Intelligence\
Mikasa = Skill/Talent\
Did the story\
          \
        live up to expectations? No. \
It actually did not live up to expectations and although i hate to use this excuse, it is precisely because it is marketed as Shounen Manga. This undermines a lot of the powerful imagery and symbolism that could've been there.  In the end they're wading in a bunch of shoulda coulda but yah didn'ts. \
Art is fantastic, and shows one of the best usages of CGI since Fate Zero. Lines are still a bit too sharp for me, but its still great regardless. Very detailed although i can see they re-used stock footage occasionally. \
Sound is your \"AAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH\" Choir on top of heavy action scenes that we've become accustomed to... and you know what? STILL FUCKING AWESOME. Great timing here on choosing when to play what music. \
Characters are weaker than i would've liked them to be. They might've been going for the \"anyone is expendable\" route, but if they were.... they wouldn't have FUCKING DONE WHAT THEY DID TO EREN I MEAN WHAT THE FLYING FU---  *cough* i'm okay >_< Lets just say Eren pulls a Jesus, with the most bullshit retarded excuse for a plot device ever. You'll enjoy the characters, but they won't stand out outside of their established character archetypes. \
Enjoyment is incredible in this anime. At the end of the day, its a shonen show, and it does what shonen shows do best. Scream loudly, and make things explode..... in the span of 10 episodes. BUT CONDENSED INTO 1! What a novel idea ;) \
Overall this show does exactly what it's supposed to, and doesn't really push any innovation besides production value to the table. I expected far more, but sadly this shant be the show to deliver. If you like action and a good enough plot to keep you invested, by all means, this show does wonders for you. \

    Okay I am a fan of some giant comics and films.  I was disappointed when i saw this series.  I take a look at things from episode 1.  If its not interesting at that first episode the anime show is not good.  This anime show went beyond that.  It was boring, and i seriously wanted to smack myself for wasting 20 minutes even scanning through this.  The plot to this show is also rediculous, and the characters within the show do some of the most idiotic things imaginable.  Like building a city and staying in it for 100\
          \
        years, and not preparing for things incase it does happen.  No they panic instead of being prepared for war, and do things too late.  Anyways also for this show to be \"gory,\" and \"graphica\"l it sure as hell takes too long to kill someone.  Seriously it takes 20 minutes for a giant monster to kill a human being.  Seriously the show would have been good, had it not started off with some of the most dumbest things imagineable.  On top of it all it spends too much of its time talking.  This is like watching those boring marvel movies, and people consider this nonsense epic or badass.  For a giant show, you would expect atleast human bodies or a darker setting, but you just get this boring plot which i am more bored than scared.  This is coming from a guy who loves the giant films.  Giant females as well which the show seemed to lack, but once they include her into the series, and while reading the manga because i cannot take looking at 20 minutes boring, they made the whole series into a big joke.  I kid you not i am changing my view of things about this anime now, because of the giant woman being introduced.  And this is a shame, how she can come in and make the manga literally funny, but the show a complete mess and waste of time that you can use to watch something else.  I seriously recommend the manga vs the anime.  The anime is a complete waste, while the manga is just funny as hell and interesting.  Its just a shame the woman acts more like a giant would in these fanmade comics, vs how a male giant would act lol.  This also proves once again, how manga will always defeat anime.  Not because of how anime always censors somethings, but because you get more content in a stand still comic vs a moving motion picture.  \

    Shingeki no Kyojin is another series that gets a very mixed response. Some claim it has a great story and compelling characters. Others say it has an overly simplified story and characters who are so flat they would almost be at home in Highschool of the Dead. It was written by Isayama Hajime and the anime adaptation was handled by relative newcomer Wit Studio with cooperation from veteran Production I.G, you may recognise them as the studio behind Ghost in the Shell, Rinne no Lagrange and Psycho Pass to name a few. This one I'm actually not going into completely blind. I have read a\
          \
        bit of the manga and interacted with some of the fans. I'll try not to hold the fact that many of those fans have trouble with a simple four letter name against the anime. After all, there are plenty of good works with much worse fanbases. Although it certainly doesn't help your credibility when you're trying to argue in favour of the intellectual value of a series but you can't spell \"Levi.\" \
Story: \
In the distant future, mankind has been forced to hide within walls. Gigantic humanoid creatures who seem to live for no other purpose than to consume humans, called titans, roam the land outside. Things get worse when the outermost of the walls is torn down by a titan, allowing the titans to take a third of humanity's remaining territory. The story focuses on three youngsters who witnessed the wall's collapse and managed to survive. They go through military training in order to fight the titans and secure humanity's future. \
On the positive side, the story is very well constructed. Everything about the world is carefully thought out from the technology to the military formations, even the horses the survey corps rides into battle were carefully selected. There are also a lot of good ideas and suspense building scenes. The story has some great tragic moments and it manages to stop at an opportune time in spite of having a lot more to the story. There are a lot of nice mysteries that keep you invested and the whole thing is very compelling. Particularly the mystery of the titans themselves. The anime itself points out that these creatures should not be able to exist based on basic biology and physics, but they somehow do and, thus far, there are only vague hints and hypotheses as to why. I am interested in seeing more of this world and learning the truth behind the various plot lines. \
On the down side, the pacing is pretty slow, with overly long recap portions contributing to the problem. The series takes nine episodes for one battle. To be fair, it's a battle with multiple enemies and a lot does happen in it, but it's slowed down by fairly long segments where nothing really happens and it probably could have been finished in four or five episodes if they'd skipped the padding. Then, there's the problem with foreshadowing. One of the things the Manga does very well is to give you hints about important story elements well in advance. In the anime, they cut out most of the foreshadowing scenes. There's even one that gets moved so that it's at the beginning of the episode that has the reveal being foreshadowed in it. Which is just terrible narrative construction. \
Characters: \
This is the big factor that people argue about and I can see why. Shingeki no Kyojin mostly has really strong characters, but it also has three incredibly weak ones. Unfortunately, the weak characters are the ones that get the focus for the vast majority of the series. \
Eren, Mikasa and Armin aren't just mostly boring and occasionally annoying. They're completely cliché. Eren is your archetypal determined “chosen one” protagonist. Mikasa is your typical “strong” but emotionally dependent love interest (who just happens to have been raised with Eren since they were nine which adds some disturbing context) and Armin is your basic weak but supportive best friend. He's supposed to be smart, but all he really does is point out the glaringly obvious. The three of them are characters who have been in a huge number of series and there's nothing that Shingeki no Kyojin does to make them unique or interesting in the slightest. \
The secondary characters, on the other hand, are amazing. When compared to Eren, Mikasa and Armin, especially. The support cast has a lot of complex, well-developed characters. Jean, Connie, Krista, Ymir, Sasha, Erwin, and Levi are the most obvious examples, but there are more. These characters, in spite of having much less screen time, are all interesting with developed motivations and great potential for intrigue . Even the characters who appear very briefly and die are more three-dimensional than the three leads. If the series focused more on the secondary characters and less on Toast, Sand and Oddly-shaped Vegetable, it would be vastly improved. \
Art:\
The art in this is gorgeous. The detailing is meticulous. The character designs are all unique. The titans are designed to look almost human, but with enough that's strange about them to make them monstrous, like not having skin or having massive jaws. The backgrounds are really detailed. The action sequences are nice and intense. Everything about this anime looks really spectacular. The only drawback is that the designs are so well detailed that you can easily tell who the colossus, armoured and female titan shifters are at a glance, even if they only reveal one of their identities in the series. The problem being that they try to play their identities up as a big mystery. Gee, I wonder if they're really the people who uncannily resemble them?\
Sound: \
Wit Studio got some really strong actors for this series. There are too many to list all of them, but they got Paku Romi, Kamiya Hiroshi, Ono Daisuke, and Fujita Saki to name a few. They all do really well in their roles. The weaknesses are Kaji Yuki, Ishikawa Yui and Inoue Marina. Just because they got the unfortunate roles as Toast, Sand and Oddly-shaped Vegetable, and all they really get to do is be bland and shout sometimes. The music is really well done. Especially during epic moments. \
Ho-Yay: \
The Ho-yay factor is a 3/10. Krista and Ymir get a few cute scenes. Erwin and Levi also have some chemistry and Jean implies that Armin has a thing for Eren at one point, but they don't do much with any of that. Perhaps the next series will, but there's not much there in this one. \
Final Thoughts: \
Shingeki no Kyojin offers a compelling narrative with an interesting world, awesome action and some superb characters. Where it falls short is with the pacing and the three primary characters being almost unbelievably bland. Although, in all fairness, they're still too strong of characters to fit into Highschool of the Dead. The series is probably still worth checking out for everything that it does well, if you're a fan of post-apocalyptic or action-oriented narratives. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Going into June my request queue is down to Kill La Kill and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Next week, Sakura Trick. ",

    If you have no idea what this anime is about... Go read the synopsis.\
Story:\
Basically, It's about a guy, Eren, who essentially doesn't have parents, and a girl, Mikasa, and another guy, Armin, who happen to be childhood friends with Eren.\
Eren loses his mother, when Titans invade, and she... basically gets eaten.\
Well then... In this anime, they rely on that idea so much. They rely on how \"disturbing\" that idea may be in order to keep people\" interested\", but to those who don't find it interesting will get bored very quickly.\
Skip over to the whole accusation that Eren is a complete monster.\
This, in my opinion was\
          \
        an absolutely horrid... arc? Anyways, they decide to spend multiple episodes on it, and in the middle of it pull out the episode 13.5... Yay... a recap.\
Anyways, In terms of the story, the producers and such decide to move very slow, as if this were an anime like Naruto, or something else that is very long, but this is a 25 episode series.. Very little happens per episode, and they have a recap at the beginning of each episode that lasts about 2 minutes, yet they decided to make a recap episode (13.5)\
Art:\
The art is actually really good. It's actually really interesting how they portray characters as if they're from different regions of the world. The way Eren's titan form looks is absolutely amazing. The same goes for the backgrounds and the smaller details.\
Although this may be true, a lot of the anime is a slideshow, which can be boring at times so.. yeah... There really isn't much to comment on.\
The art is good, some little gripes, but nothing major.\
Sound:\
The sound is also pretty good, as they decide to go with epic music... I really don't know how to describe it more... It just adds to the somewhat, old times, feel of the anime. Some of the music is pretty bad, in my opinion though, such as the openings.\
The reason why I rated the sound an 8, is because I never felt it REALLY added to the whole experience all that much.\
Character:\
The characters are alright. The main characters are pretty bland. Angsty teenager, girl who likes said teenager, childhood friend. That's basically it.\
However, the side characters seem to be much more interesting, as they have their own quirks, and seem to have a lot of thought put into them.\
That's basically why I gave it a 7/10 here. The main characters, which should honestly be the most interesting, are not. Right now, my favorite character is Levi, and he only got properly introduces a couple of episodes ago.\
Enjoyment:\
As I said before, the anime moves very very slow, and has a recap of the past episodes every episode. Doing this cuts the episode time down to about 20 minutes. I feel if anything, they should be cramming more stuff in each episode. Instead, the anime goes at a ridiculously slow pace. One episode was literally just people talking/arguing the whole time. Then they decide to pull out the episode 13.5 which was a recap, which honestly wasn't needed at all. Overall, it seems like the people working on this can't keep up with the pace that's expected by people like me. The only reason why I expect more is because I compared the enjoyment to other anime of the same number, or more, episodes.\
Overall:\
I'll try keeping this one short.\
It's pretty boring after the 4th episode or so. All their effort is honestly going into the wrong places. The story progresses very little per episode, that it makes it hard to believe that it's a 25 episode series. The art and sound are good, but nothing super exceptional. The characters are alright. The main characters are quite boring, but the side characters make up for that.\
It just moves so slow, that all their effort doesn't come through. It's not eventful, and there's very little, if any moments where I'd get so excited that I'd jump around or slam my desk.\

    I think Shingeki no Kyojin is one of those swing and miss types; either you completely love it or you don't.\
Unfortunately, for me, I'm leaning towards the latter.\
In terms of its animation, SnK is without a doubt amazingly drawn. The attention to detail is astounding, especially in the action scenes. It's probably the thing I love most about it, because it's just so impressive.\
The plot itself, however, is where I think it falls short.\
SnK is one of those shows that could only be described as epic, and not necessarily in a good way. Everything is too high-octane; the deaths, the fights, the dramatic soliloquies. Sometimes\
          \
        you need a change in tone, and after awhile it just becomes overbearing and tiresome. The characters are very much like that too. They're entirely stagnant, and every time you think they've made some sort of tiny wobble towards development, something tragic happens and sets them right back to where they were before. You're essentially left with the exact same characters in the last episode and the first episode of Season 1, albeit with a few sad stories tucked under their belts.\
I really wish I could've loved it, as it had so much potential, but there were just too many issues with the story itself.\

    \"People DIE when they are killed!\"\
Or so I thought until several episodes into this show when it becomes apparent that this might not be exactly accurate..  Attack on Titan pulled me in the instant I started watching it.  I had very high hopes and truly wanted to enjoy this show.\
Art - 8\
This show is highlighted by a lot of very good art.  The characters all have their own looks and the backgrounds are all fleshed out and are actually very gorgeous.  The 3D maneuver gear scenes alone are worth 2 extra points, as they are spectacular, especially early on.  The\
          \
        only downfall is that the art is very inconsistent.  It will be glamorous one second and then it will be ok for several scenes, sometimes even falling below the ok mark.  The desperation that they try to paint on every character's face is very unrealistic, especially the bigots that are against the main cast because of their desperation or fear.  They look more constipated than anything else.  The art is definitely the highlight of the show, but it can definitely falter at times.\
Sound - 7\
Aside from the openings, I honestly can't recall much of the music from the show.  It honestly left no impression on me whatsoever.  The only exception being the music when Eren transforms.  The voice acting was for the most part above average, and made me believe most of the characterizations.\
Story - 5\
Attack on Titan was full of untapped potential.  It hit on so many amazing notes, but then failed to follow through in even the most basic of ways.  I won't be one of those guys to say there are plotholes throughout, but I will say that a lot of the story simply does not make any sense.  What the characters do doesn't make any more sense.  Are we supposed to believe that a little kid  can track down criminals and kill them without any training or reason/prior hatred for criminals?  And why can't we have a series where the main character dies for once?  it might have been a decent change of pace, if done correctly....speaking of pace, this story has none.  I feel like I'm watching Katekyo Hitman Reborn all over again.  By the second to last episode of the last arc, I honestly didn't care anymore, they had drawn it out to such an extreme extent.  The first several episodes were fast paced and even had a time jump, then we get a drawn out five or more episode single day!!??  Why in the world could they have not given any kind of conclusion to any of the story whatsoever?  There are like fifty unanswered questions, most of which are quite obvious to deduce in your sleep, there are so many cliches in the story.\
But let's go into what Attack on Titan really is.  What Attack on Titan really is, is a zombie/godzilla crossbreed.  No one is safe aside from the main characters who will 'barely survive'  then find a way to burn all the eggs, or find a cure, and send godzilla....the zombies....I mean the titans into hybernation or something like that.  We even have the infection ideas, if no one picked up on the vomit eggs they pointed out in the later episodes.\
Characters - 3\
Eren - Annoying, Ichigo from Bleach, but more immature and less understanding, character.  I actually liked Eren after his character \"DEVELOPMENT\", if you can call it that.  Oh I got older so now I don't flip out at the drop of a hat.  That's my development, but that's as far as it goes.\
Me and my two friends are masters of the extremely hard to master 3D gear, as soon as we touch it.  My girlfriend for whom I don't share feelings for, has unstoppable potential and loves me for convincing her to take another person's life when she was a child.  My best friend likes to read books and is really nerdy meaning that he has the ability to command a losing battle into a winning one cause his book reading made him that tactically superior over the dozens of experienced tacticians on hand at any moment.\
Wish fulfillment anyone?  Mary and Gary Sue exist and they're having incest all over your dumb hopes and dreams of this being the best show ever.\
Other characters have no development other than to state what their stereotype is.  The ONLY exception being what's his face...the only guy who gets much screen time and whose friend is killed making him want to be a leader cause his friend always said he would be...that guy.  But they don't DO anything with it.  They just show him more often than any of the other side cast.  Even the AMAZING Petra didn't get a quarter his screen time....for that matter why is everyone so hyped up about Petra?  She had no development and was more friendship oriented than a 5 year old Naruto. (and yes I realize Naruto had no friends when he was 5 years old...it's part of my point)  All she really does is whine about the main character not believing in them enough...over...and over...and over again.  Sure it's a little  sad about her family, but other than that I don't get the huge travesty that was, when we had literally no time to grow to love her.\
Overall this show is pretty decent, but is overhyped to such an extreme I want to shout SAO, Naruto, One Peice, Bleach, etc. over and over and over again till people start pulling their heads out of their anuses.\
I give this show a 6/10\

I  think it has a great story plot, a great idea and the fact that it does surprise you a lot of times really helps it become even better.\
Art:\
It's greatly drawn with fantastic details but it doesn't have anything that can be considered 'beautiful' actually in my opnion it has kind of a 'traumatic' kind of feeling to it there are very little lively colors most part it's strong colors such as brown, red and orange in a fire kind of way.\
Character:\
I think the personality and the way the characters feel all this emotions such as rage and fear and the way they evolve\

        from the trauma is actually very realistic.\
Overall it's a great anime to watch, although it ends in a cliffhanger the second season is comming up, the story is still continuing in the manga and you never know the surprises there are to come.\

    I'll jump straight to the point: it gets better every episode.\
I didn't see why SnK was so mainstream popular, but once I managed to get past the first terrible, terrible episode (if you liked the first episode, you are a monster.), I saw the light. The brilliance is in how impossible it is to tell what is coming next. The storyline is filled with the horrifying side to human nature, and it isn't a utopia, guys, there is going to be blood, gore and terrified humans. I like how everything is about survival, and making sure they live another day. Storyline 10/10\
Art: AMAZING. Go watch\
          \
        the opening songs and you will get a feel of how amazing the art is. Everything is given life and a story in each frame, and every movement has a meaning. 10/10 definitely.\
Sound: I like the 1st OP, but damn, the 2nd one is just the best. #LeviHeichouFTW In any case, the sound effects make the show suspensive as hell. The entire soundtrack is just epicness that cannot be described with words. \"Music says the words we don't\" 10/10 for me\

    For a mainstream anime that has been popular for quite a while, I'm not surprised that many people have praised this show so extensively. It is not only an action-packed series full of nerve-wracking battles but also one including a multitude of emotions, dark mysteries, and creative plot twists. I was constantly gasping aloud or scared for the characters' circumstances, and I could see how many viewers became captivated by the story.\
At first I was quite skeptical about watching Attack on Titan because what I had seen of it was very bloody. I'm glad I tried it out, though. Of course a lot of people\
          \
        die and lose limbs, but it's all part of humanity's struggle against the bloodthirsty Titans who do nothing but devour humans. At the same time, while humans are desperate to survive, even the ones who've signed up to sacrifice their lives to save others continuously find themselves completely petrified when they see their comrades gruesomely eaten by Titans. They can never overcome fear of death. And though death is always a possibility, a few rise to lead humanity and try their hardest to extinguish the Titans that threaten their way of life. They can only hope that their dream to live freely can overcome their fear of losing their lives to the Titans.\
I was also pleasantly surprised by the occasional bouts of humor in the episodes. The main characters are teenagers, after all, so it's not uncommon for them to make jokes even in the midst of danger, partially to calm their nerves. They didn't overdo the humor, though, else that would have been inappropriate to the plot, so that was good.\
While most of the plot is devoted to finding a way to extinguish the Titans, I feel that a lot of it is filled with people dealing with their fear of dying in the mouth of a Titan. It got to be a little repetitive, though maybe it's just me. The threat of death for these characters is always present, and it isn't something that can be dealt with in one episode. It's reminiscent of PTSD, which can last a lifetime.\
Additionally, the majority of the story is concentrated on certain missions undertaken by Eren and the others after a five-year time skip of training to be soldiers. While the rest of the action flowed fine, I wished to see the characters train more. Some of them became very skilled, but the span of their training was only about an episode or so. Also, that way more history of Titans could have been revealed as well as their opinions behind the structure of the government, which was a little muddled or one-sided before they began fighting against the Titans.\
While I greatly enjoyed the plot, there were a few interruptions within major battles to allude to back stories and flashbacks of various characters. Those were important to know, but I found myself impatient while watching them because I wanted to know what was happening in the present.\
There are also a few unexplained parts of the plot, very minor details, but I'm sure that they will be explained in the upcoming season.\
Attack on Titan has some of the best animation I've ever seen. Most of it is attributed to the characters' movement with 3D Maneuver Gear; the users seem to weave through the skies between buildings and trees effortlessly. They're quick, though, and I found that a little disorienting. However, the speed is necessary for their Titan killing.\
Whenever there were transitions between scenes and screen was focused on landscape and such, they looked great. Flowers swaying in the wind sparkled under sunlight, buildings were very detailed with old-fashioned decorations and precise to the very bricks they were made with.\
The characters were drawn with thick black outlines around them, which I disliked. I suppose this is done to distinguish between them and the background, but I think it was unnecessary. I did, however, like their uniforms. They were stylish and pretty unique; I haven't seen anything like them before.\
The songs for Attack on Titan are pretty phenomenal. The first opening theme song is super amazing; it sounds epic and like a song I could imagine soldiers getting ready to suit up with. The second one is similar in quality, but I prefer the first one. The ending themes are pretty good, too. They're not as pumped as in the intros, but they're pleasant and otherwise enjoyable.\
The soundtrack is perfect. There are many themes composed for certain events, battles, flashbacks, etc., and they sound exhilarating or morose, fitting whatever feelings they need to. There is some techno, rock, soft piano, all very cool. This composer knew what he was doing.\
I think what is best about this show is the variety of characters and their uniqueness. For example, before I watched Attack on Titan, I was already familiar with Levi Ackerman from the fandom because they're crazy about him. However, I should really talk about the most important three:\
The protagonist Eren Jaeger starts out as a small boy with the most courage I've ever seen. His mother's death at the hands of a Titan drives him to do his best in order to achieve his ultimate goal: to kill every Titan on the face of the earth. While some may tire at his determination and lack of strength, his training helps him a lot in becoming a better and stronger soldier. He also comes to think more about his actions and the world within the walls rather than just about himself.\
Mikasa Ackerman is lovely girl with a stoic countenance. She cares first and foremost for Eren, whom she has spent much of her childhood with. Initially I found her character to be bland, but she grows into a formidable Titan killer through her training. I admire her skills and love for her friends.\
Armin Arlert is at first an impish blond child who is bullied a lot and can't fend for himself. However, he is very intelligent and comes up all the ideas and plans when he is a trainee. It is a lot of change from the crybaby he once was, as he is an observant person who thinks things through and is incredibly smart.\
The other characters are also very well designed. They have distinct personalities and their own unique traits. I didn't hate a single one of them, though some I liked more than others. Some of them seemed a little too powerful, though, but maybe that was just me. Anyway, there are a lot of notable characters in this show and I'm sure all of them are someone's favorite.\
It is without a doubt that I enjoyed watching Attack on Titan very much. I binge watched it in 2-4 episode bursts and eagerly made sure to finish the OVAs before writing this review. This show kept me on the edge of my seat, cringing at the bloody parts but nervously waiting for the characters to fight their way to the top. Many characters die, most of them not so significant but also others who have had larger roles. I honestly didn't tear up more than once, though. The action is definitely addicting, but the plot in between is also good to see. The animation is swell, soundtrack is amazing, characters are great, and the show was an overall an enjoyable watch.\

    In order to achieve something, we must make a sacrifice. For pride, dignity, honour and glory.\
Since I mentioned that I wasn't planning on watching \"Attack on Titans\" on my previous \"High School of the Dead\" review. I take those words back now. I just can't believe most youtube videos make parody out of this anime and I wonder what is all the commotion about.\
STORY (7):\
OMG! It's Godzilla! Just Joking! The story takes place in a village which is surrounded by 3 walls that protect the village. From outside to inside, Wall Maria, Wall Rose & Wall Sina. These walls are served as a fortress for\
          \
        defense against attacks. Things start to turn nasty when the titans break the walls down and devour humans. This gives rise to the challenge within the military. \
So basically the story starts off as slow with some fillers as the military troops fight the titans and slowly have some flashbacks. Things start to turn interesting on Eren's trial and when the female titan shows up. There is basically nothing special about the story. Just like most action anime, the last few episodes are the most interesting part of the anime. At the end, when they reveal a titan image on the wall, I was so surprised.\
\
ART & ANIMATION (8):\
Tetsuro Araki directed \"High School of the Dead\" which has a similar colour tone this anime has. The color tone is as dark as the anime \"High School of the Dead\". The difference is that Attack on Titans has an outline which is bold. The titans are like giant humans or zombies. Tetsuro Araki came up with a very creative idea on making giants and zombies in anime. Outlines that are bold resembles a dark and serious tone.\
The anime also made use a lot of references like Spiderman when they swing the rope. Even like during the final battle, this anime made use the reference of Red Hulk like when the Titan was angry and powerful, the titan starts to heat up.\
SOUND (9):\
Now I understand why there was a lot of hype for this anime. The opening \"Guren no Yumiya\" was frequently used in most youtube videos that I have watched and they name it \"Shingeki no xxxxx\". Even few youtube videos used the 2nd opening \"Wings of Freedom\". I liked the 1st opening \"Guren no Yumiya\". The 1st and 2nd opening has tunes that resembles pride and dignity as a soldier. The 1st and 2nd ending was ok.\
CHARACTER (6):\
There is really not so much character development in most of the cast. The main characters Eren, Mikasa and Armin had little character development.\
Eren was brave but however he sometimes act rashly and ended up screwing his life and people around him.\
Mikasa didn't surprise me at first because I thought she would be useless but in this anime she was smart, badass, calm and composed. I appreciate her development as a character.\
Armin had wits but he wasn't capable in combat. He sometimes might lose faith when things go wrong.\
So, basically Eren & Armin are the ones that overreact the most. But at least they went through a bit of development and they show courage and spirit.\
The characters that went through a great character development are one of the supporting characters. They are Erwin, Jean, Levi & Marco. Levi is my most favorite character in this anime because without him, I wouldn't be enjoying this anime as much as most of the fans of this show did. \
Levi was the most badass character in this anime. He is smart, calm and caring on the inside, even though on the outside, he is cold and strict. He is now one of my favorite characters.\
\
CONCLUSION (8):\
Eren is one good example to learn that if you act rashly, you will end up destroying yourself and everyone around you. When someone gives an opinion about Eren, he gets easily angry and shouts. Just like most people, they tend to act rashly and cause harm to others even themselves. A good lesson to learn is that when we make decisions, we must do a self-reflection and think about the consequences. Because decisions can have benefits and consequences as well.\
Most fans of this show rate either a 9 or 10. But if I rate this show a 9 or 10 which means this anime has surprised me to the point where I go defenseless. I will put my heart and soul into this anime if I rate this anime a 9 or 10. However, I wasn't surprised about this anime at all. I never say \"OMG! This is the best anime ever!\" I appreciate Tetsuro Araki's effort in coming up with this anime that is based on giants attacking cities and humans which is a new concept. However, based on my grading, I was not surprised at all. I have seen this in most action anime nowadays.\
This anime also says that in order to achieve victory, you have to sacrifice your joy. It follows the quote \"No pain, no gain\". Just like in life, we have to sacrifice our happiness for the benefit of the world.\
Now, fans of this show, please consider my thoughts carefully before you click the \"Helpful\" or \" Not Helpful\". I am trying to create a lesson which we can learn from. Anime not only gives enjoyment but it also gives a good lesson which we can take back from. If you love this show, good for you.\
Now, before I close. If you want to know why Eren's trial is exciting to watch, you click on the link that I have posted below \"Reason I watch Attack on Titans\".\
I will give it a 8 out of 10. It was worth the watch and you should definitely check this out.\

    Everything about this series is love or hate. Many believes how great and fascinating this series is, but how about the flaws many die-hard fans ignore?  \
To put it simply, some adapt to the world of Shingeki no Kyojin and screams \"best animu evarrr\" while others try to dissect the plot, and find it is a version of the likes of Claymore, or a different version of a scary zombie apocalypse. \
Story: after almost facing extinction, humanity escapes to three layers of sturdy wall, saving the last of themselves from their predator, Titans. And after 107 years of this \"peace\", the walls are breached\
          \
        again, where our protagonist loses his mother and swears for revenge on the Titans, as he escapes to the second layer of the three wall. Then, the story starts and the journey to killing titans begins. However, as he progresses, he finds the terrible truth and starts uncovering mysteries of his world.\
Perhaps many people, when they encounter some absurd ideas, think \"it's stupid\" or \"how did they do that, it's stupid\". To you all of that kind, everything in this series is part of a dark truth. \
Shingeki no Kyojin's story isn't as original as  screamers think, as Claymore also had the idea of humans living in the fear of superior beings, fighting monsters with monsters and a world with dark secrets and conspiracies ages ago. However, one may view Shingeki no Kyojin as a much more intense Claymore, female knights replaced with teen soldiers and gut-eating monsters replaced with giant man-eating human-like creatures called \"Titan\" or \"Kyojin\", and walled . I can go on about how the two are similar, but I think I have showed that the idea nor the story is original as many claims. \
However, the author knows his world well, too well, and the plot follows very well stitched. \
Characters: again, a love-hate topic. Many finds the protagonist Eren as cry-baby, way too loud, idiotic, too hyper, and too set on revenge. Eren Jaegar is exactly like that. However, anyone who understands the feeling of seeing family members ripped apart in front of their eyes will instantly ignore these qualities Eren has and accept that his actions are natural, which it is.\
Mikasa, or \"Eren-fangirl\" or \"emotionless girl\" or \"weird one\". That is the shortest description and a fitting one for our main female lead. Her circumstances are udnerstandable, again, given her past. \
Armin or \"intelligent one\" or \"biggrst cry-baby\" \
Aside from the three main protagonist, supporting characters are very well done. Some are realistic such as Jean, some are weird (Hanji), some are mysterious (Annie) and some are always yelling, some are clever (Irwin) and many who will make brief appearance and then die. There are others who I didn't mention. \
Art: a VERY unique art. Yes, you either love ot or hate it. The character designs are reputable, 3D manuevar gear deisgn is excellent and well though out (don't comapre it to reality or if it is possible)..and then Titans. Yes, titans are portrayed as sloppy,  and their proportions are varying, they are always naked (don't worry, no fanservice intended, they just lack reproductive organs). \
BUT, the borders, or outlines are very bold, sometimes it is rather uncomfortable. \
Animation: Fluid, good. However, endless recaps, flash-backs, scenes lacking backgorunds. Battle scenes are done well. The opening animations are phenomenal, where as endings are just typically animayed. \
Music: Boths openings are from Link Horizon, Japanese mixed with German. One sounds like revenge and action, and another one is encouraging anthem-like song. If the opening's job was to buy views and summarize the anime, it did extremely well. Soundtracks behind the scenes are decent. They do lift the mood, but, sometimes are non-fitting. \
Enjoyment: very enjoyable for me, personally. If you understand and are willing to adapt your veiws, you will scream \"besto animu\". However, recaps, flashbacks, some semi-annoying characters, and very bold outlines....well not so enjoyable now I think logically. \
Overall: an exmaple where anime fans wil divide and argue. While the intense, entertaining non-original plot are reputable, the flaws are there. You may or may not choose to ignore it.\
But in the end, it isn't disappointing, but not satisfying either. It is so similar to Claymore that I couldn't help but compare them. \

    Okay. I don't know where to start.\
Shingeki no Kyojin has got to be one of the most influential, profound, breathtaking study of humanity to be found yet.\
What would happen if a group of people were locked up in a restrained place and were forced to face an enemy that was immortal, ten times as big as them, and, worse even, who LOOKED like them? What would happen then, if, after over a century of oppression and constant terror, humanity was given a hope, a single, final hope, in the form of that very mortal enemy?\
How do humans react when given a hope that they can't\
          \
        believe in? How do mothers react when their children's only possibility for pride, and close to the only future they have, is to go off and die for a cause which is believed to have long been lost? How do children react when their families have been taken from them, and when they do not have in their hands the instruments of revenge...?\
Humanity is helpless. Danger did not make it come together; it divided it. Humans cannot win without deaths, and humans cannot win if they remain human - in every sense of the term. What has their world come to?\
I have no idea what possessed me to watch this anime. But I do know what kept me coming for more - though I'm not entirely sure if I can put it into words.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is not just an anime about the woes and hoes of humanity. It is a metaphorical study of the caged beast. A study, in which humanity has become the beast, and the beast has become the captor.\
Story: ∝/10. Everything has been said.\
Art: ∝/10. The graphics had me breathless. The fluidity and impressions given by the 3D Manoeuver Gear in particular are absolutely mesmerizing. I felt like I was flying, and it had me dreaming in wonder. Extensive and diverse character designs, coupled with breathtaking landscapes.\
Sound: ∝/10. Guren no Yumiya has got to be one of the best anime openings seen to this day. The sound effects in the anime were also halting, and the voice actors are exceptionally good.\
Character: ∝/10. Isayama Hajime did an outstanding job in creating his characters. Standing out are Eren Jaeger, the protagonist; Mikasa Ackerman, the genius sidekick; and Levi Ackerman, the savior of humanity.\
Enjoyment: Infinity doesn't begin to cover it. To me, it was life-changing. I could not get enough.\
Overal: Since 10 here is the maximum rating allowed, I'll settle for that; but it does not do justice to the awesomeness that is Shingeki no Kyojin.\
I wish I could write more, but every time I talk about Shingeki no Kyojin I get totally overwhelmed.\
A masterpiece of the kind, and of all kinds to come.\

    I heard a lot about this anime  before but hesitated on watching it since I was not really into mainstream anime, instead, I watch that are unpopular but are great. Apparently, i watched it one time when I had nothing to watch anymore. And so, here's my review!!!\
Story: Watching the first episode really made me wanting for more and this happened for the whole duration of the anime. I am really skeptical when it comes to plot and occasionally drop anime when I get annoyed by the first episodes but AoT's story kept me going. It was incredibly awesome!!! A mix of thriller, action,\
          \
        and mystery\
Art: The art was pretty good. The background was greatly done but the characters kind of looks like from a comic book lol (just my opinion, since I am not really good nor an expert in art or drawing).\
Sound: Hmmmm... Unfortunately, i wasn't able to notice and hear the sound because I was too occupied with the marvelous thrill and suspense :/ (which means the show REALLY is great!)\
Character: Watching a lot of anime, I already got used to characters like Naruto, etc. and many more who are weak at the beginning but gradually improves and increases in power and friends. However, AoT not being an anime with magical powers may not seem as fancy as anime with fire-breathing or lightning powers, but the characters in AoT really blend in the story and each of them has an appropriate and significant role in the story.\
Enjoyment: one word. SUGOIIIIIII!!!! Sorry, there are three words actually. HONTO NI SUGOIIIIIIIIIIII!!!This nime is one of the greatest action anime i have ever watched. There may not be futuristic scenes, characters and it looks like it's set in a world a long time ago. \
And now with the Opening Song:\
HAVING A SEX WITH THE BEES AND THE EAGLES!\

    Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Both the storyline, but also the characters. This anime also has one of the best art styles I've ever seen. I really reccomend watching this anime, but there is involved blood and many deaths.\
Personally, my favorite thing about Attack on Titan is mostly the animation. Many of the characters are amazing too, but my favoirite is Annie Leonhardt, aka 'The female titan.'\
I enjoyed watching this anime very much!\

    The only word that comes to my mind to describe this series is quite simply “Outstanding”. Far from the classic Shounen, it takes us into a \"mature\" atmosphere typically found in the Seinen, and which seduced me immediately.\
First, the soundtrack: the two Openings made by Linked Horizon put us immediately in the war atmosphere with small Germanic touches, and are very pleasant to listen (especially the first one!), and both endings are also beautiful, and gives a calmer tone at the end of each episode, which underlines the drama of the series. In terms of the OST in general, nothing wrong either: everything fits perfectly\
          \
        to situations, and makes us even deeper dive into the series.\
Secondly, the graphics: It is simply amazing. It is a true pleasure for the eyes. Having read the Manga, I was afraid that the drawing of the anime is as bad as in this one, but I had a pleasant surprise. Moreover, one can appreciate the quality of the animation by watching scenes other than scenes of battles which are also very beautiful. Some in particular have literally cut my breath as some scenes of use of three-dimensional equipment in the city.\
Third, the plot and characters: The three protagonists are very charismatic. Eren, with his leading character who, Mikasa, a kind of \"big sister\" who protects and seems to have a rather ambiguous love for his \"brother\", and Armin, the brain of the group.\
I immediately liked the character of Mikasa who is very mature, and very endearing, Eren seemed to approach to the cliché of the stupid hero, but thank God, it moves away from the corner at the first episodes. Armin also seemed to be an annoying cliché of weak character who still be saved, but it turns out to be as useful as Mikasa throughout the series.\
The secondary characters are also endearing, especially Levi Ackerman. What Can I say about this badass guy, He is just perfect!!\
In terms of plot, we follow the hero in a post apocalyptic world that oscillates between the seventeenth and eighteenth for its technologies and in which humans were dominated by Titans against whom they are trying to raise. The mystery of the Titans keeps us in suspense until the end.\
In conclusion, I can describe this anime with these three words: Epic, Legendary and Masterpiece! I really enjoyed watching and rewatching this anime. \
I look forward to a great season two, hoping that it will be as great as the first season, to finish the story beautifully.\

    I wouldn't call myself an enthusiast of action/drama series, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the anime. The anime mesmerizes its audience with fascinating action sequences and with captivating story telling.\
Story :( Please read the synopsis before reading any further).The setting of the story is quite intriguing in its own way. Set several hundreds of years ago, human race is endangered by titans, who are several meters high and eat humans. Humans are protected by three huge walls namely-Wall Maria, Wall Rose, Wall Sina. The progress of the story with every episode is the asset of the entire series. The series contain no filler episodes, while being\
          \
        serious till the end.\
Art: The art is absolutely outstanding and precise. It is the forte of the entire anime series. It sets ablaze the already radiant action in the series. I found the art one of the best in recent years maybe due to the fact that this anime actually uses it accurately as none other recently.\
Sound: Supported by an astounding opening theme and the sound track is, maybe second to none in my opinion. The background score for the fights might actually be the selling point of the series, while marking its importance alongside art in the anime. This combined with pace make unique and entertaining clash between humans and titans.\
Character: The characters in the series are quite orthodox. The main protagonist: Eren Yeager is driven by rage acquired due to his past. He, while having spirit lacks talent. Other main characters in the story are his friends Mikasa and Armin. Armin lacks power and courage, compensating in intelligence. He sits back in fear while the other two move forward. Mikasa is both talented and hard working. She has a dark past and is attached to Eren, tries to save him whenever possible. While the story progresses we are introduced to various characters. While the most noted among them is Levi. He receives a \"superman\" entrance. He is mostly silent oozing brilliance throughout his presence in the series.\
Enjoyment: I found the series profoundly enjoyable for a wide range of audience.\
Supported by outstanding sound and art, being accurately paced and possessing best action sequences, in my opinion is one of the best in its genre",

    Today I finished watching one of the most famous and acclaimed series of recent times. Before starting, I wondered if it deserves all this fame. And the conclusion I came to was: No, although it's good, is not that great.\
\
Shingeki no Kyojin is, in short, \"a display of epic action with exceptional animation and soundtrack to his height\". It has been described in many ways: The Best series of 2013, The Best in the present, A \"Before and after\" in the world of anime ¿but seriously is all this ? Honestly, no. Aside from that I mentioned above, has nothing else going for\
\
Let us begin\
          \
        by mentioning the good: for a series of action it is important that... action scenes are good, with good animation and an OST to give that feeling of \"epicness\" Shingeki no Kyojin complies with that, especially with the OST that I admit, is one of the best OST I've heard today. Still, there were relatively few action scenes for what I thought it would be (and what made me believe with so much spam when it was airing). The rest is, the \"not so good\" in the series\
\
The history with the Titans and the humanity in oppression is somewhat interesting, the way in which the humanity has managed to survive gives for much. But only that, although the anime handles well, not delve into details that, along, become important. There are times where it wants to take itself so seriously that is bored and disappointing, even to me, who really enjoy series of \"much blablabla and little action\" as Monogatari Series or Log Horizon. Among other things, the theme of \"humans don't have a chance against the Titans\" is annoying, especially when they want to put in each chapter.\
\
Another point to be discussed are the characters. No matter how good is the story, if  there are not characters that appeal, it is useless. Really are few the characters who can say that they are worth:\
-Eren as protagonist starts out decent, and is appreciated he has Balls and is decided, but that of \"I want to kill'em all!!\" seems more the whim of a child that a personal goal, aside after the second half of the anime, he goes from being a warrior to the Lady in Trouble who has to be protected and then saved. And personally, he made me understand why much people hate Yuuki Kaji as a seiyuu...\
-Mikasa... She's strong, intelligent and bold ¿what's the problem? She really has no personal goal, evolution as a character, nothing. Just walk behind Eren to \"protect\" him... What a waste of potential\
-Armin is perhaps (no, actually he is) the best character by far. Yes, the weakling who can't kill a Titan by his own is better than the rest, simply because he was the only one who showed a good development, and of the few to use his head before the Maneuver Sistem. Whenever he spoke, he said something good, enough to keep me interested in the facts. His speech in chapter 10 was the best I saw in the series until then\
-Levi stood out as a great warrior and have that air of mystery around him. It had so much potential, but his little participation prevented that he developed better\
-There were other characters like Jean (one that had good performance) and Hanji (this is something more personal, just liked her crazy personality xD) also stand out a bit, but nothing really relevant.\
\
In conclusion, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the most outstanding series at the time, although as has pretty good stuff, has other where it fails miserably. Much people turn a blind eye to these failures and there comes the exaggerated treatment they have to it. ¿It was a good serie? Yes ¿The Best of 2013 and in the present? By far... No ¿Overrated? Maybe...\

    Overview:\
Is Attack on Titan the greatest thing since sliced bread or a really over hyped series that will be forgotten in a few years? Your opinion on Attack on Titan will of course vary in accordance with your personal aesthetics, but lets take a closer look at this unquestionably popular titan of a hit!\
Story 4:10\
Humanity is minding its own business when suddenly a plague of mentally retarded giants start killing everyone. Giant: (drools and stares vacantly) \"DEEEER Herp derp Chomp!\" This is the middle ages so we really don't have the technology to fight these drooling, stumbling, special needs behemoths. However, we somehow find the\
          \
        time to build walls several hundred feet tall while the titans are relentlessly slaughtering us. How did we build such massive walls in the middle ages with such primitive tech? How did we get massive amount of requisite time? Will this ever be explained? Maybe in another 200 episodes, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. This story is the classic post apocalyptic zombie survival tale except with zombies replaced with retarded giants. In a zombie movie it rarely matters how the zombie plague came into being. What matters is the frantic struggle to survive following the plague. The first episode starts out with an emotional bang, but what follows are boring training montages that we have seen a million times before and the building up of pointless characters that we all know are mostly going to die quickly and without purpose. I will avoid any major spoilers, but there are some big plot twists that seem...questionable. If you are one of the masses that simply love zombie survival horror, this one is right up your alley. If you didn't think Walking Dead was the greatest show of the last 20 years, this story will simply not knock your socks off.\
Characters: 5/10\
The main character is Eren Jaeger (German for hunter) who hunts titans and is obsessed with vengeance at all costs. He is a stock character that we have all seen 1,000 times before. The man so consumed with vengeance that he abandons decency and becomes a monster himself. This was done better in Hellsing Ultimate with the far more amusing Alexander Anderson. There are other characters like badass action chicks Mikasa and Annie as well as the whiny twerp Armin Alert. Yes, they really named a character Armin Alert as in Armed and Alert. That pun is so bad I almost smashed my palm right through my frontal bone. The characters are decent, but really nothing memorably great. I frankly find their popularity to be confounding.\
Art: 8/10\
As you would rightfully expect from a new anime with a titanic budget, Attack on Titan looks good. It looks very good. The art is one of the biggest highlights of the series and makes the action scenes a genuine joy to watch.\
Sound 8/10\
Attack on Titan is well renowned for its spectacular soundtrack. Although it isn't my absolute personal favorite, it is in fact very good. The 1st opening theme was amazing and the background music is well done throughout the series.\
Enjoyment: 3/10\
To dive back into the 90s and quote Austin Powers, \"This just aint by bag baby\". I have never liked the zombie survival genre and changing the zombies to retarded giants doesn't really do anything for me. Is it a metaphor for the numerically huge but allegedly stupid and brutish Chinese threatening Japan? That is what many Chinese viewers felt, but I honestly don't think the mangaka had any political allegory in mind. I think it honestly just is what it is. Not everyone is going to share my opinion, so you may really enjoy Attack on Titan. It is all a matter of taste.\
Overall 5/10\
This series has amazing art, great music, and tries really hard to cash in on the zombie survival craze that has swept the world over the last decade like a global epidemic. It hit the right note at precisely the right time and for that I take my hat off to it from a financial perspective. This was an absolutely brilliant work of marketing and giving the masses exactly what they want. Is it the greatest anime ever? I sure as hell didn't think so, but if you like that kind of thing, more power to you. It takes all types to make a village.\

    Here's a fun fact, when I was 7, the first anime I ever watched was Detective Conan, when growing up I might have remembered the show or watched an episode or 2 of the show, then, last year I found out about this show, I gave it a try and ended up finishing it, I thought the show was amazing, a couple of months later I started watching anime, ironic I know. But looking at this show today, I don't think this show is as amazing anymore, why? Well, back then I was a newbie while today I know more about anime and can detect\
          \
        more of the show's flaws. This show isn't the best of all time, hell its really damn mainstream, people go as far as calling it the \"Game of Thrones of Anime\" when those people have only seen about 2-3 anime series'. This show is too damn popular for its kind, how it gained its popularity is still a question to be unfolded.\
The story starts off with a wall, well 3 walls to be precise. Giants known as 'Titans have been eating humans for years so humanity builds these walls to keep them out, for 100 years there was peace until a titan somehow taller than the wall breaks it down and now humanity is in danger.\
A simple story, this could easily lead to a well written plot, well it does but it raises many questions, before those questions are answered we're brought another question. For example, Why are these titans eating humans? Do they look like chicken to them or something? Also the show's plotwists need explaining themselves, I haven't read the manga but I heard some of them are still unanswered.\
The Art is really well done, especially the gore which is exucuted in a way where it seems fucked up but at the same time seem not as fucked up, we only see a couple of scenes of gore, fight scenes or psychological scenes. Its a perfect balance of both and I love that. The backgrounds are beautiful and filled with dark but not too dark colours which brings out the darkness AoT has to offer.\
The sound, is just outstanding, both OPs are so damn well done, each one are epic as hell and make you want to listen to them over and over and not even get sick of them. Both EDs are OK for the most part, they really do bring a little light to the show. The voice acting is so damn well done, hearing actual screams and panics brings so much realism to the show, you feel like you're there with the characters. I would easily rate both Art and Sound a 10.\
The characters, we get introduced to way too many characters, in the second episode, we get all these characters introduced in just one episode, it tries to do that trick that shows such as Durarara and Baccano pull off so well which is where there are so many characters that it adds more fun to the show. Here there's so many characters that I wonder if some really matter to the story. Some of these characters hardly get any screen-time yet they're somehow meant to be important.\
I'm gonna look at the 3 MCs of the show, first we have Eren, some maniac who screams over everything and is so goddamn pissed off at everything, like you mad bro? He wants to get shit done but does it so poorly, he's meant to be that pissed off character that has feelings but instead feels like that pissed off character who's just....pissed off. Then we have Mikasa, she has an interesting past and is one of the most badass female MCs I have seen in a while, she's strong and cares for Eren and wants to see him happy again. Finally we have Armin, a pussy who somehow is fighting yet is too scared to go near a titan. But, he's smart as shit and plans well, he's like the brains of the MCs, evern though he's a pussy. It is pretty cliche, even though he does get some moments where he stands up for himself, he's an OK character for the most part.\
One more thing about the characters, in the army each character has been trained to kill the titans, yet all of them are scared shitless when they're in battle, like seriously, you've been training for years but still haven't grown a pair and actually fight these things. I've only seen like 5 characters that can actually kill, one of them is the MC, one is a side character and the rest aren't even important to the story or die! This is no logic, its just there as a reason to make these characters die.\
Now I did enjoy this show, its mystery really makes you want to see what happens next, its intriguing done in a good way and I like that. The action scenes are tense as fuck and will give you goosebumps, they will gobsmack you. If they don't then there's probably a problem with your skin or you're not human.\

Overall, AoT is an enjoyable show. Now if you're a normal anime watcher, I reccomend this show in case you're bored or want something action-ey with a decent plot. If you're new to anime, this show will easily get you into anime like it did to me. Season 2 has been announced a while ago to come out in 2016....why so far away, the director said something about the manga reaching a certain point or something among those lines. If you can't wait for Season 2, you can read the manga from where the show left off (which is Chapter 34) many manga readers have said that the show gets even more tense. If you do get into this show follow it for its plot, sure it has some well done action scenes but AoT wasn't made for action like some shows like to do. For more shows like this show I reccomend Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, its follows the path that AoT does and its story is spread out across 64 episodes which is a lot of content, plus like AoT its focused on story.\

    Some say that this anime is an intro into anime but I've seen MANY shows and this is my favorite anime for many reasons.  I had stopped watching anime for a while and when I tried to get back into it with hyped up series like SAO, I just wasn't engaged anymore.  Part of the reason was that I thought I had seen everything anime had to offer and there just wasn't anything left to surprise me.  The stories and characters just felt rehashed. \
And then, Attack on Titan comes out. What this show succeeds in is in its production.  The\
          \
        team that worked on this show really understood what made the story strong and its tone.  As a result, I was hooked from the first episode.  I was in awe at how anime had come so far in their animation and how the scenes were now crisp, clean and fast.   The opening theme gets you hyped.  The action scenes are still the best I've seen in anime and still hold up after I've watched some newer anime from 2015.  The OST takes the anime to the next level because it's so dramatic and perfectly placed within the show.  As much as I loved the story with its plot twists, I dropped the manga since I loved the production value of the anime much more and would rather wait for season 2.\
I would compare this anime to the movie, Mad Max. They're not in anyway similar but both have this energy and tension when you watch them.\
This is an anime for people that don't even watch anime. I've recommended it to many of my friends and all of them loved it.  You should at least get to episode 5.  If you still don't enjoy it at that point, then it definitely isn't for you.\

    The show has spectacular animation. The fights with the titans are breathtaking. Everything else in between, however, is garbage. \
The filler in between titan fights is incredibly boring. It drags and drags on until they throw a predictable twist at you. The plot is pretty good, but at times, they try a little too hard to surprise the viewer.\
There is no character development, and it is very difficult to root for any of them. Every character is one dimensional without any depth. They are all annoying caricatures. The two main characters that the show focuses on, Erin and Armin, whine throughout the entire show, and\
          \
        the only character worth rooting for, Mikasa, pretty much disappeared towards the end of the season. As strict as Levi is, it is very exaggerated and unnecessary. He beats up Erin in the middle of the court room, and no one seems to think that it's a big deal. That scene, like most in the show, was so over the top. By over the top, specifically, I mean it was exaggerated extremely more than it needed to be to get the point across. I like violence in my anime as much as the next guy, but scenes like that are just out of place. The violence when fighting the titans, however, is amazing and in the right place.\
 Overall, the show looks cool and has amazing animation, but the characters have no depth. There needs to be more explanation of why the characters act the way they do to feel any sort of empathy. Until then, I hope the titans end up on top. \

    Well, I'll admit that it's been a while since I tried to sit through this...\
Where do I begin? Well, first of all, this anime is ridiculously overrated. I began watching it when a friend of mine was obsessed, and I have to say I was vastly disappointed. I knew that both online and in real life, people were mass-talking about SnK, so I guess I was expected more than what it was giving me.\
Story - 3/10\
We've all already heard the one about the angry, slightly crazy main male protagonist who has some sort of weird connection to the antagonist/ism in the show, and the protagonist's\
          \
        best friend is always the overly emotionless girl who has crazy feelings. Okay, we get it! Pick something else!\
The plot was interesting, but not very original. The titans could have been anything - wolves, a rebel group out in the woods, unicorns - and I'm not going to rate the unoriginal plot higher just because there's cool humanoid things that eat people alive. It's easy to guess what's going to happen next.\
I'll admit, since I was not planning on finishing the series, I read the entire plot and the ending of the show. And my first reaction was, \"what? are you serious right now?\"\
Art - 10/10\
I would not consider the character's art very stand-outish, but the animation for the movement, blood and overall outfits the characters wear is gorgeous. The titans' designs are also interesting.\
Sound - 9/10\
I had no problem hearing what was happening.\
Character - 4/10\
As I said above, I think Eren and Mikasa's character arcs are wildly overused, and many of the characters only seemed to be put there to move along the story, without ever really getting much out of them. Also, Eren's feelings about things don't match up with the ending at all.\
Enjoyment - 3/10\
Although story and art are both extremely important to me, above all else I need to enjoy it. Whether it makes me laugh or cry, I need to feel something. SnK just did not do it for me. I was constantly bored, and there was nothing particularly exciting about the series. I did not jump, or cry, or smile. I think the only time it triggered an emotion is when I covered my eyes once at a bloody scene, but other than that, nothing.\
Overall - 3/10\
I would not recommend this to any of my friends who haven't seen it. Like most quickly-popular anime, this is nothing to lose your mind over. It's another overrated piece that quickly bores you and leaves you with nothing to think about afterward.\

Note : I do not read the manga and this is solely from my experience as an anime-only watcher. I know that this anime has been criticized by many manga readers about leaving out certain important scenes but I will be ignoring that fact in this review since I have yet to read the mange, although I might start it soon.\
Story - 9: Titans vs Humans. Battle for survival. As mainstream as it sounds, the story arcs in this anime is extraordinary.\

        When I first watched the first 13 episodes of this anime, I was telling myself that if the second half of this anime can keep up the quality this anime showcased in its first half, this anime might stand a chance to make it to my top 3 list of anime I've watched of all time, and hell it did. In fact, the second half was as good or better than the first half. Spectacular.\
Art - 9: As much as I love this anime, one thing that I have noticed in the art and animation of this anime is that it tends to reduce its budget on the \"less important\" scenes such as having still scenes of pictures. Not to worry though because personally, art and animation is not of the highest priority in my books when it comes to reviewing an anime, although good art and animation will definitely help and add to its awesomeness. Having said that, the animation and camera angles for the action scenes were epic and spectacular which I acknowledge fully and pulls the score all the way up to a 9.\
Sound - 10: SIE SIND DAS ESSEN UND WIR SIND DIE JAGER!!!!!! I absolutely LOVE the first opening. As for the second, it was still very catchy but not as good as the first to me but oh well. I love how they mix in German words together with the Japanese words in the openings too. One to thing to point out though, is the soundtrack and background music or the climax scenes. Perfection. It adds on to the tension and hypes up the fight so much it leaves me in a state of awe. \
Characters - 9: I love every character in this anime, especially Mikasa (I mean who doesn't like her, she's so badass and awesome) and Levi. Although I would wish that some other side characters such as the beautiful goddess, Krista. If there is one character that I did not really like, it was the MC, Eren. He reminds me so much of Yu from Owari no Seraph with his personality. It is understandable that he wants to eliminate all the titans but there are times where he pisses me off with his attitude and trying to do everything by himself. However, through some character development, he has definitely grown more mature and has slowly moved up the rankings of my favorite characters but still, his personality can be annoying at times. Oh and if possible, I would love to see more Eren x Mikasa moments :3\
Enjoyment - 10: Every episode, literally every episode from episode 1 all the way to 25, had it's own time to shine and was so entertaining. Not to forget the number of cliffhangers in this anime, I really feel bad for the people that watched this anime while it was still airing. The struggle to wait for a whole week for another episode had to be painful. However, since I only just finished this anime, I was able to binge watch all 25 episodes in a day and boy the ride was so fun and enjoyable. \
Overall - 9: Call this anime over-hyped or whatever, I personally enjoyed this anime a lot and I am SO GLAD that there is going to be a season 2.  This anime is the classic battle-for-survival typed anime but done almost to perfection with flawless action scenes and is definitely up there to be one of the best anime in it's genre. It definitely lived up to its hyped and I absolutely loved it.\
I hope this review has been of a great help to all those that have yet to watch this anime. Hopefully after watching this anime you will feel the same as I do and have enjoyed this anime to its fullest. :D\

    I have to admit. This is one of the few animes that I thought were going to be underwhelming. Boy was I wrong!\
PLOT/STORY\
The story is somewhat familiar, what with mankind being under attack and driven to some point of extinction by some overwhelming force of power, it did feel familiar, but it was delivered in such a way that kept you watching despite the similar plot device to other animes out there. The story did deliver in a span of 25 episodes and did not leave anything unanswered (for the most part). It was a fast paced, intense series of episodes which never failed to\
          \
        deliver on action or drama. This is really a good anime to start with, for those looking with a starting point. Yes the anime is dark, and it is bloody in some scenes, but it was done in a necessary way that conveyed the high stakes of the situation. \
ART\
Say what you will about the story (If you didn't like the story, but why wouldn't you?) the art style of the series is very attractive and eye catching. The thick bold outline of each character really made them pop out and be distinguishable from the rest of the cast. It was really well done. The backgrounds were never....how would you say this...hmm...dull. Have you ever watched an anime and felt that the background was very underwhelming and looked like it took no effort due to the lack of dynamics and movement? well you well never get that disappointment here. Whether it is Eren and Mikasa using their omni gear from place to place in the towns or forest, the backgrounds felt very much alive. Again, it is very well done.\
SOUND\
In one word: Intense. Yes it is very intense. I watched both sub and dub and both VA's were able to deliver the characters feelings and emotions well enough that you could feel it yourself. The way Eren screams out when titans attack makes you feel his rage. \
ENJOYMENT\
Whether it was our group of protagonists against a titan, using their omni gear from place to place, every episode was exciting and intense to watch. Never a dull moment, as I say. The constant battle between titans and man was truly not disappointing to watch as much as how realistic it would be if titans did attack. The group had its struggles to overcome but thats what made it so exciting and worthwhile to watch. Whether it was a moral problem or a physical problem, it was done in such a way, that you could feel what their up against.\
OVERALL\
I was truly immersed in this anime and it shouldn't be something to be looked over. People have said it is overrated, and yes, in some aspects it may be, but come to this anime with a clear mind from recent criticisms, and you will in no doubt enjoy this as much as I did. \

    I have been a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin for almost two years now, and I can say for myself that this series is one of the most enjoyable I've ever watched, and I've named it my favorite anime out of all that I've currently watched. That being said, IT IS NOT PERFECT. At all.\
Let me explain by starting out with the story. There is a huge fucking plothole that never gets explained in the entire anime, and has yet to be explained in the 71 current chapters of the manga. This is something that a lot of critics point out and I would love\
          \
        to go further into detail, but I cannot write spoilers.\
I find most of the characters rather lovable, even though some (a lot) only care about the main three; Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Believe it or not, in a show all about killing gigantic humanoid creatures called \"titans\", the characters play such an important role in the series. As you watch, you can see the characters change according to their situations and then develop over the 25 episodes. A great example of this would be Armin; who goes from a self-pitying little kid, to one of the best strategists in the anime's military. (This goes further in depth in the manga, which gives a lot more to his character and honestly makes him one of my favorites.)\
And the fucking ANIMATION in this series is damn near perfect, if not, FLAWLESS. With fluid, 3D camera spins and rolls, it's impossible not to be on the edge of your seat whenever there's a fight scene with the 3DMG that the characters wear. it's some of the best animation I've ever seen, and I have yet to see anything better since it came out in 2013. It's unique, It's stylish, It's eye-catching, and really makes the series more gritty than it probably would've been with an artstyle any different. The same can most certainly my said for the absolutely amazing soundtrack; especially when there is a particularly epic or sad scene happening. The music can be a tear jerker on it's own.\
While there was character development in the anime, there definitely wasn't as much as I would've like there to be. I'm most definitely looking forward to the second season, where this little issue disappears forever. However, until then, the characters can only be explained as above average.\
It was a well made, well produced, and well directed anime that will definitely be remembered for years down the line in the anime community. With likable characters and a gripping story, you'll be binge-watching it after the first episode alone. 8.5/10.\

    I've heard about Shingeki no Kyojin from many people before, but I wasn't interested. The idea of titans devouring humans just seemed absurd to me. I didn't plan on watching it until a friend of mine kept pushing me to do so, and I'll tell you now. I regret every second I didn't watch this anime after its release.\
I don't consider myself an anime fanatic, but I watched a bunch of anime in my time, and to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is this rare jewel you can find under a pile of uninteresting anime. It has been very long ago since I felt so excited\
          \
        about any anime at all. Everyone likes cool characters and some awesome action, but to me, that was just icing on the cake, and not as interesting as the atmosphere of the world. You don't find much anime with an environment full of pessimism like in this one. Each episode makes it clearer to you how hopeless humanity's situation is, that they are losing, and despite that, they try. It simply gets you absorbed into the world and the characters. With each episode you realize that there is always a little innocence left to lose. Love and warmth is taken away from the characters, and they become bitter and sad, and despite that, they never lose themselves entirely.\
I didn't mention that the soundtracks are also really great to hear, and I know that some people are encouraged just by a good opening music, and for all who didn't give this anime a chance, I recommend and urge you to try it out. Watch it and feel the experience I had with it.\

    First of all I want to say that I was actually against watching this and thought it was overrated, so I am not being partial at all, the reason I started watching this anime was because I was sick and had nothing else better to do. Now i will explain to you why I gave it a high rating which is highly unexpected. I should warn you that I have read the manga, meaning I know what happens after the anime, so, don't flame me for stuff happening after, I am only reviewing the first season!\
\
The Story\
Well, the reason I gave it an 8 was\
          \
        mainly because it was a too simple concept. The story was not really thought out well, don't flame yet, I will explain why. There are many types of stories and maybe one you've heard before is \"saving the world\", it is very common to have this type of story, while it's very common and maybe boring, some can actually make this a good type of story. I know that it's very hard to come up with a good (uncommon) story, but hey, that is what I think of that. I'm not saying that it's bad or anything, I gave it an 8 after all, but it would've been more interesting if it had a different unique story!\
\
Art\
I should maybe warn you that I haven't seen that many anime, given that you can check my list, but the art style of Attack on titan is really different from what I've seen before, and I actually like it. The really visible outlining of the characters, the amazing background (non-moving environment), and also to point out the pupils of the characters, really detailed.\
\
Sound\
I can say a lot of things about the sound, not only was the first introduction song (Guren no Yumiya) catchy but the OST of the anime are really good. It's good in a way how they could fit the sounds together with what was happening, they could really get the most out of the music and gave you different kinds of emotions. Watching some scenes would get me goose bumps, and some scenes would also make me cry, for me that is a 10 when I could live into the anime and get the same emotions as the characters. Some scenes would make me really excited. I would say good job in combining the two attributes.\
\
Character\
I really like the characters, their different personalities and their appearance. After watching a couple of episodes I got fond to some of the characters, and would watch and see what they end up doing  in the series and how they live their life. You get a favorite character and some you might even relate to (personality that is). (In case you wanted to know, my favorite is Sasha Blouse). Some characters you might hate and some you might not even care for, and that is really good, that means they have succeeded in making each character unique.\
\
Enjoyment\
Yes, as you might already have figured out, I really enjoyed this series, I was caught from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching and getting different types of emotions, wanting to know more about what was going to happen next. I really like how they managed to separate emotions, meaning that they have a scene for comedy and another separate scene for seriousness. some anime tends to mix these things, like having a comedy scene in a middle of a serious matter, and for me, that is really annoying. I don't like having comedy in the middle of a fight for example, that is just me I guess.\
\
Summary\
So to sum this up, I was what you could say skeptic at first but after the first episode, I got caught in the wave, after that first episode, I just wanted to know more and couldn't get enough and for every episode, I wanted to follow my favorite character and see how she would end up. I cried, laughed, got angry, got sad, throughout the journey. At the end I was so curious that I started reading the manga, but it's not the same as the anime, you don't get the same emotions since you don't have the music, the voice actors and THEIR emotions, so I will probably wait until the next season and cry and laugh again!\

    To start off and to be quite honest in my review, this is the first series that I have completed in a year 1/2 so take it for what it is worth. \
Attack on Titan has been constantly raved about by many friends who are also big into Japanese Anime/ manga etc., and for a good while, I have refused to get dragged into it wondering if the reviews and praise would hold true if I ever were to delve into it personally. I shall agree with the praise regarding the show as a whole to a certain degree and in that phrase I shall\
          \
        explain myself further. \
To start off I shall perform this review in Tarantino fashion giving the show Attack on Titan a 9. Now like previously stated, allow me to further explain my reasoning.\
Story:\
The story regarding Eren, Mikasa, Armin and assorted nameless and known characters trying to not only survive but to carve out a place for themselves in the \"cruel\" world of AOT is actually quite enticing and kept me wanting to know more and more.\
In a short but certainly not spoiler filled paragraph, AOT revolves around three childhood friends and their desire and task of assisting humanity in combating these gigantic creatures with varying heights and demeanor's called Titans, who live outside the three walls of the kingdom where the show takes place and have a knack for eating human beings. The three characters aforementioned enroll in the military with the sole desire to combat the Titans after their hometown is destroyed and ultimately abandoned due to a titan attack.\
Now the story is very well done and there were times where I would be sitting back calmly and the next second, be on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next and where the story would take me. I can certainly see the similarities between this show and Death Note, especially in the creators proclivity for not holding back or following certain rules in stories in regards to what can happen and what cannot to main characters (I will not spoil anything but watch the it and you will see my point).\
Art:\
Now in regards to the overall animation and look of AOT, it is one of the most beautiful animes that I have seen in quite some time and harken me back to when I first saw Cowboy Bebop as a child, birthing this desire in me to see more and more if only to regain that sense of wonder at seeing such beautiful and imaginative worlds. My favorite scenes were when any action scene took place which featured the characters (both nameless and therefore throwaways, or known) zipping around the cities, and scenes with this gear referred to as omni-directional mobility gear or ODM for short. These scenes threw away the conventional 2-D approach and g=opted for a faux 3-D approach o the artwork, giving the viewer the sense that they were flying, comparative to the 'Spider-cam\" in the Sam Raimi Spider-man movies. \
Some of the episodes were filled with much dialogue that I felt wasn't truly necessary or either dragged on for too long, which made me all the more excited to glance upon the art of the speeding environments while the action picked up again. Overall, the art is very well done and I am certainly excited to see where the artists responsible for it go from here.\
Sound:\
The sounds and songs of the show certainly match perfectly or as close as they can get to what is happening or how the creators want you to feel at any given moment/ situation. To start off, the 1st opening song (Guren no Yumiya) while very excited and exerting a bit of overkill at times, is a good start to the show and what to expect in terms of the action and situations that will occur. One of my favorites songs is titled: Bauklotze performed by Mika Kobayashi and has more of a presence later in the series. This song to me sums up what the show represents in its sense of: desperation but also of hope, even if it tends to fade at times. \
Character:\
Now I have read a few other reviews of the show previously and I have to agree with  a lot of the reviewers in their assessment of the character element in the show. I felt this was the weakest part of the show and the creators, while putting in the old \"college try\" with character development fell short on what could've been a great cast. In terms of the characters that I liked, were: Jean, Sasha, Levi, Mikasa, and Eren while most of the other characters weren't given the proper time to really become human in my eyes. One of the characters that I truly despised and I use that word lightly was the character of Armin who in almost every encounter with the titan entities, would resort to whining and feeling sorry for himself which in the beginning drew me to him and made me feel for him but as the show went on and it looked as if he wasn't going to develop beyond or overcome that part of himself, annoyed me and made me wonder when he would either \"grow or fade\". \
I have to say that I found a lot of cliches with the characters, which saddened me greatly, especially with how great the characters in Death Note for instance were portrayed. Character truly was the weakest portion of the mix.\
Enjoyment:\
In terms of enjoyment, I would say that I was thoroughly entertained by this show and I actually wanted to see what would happen next even when the show was a bit slow in its progression of events. This show has a great blend of action, drama, suspense and wonder to keep the fire going. My only qualm would be in regards for its \"plot holes\". Now I understand that there will probably be a second season due to its popularity but I felt like with every question that was answered, there would be two more questions in response to that one and maybe an answer strewn about here and there. I would've liked there to be more enlightenment in regards to: What are the titans? Where do they come from? How did the city come to be? etc., which took away from my enjoyment of the show.\
Overall:\
I thought it was a great anime filled with a plethora of elements that will attract fans of varying genres although a warning must be mentioned that this is quite gory, reminding me of Devil May Cry/ Elfin Lied in terms of the \"no holds barred\" attitude with gore, human casualties. But if you can somehow get passed that (and if you have to term it in that way then this isn't for you), then you will find a rich show that has created a nice size fire within my mind, and heart; a fire that I only hope will grow with news of a second season and more development in certain areas (cough characters cough). I think the show as a whole has so much potential to become a classic, with a few minor tweaks to common story elements and I look forward to not only staying abreast of a possible return but also to re watching it again eventually.\

    Hello. I am new to this website as well as writing anime reviews, so this review might not be so insightful than the others. \
Shingeki no Kyojin review (episode 1-10)\
Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack of Titans)is an auspicious debut. It is visually and audibly entertaining, which is the primary reason why I gave this anime full marks in terms of enjoyment. \
STORY 9/10\
The story encapsulates all the necessary elements to make this film an action-packed madness with recurring hints of fantasy and unpredictability. While the plot is unoriginal in the concept of survival against foreign creatures, its ability to capture the eyes and minds of the\
          \
        audience has forgiven this. Every important scene so far has remained vivid in my eyes and fresh in my mind. As Eren who is the protagonist, experienced the arrival of the humongous humanoid creatures, he witnesses a tragedy that fuels his desire for revenge. In his revenge plan, action blooms, suspense tightens, as he unleashes his anger towards the titans. This anime has met my expectations of a good story development, and I am hoping that it surpasses its potential. \
ART 9/10\
What is refreshing about this anime is how it successfully grasps the audience into the world of turmoil; the setting that denotes that survival is paramount. This feat was aided by the enthralling depiction of the realistic dystopia that the characters live in, as well as the AWESOME animations that takes place when tension arises between humans and titans. The humans and the titans were portrayed in a perfect balance; it is surrealistic without being too overtly down-to-earth. Additionally, the art on the character's facial expressions in different scenarios evokes a sense of feeling to us, and it makes us feel that we are in that character's position. \
SOUND 9/10\
I think that the soundtrack is well suited to the anime's genre of action, fantasy and drama. Opening 1 has a perfect blend of these genres, and while I do not know what the song is about (I'm not Japanese), just by hearing the first 10 seconds tells me that the music choice is appropriate. In addition, the music prepares you for the upcoming action scenes to come and strengthens the impact it gives to the audience to a great extent. The sound effects were also exceptional. \
CHARACTER 7/10\
I gotta mention this; while there are no anime that is perfect, there are some who are near to that level though. One of the flaws in this anime is the lack of character development. Only Eren, Mikasa and Armin's past is portrayed and explained and all the main character's personality seems a bit bland to me. For example, there's Eren who's fuel for desire stems from his dark past of negative experiences. His ambition is already cliched, but why is his personality the same as well? Most of the time, he is depicted as a person who has been consumed by anger and revenge; surely there can be some happiness in his life, right? \
Then there's Mikasa, who actually has something (in this case, 'someone') to protect in her life, which is Eren. What is ironic is that Eren has an ambition, but no one to protect (except humanity indirectly), and Mikasa has something to protect, but no ambition ( except protecting Eren's welfare). In my opinion, the characters needed more dimensions in their personality and in their ambitions. However, I understand the fact that the characters live in a world full of hopelessness, and this might be the deep-rooted cause of it.\
ENJOYMENT 10/10\
I thoroughly enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin, and I recommend it to all. Shingeki no Kyojin is a fulfilling present that is wrapped with exemplary art and sound components and is filled with a story that depicts utmost survival and an inevitable outrage of vengeance. The anime is also quite didactic, as it informs the audience the importance of mateship, as shown by the characters initiative to help each other in dire moments, and their abilities to work as a team.\

    SPOILER-FREE REVIEW\
***********************************\
Shingeki no Kyojin is an extremely rare case where immense hype doesn't do it enough justice. It truly is a masterpiece on all levels and must-watch for all anime enthusiasts. I have not read the manga, so this review is purely based on animation.\
Story: 10\
In a giant pool of generic \"friendship beats everything\" types of anime, this story stands out. It immediately captivates starting from first episodes and culminating in the season finale, making you drool in anticipation of continuation.\
Art: 10\
Art is unique and may seem \"weird\" on the first glance. I first watched it in low quality; then re-watched in Full HD -\
          \
        the difference was staggering. I advise watching this series in highest possible quality from the beginning - it's quite ravishing.\
Sound: 10\
Extremely well-fit soundtrack that enhances emotions throughout the scenes. This is the only anime OST I have fully downloaded. I personally am not a big fan of both opening songs and second ending song, but it did not outweigh perfectly compiled soundtrack.\
Character: 10\
There was a couple of \"generic\" character types sprinkled in the series, however others were quite unique and extremely well-developed, so once again full mark! Without spoiling too much, I must say that it's very hard to capture the line between \"right\" and \"wrong\", something that some characters in this anime do very well. \
Enjoyment: 10\
 If you like action and drama, this anime is for you. I must admit that this is this is one of very few animes that made me tear up even during a re-watch. Extremely enjoyable both for single-watching, as well as for group-watching. \
Overall: 11\
I might be slightly biased, since this was one of the first animation series I have watch, but I have not seen anything better since. Attack on Titan currently proudly sits on the top of my anime Olympus, hopefully to be overthrown by its sequel. \

    I recently re-watched this in anticipation of the 2nd season. I had forgotten most of the plot so it was interesting to see if my initial impressions of the series remained the same. And fortunately, I feel the same as I did years ago when this aired. \
This 1st season is a masterpiece. It's essentially everything I want in an anime and more.\
Story:\
Getting the right level of mystery is important for keeping the audience captivated. You neither want to reveal too much that the audience puts 2 + 2 together themselves nor leave them so in the dark, they become disinterested or impatient. This has\
          \
        been executed perfectly and on top of that, it has been scoped very well. What I mean by this is that, the plot isn't so grand that it is filled with loose ends and unmanageable nor carries so much weight in terms of potential, that it encumbers the storytelling. The success in this area can be attributed to the well laid out exposition, info-graphics at intervals and well structured storyline within season 1.\
Art & Animation:\
The fight scenes are simply great, well animated and filled with substance. I'm a fan of the thick lines around characters, the facial expressions are consistent too with a high level of polish.\
Sound:\
A good soundtrack to me is exciting, full of personality and a direct, accurate reflection of the series it is based on. My favourite soundtracks are Tokyo Ghoul, Haikyuu, Gundam Wing  and now this (I'm not talking just about OPs and EDs). The music during tense moments, battle scenes and intermittent build-ups is glorious like a theatrical orchestra guiding the world to either destruction or salvation. Some may claim it over dramatic but for me, it enhanced every moment in the anime. \
\
Characters:\
There are a lot of anime protagonists who I just hate because they go overboard with their super hero antics and fail to develop at all. Eren is ambitious and stubborn but he chooses to listen to others and decides to learn from his mistakes like people should. The characters are diverse and I look forward to seeing how far they have to go in this beautiful, cruel world.\
Enjoyment:\
I loved it.\

    Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, is one of the few anime that even the mass majority of non-anime watchers have heard of. Attack on Titan is a combat survival pitting humanity against much stronger and taller humanoids called \"Titans\". The story in my opinion is truly something magical, plot twist after plot twist, heartbreak after heartbreak, a very deep and emotional story line backed up with every character having their moment of lime light, all playing a pivotal role in the series. \
Trying my best to avoid spoilers as I myself only just finished the the final Episode #25 a mere 15 minutes\
          \
        ago, I can't help myself but put this at the top of my anime list at the moment. I'm not all that familiar with anime myself as I've only previously watched all of SAO, but for me this was a great second step in progressing onto more. Shingeki no Kyojin is almost perfect, along with what I  said a short time ago with SAO. The only thing that would make it perfect, is if that world were open to us in real life. (Just my opinion of course)\
A beautiful, action packed, chaotic series, that I would advise even the most novice or veteran of anime spectators to sink their teeth into. Amazing.\

    Well lets have a look at it then. Attack on titan is splendidly made, featuring titans against humans. The concept has been set up so well, filling each minute with either action(humans standing up against titans with 3d gear), sad moments(people being swallowed by titans), and the small loveable moments you always want in animes(for instant the potato girl).\
Now some people say its overhyped, I beg to differ. It has everything i expected, and more. The soundtracks fits the moments so well, and it gives me chills.\
Either way if i had a complain it would be their lack of animators. While the animation of the\
          \
        story, which looks a lot different from many other anime series, it creates a much better impression of both the titans and human. It makes the scenes so much more intense than another type of animation would, at least thats what i believe. But back to the animators. You notice some small blunders throughout the anime. For instant the marks on their uniform suddenly change color when they arent supposed to. Probably because they switch animators often, and pick up animating in the middle of a scene. Now luckily its something you hardly notice. First time i watched each episode i was so hung up on the awesomeness that it went straight through my mind.\
Definitely one of the most superior animes out there, if you havent seen it yet, your missing out on a lot.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin a.k.a. Attack on Titan is one of those rare anime that grabs everyone's attention straight from the get go by being completely fucking crazy. From the very first episode it delivers the message that this series isn't really like any other, and that on a very large scale. Publically known as the best anime of 2013, a statement that might arguably be justified, however it's still not completely flawless.\
\
Story - 9/10:\
Honestly this is somewhat hard to rate given that this is merely the first season and the storyline is hence very much so unfinished, but from what there is thus far, I\
          \
        can say that it is fairly predictable as to many of its unfolding events.\
That being said you can mostly forgive that part, as the actual presentation is very good. Because of the sheer scale of the anime's setting and how cruel and relentless it is, Shingeki no Kyojin has a sense of epicness to it. You can see many of the plot twists coming way ahead of time, but in the end it doesn't really feel like it matters all that much.\
\
Art - 9/10:\
As far as the actual art style of Shingeki no Kyojin goes, I think opinions will vary quite a lot. When it comes to the characters themselves, it uses an extremely thick outline for their shapes which looks really strange but somehow works out alright anyway.\
The titans vary wildly in how pleasing they are to the eye, but then again that's mostly not a matter of art quality but rather merely that some of the titans are in fact supposed to look retarded. That being said I personally could never really feel the same intimidation from them that I think the series was trying to deliver. More so than not they just looked like oversized, brain damaged humans rather than terrifying monsters of destruction.\
What is really appealing is the setting itself. The world looks absolutely stunning, both when it comes to the city's infrastructure and the nature outside. There was even one particular moment in one episode where I had to pause the video just to confirm that it was in fact animated and not a real photo of nature.\
Most impressive of all though is the animation. Following the eyes of a soldier flying around the city via cables looks absolutely amazing, and likewise the actual fight scenes are crisp and polished. The various sword techniques used in midair look especially impressive.\
\
Sound - 10/10:\
Apparantly someone thought that German theme songs was a good idea to use for this anime, and that person made a damn good choice in that regard. The OST of Shingeki no Kyojin is stellar, with some inredibly epic music throughout, and some extremely memorable opening themes. The ending themes aren't quite as amazing, but still not anything worth complaining about.\
Quite frankly there isn't really much to say regarding this specific topic. The soundtrack does its job as well as you could possibly wish for, it's as simple as that.\
When it comes to the voice acting you're not going to find a masterpiece in particular, however it still has a quite famous seiyuu cast that don't leave much to be wished for untouched. There is one problem though, but it doesn't actually lie with the casting crew itself but rather with the characters they're voicing. To be specific, for the vast majority of this show, I kept feeling that the voice actors were too good for their own roles. I'll talk about why in the next section though.\
\
Characters - 7/10:\
The biggest flaw of Shingeki no Kyojin is actually the characters themselves. Just about every top tier anime will have at least one iconic character that people can associate the series with. However with this series, there are none. Now this is not just because so many people keep dying left and right, but rather there is no single character that is actually all that interesting.\
The protagonist, Eren, is in reality very generic. He's the typical hot-headed youth driven by thoughts of revenge while still always putting his friends before the mission. Very often you'll find yourself annoyed at how much of a blockhead he is when it comes to decision making and personality. His friend Armin is nothing special either, being the typical supportive character that wants to help his friends while in reality being fairly weak. The female lead Mikasa is a lot cooler as a character, but at the same time she's also very antisocial and quiet. Ironically this has led to the most popular person being a side character that's not even introduced until halfway through the series.\
Point being, there is not really anything new nor creative when it comes to the characters themselves. They're not poorly designed, but it's nothing that hasn't been done time and time again before.\
\
Enjoyment - 9/10:\
Despite everything though, Shingeki no Kyojin is in fact very entertaining. It's a very unique and interesting concept, and the tempo is generally very high. Even when there isn't really any story progression it's still fun to watch, since the actual fight scenes aren't something you'll find in essentially any other anime, and they're almost artistic in the way they're designed. Since it's also one of those series that isn't afraid to break norms and kill off characters, you can never really take anything completely for granted even if many of the story plot twists can be seen coming ahead of time.\
It doesn't actually have as many cliffhangers as you might expect, but rather the story arcs it has are extremely long. It often feels more like you're watching a movie in twenty minute parts rather than a tv-series, and because of that it really feels like a series you should marathon rather than watch episodic, regardless of your ususal preferences regarding that particular topic.\
\
Overall - 9/10:\
In the end, Shingeki no Kyojin is a quite memorable series not because of how good it is, but because of how much it stands out. It feels like a concept you'd find in an average Hollywood film, except it's done as an anime, and in glorious fashion at that. While it is true that opinions vary wildly regarding this show, like it does for any abnormal series, I feel like it's something everyone should at least give a chance. It might not be your cup of tea, but it also might be the best anime you've ever seen. Anything goes.\
No matter what, Shingeki no Kyojin has established itself as one of the biggest Titans in the current anime era.\

    So, Shingeki no Kyojin was like the most hyped anime in the last season. Yeah, why not? There were good basics, survival horror and action, mixed with an interesting setting. These are usually conditions for a good anime.\
But instead of that you get offered a bad production, logical issues and incredible weak characters.\
The only reason why I finished this show is that I usually never drop any anime.\
Story:  The story is like 'end time survival-action', really exciting and it gets the interest of the viewer in an instant. All in all the story was quite good, almost amazing. BUT: there are so many logical\
          \
        issues, unnecessary plot twists and stupid filler episodes that it dragged down the whole overall picture of the story.\
Art/Graphics: Second worst point. Frankly, they did almost nothing right at this point. The facial expressions and emotions are awful, they totally don't look like they're supposed to.\
That's why many scenes just lose their exciting or dramatical effect because due to the named problems the scenes appear just weird.\
Sound: All right, a good point again. The openings and endings are good, soundtracks are fitting. In my opinion the second opening is very catchy, I like it the most.\
Character: *Sigh* Let's get over with this.\
The worst point, in my opinion, are the characters. They are totally flat and queasy. You can't produce an anime of this sort with these bad characters. The figures are just too inconspicuous and odd, which is an absolutely defect for survival-action.\
Enjoyment: Oh well, I  didn't really enjoy watching this, I just watched it, 'cause I don't wanna have any dropped anime in my list. Some episodes were quite okay, some others weren't. But to be honest, I was never looking forward to the next episodes.\
Overall: This anime was clearly overhyped; the result was bad. Everyone their own cup of tea, but I recommend you to not watch this series. It's not worth your time. \

    Oh boy,oh boy where do I start..\
So,this anime wasn't even on my list in the first place.Honestly,the summary of the show didn't really seem very interesting for some reason.I never had the urge to watch these really popular series like Naruto,One Piece,Bleach...so I didn't feel the need to watch Attack On Titan either.But since my friends really wanted me to watch it,I did(it only had 25 episodes so why not).I really don't regret it in the end.Many people say that the show is way too overrated but it's really not like that.It's popular for a good reason.\
First of all-Story\
It's just amazing.The idea of having titans\
          \
        attack humanity and leaving them on the bridge of extinction is brilliant.What I really love is that everything is so mysterious.We don't know who titans really are and what are their goals.Also,the idea of having humanity use 3D Gears is what really got me.It's really a unique way of seeing fight scenes and the way they fight titans.I liked that this series didn't contain just action and gore scenes.There were also the sad times when you can sympathize with characters and happy,funny times;like Sasha and her love for potatoes.If you're a person that cries at sad moments I guarantee that you will tear up so much at the very first episode just like I did.So if you don't want to feel the feels(lol),try not getting attached to characters so much.\
Art and music were..well..ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I HAVE NO WORDS.\
Sawano Hirayuki..I admire you...like soo much.The soundtrack is stunning.Probably one of the best ones I've heard.As I said,I didn't want to watch this at the beginning and the first opening is probably the main reason why I did.From the first time I heard it I fell in love with it.\
So characters-I love the way each one was made.Every character has a unique story of their own and have their reason why they decided to fight titans.I don't know how to put this..but their personalities,relationships and everything is simply put together well.\
I recommend you this anime even if it is not your type,trust me,it will be worth the time.\

    Attack on Titan should be renamed: Angst, Anger, and Depression  since these are the only three emotions that any given character in AoT can experience. AoT isn't a very plot centered anime that mainly glorifies violence. There is almost zero explanation as to what the Titans really are, where they came from, or why they eat humans - you are supposed to eat it up without questioning the plot - and this gets dry pretty fast. The best attributes of AoT are superficial qualities, such as it's production value. I really believe that this anime is overrated at the time, but maybe the second\
          \
        season will be more revealing than the first and give this anime some sort of redemption. \

My first impression of this anime, and before that, I mean when I saw the trailer of this series I thought that it was simply amazing. The animation surprise me and the synopsis despite that it wasn't a revolutionary story it make me wait excited to see it.\
>Story (8/10) \
Like I mention before the argument of the almost extinction of mankind it isn't new, but the way how\
          \
        the anime develop that side of Attack on Titan trough the cruelty death and destiny of the soldiers in hands of the titan, without mention how the difference of power between the humanity and the titan it is present is simply remarkable. This it is clearly visible in the first 8 episode, where you are confused and excited for the continuous changes in the focus of the story, this feeling is multiply several times when you saw it in emission like my case, where I have to suffer the tension of waiting week to week the next chapter.\
>Art (9/10) \
In this section Shingeki no Kyojin stand out in comparison with the average anime, because the scenarios and character design are splendid although the expression of the protagonist and the secondaries in some occasion are disfigured, but that it is a minor detail that are compensate with the carefully threat of the iris in the eye of the characters in sentimental and epic moments that are draw with the intention of imitate a real one, that surprise me, because make a little difference to plus the emotion in the scene.\
>Sound (10/10) \
Nothing to say, this is the best facet of the series. The music that involve the scenes are simply epic and emotional.\
>Character (7/10) \
This is maybe the weakest point of the series, and I principally though that it is the fault of the flat personality of the protagonist. He doesn't have a very clear evolution around the series and the fact that when he is in trouble repeat the same pattern of behavior doesn’t help him at all.\
In respect of the secondaries, they likes me more than the protagonist because I was able to identify with them a lot, in special with Jean and Armin that I think are the most interesting characters thanks to their evolution and grow as person in the progress of the story.\
>Enjoyment (9/10)\
I think that this is an anime that the 90% of the people would enjoy and remember, because of his base of epicness and adrenaline of the moment/scene and the until today unsolved mysteries behind the series, that gives to the series a huge potential of rewatching it\
--------------------------------------------------------\
>>Spanish // Español\
La primera impresión que me causo este anime fue bastante severa, ya que solo el tráiler me dejo fascinado e impaciente por su estreno debido a las escenas que mostraron, las cuales tenían una increíble calidad audiovisual.\
>Historia (8/10)\
El argumento en sí de esta serie no es muy original que digamos, múltiples series han partido con la base de la casi extinción de la humanidad frente a enemigos que los superaban con creces en cuanto a poder se refiere, pero lo que provoca la gran diferencia entre Shingeki no Kyojin y el resto es el cómo desarrolla esta idea. La manera en que demuestra la inferioridad de la humanidad frente a los titanes es impresionante, sobretodo en el ámbito audiovisual, es decir, la forma en que lo muestra al espectador mediante escenas que generan un estado de shock. Este tipo de escenas en su mayoría están acumuladas en los primeros 8 capítulos de la serie en pos de explicar y ambientar al espectador al mundo de Shingeki no Kyojin, aunque esto se pueden seguir apreciando a lo largo del desarrollo de la historia. Esto culmina en un ciclo continuo de cambios y giros narrativos que impiden que el espectador pueda despegarse de la pantalla, debido al deseo de saber que ocurra después de tal o cual hecho.\
>Arte (9/10)\
En esta sección Shingeki no Kyojin destaca bastante y lo eleva aún más como anime memorable. Los escenarios y el diseño de personajes son sumamente impresionantes, preocupándose de detalles tan mínimos como los reflejos del iris en momentos precisos para enfatizar la emoción de la escena en cuestión. De lo único que me quejaría es que al buscar el estado de shock en el espectador mediante expresiones exageradas se genera la desfiguración del personaje en un puñado de ocasiones.\
>Sonido (10/10)\
Nada que decir, en este ámbito el staff de las serie logro un soundtrack que transmite perfectamente la emoción de la serie.\
>Personajes (7/10) \
Este es la faceta más débil de Shingeki no Kyojin desde mi punto de vista, siendo el principal causal la personalidad plana del protagonista, la cual no aparenta tener una evolución clara a lo largo de la serie, y el comportamiento  repetitivo que presenta en situaciones de conflicto no lo ayuda en nada.\
Respecto a los secundarios, tuve una mayor empatía, debido a la posibilidad de identificarse con ellos gracias a su evolución y crecimiento como persona, pero más que nada por que expiran un aura más humana que Eren ,en especial Armin y Jean , los cuales fueron mis personajes favoritos del elenco.\
>Disfrute (9/10)\
Este es un anime que el 90% de la gente disfrutaría y recordaría debido a la base de la serie de influir adrenalina y emoción a través de sus escenas y los grandes misterios sin resolver que se esconden detrás de la serie, dándole a la serie un gran potencial para verla de nuevo.",

    1. The premise.\
Humans were almost exterminated by titans, now living behind a wall, wall suddenly gets destroyed, mother of MC is kill. So far, so good. Now while this does look like an interesting premise for a proper war drama at first it suffers from the fact that there are titans. Which makes the whole thing quite fantasy like. That aside, the premise, which could have been used to give the characters, y'know, more depth or something by making it longer than two fucking episodes, set up an interesting start for the series.\
2. Story\
Everything that followed was utter crap. 2 episodes in and a timeskip\
          \
        happens. Great, because we all love timeskips so much. They give you the chance to completely change the personality of any character at any given time because \"timeskip\".\
A good timeskip would be something like: \"I hate you -> I hate you but I partly understand you thus I refuse to do something with my hate\"\
A bad timeskip is something like this: \"I hate you -> I still hate you lol\"\
SnK is a good example of a bad timeskip. The characters didn't gain any kind of depth through it and basically remained as one-dimensional as they were.\
Now back to the main issue, the actual story.\
The pacing was extremely fast at first but then it slowed down so much that it felt even slower than your average slow paced show.\
Now what does slow pacing in an action centered show mean? Right, IT GOES NOWHERE. They spent roughly 8 episodes for one arc and used 5 minutes to recap everything. Not only that but nothing in the story, which is supposed to be about a war drama or something, which COULD happen to our dear MC-kun gives you a feeling of danger because ever since episode 5 everybody knows he can transform into a titan and is basically invincible.\
3. The CAST\
Let's save the best for the last.\
Most characters were forgettable.\
Not just forgettable but uber-forgettable. Because they didn't have any personality or only a screentime of 10 minutes. Now when 5 people die in a titan attack and someone screams \"GUNTHER DIED\" you wonder which one of these samefaces was Gunther. Same goes for this one girl who wanted Levi's D. Petra, was it? She had a screentime of 10 minutes, she cared about Levi and died an episode or a few minutes later while thinking about Levi. How sad, right? This, my dear friends, is forced drama.\
But what would an anime be without a main character or a group of main characters?\
They were UNDERWHELMING.\
Eren was supposed to be given character development throughout the series but it never happened. He was just ... there. \"GOTTA KILL THE TITANS\" is how you could describe him. Or in a single word; anger.\
Mikasa is the beauty which is looking out for Eren and is willing to kill anyone who'd harm him without a second thought. Because he saved her life once. Understandable but doesn't give you the right to make \"Protectiveness\" her defining character trait.\
Armin is the brain of the group and goes from incompetent to somewhat competent. Arguably the only good character in the whole fucking show and even he is not all that good.\
4. Animation and sound.\
Top-notch.\
Conclusion:\
Entry-level anime for those who search for something cool like titan killing kids flying through the city.\
It's Spiderman just with wires instead of spiderwebs. And air-battles.\
And edgyness.\
Final verdict:\
5.5/10, a bit better than average but still not as good as people make it out to be.\

The story is engaging and catches your attention from the get go, having humans battling to save humanity sound like an anime cliche but the way this story is presented from episode one is so unique, seeing the people die and how small and helpless they are compared to the titans it makes you think could they actually stand a chance.

    “Superb, violent, dark and calculated. A composition that starts with a pianissimo and ends with a fortissimo... A masterpiece.”\
REVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\
Hopelessness against a stronger foe, an overused plot in the literature and movie business. Works like: Independence Day, The War of The Worlds, Alien, Falling Skies –and others- ring a bell with that sort of description. \
So the question is: What makes “ATTACK ON TITAN” that appealing? What makes it have such great reviews? We will see…\
Let’s start…!\
\
-STORY: 9-\
Despair is a word that would describe amazingly this show. As I previously stated the “base” plot isn’t one of the most original things out there,\
          \
        but the aspects and “lore” used within the show are what makes it original and most importantly a show worth watching.\
Another characteristic that makes the story innovative is the fact that it isn’t just your ordinary and plain shows about humans against a “foreign” adversary or the typical “humans aren’t THAT weak” show, but in reality this story is more complex, it’s a story about the human nature. What makes us strong? What makes us weak? What makes us so corruptible? The fight between what’s right and wrong? The value of friendship and trust in others. The why we fight or why we should fight?\
So, enters “ATTACK ON TITAN” a world under attack by titans, titans that have something mysterious within them and not your typical “I just want to destroy humans because the writers where lazy”\
To put it bluntly the “myth” in which “Attack on Titan” is created around is rich, huge and amazingly well-grounded.\
The starts begins with a “bang”, followed by another –and vaster- “bang” that leads to an perfect and well-coordinated climax that ends in a massive, ecstatic and well-obtained ending. By this I mean that this show isn’t the average let’s throw some problems, problems that by the end of the show will get out of proportion and we –the writers- will have to use something absurd to contain it. No, this show is as I stated before “calculated” –like a composition that starts with a pianissimo and ends with a fortissimo-. \
“Attack on Titan” is the type of story that will make you feel many mood changes within the lapse of each episode. Some moods will be because of the situations, some because of the corruption and others because of the friendship inside the show. It’s a show that transcends from the screen to your heart and mind.\
\
-ART: 10- \
Mesmerizing. The art in “Attack on Titan” from the moment it start it catches you, it immerses you within the show, it’s like a slap in the face for it catches your eyes and every one of your senses. \
It’s colorful. It isn’t depicted by your typical “Dark Palette” used in shows like this. No, it is delightful; it’s an explosion of color that depicts the situation and mood in the ambient which are perfectly detailed and believable. And the characters are amazingly well achieved and also believable.  \
\
-SOUND: 10-\
As I’ve said before I place the sound and music of a show as -probably- the most important thing of the show –aside from the story of course-. And in all honesty the ambient sound, the voice acting and the soundtrack left me speechless.\
The voice acting is a piece of art, filled with passion and each line of the script has a meaning behind it, it isn’t your average script.\
Meanwhile the soundtrack, a work by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Ao no Exorcist, Guilty Crown and KILL la KILL) is AS ALWAYS perfect. The opening song of the album “At’aek ON Taitn” with the beautiful voice of Mika Kobayashi is a song that shows the passion, the darkness, the despair and the feelings behind the whole album AND show.\
Some of the most beautiful violin arrangements. \
A-MUST-HEAR-SOUNDTRACK!\
\
-CHARACTER: 10-\
This is other aspect in which “ATTACK ON TITAN” shines. Mainly because of the character development within the show and not just a “department” in which only the MC’s (Eren Yaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert) take part, but even the supporting characters have an amazing development within the show, something that usually doesn’t happen for the main attention given just to the MC’s.\
Each character has his or her own will, goal and believes, making this department another jewel within the show. \
-ENJOYMENT: 9 & OVERALL: 10-\
“ATTACK ON TITAN” is one of those shows that make you feel what the characters are feeling. It’s one of those shows that leave you wanting more for being that good.\
It’s super enjoyable and recommendable.\
Thanks for reading!\

    Attack On Titan, AKA Sword Art Online 2.0\
It's seems this hype train decided to make another stop this summer.\
Story: 6\
Attack On Titan starts off very strong, the setting is very original and the story line is very unique. I think everyone will agree with me that episode 1 almost made you shit yourself with excitement and left you begging for more, then it all goes downhill. Then you get a couple of boring episodes of Eren + friends training and shitting around. The show keeps up this constant trend of interesting action episodes to boring explanation episodes. They never decide they need to explain what\
          \
        the fuck is going on, no explanation whatsoever. The only hint we get to how it's even possible for Eren to turn into a Titan is a shitty fragmented flashback of his dad talking about their basement. No one ever explains why these humans who can turn into Titans are trying to break the fucking wall down. After watching this show I decided to read the manga and get this, nothing has been explained. They just keep dancing around the fucking question, as if the explanation is supposed to be brilliant. If you want a storyline where barely any progress is made, I definitely recommend this for you.\
Art: 10\
Of course the art is gorgeous, it's one of the newest anime's of 2013. You actually give two shits about the art when you watch an anime then you'll love this one, but giving it a higher rating than something like Trigun because of the animation is idiotic. The animation in this show is created with the latest technology, this technology hasn't always been around.\
Sound: 9\
Other than the first five seconds of the opening song I don't really care to listen to it. It does what every anime with action in it does, use orchestral music, that always works. Anyways I subtract one point for unoriginal music choice and an only decent opening song (completely my opinion).\
Character: 5\
Probably what drags this anime down the most is the main character.\
Eren: A typical shonen hero, thinks he can beat anything and he is very ambitious. We have a term for these kind of people, all bark and no bite. The whole anime is him getting his ass-kicked. But wait I forgot about that one moment where he transforms and beats up some titans on no! Thank God the plot was so convenient that Eren was eaten by a Titan and he awakened his own special powers while being digested by this oversized mentally handicapped humanoid. Like every other typical shonen heroes he is unique, he has some special power which makes him worth a damn. Since he couldn't kill Titans like a normal soldier he relies on his overpowered emotionless girlfriend(Yuno 2.0) to save him half the time or every other soldier to sacrifice them-self for him. His altogether uselessness shines when another intelligent titan comes, kicks the crap out of him and then captures him requiring Mikasa to come save him while teaming up with the badass emotionless OP Levi. Jesus, he even makes Armin look useful.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin was one of the top rated anime in this season and I had high expectations on this. However, it did not meet my expectations although it was a well-produced anime with realistic graphics and awesome character development.\
For those who do not enjoy gore and despair in an anime, I do not recommend you this anime since you may probably end up with nightmares at night. Even I almost ended up puking in the end since humans were killed like flies without any consideration and I found it hard to accept that the lives of humans can be so easily lost.\
However, I have\
          \
        to admit that the storyline was very unique and attractive since it was different from the common anime where hope was actually visible with the progress of the anime. In SnK, even with the protagonist, hope for mankind was barely visible and it was frighteningly easy for one to fall into despair just like the people within the anime. As I didn't read the manga, from the ending of the anime, I could only say that mankind was doom for destruction in the face of the ultimate enemy: titans.\
As for character development, the producers did a really good job in defining the characters. For the main protagonist, Eren, his hatred towards the titans throughout the storyline is what propels the plot forward, and for me, it was tough to accept as the depth of his hatred was overwhelming. Truthfully speaking, I did not like his character, and probably he was one of my unfavored characters. On the other hand, LEVI (Rivaille) was awesome, pronto. Enough said right? He is the only reason I would say \"I LOVE this anime\".\
In conclusion, I personally did not like this anime as its gore and the despair I felt while watching this anime left me feeling desperate, dark, and gloomy even after the anime ended. It certainly did not leave a good aftertaste. But just because they presented an awesome character, I rated this anime a decent 4.\
P.S. If I were to live in the world of SnK, I will immediately commit suicide when facing a titan because I definitely do not want to get eaten by such a ridiculous and disgusting living thing with weird running habits and leaves you feeling extremely gross. Urgh..\

    A review of a masterpiece? Yes, yes that's exactly what this is. Yes I will compare it with the manga but only when necessary. \
Shingeki no Kyojin (SnK,) is one of the most amazing anime series of all time and it fully deserves its hype. A story of humanity, remorse, will, courage, revenge, sadness, life, death, suffering, carnage, military, the list continues... If these are aspects that you like in anime then this is definitely for you. If you like slice of life, comedy and dislike anything sad then walk away, walk far away. SnK made me cry more than any other anime, mainly because\
          \
        of how emotionally enveloped I was with the story. Don't judge a book by its cover, in this case anime, yes there are unclothed man-eating giants running around, grow up and watch it, you get over that fact pretty quickly. \
Story - 10/10 - The story follows the storyline of the manga almost exactly, the anime is set in chronological order while the manga jumps from past to present, the anime also adds a few scenes of epicness. The story starts out intense and then gets a tad boring for some during the military training episodes, don't drop it. It gets so much more intense. If you want to avoid spoilers then don't look up anything! The anime does end at a cliffhanger and fans are waiting for the highly anticipated season two, if it bothers you enough then catch up on the manga. The anime cuts off right before the really good stuff starts, new chapters come out every month, I recommend it if you're as impatient as I am. But if you can wait then wait, the anime is much better. It is a psychological anime to an extent, there are way more unknowns then knowns which can be frustrating yes, but that factor creates a sense of suspense which actually is a fantastic touch and makes the story even more enjoyable. Grab a box of tissues, close all the curtains, have something to hug, and give SnK a well deserved marathon. \
Art - 9/10 - Some people have issues with the animation... The animation is spectacularly done for its budget. The perspective isn't first person however, it's just as up close and personal, giving you a front row seat of the characters' suffering and the clear carnage of the situation. The character design is very original, the titans are drawn incredibly terrifying in the beginning and their quality dwindled some later on, however, I didn't even notice it until Gigguk pointed it out in his review of the anime. The animation is highly enjoyable and is fantastic during the fighting scenes especially, it flows superbly. \
Sound - 10/10 - This soundtrack... Is orgasm worthy. Composed by the amazing Hiroyuki Sawano, it features Japanese, German, and English OSTs that get your heart beating fast as they keep you on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed Guilty Crown's soundtrack, then you'll love SnK's, Hiroyuki-san composed them both. \
Character - 9/10 - The story mainly focuses on Eren and his path of revenge, however it's a nice vantage point for the story. The anime has many characters and show cases them in a nice fashion. Information wise, we know just about as much as Eren. SnK features some of the most loved characters, everyone has a favourite. The relationships between the characters... I think this is what really made the anime as sad as it was. Even if those relationships weren't as detailed as others, they still displayed emotional attachments. Fangirls rave on Levi while fanboys rave for Mikasa, everyone gets to rave about someone, all the characters are epic. The character quotes are fantastic and every character is incredibly real. \
Enjoyment - 10/10 - I enjoyed this anime like crazy, I'm a die hard fan, and if you asked me to join the Wings of Freedom/Scouting Legion I would gladly put my life on the line like the other characters. I'm excited for more of the series, based on what I know of the manga, season two is definitely worth the wait. I don't usually shed tears while watching anime, SnK made me bawl like a baby X3 and I respect it for doing so. \
Overall - 10/10 - SnK showcases the full extent of military themes, sacrifice, human fragility, and revenge. It's a must watch for many, just be sure to have tissues! :3 \

    Story 9: Humans are forced to live behind a massive wall in order to avoid being killed by man-eating monsters called Titans. Overall the story was excellent. The premise was unique and the plot twists were exciting. The story flows in a linear, arc-based format so there isn’t a monster/titan of the week that you might get in other anime. I generally prefer this format because I think the series can cover more ground and show more character/plot development. I was also impressed by some of the mature themes that the series tried to explore. To name a few: needs of few vs needs of\
          \
        many; idealism vs pragmatism; qualities of a good leader; the value of friendship and family; ugliness of human nature. These aren’t new topics in the world of anime but I think AoT did a better job than most at fleshing them out and really making the viewer feel characters’ struggles.\
I have a couple of additional points. First, I thought that there were definitely a few slow parts that didn’t really add anything to the experience. Plus, there were some episodes that lacked any action. Maybe it was done on purpose to build suspense. The battle scenes are definitely worth it though. The series showcases a unique style of fighting that uses “3-D maneuvering devices”. Basically the soldiers have these gas-powered grappling hooks that can propel them in any direction and allow them to maneuver like spider man. It’s hard to describe but it’s fucking awesome. It reminds me a little of the slick action sequences in Darker Than Black. These fight sequences alone make AoT worth it. It does annoy me that the series ends on a moderate cliffhanger. To make matters worse, the Manga is relatively new too so there is probably not enough content for a new 24 episode sequel series yet. Sorry.\
 Characters 9: This is probably the best part of the series because a lot of effort is given to develop the main and supporting characters, and the series has a LOT of supporting characters. Some of them are central to the plot, some of them are meant to be Titan fodder, some of them you THINK are too important to die but then they get eaten anyway. In that sense it’s like Game of Thrones where they keep you guessing. \
Art 9: Beautiful. I loved the battle/ride through in the forest. The action scenes are amazing and the city maneuvering is really really well drawn. The other thing I really liked was the design of the Titans. Their faces and bodies just ooze with creepiness. They are not stereotypically “scary” or “evil” looking like the cliché monster, but eerily ordinary looking. You’ll have to see for yourself but they shamble around in large doughy bodies with soulless stares, and remain devoid of emotion as they shove screaming civilians into their mouths. To me that’s a lot more unsettling than a fierce looking enemy. \
Sound 10:  loved the first intro song and it went straight to my ipod’s workout mix. The rest were good but not great imo.\
Satisfaction 9: Love it. I want more and you will too.\
Blood/Gore: A lot of scared soldiers getting eaten alive. \
Love/romance: virtually none. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s introduced as the manga/anime develops but don’t expect it in S1.\
Sex/Nudity: Not unless you have a Titan fetish.",

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan was pretty great, it dominated over most of/all the other animes in 2013, and after watching the series I can see why it can be seen as one of the top series of 2013 or maybe even all time.\
Story 9/10 The idea of AoT is pretty awesome, it's about Humanity against the overpowered giant cannibals or titans for short, and throughout the show you get to watch humanity fight for their lives and try and come closer to the mystery of these giant monsters and why they are trying to exterminate the human race. The story was really\
          \
        interesting throughout the entire show I found and although there is a lot of action the story still successfully manages to have quite a few other elements of different genres in it. This anime also paced the amount of episodes very well and nothing seemed that rushed or stretched longer then it needed to be for me, there are some parts of this anime that were to a point predictable but it didn't matter much i still found it very enjoyable by keeping me at the edge of my seat. \
Art 9/10 The art was great one thing that was definitely noticeable was how fluent the animations were when they were in combat with the 3D maneuver gear it was so cool and I have never seen any anime have anything like that it's definitely a must see. Another thing that AoT contains a lot of is blood it's pretty nuts there is ton of it and i like seeing some bloodshed in animes but AoT may have went a bit over the top in this sense. The characters and titans all seemed to be detailed very well also including all of the the backgrounds. I would also buy this anime on blu-ray too see the art quality to it's full extent.\
Sound 9/10 The music is definitely very good the opening theme songs and the ending songs suit the anime setting very well and the battle music and heroic soundtracks in the anime are very well done as well they seem to start and end at the nearly the perfect times I also definitely enjoy the soundtrack and will end up listening to it in the future mainly Linked Horizon's opening for AoT Guren no Yumiya because there performance was incredible, I also found that the voice actors that were picked suited there characters very well (in English sub for me).\
Characters 10/10 The characters were outstanding they go pretty deep into explaining the main characters back stories and that is definitely one of the things i look for the most in an anime the way characters also reacted to certain events in the story was very realistic. There was some character growth to an extent in the anime the anime wasn't based on a long time frame so in the short time frame in the anime I thought the characters got progressively stronger in their distinct areas. One of the characters, Armin narrates at the start of every episode and i think it adds to the feel of the anime. I also think there are a lot of characters that people would like main or supporting.\
Enjoyment 10/10 If you really like action anime's or super power then you may come to love AoT because those are it's main areas and it did very well succeeding in those areas, My brother doesn't generally watch anime but he saw some of AoT and thought it was very well done so I think that even non anime fans would still like AoT. I would definitely re-watch all of AoT not because it's one of my favorite anime's as of now also because every episode was enjoyable or had exciting parts in it.\
Overall i give this anime a 9/10 (my personal score is 10/10) if you have not watched AoT I encourage you to do so because if you enjoy the genre that AoT is in you will most definitely like it. I think that there was a massive amount of effort put into making every episode of AoT each episode seems like anime movie and was just awesome to watch and I hope that my review may make you watch AoT or maybe will make you want to re-watch it.\
Thanks for reading!\

    When I watched Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan for the first time, I thought it was a quite good anime, but not more. I watched through it like many other anime, without paying much attention. But when I watched it for the second time after approximately half a year, I was speechless. Amazed. Thrilled. Never have I seen such a heartbreaking anime before, which stirred up so many emotions inside of me. There are countless reasons why Shingeki no Kyojin is an outstanding example.\
It is rare to see such a unique story in an anime. Mankind is at the brink of extinction because they are\
          \
        endangered by titans; therefore, they fight for their survival. You get the possibility to witness the desperate struggle of humanity from Eren Jäger’s view, the main protagonist of the series. The story starts with the encounter of a colossal titan breaching through one of the three walls that protect humanity. After the titan’s encounter, Eren Jäger and his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert decide to join the Military Corps; and this is where their adventure starts...\
The story triggers a lot of strong feelings, like despair, hope/hopelessness and sadness because they strongly appeal to your heart. This is one reason why Shingeki no Kyojin is exceptional; you can empathize with the characters, you feel the atmosphere of this world as if you were actually part of it. \
The complexity of the story is another thing I admire: it is not simple and foreseeable and you do not expect certain things to happen. Shingeki no Kyojin raises many questions in the course of the series and has many secrets that are not yet to be unfold, which makes it even more thrilling to watch. \
The last and most important point is that no matter how hopeless the situation seems to be, Isayama-san manages to bring hope into this world full of despair.\
Moving on to music, I have to say that I am in love with the music of Shingeki no Kyojin. It is written by Sawano Hiroyuki, a famous composer who is known for his works on many anime (e.g. Guilty Crown, Kill la Kill, Aldnoah Zero). I generally listen to a lot of music and when I decided to buy the soundtrack, I was really glad that I did it. I found myself listening to it for hours every day and could not get enough. The reason why is that the music of Shingeki no Kyojin is so strong and breathtaking, good examples are the opening themes Guren no Yumiya (Feueroter Pfeil und Bogen), Jiyuu no Tsubasa or the ending theme Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai. The music is passionate and evokes so many emotions. It fits perfectly well with the different sections of the story and strengthens the atmosphere. I personally think that music is good music when it evokes deep feelings within us and sets us thinking. And this is what the music of Shingeki no Kyojin is exactly doing.\
The art of this anime is great. I like the strong colors and the depicted scenery. The characters are drawn with strong lines, which make them expressive; you can especially see it in the eyes. Everything is drawn realistically and beautifully and with many little details. What I really love is the emphasizing of certain passages in the story through the art. What I mean by that is that the eyes, for example, are drawn dramatically and are therefore accentuated, or particular face expressions are exaggeratedly drawn to strengthen the effect.\
Coming to the characters of the story, I was positively surprised. Isayama-san managed to include so many unique characters. Every single character cannot be replaced because everyone is special in their own way. \
Starting with the main characters, there is Eren, the boy with an inconceivable willpower who might not be physically very strong, but mentally. Then there is Mikasa, who is exceptionally strong (physically) for a woman. And there is Armin, who might be weak, but has the resolve to help wherever he can. He is a genius when it comes to creating strategies. The three of them complement each other with their personalities.\
There are also other lovable characters, like Sasha, who is known as the potato girl, or Hanji, who seems to be crazy about titans. And of course, there is also Levi, humanity’s strongest soldier, whose power seemingly cannot be measured.\
Overall, I have to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is a great example for an outstanding anime; it is one of the best I have ever seen. It is one of my absolute favorites and I re-watched it 3 times because it is so good and always gets better. I really enjoyed watching the anime and cannot wait for the next season. \
I hope I could give you readers a good impression of Shingeki no Kyojin - enjoy every second when you are watching it.\

    Is Attack on Titan is one of my favorite animes? Yes, and there are many reasons for that.\
Is Attack on Titan is the greatest anime that I never see? No, and there are many reasons for that too. And I will explain why.\
Story / 7\
Even if some people consider Attack on Titan an average shonen, like One Piece, Naruto or Bleach, I can't see this anime like that. Compared to these light-minded, friendship and justice forever animes, Attack on Titan bring us to the darkness of the human being, the pitiful selfishness and cowardice in front of the worst terror that we could imagine -\
          \
        the brutal annihilation by someone stronger than us.\
I'm not going to explain how this anime played so easily with my emotions, how some moments were so strong that they brought tears to my eyes. I think many people here explained it better than me.\
But still, I have to say that Attack on Titan is still a shonen, and so, brings with him some flaws of the average shonen. When you look back to those twenty five episodes, you can see that it's slow. A slow story, with some more boring episodes between the main two arcs, with a lot, A LOT of battles. The anime (I said the anime because it doesn't necessarily apply to the manga) is a shonen, but a very good shonen who doesn't quite looks like any others.\
Art / 10\
Aaaaah, the art! How can you talk about Attack on Titan without mentioning the beautiful work between the images ? The animation, the colors, the atmosphere is remarkable, the same quality has the best movie for some moments. I couldn't say it's perfect, because some episodes are less beautiful than others, but DAMN. I don't think you never seen an anime looking like that before.\
Sound / 10\
I'm not a good reviewer about the music of something, but, you know, here the whole thing - the music is as astonishing as the art, and both of them together can be described in one word - epic.\
Character / 6\
And then there is the worst point of Attack on Titan, even if it doesn't bothered me when I watched it.\
Because Attack on Titan is such an oudstanding piece of work, with all the colors and the music and the emotions assembled so greatly with each other that you don't remark that any of the main characters has any  « psychological evolution » (I don't know if you say it like that, but oh well you understand). Like most of the shonen characters, they are, at the final episode, the same that they were as the first one, or almost - they doesn't really evolve, doesn't really mature. All of them (with some exceptions, I admit) are cliches, and they will be cliches to the very end.\
It doesn't really bothered me because, well, I like shonens, and so I'm used to this. But if you don't like the whiny Eren, the crazy Mikasa or one of the most important characters, maybe you will not enjoy as much I has enjoyed it.\
\
Finally, Attack on Titan is not the greatest anime ever. It has too many mistakes, too many imperfections for me to call it the perfection, like FMB. But, like Death note many years ago, Attack on Titan is surely one of the most enjoyable anime that I never seen in my life. It's a rollercoaster of emotion and epicness, a well executed horror and action show, an anime so better than the average that it's difficult to ignore it. Trying it will not cause you harm, I swear ;).\

    Shingeki no Kyojin (A.K.A Attack on Titan) is a complicated topic for me.  My first time through I really enjoyed it and watched about 8 episodes right through and got caught up pretty quickly.  However, I was completely unable to watch it at all a second time through.  I give it a 5/10 purely due to the initial impact which it gave me.  I will list some of my opinions below:\
Pros:\
The World and Setting -- Honestly the main selling point of the show, the set up and world is one of the most original settings I've seen and it's what kept\
          \
        me engaged for the most part.\
Action Sequences -- In my opinion, the action sequences were well done and the art style complemented the series well.\
Impact -- The series does a nice job of reeling you in (especially the first episode) and there is really nothing else like this series at the moment and the death scenes are quite gruesome\
Cons:\
The Characters -- People will likely try and defend them, but the characters are just boring.  Eren has an enormous rage boner the whole time, Armin is made out as being really smart but doesn't actually show any indication of being that intelligent, Mikasa was cool until Levi showed up and was basically better at everything and then Mikasa proceed to become not only less useful but an even more boring character.  Erwin was one of the few pretty solid characters.  The rest are so dull they don't really warrant being mentioned.\
The Plot  -- I'll try not to spoil the plot, but in the anime and the manga the author has only shown himself to be capable of using one plot line:  Eren gets kidnapped and Mikasa and/or Levi later on have to bust his ass out.  The basement was presented as this cool mysterious element, but the author has not really done anything with that, and what the manga has alluded to about the titans was something I came up with 5 episodes into the show.  Really disappointing in my opinion, especially when the author created a world with so many possibilities.\
Mixed:\
The Music -- I love Hiroyuki Sawano.  I really liked his work in Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, but I just felt like it was kind of out of place and didn't really fit the series really well.  Maybe would have preferred Yuki Kajiura for a show like this (although she tends to be a bit repetitive).\
Overall:\
I really enjoyed the show the first time around, but all consequent viewings caused its numerous glaring flaws to become apparent.  The pacing in the show is very poor and there are many episodes where nothing really happens for better or for worse.  The show takes itself really seriously and likes to act like some events were huge plot twists when it was incredibly obvious ever since the start (although there are some which are actually surprising in the manga).  It's good points sadly just don't measure up to it's flaws in my opinion, which is a shame.  It's worth a watch, but maybe not a second.\
Side Note:  I also wish there wasn't so much Eren x Levi Yaoi material around the internet\

    Overview:\
\"Attack on Titan\" was one of the first anime I ever watched, and to this day it still stands as one of my favourites. It's really hard to say just how much I love it, because there are so many reasons it stands out that they're very hard to choose from. Whether it's the show's emotion-filled story, amazing animation, incredible music or fantastic characters, \"Attack on Titan\" succeeds in being an outstanding series in just about everything it does. In short, \"Attack on Titan\" is a masterpiece and I consider it to be by no means a stretch to call it one of (if not\
          \
        the) best anime of this decade.\
Story & World (10/10):\
\"Attack on Titan\" is set in a dystopia where humans constantly live in fear of the titular Titans, giant humanoid creatures who drove them to extinction practically overnight and forced them to live behind enormous walls. These creatures are monsters. That really is the only way I can describe them, they're monsters! There's no rhyme or reason to anything they do. They appear to have no intelligence, don't even seem to be properly alive, devour humans by the dozens out of sheer pleasure rather than hunger and some of them even have their faces locked in permanent hideous smiles which makes them all the more terrifying. After a century of being separated from humanity by the walls, the Titans finally break through and our main character, Eren Yeager, is forced to watch helplessly as his mother gets brutally devoured by one of the behemoths. Plagued with anger and regret, Eren makes a solemn vow to exterminate the entire lot and win a new future for humanity and so decides to enlist in the army (specifically the Scout Regiment) in order to do so, with his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert joining him, albeit for different reasons.\
This is definitely far from your average military story. Soldiers in this series are viewed as anything but pawns. The people view every single one of them as nothing less than a human being and so view every death as tragic and important, which only makes sense considering how few humans there are left. It's at the point where they can't even call victory an accomplishment if they have to endure so many sacrifices in order to achieve it. This is all made clear by the speech of a single supporting character in one episode, and it does an amazing job at fleshing out the world these people live in. \
The pacing of the story is overall really good, with one notable exception, and the amount of suspense and massive surprises made me almost forget how to breathe several times. There are a lot of things that go unexplained in the first season, but the second delivers with a bunch of shocking revelations, with a third season on the way soon. Ultimately, an emotional, very deep and brilliantly well-thought-out story.\
Art and Animation (10/10):\
The animation is near-flawless. I don't think I can name a better looking anime because the amount of detail in everything is astonishing. As I said before, the Titans are absolutely terrifying, no small thanks to their fantastic design. In fact, everything looks incredible, from the humans to the environments to the equipment, with an interesting combination of traditional Japan animation and computer-generated images. The animations are all flawless and, almost uniquely, the fanservice is non-existent, which is a good thing as it really wouldn't fit with this type of show.\
Sound & Dialogue (10/10):\
I really don't think 10 does this justice. The soundtrack is THAT good. Practically every track is both noteworthy and memorable and they always play at exactly the right time. The openings are both amazing and the ending themes aren't bad either. I would definitely recommend you look up \"Vogel I'm Kafig\", \"E.M.A\" and \"Call Your Name\" just to see how fantastic they are. This is quite possibly the best soundtrack for an anime I've ever heard. The voice acting is fantastic too. This is one of the few instances where I would recommend the sub over the dub, as Yuki Kaiji, Yui Ishikawa and Marina Inoue all deliver fantastic performance as the lead trio, complimented by a strong supporting cast including Hiroshi Kamiya and Daisuke Ono. Of course, good voice acting is nothing without good dialogue and this series has no shortage of that. In fact, it's really hard to pick the lines that stand out because there are just so many to choose from. They really do an amazing job at subtly fleshing out both the world and the characters.\
Characters (9.5/10):\
On the surface, Eren seems like your typical shonen protagonist but there's far more to him than a guy who wants to kill Titans and save the human race. He wanted to join the Scout Regiment even before his mother's death, as he wants to see the outside world as he hates the idea of being confined in what's basically a cage. Killing Titans just became another reason for him. We also learn that he's not only angry that he couldn't save his mother, but that he argued with her to the bitter end and didn't even realise how much she meant to him until she was gone. Through conversations with others, we also learn that Eren is among the small minority of people who can witness the horrors of the Titans and turn that experience into a desire to fight them, which disgusts him as he believes the fight isn't over until the last human gets killed. And let's not even get started on his will. Seriously, at times his determination could put even the likes of Goku to shame. Unfortunately, this is a world where charging in on determination alone will just get you killed, and so Eren needs a lot of support from allies to really accomplish anything and, even then, he still makes a lot of mistakes along the way that haunt him for long after.\
Despite all this, Eren is not my favourite character in the series. That honour goes to Mikasa, who besides being one of Eren's childhood friends is also his adoptive sister, taken in by Eren's family one year before the beginning of the story. At first, Mikasa comes off as an overprotective sister, insisting on accompanying Eren practically everywhere he goes, an habit he generally views as annoying. In fact, she joined the military solely because of him, knowing he wouldn't last a single fight without her. However, her motivations become clear in episode 6 and this and the following two episodes do a brilliant job at fleshing out her character. Her reasons only make more sense if you've done your research on Japanese culture. The Japanese moral character is built upon four subjects: reciprocity, piety, duty and compassion, and I won't spoil why, but Mikasa is largely driven by the former two. However, she's the only Asian in an otherwise Western setting so it's only natural that Eren and the other characters would find her devotion so strange, which I must admit is pretty damn ingenious. As for her talents, well, she makes the other soldiers look borderline useless, taking down multiple Titans completely by herself while others have struggled to take down even one. That's not to say she's perfect. She's far from it, in fact. Whenever Eren is in danger, she frequently loses all sense of reason and attacks the ones responsible in a panicked rage, which is saying a lot considering she's disturbingly calm in every other situation. All in all, she is not only my favourite character in the series, but also one of my favourite animated characters of all time.\
Rounding up the main cast is Armin, Eren and Mikasa's best friend. While Eren and Mikasa had a hard time in the past and became who they are now, Armin grew up weak, cowardly and having a very low opinion of himself, believing he's just a burden. Needless to say, much of his development revolves around him overcoming this and gaining more self-confidence, though ultimately he's more of a strategist than a fighter. While I didn't like him nearly as much as Mikasa or Eren, he's still a very good character, as well as proof that you don't have to be a badass to be useful.\
The supporting cast is very strong as well. There's Captain Levi, one of the leaders of the Scout Regiment who is viewed as humanity's strongest soldier, but is also a neatfreak and brutally honest. There's also Jean, who is introduced as arrogant and cowardly (he's established as telling Eren that fighting the Titans is suicide) but gradually develops into an honourable man through personal tragedy, Sasha, who's pretty air-headed but also one of the nicest characters as well as one of the few sources of comic relief in the series, Hanji, who is a serious oddball and enthusiastic about Titans. and numerous others who are best left unmentioned. What stops this category from getting full marks is that it tends to focus on a select few while leaving everyone else in the dust. Overall, however, the characters are brilliant with very interesting and believable personalities.\
Enjoyment (9/10):\
Word to the wise: this is an extremely hard-going series. If the concept alone isn't proof that this series isn't for the faint of heart, the enormous amount of deaths (a lot of which are established characters) definitely is. While the battles are nothing if not entertaining, we are pretty much talking about a hopeless battle, which only gets slightly less hopeless later on. Too much for you? If so, then you're probably not going to like this series. If you can get past this, however, then it is very enjoyable with plenty of twists and turns and some truly glorious and memorable battles \
Overall:\
\"Attack on Titan\" is an incredible, deep series with an amazing soundtrack, great characters and a strong plot. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind having their feelings played with, particularly anyone who likes dark fantasies and dystopias. In fact, I would say that everyone should at least try this series if they haven't already, just so they can see why it's so popular. It's hard to believe that the series is far from over. If it keeps up the quality for the next season and the possible ones that follow, it could very well be this decade's answer to \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". In short, one of the greatest anime ever made in my opinion\

                          \
    Shingeki no Kyojin (SNK) is by far the only anime that has ever satisfied me thoroughly. Though the story itself is unoriginal (apocalypse theme with humanity on the losing side), I praise the author for his obvious devotion in this. It's evident that a great deal of research was done to come up with this epic tale that so far is free from any plot holes. How he skillfully manage each of the events and the characters involve so as to diverse it from the stereotypes and the current trend in anime is just- wow.\
The art is what literally brought me to the animated series.\
          \
        I knew of SNK before it was adapted. Me reading it was more or less prompted by the lack of activities back then but not once have I regretted anything since I clicked it. Anyway the visuals are very pleasing to the eyes, and the fact that the animators paid attention to every possible detail is what made everything suitable for the kind of genre SNK has and commendable enough to leave one's mouth hanging open (tested and proven). From the historical setting to the action scenes, everything is well accounted for. Contradictory to how meticulous the environment is portrayed, the less-complex looking characters look at home probably because of their dark borders and how color coordinated they are with their surroundings (thank god I haven't seen any of the pink or green hair common in anime). I have my hat's down for the artists and animators.\
The soundtracks are nicely done. The opening songs are really attention grabbers, with all those operatic voice(s) at the start and the indescribable instruments that worked remarkably well together. The rest of the instrumentals you can hear throughout the series (usually backing up intense, rise of action moments and such) also did great in strongly depicting the emotions  and in not competing with the characters' dialogue. I can't say I'm a good judge of music, but it's not everyday that I immediately like them in one sitting seeing as I'm very picky when it comes to them (which is what happened in this case haha).\
I must say, the characters are what really surprised me. They have all the elements of the common characters found in other animes (I had to compare), but how these accustomed personalities are twisted to match the ever dreary atmosphere of the story was stupefying. My speculations regarding their attitudes and how they work with it are always thrown off the cliff. Though I did get some right, it is a new experience for me not being able to prognosticate their intentions. Their unpredictability is what got me glued to the monitor and what kept me clicking on the next episodes.\
Erwin never ceases to amaze me with his intellect that seem to get sharper and wider as the story goes on. His growing experience in the field is obviously the reason why he's often a few steps ahead Armin's smart analyzations and I'm sure the latter will become like him in due time.\
Armin's tenacity is one of the things I'm looking over because by now I've deduced that fools like him are the ones who are capable to continuously adapt themselves in a frightening pace (he'll soon become someone mentally and physically stronger than the Armin we know of). Eren as well, since I never thought that a blood-lusting young man who's only filled with revenge and dangerous desires be made into the hero of mankind. But that's a good thing though, because he seemed like the personification of the fearful and weak mass of people; full of flaws and near impossible ideals. Because Eren's character is not overly done and nowhere near close to perfection, I love and hate him at the same time.\
Conni also caught my attention,  particularly because of how forced his passive attitude is. His drastic resignation to being a person who's caught in the flow caused by abandonment of his previous headstrong attitude was sadly obscured by the strong presence of the trio, but that didn't stopped me from noticing him (okay, I paid attention to him first because he's bald). He's a great guy and someone you can count on, although a bit cowardly and small in size.\
The other surrounding characters also have their own eccentricities and dark sides. It seems that their inner demons are slowly gaining the spotlight because of how desperate the situation is becoming. Again, another good thing because it shows how disgusting, at the same time praise worthy, a person's real intentions are. SNK's creator really made a great clash with fantasy and reality.\
I did not enjoy this series, because \"enjoy\" is a happy emotion stimulated by happy moments. SNK has none of that. Fear, distress, tense, anxiety, sadness, gloom, thrill, mental breakdown, and overwhelming horror/terror is what I felt while watching/reading this story. Add those with the blood and gore shown throughout the whole series, it's spectacularly hair-raising. I have no regrets.\
Overall is a perfect score of ten. Bias or not, you can't deny the fact that it's EPIC AND FILLED WITH AWESOMENESS.",

    I think it's safe to say that Shingeki no Kyojin is the most popular anime of 2013. Whilst I can see why people would be attracted to it and that it's a very entry-level anime, it's also a pretty mediocre show. \
Let's start by looking at this show as just an adaptation. So, ignoring the story, characters, etc. I'll just look at how well the manga has been adapted into an animated series. The artstyle is quite unique, it has a certain appeal to it and I quite like it (even if the quality of the artstyle suffers in the manga). Production I.G managed to\
          \
        do a nice job of preserving the good aspects of Isayama's work. However, when we come to animation, things seem to go downhill. I could write a book on how many very poor examples of animation there are in this show. From QUALITY drawings to a still frame being shaken around the screen with some wind effects over it in place of an actual action scene to purple bricks. The bottom line is the animation is rushed, cheap and poorly done. There ARE some good examples, sometimes whole episodes go by with very few issues, but other weeks it'll be god-awful. The inconsistencies in quality leave a bitter taste and I would have to call the animation, overall, average. Having taken a look at some comparisons between the BDs and TV releases, the BDs seem to have improved on the QUALITY moments quite a bit. Those comparisons were cherry-picked, however, and I’m not going to re-watch the series to adjust my review for the BDs. All I can say is that if you want to waste your time on this series, you might as well try watch the BDs. \
As for sound, another major aspect of a manga adaptation, I think they did a decent job here. In fact I think the OST carries entire episodes sometimes. The OPs and EDs are pretty great, and never fail to get fans hyped for the show. I'm no music geek, so I find it quite hard to express what I thought of a soundtrack in a review, but the music for battle scenes fits quite well and made up for some of the poor (or complete lack of) animation in some scenes. However, only a couple of tracks are memorable, so I'm not going to call the OST great. \
Direction and pacing are truly the worst parts of this adaptation. 4 episodes to move a boulder speaks for itself, but I'll mention all the filler later on.\
Now leaving the adaptation-specifics to one side and looking at something that crosses both forms of media, the story. I think this show has a decent plot. In fact, the premise is really great and I think that's how the show got so popular - it has a very interesting premise. All of humanity trapped inside giant walls that protect them from the horrific titans outside, and finally the titans break down the wall? Pretty cool. It's a shame, however, that this premise was somewhat wasted. Once the show gets to the boulder arc, it just starts to lose its appeal and becomes very generic and shonen-y with TONS of filler. Seriously, there is an amazing amount of filler in this series and I struggle to comprehend how more people aren't complaining about it. Maybe it's because they've organised the filler in such a way that it's less noticeable to the teenage audience? This is the general formula for the show: Up to 3 minutes of recapping what you already know, the OP, 15 minutes of sweet FA and dragged out speeches, 2 minutes of something happening, the ED, then a preview for next week. It never fails to leave the only interesting part until the last couple of minutes, then just cuts off so you have to come back next week for your weekly dose of filler. In fact, they hinder the actual show by forcing each and every episode to end with some sort of cliff-hanger. It would be a lot smoother and better if they didn't force this every single week.\
Back to the story, besides the premise it's nothing that special and has a rather large amount of plot holes and things happening for nothing other than plot convenience. \
Characters. Characters. Characters. Wow, it's amazing how two-dimensional they all are. Besides the changes characters go through early on in the series, there is 0 character development. Almost everyone is the exact same cardboard cut-out they were to begin with. The main character is nothing more than 'hurr must kill muh titans!' and the female lead is nothing more than 'hurr must save muh not-brother-pseudo-boyfriend!'. It gets very boring, very quickly. Jean is the most interesting character and has the most believable development, why isn't he the main character instead? Supporting characters are usually pretty bad and I've never felt anything when someone died. This isn't because I'm a heartless monster, it's because trying to empathise with ANYONE from this series is similar to trying to empathise with a brick wall. \
To summarise, the lead cast are some variation of Mary Sue (albeit Eren fucks up 24/7 and is just generally retarded) who have a shitload of plot armour whilst almost everyone else doesn't matter and dies. The plot and characters follow so many shonen tropes and cliches that leave me feeling that this show wasted so much good potential. \
Overall, the show can have its enjoyable moments. The plot is generally interesting, but falls really short with its characters. I can see why the show got popular due to its premise, and I can see why it remained popular and why people like it. However, this show is simply just not that good and is seriously overrated. The last few episodes, whilst good, did not make up for the countless time wasted throughout the series.\
5/10 - would recommend you read the manga instead to avoid as much filler if you were really wanting to watch this.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, is simply like weed. It circulates your body, into a powered-up mechanism of charisma dwelling from the sprawling adrenaline of anticipation pumped into the human body. A constantly hyped anime viraling throughout the anime community, and whether or not this anime is critiqued or loved, an anime is an anime and thus will forever be ingrained firmly into anime history and Japanese culture regardless. Question is, is this a masterpiece? or is it merely an over-hyped and generically produced show of the 2013 year? or perhaps, is it ambiguous towards every individual? \
Primarily, Shingeki no Kyojin (will refer as snk from now\
          \
        on) at first with exceptional hype was seemingly latent. Meaning, just from the first episode of Snk, the potential of Snk was already evident towards the audience, and you know, it is going to be a well-recognized and decent anime.  \
Story 9~\
Snk portrays the world of humanity in an almost dystopian state where humans are on the verge of extinction, where humanity is engraved within walls and restrictions, and where humanity is deemed into living with fear and agony as inferior existences amidst the superior entity also known as the 'Titans'. Although humans being more intellectual, the titans excelled in their large physical state. The show conveys how much despair humanity is left to face in order to strive and thrust for their freedom and entrapment. Definitely a marathon-able anime to say the least, it is addicting and extremely entertaining to say the least, and this addiction will only you make you strive for more when the show comes to an end.  \
The pacing is fine throughout the anime although a bit slower in the middle, the effects are brought out nicely as our supporting cast receive more screen time, such as Levi and Jean. Eren, after witnessing grief and despair, finds himself with the need to achieve a change for humanity, a change where humanity will be free from the walled city, a change where humanity can see every individual with smiles on their faces, and a change where mankind will be able to explore the rest of the unexplored lands awaiting them. \
After years of training, Eren, Mikasa and Armin pursue their inevitable goal of protecting humanity and as for Eren, \"to kick the Titans' ass\". \
Art 9~\
I would summarize the animation and art with three words. Pretty top notch. \
Animated by Production I.G, a producer known to have previously released other several high quality works and excelling in animation, from characters to the backgrounds to the action scenes, I can definitely claim this superb. The characters are well highlighted with thick black borders, making the audience able to easily distinguish the backgrounds from the characters while helping us understand these characters more as well. \
The titans are depicted comically and uniquely, their faces are indescribable beauty and it is hilarious to the extent you would feel like bursting with laughter or at least laughing within you. However, a potential problem for some viewers would be that these crudely drawn faces can cause serious action and intense scenes into becoming scenes of where humour is seemed to be forcefully implemented into. Nevertheless, these faces kept us entertained and ultimately did not ruin many viewers enjoyment and expectations including me and did not have that much of an impact. \
Sound 9~\
Likewise, to say the music fits the anime at times is an understatement. Sound is excelled in Snk and is superb, having appropriate music to approach their required scenes in order to acquire and release their full wanted effects. Snk used euphonious, emotional and sympathetic soundtracks to hit on the dramatic and emotional scenes our characters experience. Ranging from a fusion of electronic, orchestral and rock type music, soundtracks such as \"Bauklotze\" and \"Call your name\" are examples of highly recognizable soundtracks of rock erupted adrenaline embedded into our veins and pumping our eagerness to watch the show. It keeps your feet on the floor, and your body sitting up straight. With Guilty Crown, Kill La Kill and Ao no Exorcist soundtrack composer Hiroyuki Sawano, I can ensure you that you will be leeched tightly onto your chair.\
The opening prepares you with eagerness for what you are going to experience in the episode while the ending leaves that experience as a memory forever stained into your mind, wanting to see more.  \
Character 8~\
One of the three main characters in Snk is Eren, the \"boss\" or \"shounen leader\" of the crew consisting of Mikasa and Armin and Friends. He is placed on a vocation to pursue the retribution on the titans due to the death of his loved ones and for humanity's thrust for freedom. This boy can be considered a raging nuisance, but that being said, this is what makes him intriguing as a character as throughout the show, we are put into his shoes to experience his physical and psychological pain he endured throughout his journey. \
Next, Armin, at first being depicted as a pussy who would never takes the initiative and stand up for himself, having no absolute or firm resolve, he is shown to be weak and looks up to Eren his best friend from childhood. As a result, after walking the same path as Mikasa and Eren, he is shown to grow and develop as a character in his areas of determination and bravery, excelling and being of much use in the tactical and strategical field in battles.\
Lastly, the one and only Mikasa. The epitome of flawless perfection, one of the reasons why I watch this show is simply Mikasa. She is \"Shingeko no Kyojin\" in a nutshell. Being physically strong and intelligent in combat, she is also notably and essentially one of the reasons why Eren wants to conquer the titans and she wants to ultimately, protect Eren as well, being her adopted loving brother and taking care of her when she did not have a home. \
In pure opinion, I believe these characters were developed quite well, but it was possible to develop them to a deeper extent, exploring their personal background. The supporting crew of Snk is phenomenal, why? There is Levi and if I were you, lets just say if you piss him off, you won't have a very bright tomorrow. :D\
Enjoyment 9~and Overall 9\
The show to conclude kept me leeched, and It definitely has a gripping and well written story to accompany the fluid animation, art and epic soundtrack, all contributing into driving your blood inside your veins around your body. After watching Snk, I really have no idea if I am human anymore, the thrill of Snk has made me sub-human and so I will have to stop writing now. Snk will always be remembered when the anime community reflects on 2013 as a year, and we will then recognize how much anime has changed throughout the years, be it years, decades or centuries.",

    Before snk haters start clicking on not helpful, plz maintain dignity by at least reading the review first.\
What does a genre mean? Generally, it is a class on which the author wants to focus on. But there is one more genre which we as viewers create, which I nomenclate as the epicness genre. It is a genre which can include animes from any other genres, may be from rom com, to horror to psychology. It is a genre reserved for the best of best animes we have watched till date, and is obviously not the same for everyone. Still there are numerous animes which have\
          \
        universal appeal and get into this genre in everyone's list, a few eg. would(could) be death note, or code geass, or hxh. So is Shingeki no Kyojin probably the vest anime 2013 one of them? If yes its incredible, if no then what did it lack?  A good start is half done, but that also means half is remaining to be done.\
So is there anything that makes it different from other animes? Snk is set in a medieval period, where titans attack the humans or may be the other way around. Humans use weapons like cannons, guns and 3D gear, to fight against them. Obviously our protagonist losses people precious to him and wants revenge. That is what I originally thought, and it is probably a stagnated thought in many minds, but the fact is that the protagonist EREN fights for a broad goal like freedom, not for a narrow minded aim as revenge. So he trains himself and tries to fight. The action scenes are decent and nicely animated, and are added with the best osts. Apart from this there is one more thing that this anime has and that is REALISM. Action, shounen anime and realism can't go hand in hand, but this anime manages the impossible. Ok so are titans real? Answer is yes and no. No for obvious reasons. Yes from a very scientific point of view, I am not a biology student, but I do know there existed dinosaurs, and consider titans to be dinosaurs with brains and human faces we are done. And let them be a hybrid between a  dinosaur and a regenerative animal, so they can regenerate. Moreover there is the 3D gear, and in between the episodes, on screenshots, there is a whole description on how it works, and it is very scientific, and needs skilled users to handle it. And the feeling of despair, and the reactions of common people under this, and the psychology behind their actions is also well explored. Above all it removes many side characters very easily, which is a rarity in many current shounen animes, in fact they resurrect the dead. All this simply adds to the realism factor.\
Animation 9/10, Sound 11/10\
Production IG maintained good visuals, with incredible animations, except for a few parts where they used the same picture again and again. But still on the whole it sets a fairly decent mark on its animation due to incredible action scenes, and some cool characters (Mikasa is a beauty dont disagree on that now). The medieval period is shown nicley, the scenery and backgrounds all add to the decent animation. The exact reactions and facial descriptions when the characters suffered from despairity, were very well animated. Sound and music are one of the best of all the anime osts I have listened to. The osts are godly epic, and this ain't any exaggeration and it is probably the osts that make even simple scenes, so lively that the viewer is glued to the screens. It emphasizes that incredible osts can literally lift the enjoyment to another level. Moreover the voice acting is fabulous. Sorry Kaji Yukii haters, but his role as Eren is the one of the best voice acting.\
Story 8/10 Minor spoilers\
Story is fairly simple, titans attack humans attack titans some get killed, some get injured ,some live some die in the name of a soldier (this is quoted from samurai champloo opening, samurai is replaced by soldier). But all that is for the first arc. The second arc delves into mystery too. It is strictly not classified as a mystery genre, but it still has fair amount of it but it is mostly implicative. The story has some distinct features absent from many of its counterparts. Most people believe that the story is partly new and stuff, but its most distinctive characteristics is that it brings out the filth within the humans. It also questions things such as right to freedom, and the need for power, and the ability to make precise decisions. The main story follows Eren and his friends who strive  to survive (or may be not?). One of the strongest points of the story is that it is able to remove any side characters who are not needed without any second thought, so plz dont get to  like nay side character, else u will be largely disappointed. \
The first arc mainly depends on action scenes, with few unpredictable situations. It mainly depended on the cliffhangers.  In fact the first arc had a lot many cliffhangers, and I was unable to sleep for two nights after one of the cliffhangers. So this mostly had a universal appeal. It has overall a very dark atmosphere and the author displays the despair within humans in an indigenous manner. As such the first arc deserves easy 10/10.\
The second arc was entirely different. With many new characters, it also started to have a mystery tone to it. And this probably backfired for many viewers as they started pointing out that the mystery was lame, whereas the real fact is that it was never meant to create any mystery, it was just to add suspense, and more importantly create tension for the climax. The author cleverly laid down facts so that the viewer knows the answer to the puzzle and just waits for the characters to understand and play it, but unfortunately it was misunderstood by many of us. Another aspect of this arc was irregular pacing, it would have been better to delete or merge one or two episodes and the let the climax reached earlier, and this followed by speculations to the next arc.\
Characters  9/10\
Since the anime follows the life of soldiers it is obvious that it will cover many characters. So firstly the trio Eren, Mikasa, Armin. At first Eren is showed to be fighting for revenge, but then he develops into a character who puts freedom first, and that is what fuels his ambition. Later in the story he mostly develops into a cliche character of a regular shounen anime, but that is a law rather than exception. His development is done most intricately, and his experiences fuel this. Mikasa, the adoptive sister of eren, the star of the academy, is shown to be overly possesive about eren, but once her backstory is shown, it becomes completely understandable. She is shown to be superskilled, and is one of my favourite characters. Armin a kid, who becomes an incredible character later. He gets an awesome character development, and also plays the role of a narrator. He is a keen observant, and he is the one who makes many statements, which lead the viewers to a definite conclusion. He also quotes cool lines and was very impressive and bold in the latter half. Apart for the trio, there are MC's friends who are typical of a shounen anime. And the boss of all characters LEVI, who becomes a very important part in second arc, is mostly supported by his reputation, and his character is well defined and needs no further development.\
Enjoyment 11/10\
For me enjoyment is measured at two levels. First, general satisfaction. Second, my reactions to cliffhangers. I heavily enjoyed the anime and the sole reason for this is that I watched it as an ongoing anime. Other reason would be the first impression of the anime, and second reason would be awesome osts. Third and the most important reason would be a completely different class of shounen. In which shounen anime have we ever seen people getting eaten up and actually dying, I. Fact I wonder whether this should be classified as a shounen. I attribute its success to the incredible tension.\
Most SNK haters comprise of people who either marathoned the series in a day or two, or may be week at its most. The whole of the second arc depends upon the tension created in 4-5 eps, and the climax at its peak. Many lost the vast tension because it takes time for the intense pressure created to be fitted into viwers mind. In fact they lost the most crucial part. So I honestly suggest one to watch the anime in regular gaps. For me it was one week, which is impossible because u will most probably surrender to ur conscience to watch what happens next, but still I would suggest at least a gap of three days between any two episodes, to gain maximum enjoyment. The brain dissects all facts carefully and this is the path for full enjoyment.\
Another trick is to watch the anime in HD, it looks as if the Titan came out of the screen. HD rocks.\
Overall 9/10\
So the question still bugs did this get into everyone list of epicness genre? The answer is yes and no. For me it did, for others it might not. I was forced to watch this on a weekly basis, and with no new eps, I irrationally rewatched the previous episodes. In fact I watched the first arc probably 3 times. With each new episode, there was a general satisfaction. All the episodes served a purpose and rarely any episode was wasted. The author has carefully planned the outline, and the anime adheres very much to the manga. But as I already mentioned, the problem which occurrs when u marathon a series, u dissolve and nullify the huge tension, leaving a dull taste.\
Cons : On complete objective viewing, there are few plot holes in the story, but this can be easily overlooked, and these will be probably covered in the later chapters of the manga. Animation though consistent, had a few backdrops, but on the whole it is at a very good level. Characters like erens mom and dad, and his friends could have got a bit more development with their back stories. As for the episodes, one or two scenes could have been deleted or fast forwarded to reach the climax early, leaving us with speculations of what's next. Given all these cons I can at most kill up one point leaving a close masterpiece at 9/10. \
As a side note: I never intended to write a review on SNK, for I assumed that this would get plenty of 10s as it's review, but the hell, it barely got 9. What is to happen of the next generation of anime viewers if they were to miss out on this epic shit.",

    *SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\
Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is by and far the most popular and hyped anime of the year 2013. It has received much praise from all sides of the anime community and it is usually agreed upon that it is at least a “good” anime. Though the question is, is it overhyped?\
\
Story:- 7\
(a)Premise:\
The story of SnK is one which, at first glance, doesn’t show originality. It is a classic “zombie” movie, just with the zombies being gigantic. The premise revolves around, gigantic man-eating creatures named “Titans”. These titans pose a gigantic threat to humanity’s existence. Thus humanity creates 3 walls, which\
          \
        protect them from the titans, but for how long?\
Soon the wall is broken and the first protective wall is abandoned. Here, we meet our 3 main characters, Eren, Mikasa and Armin. Eren has just lost his mother in the titan attack and swears vengeance against all titans.\
(b)Originality:\
Thus the story truly begins. I call this a non-original story since, there are many anime that have a post-apocalyptic world where humans are constantly under the threat of attack from an external source shrouded in mystery (Like Evangelion and Gurren Lagann). The story also revolves around the survival aspect that many anime use. But, it is here that the story stops being similar to other anime. The rest of the anime is completely original filled with plot twists in every other episode.\
(c)Pacing:\
The pace of SnK is “weird”. After the first few episodes there is a 3 year time skip, while later on in the series, there is an “arc” which goes on for around 5-6 episodes, but takes place in 1 day.\
Throughout the entirety of the series, it keeps the viewer exited for the next episode and keeps the story going at a ridiculously fast pace.\
(d)Ending:\
The ending of the series is extremely unsatisfactory. But as of now, a second season may be coming in 2015.\
\
Art and Animation:- 9\
(a)Art:\
The art of SnK is of the best art in recent anime. The quality of the art is amazingly good, which is ironic, since the art in the manga wasn’t that good. Every single human and area shown in the anime is extremely detailed. For example, the art style shown in the outer and middle wall shows the cities to be filled to the brim with buildings everywhere. While on the other hand we have the complete opposite in the inner wall, which shows an abundance of nature and beauty.\
(b)Animation:\
The animation in SnK is a gigantic step in animation for all of anime. Specifically the scenes which utilize the use of 3-D maneuver gear. The 3-D maneuver gear is basically a piece of equipment given to the soldiers which allows them to become spiderman. The animation in the scenes with the maneuver gear is brilliant. It gives a sense of actual movement to the viewer.\
The scenes with normal animation still seem very unique when compared to the animation style presented in other anime.\
(c)Character Design:\
The design of every human character is extremely unique and no character looks like a “normal” anime character. Every character looks like an actual human would look. For example, unlike other main character of other (Shonen) anime, our main characters in SnK all have, average human bodies with average looking hair.\
The titan’s designs on the other hand, degrade as the series goes on. At the beginning of the series, the titans all looked creepy, but as the series continues the titans go from creepy to borderline retarded. For example, in episode 5 we are introduced to a Moe Titan and a Darwin Titan.\
\
Sound:-9.5\
(a)OST or Soundtrack:\
Masafumi Mima was the one who directed the soundtrack for Shingeki No Kyojin. His previous works were nothing worth mentioning, but his work for this soundtrack in particular, it masterful. Every song just screams the word “epic” into your ear while listening to the soundtrack.\
Every piece of music has german words thrown into it and uses choirs as an accompaniment for the lead music or singer.\
(b)Openings and Ending:\
There can only be one way to define the first opening of the series. Eargasm. The opening, on its own, has reached a higher hype level then the actual anime, which is saying a lot.\
The second opening is garbage when compared to the first one, but when heard on its own it is a pretty good song.\
Both endings of the series, while not terrible, are easily overshadowed by the 2 openings.\
(c)Sub and Dub:\
The subbed version of the series is more recommended than the dubbed in this case. It’s not that the dub is bad, but the sub it’s just better. The dub for SnK is fine, but Eren sounds ridiculously old for his age.\
\
Character:-3\
(a)Main characters:\
The characters of SnK are the worst part of it. There is almost no development for any character aside from Armin.\
Eren is the stereotypical “revenge junkie” for anime and doesn’t evolve any further than that.\
Mikasa is the main problem. She is extremely overpowered. Awesome, but overpowered. But here biggest flaw is her affection for Eren. Unlike characters like Levi, who are overpowered, but not overly affectionate, Mikasa has an unreal amount of love for Eren.\
Armin is the only main character in the series that goes through any development. He goes from a weak character to a person who uses tact in battles.\
(b) Supporting Cast:\
The supporting cast of SnK is mediocre at best. Some characters get little to no attention while other go through some development. Examples of a few good supporting characters in SnK are Sasha, Jean, Hange, Annie, Erwin and Levi.\
\
Enjoyment:-8\
The series as a whole was very enjoyable. It was a good shonen which was slow at some points. It keeps you on your toes by giving cliffhangers on every episode doing something like Code Geass achieved.  The soundtrack was epic and the animation was brilliant. The ending, while was unsatisfactory, made you excited for the next season.\
Is it overhyped? Maybe. That depends on your personal preference. It does praise, but definitely not as much as it gets.\
The action scenes get your blood pumped up, the crappy character development will make you facepalm and the retarded titan designs will probably make you spit out your drink.\

    Well then, here I sit and wiggle my toes around in the shark tank of fans. I know I'm taking a big risk by putting my tender little opinionated toes into said tank where they might be devoured by the beasties below me that perceive them as insults instead of honest and fair criticisms of their so called\" perfect\" show, so here we go. \
Usually when I watch an anime I seek out what people are saying about it so I go in watching it and deciding whether to finish it as college has made me such a busy little bee. But when even non-anime\
          \
        fans are talking about this show and everyone else is either praising it or shoving yet another nauseating \"haha they kill off your favorite characters\" joke for the billionth time, I begin to question the horde and their hurricane of hardons for the show and get a little skeptical. So when my friend said we would sit down and watch it, I couldn't help but feel like I've lost my uniqueness. But after finally finishing it I'm really proud to have had criticisms of it while enjoying the show as well. \
I really enjoyed the premise, and the consistent theme of hopelessness and horror that plague the humans and soldiers behind the walls. Granted at times it was hard to care about said characters. You spend the most screen time with Eren and while he is your typical angsty \"I can do this because courage\" protagonist, he did grow on me and I started to feel bad for his struggles and took pride in his accomplishments. But the rest of the cast is just really meh to me, and I started to enjoy seeing characters like Pixis and Levi boss them around and bring them to their senses after having a dramatic exposition. The rest of the cast seems to only have one personality characteristic (Sasha likes eating, Connie is pissed off, Mikasa is determined, etc.) and development of these characters is scarce if not completely nonexistent. And the show's action makes it move at such a breakneck pace, that with the exception of Eren, you never get a full picture on who these people really are. Even with Mikasa and Armin, they are Eren's friends, but neither have much of a personality, and the fact that they're willing to trust Eren no matter if he can turn into a colossal, unpredictable killing machine is just naive. Not to mention that many of the side characters' melodramatic conversations seem to take place during a 5 minute post-action interval where the Titans must have been taking a convenient breather and they only really solidify the fact that they have to keep fighting instead of having such conversations keep the plot moving. \
The titans themselves really are the best part of the show, and having humanity being slowly devoured by horrifying naked caricatures is a great, scary concept in and of itself, and you praise the humans when they get killed That breakneck stream of action was the best part of the show, and the operatic music tracks combined with bone-crunching violence and facial drawings so intense they pop out of the screen, I couldn't help but enjoy the excitement the show had to offer. The plot and pacing can help with that, as each episode leaves off in a way that makes you want to watch the next one. Sometimes it's really cheap though, especially when they leave off when they appear to kill someone off only to have a convenient victory pulled out of their bum by the next. The plot, as said before is good but lacks focus, especially after everyone thought that the secrets of the Titans and the key to victory was locked in Eren's dad's basement, and the Scout Regiment and creators of the show were just like \"yeah let's NOT do that\" for some reason. Granted here I'm willing to go easy on the show here, and despite this unanswered question and the fact that the Colossal Titan only shows up once or twice, I can accept the answer to wait for a second season. \
So as mentioned before, despite the hype and having fans spoil little events in the show, I did enjoy Attack on Titan for its awesome art, thrilling action and exciting soundtrack, but not so much its melodramatic characters, all too convenient plot, and unanswered questions.\

    Right off the bat, I have to admit; I have a distinct love for the ‘dystopian world’ genre. It’s fascinating and something we may never be able to truly understand in the real world. The suffering, the agony and fear of being caged and suppressed…it’s not uncommon, but we definitely don’t live behind 50-meter high walls and don’t see giant naked humanoids eating our family and friends.\
That is what makes Shingeki No Kyojin so amazing to me.\
The storyline is very simple and easy to understand right from episode 1. \
The overall revelation of the exact plot does not allow me to truly comment on it\
          \
        as the manga is still ongoing and I have not finished the manga myself. I do appreciate the anime production team’s job on the whole aspect of suspense in almost every episode that relayed the true fear and tension from the story. As I’ve said, it may not be easy for us to relate to running away from naked giants but the anime portrayed great emphasis on fear, anger and many other extreme emotions that just draws us in. I would be lying to say that I was not at the edge of my seat in every episode. There is also the involvement of the supporting characters which is something I personally enjoy. I really can’t stomach when an anime or manga is ALL ABOUT the main character and that he/she is everything that the story is about –unless, the title itself IS the protagonist’s name. I just love to see the development of relationships amongst characters that adds up more depth into the story. I can’t say much about the story in complete detail for I am placing my bets on a second season AND awaiting the true finale of the manga, however, I can definitely say that the anime itself did a great job in portraying the originality and raw emotion of the story which enables me to give a double thumbs-up.\
Now, here is where I want to elaborate on the most; the Art.\
Oh how Shingeki No Kyojin blew me away with the majestic animation and art. From the characters to the settings and the details of the animation made me breathless; especially when they portray the use of the 3D Maneuver Gears. Not only that, the lighting and use of slow-motion effects magnified the emotions and suspense of each scene. I am a freak for fine details because it is quite hard to see super-great detail in art styles of shounen-based anime/manga. However, I was not disappointed with Shingeki No Kyojin. It captured the essence of the story beautifully and not to mention the work and effort of the flawless animation. I just…love it. I can’t put my personal happiness in words enough because I just wish that there are more shounen animes with this kind of quality animation; especially for action scenes. Simple thick intense lines and sound effects are not enough to convey a perfect action scene…it is the raw animation and movement of the characters captured frame by frame. That is why I appreciate the effort and work put onto this anime and the art is definitely one of my favourite aspects of this anime; hands down.\
The soundtrack used in this anime is just stunning. I personally downloaded the entire OST album to listen to all of its tracks and although some were just…not all that great, there are certain ones that are beyond spectacular. Even by just listening to the background music, you can feel the sadness, melancholy and agony of the characters…and at other times, it builds up the pace into a huge Titan kickass fight. It blends well with the setting and mood of the anime and stays true to its emotions. There are also certain songs that are just plain EPIC which…I have to urge you to watch the anime itself to truly appreciate it. The two opening and ending sequences were also well chosen and in my personal opinion, I LOVED both of the openings…they were amazing. The first opening song captured the main protagonist, Eren’s resolve and anger towards the Titans which is basically the main thing happening in the anime and the second song is more of an evolution into a war-like aspect where you can truly catch onto the soldiers’ resolution for humanity. All in all, I love the soundtrack used in this anime. Great job once again, production team!\
Ah, the characters…they can basically become the goldmine or garbage for an anime in my personal opinion. In this case, Shingeki No Kyojin is purely gold. Not saying that every character is awesome, I hated a few characters…but that is the beauty of it. There is never a perfect character and in this anime, ALL the characters are flawed. In the dystopian setting, I think such characteristic is easily found in all of its characters and it makes the anime less…boring? I don’t know about most of you but I love it when an anime truly portrays the weaknesses of the characters. Sure, strength and power development is cool and all but it is the flaw that makes them more…human and relatable in a sense. In every episode, you can see the characters in fear because…that is how things are in a crazy dystopian world. There is no such thing as ‘fearlessness’ here. Even the strongest soldier shows confusion and indecisiveness but that might give out spoilers so I’ll just leave it at that. Overall, I find the characters all beautifully made and well-thought out. And for once, I love how a supporting character is a lot more badass than the main protagonist… \
I’m going to group up enjoyment and my overall thought of this anime into one and that is; simply EPIC. The anime does not showcase huge adventures and multiple crises; it’s already IN one huge severe problem. I’m just happy that there is still hope for epic animation in an anime because I’ve been disappointed a lot with many shounen animes.  I’m going to give this a 9/10 because I cannot say that this anime is PERFECTION. It is not. But it definitely is a winner in my heart and hopefully yours as well! =D",

    Its the big over hyped show of 2013. I'm not saying its horrible its just overrated by many.\
 Story 7/10\
 Lets start off with What made it bad, the pacing was horrible. It felt like they took 2 episodes longer than they should have to do something. The story had an interesting concept but the final work was messy. They could have had the anime last longer into the manga but the pacing ruined it. They jumped from idea to idea to fast and then took to long to finish it.\
Characters 6/10\
The character Eren was kinda eh he makes the show kinda annoying. It kinda\
          \
        ended up like he cry'd and never got anything done. Mikasa on the other hand was a new thing and was very interesting to see how she would act. I liked how she was so focused about protecting Eren.\
Art 9/10 Sound 9/10\
The overall art and sound was great. The scenes where they had the 3d gear on they animated the background very well. The art had good fitting to the show. The music was also fantastic. I enjoyed it most of the time but the pacing and annoying characters kinda ruined it.\

    After finally finishing SnK today I think it's time to write a proper review rather then writing one when the anime/season hasn't even ended yet.\
Shingeki no Kyojin, or some might call it Attack on titan brings us an outstanding story line that is original and very engaging, that compels the viewer to keep on watching every week, and sitting with your jaw hanging for a while after the massive cliffhanger at almost every episode, having the thought of waiting an entire week before we get to know more, and what else is there to do besides rewatching the anime while waiting for the next episode?\
          \
        ^^ (no life) well moving on. Since I have rewatched this anime probably more then 6 times so far I believe I have the right to say the art and animation of the anime was probably one of the best I have ever seen. The incredibly smooth and spirited action scenes were very well made, not to mention the music which fit the animations almost perfectly and made it seem even more intense and absolutely stunning. Although there were many plotholes that I expect all to be covered in the next season, well that is if there is one, the anime itself was extraordinary and very well made I highly enjoyed this anime and it definitely has reached my top 10, I also find it very amazing how an anime with only 25 episode is up to par with all the other mainstream and ultimately popular anime like naruto.\

    This is a review for both Season 1 and Season 2 of Attack on Titan, as I give both of them 10s across the board.\
Let me first start by saying that I was very hesitant to watch AoT because of all of the mixed reviews it has. I've heard AoT be praised, and I've heard it be trashed. But fortunately, I can confidently say that it is such an incredible anime, and ANY anime fan should watch it as soon as possible!\
Story: 10\
For some reason, I've heard people say that AoT doesn't have a plot, but that is silly to say! That would be like\
          \
        watching a zombie movie and stating that the movie didn't have a plot. The whole point of AoT is to discover more about the titans, and, more importantly, eliminate all of the titans so that humans can live peacefully outside of the walls again. The plot is actually quite deep and heartfelt, and without spoiling anything, the supernatural twist in this anime is VERY creative and definitely surprised me.\
Art: 10\
The art style and overall animation in this anime is godly. This is probably the second best animation / art style of any anime I've seen, only being surpassed by One Punch Man for me. But this anime is so beautiful to look at because of the vibrant colors. Also, the titans look quite terrifying! The art definitely adds a LOT to the anime.\
Sound: 10\
Again, a masterpiece. The intros and outros are extremely catchy, and the overall soundtrack is beautiful, creepy, and unique. It definitely captures the scene of the moment effectively, and definitely makes you FEEL something. That definitely isn't an easy thing to do, but unsurprisingly, AoT nails it!\
Character: 10\
Okay... Here's where things really get real. The characters in this anime are so damn good. I'll mention a few of them, but won't reveal much about them because of spoilers. But trust me, a lot of the characters have heart-felt backstories, and they are all really easy to love. Also, the villains are really unique and interesting, since there is no specific or particular one.\
Eren: Our main character that has a burning passion to kill titans, and to see all of the beautiful things that he has heard about outside of the walls. After all, it IS humanity's birthright. Decided long ago that he wanted to join the military.\
Armin: Eren's best friend. An intelligent, passionate character who is always looking to protect the ones he loves.\
Mikasa: Eren's adopted sister / best friend. A badass female lead who really knows how to get things done. Like Armin, she vows to always be by Eren's side.\
Levi: Arguably the best and most badass character in AoT. He is a total neat freak and loves cleanliness, but doesn't play around when it comes to titans. Humanity's greatest soldier. You won't see much of him until later, but just keep this in mind.\
Enjoyment: 10\
All of these things combine to create the beautiful masterpiece known as Attack on Titan. There are very exciting and surprising moments that will put you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is great, and there aren't any boring moments. This is just one of those anime that you will want to binge watch because of how good it is, and also because it has quite a few cliffhangers.\
Overall: 10\
Of course I have to give this anime a solid 10. It's one of my favorite anime, after all. I think that there are some anime that are better, but this is still a masterpiece. I absolutely can't wait for Season 3. A lot has happened and I hope that the anime will have an excellent conclusion and the one that it deserves. Watch it. Ignore the haters that say that this anime is overrated, because in my opinion, it isn't. But you be the judge.\

    This anime is good. Very very good. I feel as though it's more unique than anything coming out recently. I didn't read the manga. \
Story: 9/10 \
Okay, so the whole \"humanity is threatened by very powerful force, seemingly untalented young looking boy some how saves the world\" thing isn't new. We've seen this before. But, the delivery makes it so great to watch. It's not dystopian, like so many of this plot line, but it's not quite past, either. It's like an altered present- things that exist now do not exist because of the Titans and their impact on human history. It is very\
          \
        gory, beware of that. However, I found it tolerable and pretty necessary to the story. This anime has many facets to it's plot- action, drama, a little bit of underlying romance. One thing I found interesting was it was written with a lot of open ends, like they were anticipating a second season ( and if there wasn't a second season being released, this would be a major flaw). Overall it has a pretty uneven pacing throughout, slow sometimes, fast others. Some people really don't like that however, I thought the down time was usually pretty well used. \
Art: 10/10 \
This is drawn in the style of a manga- lots of visual shading, dark outlines around the characters. Mostly in still shots/close ups. It has beautiful and incredibly drawn backgrounds, and overall i thought the art was very detail oriented. I was very impressed.\
Sound: 8/10 \
It was good most of the time, distracting other times, added to the suspense other times. Overall, the sound was pretty average. \
Character: 8/10 \
This gave us pretty good character development for an action anime, but still, as with many of this genre, it left me wanting more. I can't say it didn't have any, because it definitely did, but I place a lot of importance on character development and this did not totally deliver for me. \
Overall: 9/10\
I really liked this, truly. The story is compelling, the characters are great, and the art is gorgeous. It was definitely not something I loved so much I binge watched, but I did like it. I would recommend this to someone who likes action but doesn't want to sacrifice plot! \

Story: 9\
The story is quite simple but very unique. A 100 years prior to the story humanoid creatures called titans enslave the human race so the hominids builds wall to keep their self safe from the creatures\
and so the story begins a 100 years after the incident with our main character Eren Yeager and is adopted sister Mikasa one day Eren\

Art: 10\
Art is really unique and animation is on point\
Sound: 10\
The music is well placed and i had the feels every time there was a dramatic scene because of the music. The voice acting is superb i watched the show subbed because i wanted the original impact. The voice go well with every characters and never felt awkward.\
Characters: 8\
Most of them were good but i had a little bit of problem with some of them were untouched we did not have back story for most of them and it made me sad i really wanted to know the back story of Reiner Braun and Sasha. Like i said previously the voice acting is really good and never misplaced.\
Enjoyment: 10\
This anime is a breath of fresh air and every anime fan should watch this amazing show i never felt bored and i watched all the 25 episode on a 2 days period it has little problem and very worth your time\

    So, humanity (or at least the people in the near geographical area) has locked itself inside a fortified city to protect themselves from titans, gigantic humanoid monsters that eat people. The story takes place around a guy and his friends as they train to become rangers. A decent foundation for a good anime, right?\
The problem is that the epicness is never properly built up and the characters are all shallow stereotypes. There is no real character development, no person you begin to connect with and no personal storyline that grips you. The ones with potential are fumbled away and instead we get drawn out battles\
          \
        that try to showcase how cool the characters are, but instead are only boring.\
You see, the thing that made shows like Hunter x Hunter or Trigun great is that they focused on the characters and this made the battles interesting. There was always something at stake and you cared about the outcome. Shingeki no Kyojin has too many characters to pull this off and the result is a show that can be best described as \"Meh.\"\
A good comparison would be with Claymore. That show also has epic battles with monsters, detached and tragic characters and a lot of psychology and philosophy. It seems that Shingeki no Kyojin tries to be the same, but falls short in its attempt to ante up. Instead it spreads out too thin and what could have been a great anime becomes a mediocre one.\
Should you see it? Well, if you have the time and you want to see what it's all about. You might be one of those who think it's great. But if you want a bit more from your anime, pass this one and look for something with more substance.\

    Shingeki No Kyogin is honestly one of the most hated and loved anime of all time.\
The reaction towards this anime is very mixed.\
This anime is either raised to Game of Thrones level put down to Thomas And His Friends level.While I admit this isn't the greatest thing ever made,you should  see this before you die.\
Lets start off with\
The Elements (    9.5 /10)       \
               The thrill and excitement.It gets a 9/10 from me.Attack on Titan is an unpredictable anime in general.All hope\

        seems lost,and we're left thinking 'How are they gonna make it through this'.As more and more obvious options close,everything is solved in a very unexpected manner.There are a few moments wherein when the tension dissipates,viewers realize they were gripped.they cover up most of these moments with the pace.But the fact that they couldn't have done it without the complimentary pace. 9/10\
               The Action and 'awesome moments' : The action is over the top.The action             scenes are choreographed and animated well and they give off a feeling of epicness.10/10\
               The Drama : There wasn't supposed to be much drama,but when there is drama it really is intense.The drama could be anger,sadness or any human emotion.The emotions are placed in sync with the situation as well.They really capture human psychology very well.9.5/10\
               Tragic moments : The drama isn't very tragic overall.But the death scenes are heart wrenching.Complimented by a slow pace.9.5/10\
Story (9):\
              Concept and Theme : The theme is about creatures callled giants wiping out 9/10 of the human race.The humans are trying to resist.This isn't very original.The theme isn't very deep but its deep enough to be called decent.The concept of 3 dimensional motion equipment,which is the battle system in AoT, is quite creative and realistic.The gas propels users forward and the users will be able to move in 3-d by anchoring nearby objects.(9/10)\
                  Depth : The story is reasonably deep but not very deep.It has no plot-holes.That being said it is somewhat deep but coincidental.The story lies somewhat on the margin of plot and character driven ( 9/10 ).\
                Execution and pacing: The writing is really good.Now I\"m about to say something you guys should fully read before marking this review not helpful.The pacing compliments the mood.This is strange cuz fast pace compliments gore,and the pacing is slow.Well,AoT is alot more than gore.Sure,the presence of gore enhances the the visuals,but the slow pace is required to increase the tension and it keeps the viewers gripped,and as mentioned before,covers up potential boring moments.The pace was also used to 'expand upon characters.Also,tragic moments and drama are better done slow.(9/10)\
Characters (8.25/10):\
          Development : Not many besides the main cast receive much development.\
MC gets some development towards the end.Female Protag and the Deuteragonist get some development in the first half.(8/10)\
         Execution   : Well,the execution of the characters are excellent.The anime portrays each character well.Some characters are a bit cliche,but those points will be dealt with in the cliche section.However,some characters are killed off too soon,which is a big downside.  (8/10)\
         Depth :  The MC isn't one dimensional,but not 3 dimensional either.Something like 2 dimensional .The female MC and Deteuragonist is pretty one dimentional though,and,so is the rest of the cast.The 2 main members of the supporting cast is reasonably deep though(7/10)\
        Appeal : All the characters are appealing to viewer and all have their unique personalities.They also fill certain roles.Some people of the second group of side cast aren't very appealing,while the rest of them are adored.(10/10)\
Sound:(10/10)\
      Nothing much to be said here but a perfect 10.The OST's and ED's will not be skipped(10/10).The bgm and voice acting is to notch(10/10).In this aspect it is perfect.\
Visuals ( 10/10)\
         Art : The art style is suited for the premise.While it isn't too realistic,it reaches the exact amount of realism needed.\
         Animation : The visuals are simply amazing.They are very sharp and enhances viewing experience,especially the action.\
Minor :(9/10)\
       Realism fluctuation : The anime is very realistic.A few fluctuations are necessary for plot progression though(and for a solution to WTF moments)(10/10)\
      Originality and cliche's: The theme isn't very original on the surface.Some of the characters are cliche' on the surface,but not so cliche' it makes you roll your eyes.MC is only a bit something like 10% generic,the Female protag and Deteuragonist are 30% cliche'.and the rest are like 20% cliche'.(8/10)\
Enjoyment : (10/10)\
        I thoroughly enjoyed the series.It was very intense,somewhat emotional at times with lots of surprises and WTF moments.I watched everything in this series squealing,open-mouthed,name it.Enjoyment-wise,outstanding.\
Overall (9.34/10) : SnK is an outstanding anime,while flawed,it is definitely an anime to be taken seriously.Some call it overrated,and it is true,but overrated =/- bad.This is an amazing anime which simply is a gem of an anime.Well,I gave it a rating of 9.34 out of 10. Lets just hope season 2 is as good.I do hope so.\

    Let me just start this review off by saying: Attack on Titan is NOT THE greatest anime in the history of all anime. It's a solid fact, because people are constantly making more animes and creating new ideas that are always better than the last, that's just how we are. Now, is it an anime with amazing story, fantastic art and character design, plot and character development that tries not to state the obvious, great sound, and did I enjoy it? Yes. But that means it was indeed an amazing anime, not the Messiah of the anime world. Anyways, I suppose I made my point\
          \
        there and I can move onto the review.\
Story 10/10 - Just by looking at this anime you can tell it has an amazing story. The sheer fact they're making another season proves that this anime was not rushed and took its time with creating the story to fit the manga. I love that it doesn't \"state the obvious\" or gives you a form of irony where the watcher knows something the characters don't, this entire anime loves to toy with the watcher and keep them guessing. Not to say all the details are kept hidden, but that is definitely something that makes this anime worth watching. I will warn you though, it does get grotesque at times so watch out for that, but that is yet another reason why this anime is as good as it is. It's the nature of it that gives it depth and emotion.\
Art 10/10 - Being an artist myself, I can say this art was simply beautiful. The animators obviously took a lot of time and effort into making this series, so the next time an anime sequel takes too long for your interest, keep in mind those animators are working dirt hard for your sake and the watchers sake. Not only was the animation amazing but the backgrounds were also amazing as well. Overall, the art in this anime was obviously taken into consideration greatly and it was one of the first things I noticed when watching it for the first time.\
Sound 9/10 - Openings and endings all good, but I think what impressed me most was the ost songs used in the anime, especially in the first episode. It was one of those animes where sound played a big role in setting the mood. For an anime that had so much going on in so little time, sound was a must-have for this series. \
Character 10/10 - Characters were all amazing, and easily attachable which is what makes this anime so good and emotional. It's this type of \"kill or be killed\" anime with lovable characters that are on the brink of extinction, which always gives you the lingering paranoia that something might end up happening to them. All of them have unique back stories, whether they be tragic or not but either way, all of the characters seemed well thought out and interesting in themselves.\
Overall, I did enjoy this series and while I don't believe that it particularly needs the amount of bravado it gets while other really good animes go unnoticed, I do think that fans aren't wrong for thinking that Attack on Titan is a really great anime with plenty of story and character to show for it.\

    Overview: Chances are if you watch, or know anyone who watches anime, you've heard of this one. Shingeki no Kyojin (or Attack on Titan) got crazy popular extremely quickly, and it's really no surprise why: the animation is absolutely beautiful, and the story picks up with a frantic pace right off the bat. However, despite this amazing introduction, there are significant flaws holding this anime back from being a masterpiece.\
Story: 30/37\
The actual story of Shingeki no Kyojin is... well, a lot better than it sounded to me at first. While the idea of mankind being held in check by some alien force is not in\
          \
        any way new, this series handles it extremely well, and really can make you paranoid at times. That is to say, the titans, for the most part, really do feel threatening. Unfortunately, there are some major pacing issues in this anime. Shingeki no Kyojin starts out pretty fast paced, while still giving you adequate information to understand what's going on. That's not easy to do, and it does that very well. However, after the first half of the “first season”, things go downhill. There are some great moments scattered throughout the episodes filling up the middle and latter sections of season one, but there just aren't enough to justify how slow some things seem to get done. Fortunately, this is remedied towards the end of season one with the introduction of a few great characters, and some key story-line points that, actually, make a lot of sense and are well done. However, season two continues this offense by starting out great, ending good, but not having good meat in between point A and point B. The idea is that all humans are confined to one massive city surrounded by three circular walls, with parts of the city in between each wall. This being said, the area of this really can't be that massive, and when, in season 2, they announce what their goal is, it feels pretty easily accomplished. However, in the remaining 10 episodes of the season, they never even get reasonably close to reaching this, and instead are sidetracked, although I will admit that at least the sidetracking is important and relatively well done. If this review is making me sound like I hate the story, I don't. I think it's one of the better stories as well as good story-telling for MOST of it, but there are just some parts that feel extremely rushed or extremely slow, for little to no reason.\
Characters: 23/37\
Well, here is the single reason I don't like this show that much, and it shows by how many points are being docked. I would be lying if I said there weren't any fantastic characters in Shingeki no Kyojin, because most of the side characters are good, Mikasa Ackerman, one of the three main characters, is fantastic, and everyone's favorite: Captain Levi is also a great character. Unfortunately, this possibly good total cast is absolutely ruined by the main character of the series: Eren Yeager. Now, I have watched a lot of Slice of Life genre anime, and many of those are known for having awful, dense, un-interesting male leads, but Eren Yeager is in his own league. At lesat characters like King Joffrey from Game of Thrones are fun to hate. They are genuinely amazing parts, just evil characters. Eren is not fun to hate. He's annoying, constantly feels like he needs to get angry at everything, and thinks he's just going to do whatever he wants whenever he wants. It's absolutely childish and painful to watch. To make matters worse, the third of the trio of main characters, Armin is also annoying and whiny. Granted, both of these characters get SLIGHTLY better, but I will never be able to think of either of them as anything but annoying bitches unless some serious development goes down. As if all of this isn't enough, the worst part about it all is that the third main character, the female lead is absolutely great, and always goes out of her way to help Eren out of his own messes. And what does she get? Not a SINGLE, not ONE, thank you for the entire 26 episode series. Eren just brushes it off like he's entitled to her and deserves nothing less than to be pampered by his loyal friend. Enough about Eren though, the rest of the characters are pretty good. The aforementioned Mikasa Ackerman is a very good character, as well as Levi, once he's introduced that is. There are other great ones, but none worth mentioning.\
Art/Sound: 25/25\
Honestly, if I put more of an emphasis on animation quality than character development (which, in my opinion, would be pretty dumb), Shingeki no Kyojin would receive a vastly different score. For every flaw in character quality, the art and sound makes up for it. This series has by far the best soundtrack in anime, and has probably the best animation I have ever seen, even trumping the June 2014 anime that I am currently watching. I cannot say enough good things about the animation quality, sound or art, so I won't, and I'll let you see how awesome it is.\
\
Romance: 0/1\
This section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\
Overall: 78/100\
Shingeki no Kyojin rubs me the wrong way, so take this score with a grain of salt, but I think that the show is incredibly over-rated and needs to get the Sword Art Online treatment a bit. Everything about it is so awesome... except arguably the single most important things such as good pacing, or even bearable characters. If you can get past the main character, Eren Yeager, you will most likely enjoy this show vastly, as that alone would probably add 10 points onto the score.\
Deductions in points from the score are my attempt at being as objective as I can, but they will be listed here in case anyone reading this cares more or less about anything I take points away from:\
-The story has some minor, but still jarring pacing issues, and there are some parts that don't feel well put together\
-Eren Yeager is an atrocious character, and never should have existed let alone as a male lead.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin's reviews are not at all consistent. Depending on who you ask they will either love the series or absolutely hate it, so if you're going to take anything from my review it's that you should try it for yourself. \
Getting to the actual review, now: I give the entire first season of this anime a 7 and honestly feel like a 7 is what it deserved.\
Why?\
First off, the pacing. SNK is one of the slowest animes I have ever experienced. Its arcs span an unnecessarily long amount of episodes and barely get the story that far in the end. Its pacing was\
          \
        completely horrible considering it got 25 episodes. I'm guessing this is because the manga isn't finished which is completely understandable. However, by the end there were no plans to make a second season and the anime viewers were left incredibly confused and full of questions (then they turned to the manga where they were left were even more questions).\
Second off, inaccuracy. One of the biggest issues manga readers had with this anime were the inaccuracies (mostly around the end of the anime) when it came to comparing the manga and anime. I know what you're thinking now, \"Animes can take different turns! Who cares!\" But, said inaccuracies even angered the original creator Hajime Isayama so you know that these will probably end up ruining major events or character development later on. \
Now let's get to the anime itself. The story? While interesting, like I said before, it has very slow pacing and will barely get watchers anywhere. Not at all a good standalone anime and it would probably be better as one of the bulky animes with 100+ episodes. It does a good job getting new readers for Isayama's manga though. I give it all a 7. \
Art? While it looks strange with its thick lines initially, the art style grows on you. The animation and art in general aren't disappointing in the least and it's almost surprising finding such a popular anime without girls with huge boobs and people with strange hair. I give it a 9.\
The background music and the voice acting (Japanese) were all great to me. I don't like the English dub (or what I heard of it) so much, but it's not exactly \"horrible\". The background music added perfectly to the feel of the rash and intense situations. I especially enjoyed the openings and the ending song gives it a strange, nostalgic, eerie feel that I also enjoy. I give sound a 9. \
Character. There are so many characters in SNK and character deaths come easily because of it. Eren Jaeger is as intense, angry, determined, and merciless as the series is and I think he makes a pretty decent main character. However, the girl who often follows beside him, Mikasa Ackerman, is barely given an explanation for why she is so attached to him and her background and Eren's background feel very unexplored in the anime and I hope they are explained more in the manga or the second season. Armin, who is the third main character, doesn't really make an interesting main character at all. In fact, I'm so unsure of why he's considered a main character at all (besides being Eren and Mikasa's friend) and understand why he's always switched out for Levi in promo art and merchandise. I can only hope that he does some major development later on because he seems like he could be very interesting. I give character a 7. \
And lastly, did I enjoy SNK? It was long. It was long and I hated how long and slow it was (though I did expect them to take more time on an arc that luckily lasted only around 3 episodes or so) which really killed it for me and how it just ended. The ending was strange and unfulfilling because instead of solving a HUGE issue/mystery in the series it somewhat solved a new one they found in the last arc. However, I had people to talk to about the  anime while it was ongoing so that kept me entertained waiting for the new episode so I could say that I did enjoy it. Did I enjoy it enough to recommend it? Well, I'd only recommend this to someone who was new to anime. Mostly because of the mixed feelings that many people have with SNK and whether or not it is a quality anime, and also the fact that it's very popular and well known so anyone who is experienced with anime has probably heard of it and can make their own decision to take part in it. I don't believe everyone should experience this if they feel like they wouldn't enjoy it. \

    It's really hard to write a review in this anime, because it's my favorite, but I'll try my best. \
So attack on titan follows the story of humanity's battle for survival against these nusty creatures with funny and creepy faces called titans. Titans are humanoid type beings that eat people for fun just because they're bigger than them. And that's the idea of the anime. But the best part except from the amazing soundtrack, the beautiful art and the well-built (in my humble opinion) characters the best thing about this anime is the feelings it gives you. You start to wonder what whould you do\
          \
        in their place and how whould you react. Attack on titan is not based on super-humans that can kill titans without any problem, I think the fact that no one is safe there makes it special and you know that it's a life or death endless battle that even the best of bests can fall. \
(oh god I really love it, sorry) \
So I'm gonna rate the anime now, but it's really hard to find any flaw. \
STORY: 10 \
I really love the concept and the story is just amazing. \
ART: 10 \
The first thing that I loved about the design of the anime, except the colours, the titans and the sights was the eyes. Srsly you can see the whole universe in Eren's eyes. \
SOUND: 10 \
The soundtrack is extraodinary gives you chills and put you in the mood of the anime. (the mood of crying) \
\
CHARACTER: 10 \
Even if sometimes they make me wanna hit them in the face with a tree, I really love them. You wanna know what happens to every single one even if they're not the main characters or not. \
ENJOYMENT: 10 \
I don't think I need to say something here. \
OVERALL: 10 \
watch it and you'll understand what I say. Except if you don't like it then you won't, but that's okay! ",

    WARNING: Due to the nature of this anime, Hinting a few things could not be helped while addressing some pros and cons during this review. With that said, I shall call out a minor SPOILER ALERT before I start this review. This review should be fine if you are at the halfway point or have already seen the entire thing.\
\
Critic’s Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2014. Review #90: Attack on Titan\
\
There is an anime convention that I attend on an annual basis known as Sakura-con. When I went there in 2013. Sword Art Online was heavily promoted and it was becoming popular at the time.\
          \
        I found it to be a complete clusterfuck. Earlier this year, This anime was also heavily promoted and is still is one of the most popular and one of the more talked about recent animes of this current decade. Do I really need to explain more? You know it, it’s ATTACK ON TITAN!\
\
Several hundred years ago, Humanity was on the brink of destruction because of giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by enclosing themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants. In present time,  the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. That all soon changes when teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific… Okay, I will stop there just to be safe.\
To be technical, Attack on Titan (sometimes alternatively called “Shingeki no Kyojin”) is a Wit Studio production and this is actually their first production and this is an impressive looking series for starters. If you are familiar with the studio Production I.G. Wit Studio was founded by producers from that studio. Production I.G. has gotten quite a great reputation with production values, which is no surprise if you try out or seen Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. As for Attack on Titan, The animation is really good in this show. However, there are two little problems I had with the animation. Some of the CG in this show is kind of hit and miss but there are some areas where it is not an issue for me. The main issue I had in the animation leans more during the first half. The show had weird timing in pausing its animation. I did discover that there were changes made in the DVD/Blu-ray release to fix certain mistakes from the TV broadcast. but even with the changes made, there still was some moments where it pauses, even when there’s dialogue going. It is a little odd to see things play out like that and this is a noticeable flaw in the animation. If you think that’s bad, the Berserk TV Anime had the same problem years ago. For this being a start from Wit Studio, this was one hell of a start.\
The music by Hiroyuki Sawano is an interesting case. I have not seen other animes that he did the soundtrack to but for Attack on Titan. The soundtrack kicks ass. For a show dealing with Giants and humanity fighting for survival, the music does compliment the show. When it’s thrilling, the soundtrack makes a nice bonus, when things get bad, a chorus might come in to make things sound pretty big. When it gets emotional...Damn, it can hit some people hard. The soundtrack to Attack on Titan is one of its strengths. Now here’s where the real fun begins.\
\
When voice acting is concerned, this is probably the one thing that has split opinions for most American anime fans. With the Subtitled Version. Yuki Kaji is probably ending up being well known for voicing Eren and it’s not really a bad role. I haven’t seen much animes that he plays a role in that much but with Eren… He does pull off the intense, angry moments pretty well… As for the entire performance. It’s good to say the least but not phenomenal. As for Yui Ishikawa, she is a wonderful Mikasa and it is probably going to be her most memorable role for quite a while until something comes up I guess. Then there’s Marina Inoue as Armin. The voice is good on its own nothing much to say there. There are any noteworthy seiyus outside the main cast. There’s Hiroshi Kamiya as Levi…The voice was pretty cool, if there is one seiyu that I did not like in this anime, it’s Romi Park as Hange. The voice was a little deep for someone like her.. The Japanese cast is pretty average but has some well played performances from the main three leads. As for the Dubbed version, I can honestly say that Bryce Papenbrook is not a bad voice actor, but when I heard that he was picked to voice Eren. I was skeptical, I thought to myself “How is he gonna pull it off?”... Well, as I watched the dub, his performance of Eren will take a little getting used to. As the show progresses, he actually proves his worth. As for Trina Nishimura, I thought this was an interesting choice since Mikasa was the one voice that I was actually a little worried about in regards to the dub. Well, I got to rest assured because Trina Nishimura actually plays Mikasa pretty well on her own without having to rely on a unique flair that Ishikawa-san gave on Mikasa. No objections here. Now I get to the point with Josh Grelle as Armin, out of all the main leads. Funimation really took the most liberty with Armin’s voice. But in the long run, Josh Grelle was fantastic as Armin. Inoue-san was not a bad Armin at all, but I have to give some credit where it is due. Josh Grelle’s take on Armin was the biggest surprise in the dub and his performance felt believable. Kudos to Mike McFarland for his ADR direction… It may not be a perfect dub persay, but it is nice to see a cast list that is mostly from Funimation but with a couple special additions outside their talent pool… One being Jessica Calvello who probably got the most fun part of the show with Hange Zoe. Another interesting choice was Matthew Mercer as Levi. Seeing as Levi was the most popular character in the show, I get the feeling Funimation knew they couldn’t screw up the role, and the voice is also cool. Hiroshi Kamiya may sound a little badass with Levi, but Matthew Mercer sounds just as cool as well. You can’t go wrong with either version on this one, and I also can say that Attack on Titan may be worth seeing Subtitled but if you give the dub a little getting used to. Chances are you might enjoy the dub too. I will say that it all depends on tolerance with certain voices. I’ve already stated that I don’t like Hange’s Japanese voice but I love her English voice as well as that Bryce Papenbrook took me a while to get used to while Yuki Kaji was easy to adjust to. Both versions (in my opinion) are both listenable. This really boils down to preferences. The only issue with the dub is the adaptive script. It may have taken some liberties but it often had some moments that were not broken dialogue-wise and yet the adaptive script has some changes on some of those key moments… It is a minor nitpick overall but performance wise, it’s still good.\
\
Now let’s see, what am I missing? I mentioned Animation, the soundtrack, the voice acting... Ah! Son of a bitch! I missed one part when I brought up the soundtrack! Well, I think now’s the best time for me address it. What would that be? Oh, I don’t know….But I sure as hell know for sure that once you hear “Seid ihr das Essen? Nein, wir sind der Jäger!”. You will not forget it. That first opening theme “Crimson Bow and Arrow” by Linked Horizon is so overloaded with awesome and it is one hell of an opening, it is rather depressing that after 13 episodes, it…changes. And the second opening “Wings of Freedom” also by Linked Horizon is... just as good\
\
As awesome as the first opening is, the second opening fits the tone considering what is to come. Even though the first opening is short-lived, the second opening does not disappoint. As for its closing themes, the first closing theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa is kind of a nice contrast with the first opening and it fits considering that Mikasa is heavily focused in that closing theme. Like the openings, there also is a second closing theme which is “Great Escape” by cinema staff. The song is not a cup of tea I would finish but I don’t think the song is bad, it’s a little underwhelming out of all the themes in the show. The opening and closing themes really stick out in this show.\
Out of all the things Attack on Titan, it does have one major weak spot. The characters. Now this is going to be a doozy. I will save the main three leads for last because I can… My major problem with Attack on Titan is how it utilizes its minor and supporting characters (save for a few that are connected with the main three) I will not go into much detail because it often leads into spoilers but I can say that the way the minor characters are treated wears out fast after a while. Sasha is funny at times and Levi is a badass for sure but if there’s a character I did like that was not a main character, it would be Jean. He was not bad for a rival character (as stereotypical as it sounds). I grew to like the guy along the show’s progression. With all that said, let the heated topic begin. Armin Artlet is a bit of a whiner which may irritate some viewers but I gave him the benefit of a doubt and I actually didn’t mind much of his whininess as the story progressed. He may be the “brains” of the main three but there is some ups and downs I have with Armin but I grew to like his character in the long run to an extent. Mikasa is actually a character I had mixed feelings about throughout the entire show.. She is cool for one thing but there’s just one problem I had, She felt like a “Mary Sue” to me. She was interesting when “Episode 6” kicked in but as the show went on, well... try to figure out why I think Mikasa is kind of a Mary Sue in the show when you watch it. She is not a terrible character to say the least, it would be nice if some things could be written to make her less of a Mary Sue. Now I did save the main character for last for a specific reason and that is because when I was jumping into the show. I have heard people ranting and complaining about this show’s main protagonist, Eren Yeager. It is obvious that I am going defensive over this, but I have my reasons. Eren often gets the bashing than other characters. In my opinions, the character interactions are pretty shoddy since most of the minor characters are there for a short time while the supporting characters do get some spotlight. As for the interactions with the supporting characters, some of them are done well and some of them should have been utilized more effectively instead of having a half-assed execution with its character writing. With Eren Yeager, he is often criticized for being too angry throughout the show… Allow me to ask this question,  Have you been paying any fucking attention while watching this show? I will admit that his impulse did get on my nerves, but that is besides the point. Eren does get angry in some moments, yes… But it actually has a purpose in the story. Now if I were in Eren’s shoes and I saw my mother being eaten and killed by a Titan, I would be distraught and greatly upset. I can understand why Eren is feeling this way after his mother died. That and him swearing vengeance to kill every single Titan. I bring these two up for a very specific reason, This happened when HE WAS A CHILD. As expected, he goes through emotional trauma after what he saw which makes his desire to kill all Titans... plausible. There is another thing to address but I have to say this differently because it is quite considerably a heavy spoiler, but if you’ve seen the show… You’ll know what I mean. There is a little thing called “Plot Armor”, all I can say is that it has a benefit and detriment, and that is all I will say on that. Anyway, I actually do not hate Eren the way some people do, but I have to be honest here…He has some flaws due to how he’s written. I still find his impulsive moments a little jarring but overall, he still has his merits. But still after all that said and done, I still find the characters to be the weakest part of the show. It is obvious that Eren, Mikasa, and Armin get the most attention but it is hard for me to care for some of the characters who only have a short time. The supporting characters were fine but I noticed some of them got a good amount of screentime than others which is why I had a bit of a problem with the character interactions with the show. The characters are a mixed bag but I will give them the benefit of a doubt if a second season gets made\
\
This leads me to the story of Attack on TItan. The show starts out strong and does take a while to pick up… Along the way, it does slow down a.bit only to pick up the pace once again. However, there is one thing that does get on my nerves with this show and it is those fucking cliffhangers. Now to its credit, there are other animes that have done this as well and it did get me coming back for more, good or bad. Now I think it would be fair to say that Death Note had its fair share of cliffhangers as well… Which is interesting because Tetsuro Araki directed the Death Note anime as well as Attack on Titan. Like Death Note, his direction on Attack on Titan also was stylized in an epically over-the-top fashion while retaining substance. Highschool of the Dead on the other hand had little substance because that show focused heavily on the action and style as well as Guns, Zombies, and plenty of fanservice such as Pantyshots, Tatas, you name it....The overstylized moments are often saved for the action and the 3D gear movements which I found alright, moments where scenes look a bit shaky during dramatic moments are where I found them a bit overkill. It is a mild nitpick but overall. Now there is one thing that I will commend Tetsuro Araki for doing is taking liberties on the overall story of Attack on Titan with this adaptation. I will honestly say that I found the story decent, as for the overall execution, that’s where the manga and anime differ. The anime adaptation is extremely faithful to its source material which is a nice thing. I say this because anime adaptations of ongoing manga tend to either make filler episodes or deviate from the original storyline and end it differently. Now the major difference between the anime and the manga is actually from the earlier episodes of the anime which is the reason why I threw in the little warning before I started the review. If the anime followed the manga from frame to frame throughout the 25 episode run… Episodes 3 and half of Episode 4 would have taken place in the middle of those 25 episodes. I found the manga quite jarring when Chapters 15 through 17 are concerned. I like how Tetsuro Araki took the liberty of placing it in its fitting placement in the overarching story. The anime’s execution has its flaws but it is not as half-assed as the manga was. It is not Tetsuro Araki’s fault at all, it’s Hajime Isayama, the creator and writer of the manga. Seeing as how the anime is extremely faithful to the manga, Tetsuro Araki is excused in my eyes. If there is another thing I will also excuse is the pacing. The overall execution may be off in some areas but the middle portion is often noted for being slow. To be honest, I personally didn’t have a problem with this. The only thing I could point out is that the pacing is unbalanced from time to time. That’s my only nitpick about it. However, in spite of that, there actually is one major problem I had with Attack on Titan. It is most of the second half’s execution. I did say that the anime has its flaws with this. Most of the second half is where I would label most of this at. I am afraid I can’t go into much detail but it does rinse and repeat in a couple of areas, except with differences. That’s all I could say really…Now since the manga is still going and the anime ran for 25 episodes with no conclusion but a halt, it is no surprise that a Season 2 is demanded by viewers. George Wada, the president of Wit Studio did state that a second season is definitely happening. It has not been fully confirmed and I will not be surprised if it happens, but I do hope that it does get announced.\
\
Before I reach my verdict,  I would like to address some supplemental info regarding this anime and everything else connected to it.\
Attack on Titan is available by Funimation, it is also available by Manga Entertainment in the U.K. and Mademen Entertainment in Australia. The manga by Hajime Isayama is available by Kodansha Comics USA, a light novel “Before The Fall” written by Ryo Suzukaze and illustrated by Thores Shibamoto is available by Vertical. Another manga which is outgoing at this time called “Attack on Titan: Junior High” by Saki Nakagawa is also available by Kodansha Comics USA as well as A manga adaptation of the “Before The Fall” by the same writer of the light novel but illustrated by Satoshi Shiki. The manga “No Regrets” written by Gun Snark and illustrated by Hikaru Suruga is also available by Kodansha Comics USA. The light novel “Harsh Mistress of the City” is available by Vertical. The manga spinoff “Titan Short Skits” (A.K.A. Sungeki no Kyojin) has not been released stateside for all I know but seeing as Kodansha is the publisher of everything Attack on Titan with Manga and light novels, I would not be surprised if it eventually comes into the U.S. If not, oh well... There is also a 2-part movie series of Attack on Titan which is not even fully released at the time I’m reviewing Attack on Titan but it is going to retell the entire show in 2 parts and I don’t see the point in this since the first 33 chapters of the manga were faithfully adapted in the show. There is also a live-action movie planned for Summer of 2015, and I don’t have much to comment on this until it’s released and so forth.\
Well... After much talk, it is time for my final verdict of this anime. It is without a doubt that Attack on Titan is a popular show and was a smash hit in 2013. It was hyped to colossal proportions and It has sold extremely well for both the manga and its anime adaptation, although the manga is making a shit-ton of money thanks to the anime which... did not disappoint me.\
That’s right, I was not disappointed with this anime. Attack on Titan was not perfect to begin with, the main characters were fine. Some of the supporting characters had decent screen time, some were just there. The story on the other hand I find kind of a mixed bag. It had some interesting ideas but it’s execution is hit and miss. What really works in the show is its animation, and the soundtrack kicks ass. It is also exciting and intense, but I can really appreciate this anime for a few things, Being faithful to the manga without going into filler or deviating from it. Changing a little of the manga’s narrative for the sake of chronology, and it also didn’t have fanservice.  Whether you like it or not. Attack on Titan is not over and a second season would be ideal because we do not need another infamous ending like Berserk. For what it is, I liked it but not in the way the hype was building it up to be. It is still a smash hit and it doesn’t have to be a Masterpiece for it to be awesome.\
\
With everything said and done, I give Attack on Titan a 7.6 out of 10, it is GOOD!\
\
Feel free to leave a comment, and if you want to salute Attack on Titan style…Go ahead Soldier!\

    Oh how I know I'm going to be going against the masses with this review. When I first watched AOT I was intrigued. What an interesting notion: the decline of humanity, being forced to live like caged animals behind massive walls to be safe from massive human-eating beings.....and that's where all of the good stopped for me.\
First off, we have the three main characters: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin.\
Eren (aka - mr. grumpy-pants who never stops yelling) seems to be an ideal character at the beginning, but as we move onwards through the series....where is the character development?! Come on!!\
Mikasa, is literally ms. perfect in every\
          \
        way. It seems this girl can do no wrong. She can do everything without even batting an eyelash. Enough said - irritating character due to her perfection. News flash - nobody should be perfect.\
Armin is the best out of the three by far. He's the classic bookworm. I don't have pretty much anything bad to say about him. \
\
One thing that really irritated me was that this is pretty much a military anime about fighting gigantic titans. The characters are in an ARMY and yet, they're disobeying orders left and right and I don't think that they were ever punished for doing so? What BS is that? I'm sorry, but it's true. Also, if it's based on military, I'm sure there should be some military strategy - NOPE. practically nothing. \
HOWEVER, all of this is not the fault of the animation team, they did the best with what they had to work with. They did a fantastic job with the animation. \
Last thing in the review I was attempting to keep short: FLASHBACKS!!! WHY. SO. MANY? - I remember watching an episode that was 3/4 flashbacks. Worst episode ever because there was 5mins of new content. \
My summary of AOT: Crappy storyline and characters hidden behind massive flashy battle scenes. \
OVERALL RATING (for me) = 3/10\
(based on all 5 sections) = 4.4/10\
\
EDIT: I have a few people asking me about the sound rating I gave for this series. The subbed version wasn't all that good, and when I tried the dubbed I was laughing so hard at the voices that I couldn't focus on the series. The 5 is just my personal rating. I did not enjoy the opening song, however it did suit the series, so the sound probably deserves a 7 overall.\

    Artstyle: Very inconsistent. Sometimes drawn very cool, full of action, other times so ugly, wrong anatomy. \
Story: starts out interesting, giants eating humans. Becomes very boring after a while because the only thing that happens is giants eating humans. They have a interesting plot but they stretch it way to much. \
sound: didn't bother me, nor did I notice anything special. I guess that's a good sign. \
I also like the intro. so sound is good (also when the titans snap the humanbones between their teeth it goes like crunch crunch :)\
Character: all characters are kinda dull. except for the 2 maincharacters because they seem\
          \
        to have killed a few robbers. and some personal stuff happened, but nothing big comapred to other animes.\
enjoyment: like i said, i liked it a lot, but now I really start to get annoyed, havign the feeling they are wasting my time. I want to know how the story ends, but every ep i watch nothing happens for already 5 episodes, so guess what. I'll drop it (at episode 15).\
overall: if you want to see some cool action shots, a no brain story, and lots of boring moments watch this. But don't expect the same level of the first episodes. \
This show started out awesome. I was really hooked, lots of action, tension etc. But then it starts to slow down. They start to reuse images from past episodes. Nothing wrong with that, but after seeing the same thing for 10 times it really gets boring. The intro also exist of 5 minutes of footage from the previous episode. They do a lot of flashbacks, or use old footage with a narrator saying some new text.\

    If you like short reviews - Just scroll down to \"Overall\"\
Story 8/10:\
If you're the type of person who loves giant naked people with no rude parts & blood, this is the right anime for you! I guess there isn't much of a plot. But, the suspense & fighting scenes made up for it. I'm not much of an action person, but this anime really hooked me up, since episode 1 (Dat suspense doe). This has a lot of violence/fighting scenes & blood from ofcourse, you guessed it, the titans & the team members!\
Art 10/10:\
The art is amazing, even though it's not like art of new\
          \
        anime. I like how the details of their faces when something bad happens, makes the characters look more realistic in the anime way. I just found one thing terrible (It's a spoiler so I won't say it) which reminded me of power rangers (not saying power rangers is bad though).\
Sound 10/10:\
I love the 1st opening which fits in with the storys theme so well. Just going to be honest with you - the 2nd opening sounded so crap, it sounded like a places national anthem & I don't get how that fits in with the story (in my opinion, ofcourse). The ost when theres fight scenes always hypes me up, they chose the ost well. A good scene matches well with good music. I remember watching this scene & the music was just so good, I got the chills.\
Character 10/10:\
I don't know why but people say that Eren is really annoying, I feel like he's fine. I feel like the characters are so real, that you can actually tell what their personality is. I have no arguments for the characters, they fit well in the story & they really are realistic, can't name a person who isn't. The story actually builds up the characters personalities & their personalities fit well in what they do in the story.\
Enjoyment 10/10:\
I really enjoyed this series (and ofcourse the vines made from this series). It made me feel like every episode is a cliff hanger & a titan apocalypse is the worst thing to happen. If you're the type of person to watch anime & copy things out of it, you probably shouldn't watch this. Slicing the back of tall peoples necks is a serious crime, you know.\
Overall 10/10:\
The series was really realistic, the characters, music, everything. Not much of an action fan, but I totally loved this series. The art was terrific, the way the details show when something bad happens reminds me of one punch man. The 1st opening, endings and ost are perfect, no arguments here. Excuse me while my head blows up because there's too much suspense (loved it though, if you love suspense or your just an M, you should watch this anime right now). And yeah, I guess this sums it all up.\

    Please, hear me out! This will be my first review on MAL, though I've been watching anime for a few years now. The reason I even decided to make this review is the overwhelming number of 9 and 10 scores that this show is getting in the reviews section. I feel that this is completely misleading to anyone who has not yet seen this series and is browsing through the reviews section looking for an honest review that has not been affected by the extensive hype of the show. \
Story:\
The story is well thought out (so far), with constant cliffhangers at ends of episodes making\
          \
        viewers want to watch more. Unfortunately, the first and last 5 minutes of each episode are the only engaging ones, as the middle of each episode seems to drift off into the hazy realm of nonsensical monologues and Armin pretending to be intelligent by saying stuff that should already have been apparent to everyone else. The pacing of the show is atrocious, with the 25 episode length easily compressible into a 12 episode format in my opinion. Also, **Sorta Spoiler... I guess?** NOTHING is achieved by the end of season 1 -_-. Seriously. The only thing that actually has changed in over 10 hours of show, is that Eren can (sometimes) transform into a Titan now... Other shows, such as Baccano! (A superb show in my opinion) are able to convey extremely complex and detailed and complete plots in a mere 12-13 episodes. I can only hope that season 2 will actually give us some answers instead of expecting us to just watch training exercises and wait for some story to develop eventually.\
Art/Sound:\
The art and sound are the two things that truly make this show outstanding, with the animation of the ODM gear combined with the intense, booming OST making for exhilarating action scenes. This show has a (semi) unique art style with the way it appears to lift the characters away from the backdrop with their black outlines, adding a ferocity to each character. The sound of this show is incredible, with the voice acting completely on point... IN THE JAPANESE VERSION! Please don't get me started on the English dub. While the range of voices available in the dub is impressive, I just cannot fathom how anybody taking part in the creation of the dub thought it would be a good idea to make almost EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER completely whiny, childish, immature, and generally useless sounding, while in the original Japanese voices, while it is apparent when characters are distressed (which is often), they never become completely whiny, always maintaining some minimal level of dignity. Eren and Armin in the English dub, on the other hand, cry for 90% of the show and I just can't bear to listen to Armin's constant cry/shouting.\
(I watched the show in English, then again in Japanese, hoping for it to be better. It was.)\
Characters:\
I already covered my extensive issues with the characters in the English dub, mainly their whiny and cowardly atmosphere. The characters in Japanese, however, perform well, providing credible performances and bringing character motivations (of which there are actually few and pretty generic ones at that) to life. The biggest problem is that the characters are not consistent, with certain characters being complete rebels at some times and then blindly following orders with their heads bowed at others. Also, so many characters are introduced that it is difficult to keep track of who is who, especially when the entire character selection is replaced every 5 episodes because everyone died (except the invincible main characters of course). The only redeeming character in the show is Mikasa (and arguably Levi, though he does not get alot of screen-time) and honestly, she is a pretty pathetic excuse for a character as well, with completely basic character motivations of protecting Eren and nothing else. The only reason she is liked is that she is the only character in the show who doesn't ever whine and actually does stuff (such as fighting alongside Mr. Sonic-the-Hedgehog-Levi in badass ways) instead of crying about how she will die soon.\
Enjoyment/Overall:\
Sadly, I CANNOT recommend this show to anyone who enjoys having explanations to things (as the first season ends with no more explanations than it began with) or enjoys having semi intelligent main characters who actually know what is going on and don't just \"overcome\" all their obstacles through brute force (Eren even fails at this on multiple occasions). It's difficult to understand the incredible hype around this show. I DID NOT make this review because I want to be a hipster, this is my honest opinion, stemming from my amazement of how this show exploded like it did, riding only on the back of a good soundtrack and animation style for an entire season of non-events.\
I give this anime a final rating of 6/10. -Fairly shoddy characters being carried by incredible animation and music.\
That’s it, folks,\

    \"What do you call a titan that can't swim?\
The Titanic!\" - Armin.\
Beware for a review filled with shitty jokes I found on the internet!\
Shingeki no Kyojin is currently the 3rd most popular series on MyAnimeList, right after the infamous Sword Art Online. However, Shingeki no Kyojin and Sword Art Online have one major difference...\
Shingeki no Kyojin actually deserves some of its hype!\
I am naturally a hipster douchebag so whenever someone tells me to watch something that's \"mainstream,\" I just naturally go like \"eh........\". One of my friends made me watch the first few episodes at his house, and I was like, \"Hey, it's pretty good.\
          \
        But not great or anything.\" After leaving his house, I didn't touch this show for months until just a few days ago, where I finally decided to finish this series. \
Damn son, this series. When my friend told me that there would be epic moments, he wasn't kidding! This series is chock full of epic battles and extremely emotional moments. The action scenes were amazing and dynamic, and I could see that this show was extremely popular for a reason, and it is definitely deserving of its praise. But is it the best show ever?\
Nah man.\
It's definitely one of the most enjoyable shows out there, and it is extremely easy to watch and just get absorbed into its world, but there are some points of the show that prevent it from being a masterpiece in my eyes.\
\"Making my way downtown. Walking fast. Oh, a titan. Walking faster. Running really fast.\" - Armin.\
Pros:\
- Great depiction of its world, you really get absorbed into it.\
- Very thrilling story, many will find it hard to peel away from the screen.\
- High quality art and animation!\
- Extremely emotional and impactful, the emotions of fear, hatred, and other feelings are expressed well.\
Cons:\
- Inconsistent pacing. Sometimes it's too fast, sometimes it's too slow.\
- Side characters are very forgettable.\
- Has no plot armor but also a crap ton at the same time.\
- Mysteries unexplained, although this is because 2nd season. Even so, this season could have shed more light on it.\
Story: 7\
Despite the story being really fun to follow and incredibly thrilling, the quality of the story itself is... hard to explain. One thing that this show does extremely well is the attention to detail of its world. It set up the depressing world very well, and the premise was hooking. The story includes a great mix of both intense action and great dialogue. The story is also really suspenseful at times, and you'll be on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. Really, the story itself is great! It really highlights the themes that the show is trying to convey. But it is the pacing that can somewhat ruin it. In the beginning of the show, the pacing was incredibly fast, things were happening left and right, and although this did help in supporting the hectic events in the beginning of the series, it didn't do much to help the normal dialogue and other events. However, the pacing of the series can also get incredibly slow, and I mean like turtle pacing slow. There is always a recap at the beginning of each episode, with some lasting 3 minutes. This makes any new content in these episodes last only around 18 minutes or less. So yeah, calling the pacing for these episodes slow is an understatement.\
\"If Gordon Ramsey was a titan, would he just spit us out and say 'THIS PERSON IS RAW' and throw out the other titans?\" - Armin. \
Art: 9\
Breathtaking art and animation, the only reason why this isn't a 10 is because sometimes it gets a bit lazy, especially during the slow paced scenes. Even so, this show depicts its world amazingly! Serene and beautiful at times, but deathly depressing as well. The action scenes and nom nom nom scenes were extremely detailed, which really made the impact of these events that much more powerful.\
\"We have successfully banned Eren from using the word 'Yolo.'\" - Armin.\
Sound: 10\
One of the best soundtracks in anime hands down! With the two famous hype generating openings, and the extremely epic OST, the intense moments of this series is taken to extreme heights. The voice acting is also really good, as it highlights the fear that the characters go through.\
\"Haters gonna hate. Potatoes gonna potate.\" - Sasha.\
Character: 7\
Now, I'm going to clarify this. Some people say that due to the extreme underdevelopment of the side characters that eventually die, their deaths become meaningless and aren't impactful. I say bullshit! Well, I agree somewhat. In terms of attachment to character, when these characters die, I don't feel heartbreak. But what these side characters do incredibly well is that they highlight the weight of a human life. Whenever they die, they don't deal a blow as a character, they deal a blow as a human. It gets incredibly depressing. Either blood is just spurting everywhere, or witnesses are crying their eyes out or are just stunned in complete shock and devastation. This show really highlights the fear that human deaths result in. While this doesn't replace the fact that most characters in this show are forgettable, and the main characters are still plot armored up the ass, it does redeem itself in the fact that the characters' deaths break your heart due to their weight as human lives. \
\"Marco, are you alright?\"\
\"No Jean, I am all left!\"\
Enjoyment: 10\
What can I say? This show was hella entertaining, thrilling, and impactful. It definitely ain't the best show I've watched, but it was definitely one of the most enjoyable to watch.\
\"Survey Corps? More like Survey Corpse! HAHAHAHA!!\" - Everyone.\
Overall: 8\
Shingeki no Kyojin is deserving of praise, that is for sure. For a show so hyped and popular, it still managed to satisfy me incredibly well. I highly recommend it to everyone!\
TL;DR: A world where \"Your Mom\" jokes aren't funny.\

Anyways let's talk about Attack on Titans. This show becomes so popular in the west that makes people forget One Piece and Naruto have ever existed. Popular things tend to not be the \"best\" things, but it is undebatable they always have aspects that are truly good and worth praising. That said, these good features tend to overshadow the flaws and problems\
          \
        that would otherwise be extremely obvious if we put them in a mediocre show. \
All constructive criticisms are welcomed and great appreciated via comment or PM. This is a rather critical review so my personal enjoyment is... not taken into account, for the most part. \
\
STORY (Concept 2/2, Execution 4/8) \
The concept of AoT is perhaps the major reason that led it to be a successful series. The universe uses a direct, simple yet effective theme: Humans are going extinct, the the cause is humans themselves. This idea is expressed in a very unique/generic (yes I know it's a contradiction) way by integrating a superb cliche idea of \"monsters kill humans\" with another superb cliche idea of \"humans kill humans\". When you put these two ideas together, it becomes unique and refreshing to look at. \
However, the execution has failed to explore this wonderful world. Within the walls, we are shown to many things including but not limited to kidnapping, corruption, abuse of power, racial inequality and many other things that are supposed to be impressive and amusing to know. The problem is none, none of these interesting factors have a real purpose other than making the audience feel amused. SHOCK FACTORS. I personally do not dislike shock factors, but at least there should be a purpose on the factor instead of just pouring in the factors for the pure sake of amusement. \
This anime is not finished, and I haven't read the manga yet. So far, the general trend is very straightforward. The first arc Crimson Bow, which talks about how the humanity defend a titan invasion and the second arc, Wings of Freedom, which tells a story of a group of people trying to \"find out\" the \"origin of titans\" are both reasonable, yet rather predictable arcs that successfully deliver the storylines to the audience without too much confusions. \
That said, some parts of the show are very terribly paced and absolutely unnecessary. Events occur just to flesh out some character background. In the first arc the pacing is horribly fast. It took Eren only 2 episodes to get to the cadet training camp and only 1 episodes before he first fights titans. Things are escalated so quickly. That may not be a bad thing, since many other shows such as Code Geass and Gurren Lagann all have super fast paced plot and they keep us excited. The problem with titan however, is that in the second half of the show, everything goes dangerously slow to a point of kind of boring. It took the show full 3 episodes to run to the forest and actually begins the quest. We've been seeing many character falling off the horse and half of the time is pretty lame and contribute little to the story. \
There were many unreasonable events that tells little about the story, at the same times waste solid, whole episodes screening time. In the cadet training camp for example, the potato girl's little interaction with the officer is... not funny, and that scene lasts for one and half mins. Yes, I agree that this scene kind of becomes titan's trademark, but still purposeless. \
Oh, and can someone tell me why there was a hand-to-hand combat training in the titan-killing-skill training camp? \
All in all, the story is slightly above average. It does tell a good story without making it boring, with the use of shock factors and filler scenes, it has a little bit of flavor to spice it up. \
\
CHARACTER (Design 1/2, Development 2/8) \
The cast is extremely generic. Which is fine since generic, unextreme characters tend to be the ones that appeal to the general public. The downside to that is they are forgettable. Very forgettable. They don't have any symbolic value like Edward in FMA or Spike in Bebop, they don't have anything other than their unique hair colors and given character treats. (yay pokemon!) \
Let's talk about the deaths that AoT is known for. From Eren's mom to the \"Elite Four\" serving Captain fangirl, although some do have symbolic meanings, most of them are just there purely for the shock factors. The death of Elite Four was mostly a shock factors because it contradict the popular belief of \"friendships and bounds creates victories\". Of course we can see it as \"resembling to the reality\", but it is inconsistent because the show itself is not a resemblance to the reality thus such thing should not be considered. It is just a shock factor.\
Now we can talk about the development of complex pokemons. Eren, we knows nothing about him other than he is angry. Sure at the end of the show he becomes more understanding and changes his belief, but he is still the same person as before. He did not develop to a more mature character or anything like that, he merely received some amount of flashbacks and does some 2Dimensional character flip flops. \
Mikasa. Why would you like her? She barely has any characteristic that makes her a legit person, she stays with her ideologies from beginning to the end. She has special episodes to describe her encounter with Eren and that's all it is. She is NOT a goddess of victory as she plays no part during any important events where Eren is in danger. \
The rest of the casts are all plot devices. They are there because the plot needs them to be there. They feel inhuman, they don't have any real development and they are seriously sometimes only 2D or even 1D characters. Really nothing to say much about it. \
The worst part of the characters is that, all of them feel like half-assed shounen characters that try to be something serious. They are essentially \"mature\" pokemons that have dark sides and actual brains. \
But afterall, some of the character treats are likable. It's rare to see a relatively independent female character like Mikasa, tho somehow she is overly attached to Eren so the fanboys can imagine... Yea I get it. But that doesn't make her a good character. \
\
Graphic (Art 5/5, Animation 5/5)\
If you are still with me by this point, I thank you to the sincerest. \
Art is great. The art style is very unique. Things such as the weirdly but appealing looking thickened character outlines that defies the current trend of \"everything in 3D\". 2D animation can also be just as beautiful. The extremely amazingly looking titans just grabs my eye like a magnet. At first I felt a little bit of absurd how all of them are naked, but eventually as I get used to them, I realized how most of them resembles typical mid-age male body shapes and how powerful they look. The art is also very consistent. There isn't any significant difference between the \"action scenes\" and the \"talking scenes\" in terms of art style and quality, unlike shows such as SAO, where the action scenes are refined but the regular talking scenes are stale and boring. \
The animation... gosh they are just good. Brought to you by the animation director Death Note, Guilty Crown and... high school of the dead *cough cough*, Tetsuro Araki, you will experience possibly one of the top 5 animation in anime existence. Aside from amazingly detailed action scenes during titan fighting, the use of different camera angle during the ordinary conversational scenes maintain the exciting atmosphere of the show's overall feeling. \
This is good. And good things need to be experienced. So I wouldn't talk much more, enjoy it yourself. \
\
SOUND (OP/ED 2/2, OST 4/4, Dub 1/4, Sub 4/4)\
The OP is one of the most engaging song I've heard for the longest time. It just fits the show so perfectly, and the complex but straightforward metal/vocal/orchestra mix creates really nice, glorious, solid soundtrack. It is worth mentioning that the rest of the song (the original, not just the 1:30) version is not nearly as good since it basically just repeats itself over and over to a point of dreadfulness. I've been listening to this song for months now and it is a bit irritating. The second OP is, in my opinion, just as good, or even better. The climax of the second some is a really nice melody that the first one does not have.  \
As for the ED... um... I never really listened to them all the much but they are also wonderful songs. (sorry about that :P) \
OST feels like those songs you often hear from historical films where people fight gloriously on the battlefield, that's exactly how it feels. When the plot is going under a darker and depressed mode, the song is calm, but without losing the excitement. They reminds me pacific rim's soundtrack which I love (it was the only good part of that movie). Notable tracks including but not limited to Vogel im Kafig, Doa, and The Reluctant Heroes are very well done. \
The dub. Funimation you lazy bastard is the only thing I have to say. They used the most overpraised voice actors who are clearly 50 years old to try speak in 16 year old tones. Come on, can't you at least do something like an real audition so the talented people actually get a chance to contribute their talent to the community? Why can't you learn from Japan and do the shit right? Watch sub if you don't mind reading, the dub can only be classified as \"understandable\". \
\
ENJOYMENT (10/10)\
AoT is my all time favorite action show. I completely enjoyed it, since the actions are truly amazing and not stupid. I was kind of disappointed about the character, but they aren't the focus so... Yea I'll let it slide. The story is fine, it does its job to carry the action. Very enjoyable series and easily recommendable to literally anyone. This is a really fun show to watch. \
\
OVERALL (8/10) \
Despite the lack of character development, this show does perfectly on what it tries to do. Since no one focus on the characters all that much, the action and music shine brightly. A solid 8 for what it has accomplished and the good features it has. This is one of the show that requires you to not overthink (like I did) and it certainly is a respectable piece of entertainment. \

    Love it Love it Love it. Every episode was amazingly thrilling and the whole story and plot of the anime was amazing. The characters were also very likable. The unexpected plot twists make the anime exciting to watch and makes me want to watch more. The art style is very nice and suits the genre and theme of the anime alongside the setting of the anime where they use cannons and swords. The way the anime immediately draws you in from episode one and keeps you from looking away. The anime is very unique in its perspective of going about doing things and the setting\

    Attack on Titan focuses on the story of three young protagonists: Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their mutual friend Armin Arlet.  In their world, humanity has been ravaged by otherworldly, humanoid beings known as Titans.  Titans look human, but make no mistake, they are anything but; they're giants that vary in height, they have -- in the words of one of the characters -- \"stupid expressions\" on their face, they're seemingly invincible, and they have no means of reproducing, yet continue to pop into existence.\
100 years prior to the story proper, the survivors of the initial Titan attacks created a\
          \
        series of 50-meter high concentric walls to retreat into.  The outermost wall is known as \"Wall Maria,\" the middle wall is known as \"Wall Rose,\" and innermost wall is known as \"Wall Sina.\"  The walls were created to add a defense-in-depth protection from the Titans, who now inhabit what's referred to as the \"outside world.\"  Within the walls, humanity has built numerous towns and cities, but by being closed off to the outside world, resources are scarce, and a class system has somewhat developed.  The lower-class live in Wall Maria, and the upper-class live deep within Wall Sina, which keeps them safer and better off than most of the population.  However, they'll soon find out the peace they've grown accustomed to is short-lived when an aberrant, Colossal Titan beams down from the sky to breach the Wall Maria.\
That's really all you need to know from a story standpoint, because to expand anymore would do more harm than good.  The strength of the show lies in its characterizations and plot development, so it's best going into it knowing as little as possible.  The pacing of the story starts off fast, and we see Eren, Mikasa, and Armin go from being powerless civilians to skilled soldiers in the span of a few episodes.  Then, from the moment they begin training, the scope widens and we're introduced to a variety of interesting characters.  Some characters only last a few episodes before either being killed off, or fading from the focus of the story.  But each character has a distinctive personality that separates them from your typical side characters.  The main trio is an affable bunch, and within a few episodes, you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their plight.  Eren, in particular, has such an intensity to him that it's hard not to get caught up in his emotional tirades.  On the other hand, Mikasa is the complete opposite, but her understated nature portrays a strong loyalty to those she cares about.  And while he’s not a focal point as much as the other two, Armin has moments that allow him to prove his worth.\
The series does not hold back on the violence neither, as Titans and characters alike are dispatched in some pretty gruesome ways.  That's not to say the violence is extreme; most of it is left to the imagination, but the impact a death leaves is somber and meaningful.  You'll find yourself lamenting the loss of minor characters because their death resonates throughout their friends and relatives.  Conversely, what's probably most surprising aspect about Attack on Titan is its ability to combine humor and drama in a way that neither undercut what the other is trying to achieve.  With most of the characters philosophizing about the limitations of humanity and their worthiness of survival, the appearance of characters like Dot Pixis, Hanji Zoe, and Sasha Blouse provide some much needed levity.  Without them and their character quirks, the story would probably be too bleak.  The series knew exactly when to ease up on the drama, and it was much appreciated.\
As mentioned earlier, the series wastes no time getting into the core of the story.  Then it slows down considerably, as episodes are crammed with indecisiveness, internal monologues, and a whole lot of flashbacks.  The material during those episodes is definitely fascinating, and allows for a good deal of character development (even from minor characters), but you can easily accuse the show of dragging its feet.  Attack on Titan does suffer from some pacing issues, but when it comes to postponing an inevitable conflict, Dragon Ball Z is the undisputed champ.  Interesting enough, the last few episodes of Attack on Titan are a perfect balance of exposition and action.\
The animation and art style is fantastic and highly technical.  The medieval-like setting is brought to life by beautiful backgrounds, and the combination of hand-drawn and computer-generated imagery.  The characters are designed exceptionally well, and you really a sense of their emotional state of mind just by looking at the subtle changes in their faces.  The Titans are visually frightening -- their bodies have strange proportions that make them look even more bizarre when compared to their human counterparts.  Everything's pleasing to look at, but the battle scenes visually stand out as the most memorable.\
Battle scenes are smooth and easily to follow, and they're enhanced by the usage of the character's main mode of attack - the aerial 3D Maneuver Gear, which is a set of gas-powered grappling hooks attached to a person's hip.  This gear allows its wearers to fly through the air and battle the otherwise impervious Titans.  They're the primary mode of attack against the Titans, but are practically useless in an open setting.  But when used in closed quarters, with tall structures to latch on to, they make the fights between the humans and Titans exhilarating.  And despite humans having the 3D Maneuver Gear at their disposal, aberrant Titans make for unpredictable opponents.\
Having never read the manga this is based on, I'm not sure how long the series can last.  Nevertheless, this is a must-watch for anyone who loves serious anime with a sense of humor.  It's far from perfect (despite perfect rating), but strong characters, crisp animation, and a very absorbing story ranks it amongst the best anime I've seen.\

    Story: Intense and thrilling as fuck. I've watched horror movies that have had me on less edge than this shit and thats a good thing. While at times a bit to shonen for my taste its constantly moving and constantly tackling issues the size of the titans themselves. Season 1 is a tad slow but ya'll probably watched slower.

    I loved the first few episodes of Shingeki no Kyojin but as the series went on I began to notice how slowly the story was unfolding, and although it was an exciting and gripping story, the rate at which it was given was disengaging to me.  The art is fantastic; however, it does not change much throughout the series and can feel bland at times.  But watching beautifully animated soldiers fly through the air slicing up enormous titans as blood sprays across the screen is wildly entertaining.  The soundtrack, although repetitive, is amazing and always puts the viewer in the right mood\
          \
        for whatever scene they are watching.  The theme song is nothing less than epic and is thrilling to hear before each episode.  I did like the characters in Shingeki no Kyojin, but they were pretty cliche and predictable, although Eren and Mikasa's relationship was intriguing.  This show is a good action/drama anime, but can be almost painfully slow at later points in the series.  I enjoyed watching it and may even watch it again sometime.  Shingeki no Kyojin is a good show but not a great one.\

    This is my first review so feel free to give some feedbacks.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the best anime in 2013 and one of the most popular anime all-time.Made by Wit Studio which is its best anime, I think this anime is one of the better anime I've watched so far.On the contrary, I think it's a little overrated anime.\
***This review may contain some spoilers***\
STORY (7/10)\
The story of Shingeki no Kyojin is a good story but with some drawbacks. Set up in a world with titans and with humanity struggling to survive against them is, for me, one realistic story for this show. The\
          \
        story begins with people living happily surrounded by big walls when, suddenly, one titan attacks them. People covered in fear, watching titans eat them, they try to escape from this. This beggining is the forte of this story. Showing the main character and his friends how they escape and most improtantly, how Eren(the MC) sees his mother being eaten by a titan is one of the best way to start this show. Then, the story begins to develop slowly. Showing the characters how they train or sitting on horses for many episodes isn't so great for people who want to see how the story continues. Last but not least I think that the story doesn't explain so much in this anime. It leaves the spectators with many questions unanswered.\
CHARACTERS (6/10)\
I've been a little bit dissapointed of these characters in this show. I will comment on the three main characters on this show. First of all, we have Eren. Eren, the main protagonist on this show, whose mother died in front of his eyes, swearing for revenge on the titans is, for me, the most irritating character in this show. His logic of wanting to kill all the titans and to be very angry on this subject after what he had experienced I found it a good point for his character. But they failed on his attitude. He is yelling all the time, he is immature and he has a big idea for himself. On some situations, he fails to think logically because of his idea of killing titans. The second character is Mikasa. Mikasa is one of the best fighters and she has the greatest abillites to kill titans. She is generally quiet but when it comes to Eren, she is very kind and protecfull to him. Unfortunately, she is, sometimes, so protectfull that when titans kidnapp Eren she rushes in to save him without thinking. That's the worst characteristic that she has. The last character is Armin. Armin is one of the most normal character in this show. In the first episodes, he is a crybaby and a chicken but he improves within the following episodes becoming brave and smart, helping his friends and teammates with the fight against the titans\
ART (9/10)\
The art was great on this show. The shapes of the titans were very orginal. The colours and their combination were very good. The design of the city and the walls, were, also, good. Last, the fight scenes and the moves were the best\
SOUND (10/10)\
The music was the best thing that the anime has to offer. The openings and endings were great. The soundtracks on the fighting scene were perfect for them and every soundtrack was suitable for its scene. The voice actors were, also, very suitable for characters.\
ENJOYMENT (8/10)\
This anime was good. I enjoyed it. It had the action and the drama that I wanted to see and the ideas of the anime were really good. I will recommend this anime to everyone who want to watch a show who has action, blood, drama and fantasy.\

    NO SPOILERS\
Story(8) There is a good plot, well-exploited, in a mediaval-like world but with advanced devices(the 3D maneuver). There are many plot twists in Shingeki no Kyoujin which make it very appreciable!\
Art(9) Compared to the manga, the style is the same but more clean. The colors suit really good and the animation is very flowing. It's very pleasant to watch!\
Sound(9) An excellent soundtrack. After watching Shingeki no Kyojin, it's really funny to notice that the openings and \"Armored Titan Theme\" are always in your head!\
Character(8) All the characters are useful in the story(trust me I read the scans). It's a shounen, so there are typical\
          \
        characters: the bad one, the funny one, the intelligent one, the happy one. In a nutshell, characters are classics even though, they're still pleasant to see evolving. The funniest is surely Eren, the protagonist, he always wants to kill them all, here the Titans( like most of the shounen protagonists). However, he isn't the most powerful guy in all history in comparison with the others characters in the shounen. This point makes Eren an interesting character.\
Enjoyment and Overall(9) It's simple, you'll want to know more after this, so wait the 2nd season or read the scans. (You'll also want to move with a 3D maneuver)",

    With season 2 coming out I decided to re-watch Attack On Titan which was the anime that resulted in me becoming an anime fan. In the year 2013 a few friends recommended me an anime called Attack On Titan. I was in that year not into anime at all and was that guy who was a video gamer only. Then I watched the show itself and found it extremely intense cool compared to what I was expecting. After watching the anime I was left with emptiness and decided to fill the hole the show left by watching many more anime.  Attack on Titan was\
          \
        my kind of show, where heroes used very cool technology referred to as odm gear to take on extremely powerful opponents called titans in battles that resulted in many deaths.  With top notch animation to boot Attack On Titan was a series I fell in love with after a few episodes. \
Every year has that one anime that becomes extremely popular and in the year 2013 Attack On Titan was that anime.  So what attracted people to this series was its story. The story is set in situation where humanity is being brought to the brink of extinction by these giant humanoids called titans. These titans seem to have no objective other than to eat every human they encounter. To save themselves the human race built three giant walls to protect themselves from the titans. One day the biggest titan ever seen appears and creates a hole in the wall. \
As a result a third of the population is lost and in realizing the stakes are high a member of the audience can get interested in the struggles of the human race to survive. Certain events in the series can shock a viewer but that is what makes Attack On Titan interesting cause if it did not do so the series would be and average anime where everyone survives extremely dangerous. \
The main story is what happened after the incident and follows a group of rookie soldiers which are the main cast of characters referred to as the 104th corps. In the series the story becomes a struggle for the 104th as they are brought into duty to fight for humanity. The characters go into battle realising they could easily get killed by a titan anytime. The main story is like a continuous stress test for the 104th who must endure to win which goes for some more than others.\
The 104th consist of many soldiers but only certain members stick out which includes the top ten. The top ten are the rookies who have the highest survival rate amongst the 104th which makes them the characters to get the screen time. The one who is most central to the story is Eren Yeager. Eren is the first to be introduced and wishes to kill all the titans one day. Eren starts off as immature but he will grow on you as he becomes more willing to rely on his comrades. He is a character who acts all tough but he cannot stand seeing anyone die. \
Other Major characters in the top ten include Mikasa Ackerman who is the strongest of the 104th. They seem like a calm character but they are the type to kill everything in their path if they lose their composure. I like her character a lot because I find her to be a badass. Other crucial characters include Jean who is a character who grows on you over time as he seems selfish at first but like Eren gives a damn about the other soldiers although he is not as open about it. As a leader he makes logical decisions that result in the least deaths. \
Other characters that are significant are Armin who is not really strong but is the most intelligent in the 104th. Compared to other characters he is more of a tactician then a soldier and is more better giving commands then fighting. There are also elite soldiers like Levi and Erwin who have a big impact on the story and other soldiers. Apart from those few the other central characters have great personalities that make them stand out from the crowd. \
The Art in this series is really good. The soldiers are drawn well and movements are fluid. The main villains the titans are drawn in a way to make them extremely menacing and creepy. The textures used in materials such as the buildings, clothing and the wall itself are very nice and smooth. In the effects department some things such as explosions, buildings coming down, smoke and light on at the top level. There is a bit of gore in this series that can be brutal at times as these titans do tend to chew their victims to death. \
One major cool thing about the animation is how they animate the scenes where characters use the odm gear. The odm gear is a grapple hook gadget that makes the characters into steampunk spidermen with swords. In the scenes where they use the gear there is a lot of 3d cgi with the buildings the characters are zooming around.  The 2d characters are done so fluently that the mix of two art styles makes these scenes seem badass. \
The music of this series is a mix between catchy and epic. The opening themes which include linked horizon are fun to listen to and have that catchy rhythm that gets you ready for an episode. In the show we get some epic battle scenes where the best and most suitable music is used to make the situation give off more of an adrenaline rush to the viewer. The sound effects used are on par and don't miss the mark in lining up with the animation in fast paced scenes. \
Attack on Titan is a really good anime with epic moments of awesome animation that would be of liking to any general anime fan. If you are someone looking for an anime where the characters seem to be in a hopeless situation then this is the show for you.    \

    At first, Shingeki no Kyojin caught my eye pretty unexpectedly as i just thought of watching an anime out of the blue (it's been a long time since i've watched an anime). It was my second anime after watching Naruto but i stopped for a while because it kept having spoilers and i have watched a minor amount of full metal alchemist when i was little. Anyway i read the synopsis and my first impression was that it was going to be some badass titan slayer, who is trying to eradicate the titans after going through some immense calamity. Which in fact i did actually\
          \
        predict a lot of the plot in the anime, though i was a bit off of what i imagined the main plot would be. I have also noticed that i am watching 2 years later after its release so i'm a bit late on the 'latest hyped anime', and that it's known to be overrated but i beg to differ.\
Story: Though i i don't know how much it deviates from the manga, i found the story really unique and that it had amazing ideas. From the first couple of minutes of each episode it gives an intro of the events and the history of humanity, which it basically summarises that human's are useless and is at the brink of extinction. At the start of the anime it follows the three main protagonists: Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlet. We see it kick off as they are all best friends and want to explore the outside of the wall where they don't even know the vast ocean exists. As it progresses, it escalates pretty quickly and Eren's mother gets eaten by a titan whilst he is watching, and no kidding that was a really intense and emotional scene. This is where he vows that he would eradicate all the titans, and the story follows him meeting other squad members, as he ends up in the 104th trainee squad of the military police brigade. More characters are introduced and the progression was perfect i found because it steadies itself to a climatic scene with the epic soundtrack coming in. Those were the moments where the story just keeps getting your mind blown, and at the point, where you see that true epicness and spotlight shining on the protagonist.\
Characters: For the characters they are all shown to have unique characteristics from the usual brave one, the clever one, the endearing one, the comedy one, etc. It also shows their aptitude and qualities in comparison of each other which i thought was a nice feature. \
From the main protagonist, Eren, we are introduced that he is an abrupt but a brave character who only thinks of killing titans (on occasions). His general aspects are his main points which creates him as who we see him as. His heroism and valiantness is put on a bigger a picture to enhance his intrepid attacks in combat. This is basically the best part where he just goes complete ape-shit fighting the titans whilst himself as a titan. In my opinion however, his characteristics was corresponding to Naruto, so he's just abrupt and brave who cares for his friends and want to protect them, but this is not all. It's also the fact that (this accounts a lot of other anime too) he involuntarily gets some sort of power that makes him more powerful physically.\
For Mikasa however she is unique, not the usual 'save me' vulnerable girl but the one that at times saves the male protagonist. Her protectiveness over Eren is one of the big features which is why the anime is standing out. The romance between Eren and Mikasa is profound, though Eren is completely oblivious to the fact Mikasa has feeling for him. Just to point out i thought it was a nice touch to see Mikasa's BIG strong abs and the fact she's stronger than Eren which really deviates from what we usually expect.\
Armin is the vulnerable, scared, but kind and clever guy that devises plans like the leader of the group. His character was definitely unique, his intelligence but vulnerable self shows the diverse amount of characters in the anime. What i liked the most was though was how he's the most relatable, his realistic fear is involuntary which happens to everyone. As i am only writing about the main characters descriptively, i can't miss out the fan-favourite character- Levi. He is basically the main badass which hates society because of his past events (shown in OVA). For some reason he can fight any titan including Eren as it states and he is overpowered in all ways, he's intelligent, strong and is a clean freak. Most characters are realistically developed and they're individually evolved to a good extent, and does not only revolve around the protagonist only, but shows development in the others too.\
Music: The music is always the part where it enhances the show, movie, anime the most, and it pretty much transcends the epicness and badass moments. The opening song really was a hype for every time you watch an episode, it's stands out and it's a very different and unique song where i've never even heard a similar comparable music. From the vogel im kafig to Levi's song, each soundtrack really hit the top marks. It enhances the emotions and feeling of the scenes and arcs.\
Art: The art also hit top marks, though i did have some problems. The abherrent titans runs unrealistically and to some extent, it becomes stupid. I do know that anime usually exaggerates the movement and proportions of the object but i just thought it was kinda weird. The characters too, i thought was quite different to how it's usually made, it was kind of similar to cartoon type. It's very minor but it is just my opinion and im being very picky, overall the art was really well executed.\
Finishing off, epic anime, epic soundtrack, and epic characters. I also found the 3D maneuver gear was really cool or as the movie calls it the omni-directional mobility gear. I've watched the first part it was... different, i'll just say you're not missing anything if you are not planning to watch it. Anyway the anime is really entertaining and really was outstanding.\

    Re-reviewing this anime for the second time already.\
TL;DR:\
+Great premise\
+Great animation\
+Great soundtrack\
+Great 3 main characters\
-Bad cliffhanger\
-A lot of it's side characters are completely forgettable\
Shingeki no Kyojin is not an overrated anime and, I'll explain why.\
The humans are now at a brink of extinction and because of that, a wall was built. This wall survived for a 100 years until it was destroyed by a colossal titan. This horrific event was witnessed by Eren, Mikasa and Armin and because of this horrific event, Eren wants to kill all the titans by joining the survey corps. \
It's safe to say that the first episode of this anime was\
          \
        very good and it was well-executed. That first episode shows us that there's more to come on this show because it's going to be one heck of a ride.\
Here's the thing though - the ending sucks. I mean, I know, there's still a second season but that's not how you end the show. That was a very bad cliffhanger. I wish they left it with a good cliffhanger where the thrill goes down.\
I've notice that many people gives the story a very low score because of the plot holes they leave like seriously? I respect your opinion but, I think you have to deal with it since, most anime with only 10-13 episodes will leave a lot of plot holes so, they won't catch up to it's manga/light novels. Though, I gave it a 7/10 because the cliffhanger was very bad.\
The animation of this show is top-notched. The shadings and it's black outlines was very good and it was well-drawn. Also, the action scenes like the 3D Maneuver gear was also very well animated. The soundtrack of the show is also another highlight. It adds so much thrill to the show. I know, there are like English voices which might cringe you at first but, I thought it was still great. Not to mention that the first and second opening themes of this show are very good. Second opening theme is even better than the first.\
The show places so much characters on this show thus, not everyone is memorable but why 8/10 you ask? Because this is a post-apocalyptic anime and not a lot of them is going to last long. Plus, they do give some short developments on some characters that's not going to last long.\
Eren Jaeger is a typical Shonen character but come on. Who wouldn't act like this after the horrific event he saw years ago. He's a character who is willing to kill all the titans.\
Mikasa Ackerman is a quiet girl but really strong. She has a quiet personality because on what happened to her parents in the past.\
Armin Arlert is the genius of the three but gets nervous and depressed really easily and both of them are there to cheer him up.\
Overall, the thrill of this show is what I enjoyed but, I do wish the thrill got down by the season ends. Well, at least the second season is confirmed but, it's still going to air on 2016 so, we have to wait.\

    This anime was an absolute masterpiece and is one of the best animes I have ever seen. It literally had me hanging on the edge of my seat almost the entire time I was watching it. It is also one of the most emotionally powerful animes I have ever seen. Part of the reason for that was the art work. It was phenomenal and you could see the emotions of the characters raging behind their eyes. I had heard about this anime from my friends and, honestly, I really didn't want to watch it at first. But once I started, I couldn't stop, and I\

Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the greatest shows I have ever seen in my life. The entire anime is just outstanding.\
The story of Shingeki no Kyojin is that humanity is on the brink of extinction because they are being devoured by these creatures called Titans and have to maintain refuge inside of three walls (Maria, Rose, and Sina). Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are the three main protagonist that witness the worst day of humanity which is the day the Colossal and Armored Titan broke through the walls and Titans invaded their homes. Eren\
          \
        then vows to eliminate all the Titans after escaping to the inner wall.They later decide to join the army and become soldiers. The three later join the survey corps after graduating and after that it's just plain epicness.\
The animation is unbelievable. This anime has the best animation that I have seen so far.\
The voice acting is also outstanding. Yuki Kaji deserves a noteworthy performance as the voice as Eren Yeager. The Dub for this show is also very good. But by far the best sound is the openings to Shingeki no Kyojin.\
The show has an abundance of great characters all with different backstories and reasons why they joined the military. My two favorites being Captain Levi and Mikasa.\
This show had my adrenaline pumping because of it's epicness, phenomenal story, and superb animation. That is why I am giving this show a perfect 10 out of 10.\

    The work the animation team did is rather outstanding here, the animation and music is superb and the whole thing is relatively well directed. But, and it's a big but, like \"damn, Becky, look at that but\", the source material has several glaring issues that prevent the anime from truly earning its gargantuan hype. Most of these stem from the fact that nothing really significant seems to happen in terms of progression, for both the plot and the characters. Note that I am taking the manga chapters I read into consideration here too, which was up to about 50. Each arc suffers from one of\
          \
        two major problems, they either aren't properly wrapped up or they are just plain boring. The first arc is part of the latter, it just wasn't satisfying to see all the training from past episodes barely even get put to use. Most of the other arcs suffer from the other problem though, they each seem to bring up some kind of head scratching question, these questions are some of the best things in the manga/anime, but the problem is that the anime ends before any get answered. Normally this would be okay because you can just move on to the manga, which most people do, but here that doesn't work because 28 rather large chapters later I still haven't found any complete answers to these questions. This is not because despite large investigation on the characters' behalf the questions are too hard to answer. This is because the characters all seem to either forget or give up on these questions completely. However, I can never tell which reason it is because the characters are so underdeveloped. Attack on Titan has quite a few characters, and since they are all too busy running around in circles trying to figure something out or solve some kind of problem only to inevitably fail they get little time for growth. And despite its reputation Attack on Titan doesn't actually kill off its characters any more than any other anime, a few of the many side characters die occasionally but since none of them get enough screen time it really doesn't matter much. There are a few characters that seem interesting and do see some development, but none of these ones get killed and I doubt they will for a long time if ever. Namely are Jean, Armin, Christa, Ymir and maybe Levi and Hanji, but with the exception of Armin these are all side characters whose screen time is eaten up by the male stand-in Eren and his all-too-familiar yandere sister that conveniently isn't actually his sister. This leads me to one of my smaller problems but its worth mentioning because it may become significant. People want Eren and Mikasa together. This is bad because it could ruin Mikasa as a character. If given a good enough justification for her obsession with protecting Eren, like not wanting to lose the last of her family she has potential to be a unique character, but if they get together that gets flushed down the toilet because it just turns her into an overly attached girlfriend and makes her obsession too cliché. Add on to this the fact that their relationship right that now is more like that of a mother and son, because she has been taking care of him since they were kids and he wants to take care of himself and be independent because he is a super typical 15 year old boy. Another problem I have there is that Eren actually can't take care of himself. Without the convenient boon of his thing that I won't spoil he would totally suck ass and get eaten. This takes me to my final issue: there is an enormous power gap between Levi, Mikasa, maybe Hanji and literally every other person in the whole show. The fact that Levi and Mikasa cut through hordes of Titans like swiss cheese makes it hard to believe and sympathize with everyone who gets eaten or \"has\" to retreat, especially when Mikasa is so strong for pretty much no reason at all. So yeah I may have bashed this a lot but it is because I got so into the show in the first place that I feel so strongly so I have hope that Isayama might actually start tying stuff together and if he does he'll have fixed the largest of the issues, so while AoT is not nearly as good as its made out to be now it may get closer soon, so it might be worth getting into if you think you can wait for that.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin has been a hugely popular series since its inception as an animated series. Mankind is under attack from the mysterious and equally terrorizing force known as titans. After a spell of peace, the quiet threat has emerged as even more devastating to humanity. The show follows Eren, Mikasa and others as they are set to face the titans head-on. \
The story behind Shingeki no Kyojin is both gripping and engaging. The show suddenly throws the viewer into a world with many unanswered questions. What are titans? How can they be defeated and if so, can they ever be defeated entirely? As the\
          \
        plot progresses, the cast slowly uncovers hints behind the origins of titans and leaves the viewer desiring more. Both the art and soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin are exceptional. As an example, the first opening, \"Guren no Yumiya,\" left a large impression on those in the anime community. The quality of the animation in the series is surprisingly much higher than that of the original work. Significant amounts of details are added to even townspeople and backgrounds.\
This being said, Shingeki no Kyojin appears to be a tremendously entertaining title. However, it is not without its own flaws. The main issue is the pacing. The pacing can be slow, excruciating slow, at times. While this can add to tension, it is taken to the extreme. The show includes a 6-episode arc, in a 25-episode series, which does little to push forward the plot. Due to this overall inefficient use of time, character development is almost halted and conflicts between the ranks and government are not fleshed out in a meaningful fashion. From this one deficiency, the quality of the show decreases dramatically and the viewer is left largely disappointed. Ultimately, it feels as if though all of the unanswered questions posed by the show are simply that, unanswered questions. \
For those interested in picking up the show, I would highly recommend reading the manga at the same time for more closure. \

    \"If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. If you don't fight, you can't win!\" - Eren Jaeger \
Attack on Titan is my all-time favorite anime. It is pretty gory, and a ton of bloodshed. Obviously. If you were \"caged in like livestocks\", would you be like Eren, who wants to see the outside world? \
Story: 10/10\
I'm going to assume you all know what this story is about, just because this anime is so popular. The story is outstanding. What would happen to our world if one day human-like giants came and smashed our very home with our own eyes? Or our family\
          \
        getting eaten as well? The story is extremely creative. What if Attack on Titan becomes true one day, what would become of mankind? Would it be extinct? And would Titans rule the world? \
Art: 10/10\
The blood is very real. The titans are nicely drawn as well, and the scary ones really do look scary. The titans are uniquely drawn, and you can see the bones of the Colossal Titan. I can see how people can see this anime as horror, though it really isn't that scary, and I like the way they drew the fights between Titan and Titan, when they're smashing each other apart.\
Sound: 10/10\
The two openings are amazing, and the epic battle music fits in with the epic mood of the fight scenes, it is terrific, it makes you get all hyped for the next fight. \
Character: 10/10\
My favorite character in Attack on Titan is Eren, because he is that suicidal bastard who cares nothing about himself, and is not even afraid of titans anymore, he just wants to exterminate all the titans and wipe them from the face of the world. I like how he's very determined, even a lecture from his mother won't do, and even going against her wishes. Mikasa is cool, and she is a great fighter, ex. Mikasa vs Annie. Mikasa can even throw Eren to the ground with one hand, it shows how strong she is, and she supports her two friends, following them wherever they go, because she doesn't want to lose her family again. Armin is a chill tactician, even though he is physically weak, his strategic minds are necessary during fights, and both Eren and Mikasa trusts him when they're in a dangerous situation, such as letting him make the speech about how Eren is a human and whatnot. Levi is a coolheaded leader, and a clean freak XD\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
Overall I enjoyed Attack on Titan a lot and I am glad that I gave it a try, and I am eagerly waiting for the second season to come out. Though if you don't like too much gore, then don't watch it.\

Story: 9 \
The story of humanity against a threat that can possibly lead to the extinction of humans.  The story follows Eren Jager and a bunch of other people as they experience battles with the Titans, monsters who have it out for humans.  Through these battles, we see the death of many soldiers, the psychological effects of a war when tides are against them or when the plan fails, and massive\
          \
        character development.  \
The story was paced so well, nothing was rushed, and as with an action anime, it wasn't slow either.  So no complaints on pacing.\
Art: 7\
Quite a let-down for me, since everyone hyped the art to be amazing.  ONLY 1 SCREENSHOT FOR MY COMPUTER BACKGROUND... Maybe I wasn't paying attention to scenery enough like I do with other animes... but the scenery art wasn't out of this world, good, just not outstanding.\
The biggest reason I don't watch action animes, is that when action scenes happen, the art style suffers or the animation is subpar.  SnK did an amazing job with their action scenes, as we were able to tell what was exactly happening with the characters involved and I saw to decrease in art.  The \"Three Dimensional Movement\" looked really well animated, I was quite surprised at how great it looked after seeing decent scenery art.\
Gore.  Wasn't really expecting this much gore.  I know this anime was going to be violent, but I thought it would be violent in a non-gorey way (That makes sense to me).  A lot of the times, I feel like a Titan should have caused certain bodies (Mainly Petra's) to disappear based off the Titan trying to crush the soldier.  Just a thing I wanted to bring up...  Not really related to my review though.\
Sound: 9\
Before I watched this, I have heard the first OP everywhere.  It is quite catchy, although I would have gone with a different direction art-wise with the OP.  The second OP wasn't as good, but still a nice addition to my iTunes, with a great art-style for it.  \
Both EDs were amazing, the first being a great piano song, the second being a great rock tune.  No complaints there.\
Background music didn't really stick to me, felt very normal to the scene, and something I will not be going out of my way to look up to relisten to.\
Insert Songs were amazing, great choice of music for the select few songs that got in.  These I will be looking up in the near future to listen to.\
Character: 8\
At first, I hated all the male characters.  HATED THEM.  Jean wasn't the nicest, Armin was a baby, Connie was sorta just there, and I felt that Eren was a bit annoying (Yes, I understand you want to exterminate them all... calm down a bit)  I typically don't like male characters anyways, since the animes I watch are focused on females.  The thing that was great was: the introduction of Pixis, Levi and Erwin, characters with great intelligence when it comes to war, and the development of the characters I mentioned earlier.  Rather not go into detail, as I am trying to keep this a spoiler free as possible.\
Female characters are the bomb.  Sasha is handsdown my favorite character of this series, as she was a great comic relief character.  Something I never expected from this anime was the humor she brought.  Annie being one of the most interesting characters in this anime, and Krista being the most cute character in this anime.  \
Mikasa... Sometimes I want to say her character developed, but other times, she is still trying to do what she did from the very beginning, protecting Eren.  \
Enjoyment: 9 \
Very enjoyable, the hype did not lie about this anime.  I was under the hipster impression that this anime was mainstream and gonna suck... but I still wanted to give it a chance and I am glad I did.  I don't enjoy action animes, especially ones with a lack of romance, but this anime did a great job showing me that I can enjoy it.  \
Overall: 9\
This made me push aside all my studying for my finals to watch this series, but I am so glad that I did.  ",

    The story deserves a 9 in my opinion up to episode 9. I don't take the liberty of giving an overall story point since it is still not finished. The story takes unprecedented turns and doesn't fail to surprise the viewer. Also the writer mercilessly kills off important characters.\
The art is the best I've seen in any anime so far. A plain 10. I would give it a 11 if it was possible. The animators have succeeded in masterfully merging 2D and 3D animation without messing it up. Also everything about the art is fantastic and that said, I need to mention the amazing Opening\
          \
        and Ending that each episode has.\
The character development gets a 10 straight. The writer achieved the same level of character development in 7 episodes that Masashi Kishimoto achieved in over 500 episodes of the Naruto series.\
Voice and sound are also the best present. The OST s really lighten up the mood and help build up the tension. I am eagerly waiting for an official release of the soundtracks. 10 again.\
Attack on titan leaves you begging for the next episode each week and each episode ends at the precise moment to achieve this goal. The fighting scenes are well worked and make you have an adrenaline rush.\
Overall, we are facing one of the best things that has happened in the anime industry in years. Not really surprising when the brilliant director of Death Note has taken the director seat for this anime.\

It's a little surprising to me as well considering how I enjoy games like God of War and TV Shows like Game of Thrones that I would dislike this series. \
But I did. I found the excessive violence and death to be more detrimental to the story than anything. The vast majority of the Deaths in the story served no meaningful purpose. Not to mention having a main character who is , in my opinion, unquestionably the LEAST capable member of the main cast. The only\
          \
        arguably admirable quality he possesses is that he doesn't give up easily. \
My Biggest issue with this series, is that if you had given nearly ANY OTHER CHARACTER in the series The power that Eren got...The Humans would almost certainly have defeated the Titans and the series would have been much better. \
That said I can't deny that the Art and Music were quite good. \
Aside from that though, I personally find this series to be ridiculously overrated. \

    If I have anything to say about Attack on Titan is that this is the most overrated anime like Sword Art Online. The show is mediocre and nothing about it is groundbreaking. If anything the swift animation is fantastic and this show looks amazing. But the lack luster characters are just boring and there is nothing to their personality. I'm always told this show is the \"Game of Thrones of anime\". That statement is bullshit. Cause Game of Thrones at least kills their characters and keeps them dead. and doesn't find some unexplained bullshit reason to keep them alive. But then kills off useless or\

        uninteresting characters. My favorite joke to make is to scream \"NO NOT POTATOE GIRL! SHE WAS SO WELL DEVELOPED BECAUSE SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT LIKING POTATOES!\". This anime is so popular and I just don't get why. Ok visual eye candy wise it's great. Action scenes are spectacles and leap off the page into such an emersive experience. But the story is weird. These titans come from nowhere. How do they reproduce if they have no dicks? Where are they from? How'd they get here? There are more questions I have and if anything I hope when season 2 eventually gets here these questions will be answered and who knows, maybe the score will increase once all is explained. As of now this show is just ok. I didn't hate everything about it and generally it was entertaining but with all these questions and a retcon of a main character death and a boring dip in slow pacing by the second half makes this just a whatever show I think has gotten too hyped for it's own good. \

    After finished this series, there are a couple things that I must point out.\
Lots of action, but for some reason the characters seem to need to have conversations while standing still in the middle of battle.\
They tend to reiterate things over and over and over, I feel like I'm being talked down to.\
There is a lot of filler in each episode, and a they go way into depth on characters that have almost no hold on the plot.\
Characters seem to stand around in battle or while under attack when any normal person would be doing something, literally anything.\
All of that said, the artwork is absolutely\
          \
        beautiful, the idea behind the story is great, but the writing is shit-tastic, the sound is quite enjoyable, but there seems to be an odd mix of music choices, some are epic orchestrals, while others are Japanese pop, the characters are bland with too many to care about, and these massive flaws take away from what could be a great series.\

    Shingeky no Kyojin was on of the most hyped anime in the season it was released. After a few episodes were released I have also decided to give it a try. I really have to admit that SnK was thrilling as f***, so why did I rate it as poor? \
It's simple, except of the thrilling factor SnK really offers nothing to the viewer! \
Story: After reading the synopsis SnK should be a simple action anime, based on the revenge of Eren Jaeger. Sadly the Story makes so many ridiculous twists and turns that not a single unanswered question was answered instead more and more\
          \
        unanswered question came up. The best example is the last episode, I really don't want to spoiler so I will just drop a single word here: crystal. The people who have seen the end know what I mean.\
Everyone knows that SnK isn't finished, you can read the mange and there will be a second season, still the first season story, was completly pathetic. So only based on the first season story, SnK had really the worst storyline I have ever seen in my life. Also included a lot of filler episodes in which the storyline just stopped. (this is a personal comment: it really breaks my heart to see people rating the story with 10/10. Compared to DeathNote/CodeGeass/Steins:Gate/... which really had well thought out stories (most of the time))\
Art&Sound: The combination of Art&Sound was the reason why SnK was thrilling. The perfect prospects of a situation included a perfect set and matching music gave us all goosebumps. Art was okay, nothing really special compared to other animes of that season.\
Character: This part is as same pathetic as the story: Jean is really the only character which had a normal personality and wasn't killed after 2 minutes. Every other character is an eccentric or cannon fodder for the titans. So only irrelevant characters die.\
SnK shouldn't be rated as outstanding by ignoring the badly made storyline in the first season. The most important thing for me to rate the anime as poor was the moment at the last episode when I realized that after 25 episodes nothing relevant happened to the whole mainstory.\

    We have a weird obsession with our own self-destruction. It’s not just stories about how we’re destroying the Earth. We are attracted to the sight of humans being butchered, cut up and eaten. The arts have constantly provided a safe place for people to view these things, knowing these people aren’t really dying.\
As profound and deep as it sounds, it also gave rise to exploitation films. Sometimes, they get a budget and we get something like the Saw series. The worst offenders are those that use the grim’n’dark atmosphere of violence to shock. The audience for Saw is there for the visual spectacle, but many\
          \
        people are still sure grimdarkness is a sign of depth and maturity. Just look at all those crappy FPS games with monochromatic tough guys, or that very popular fantasy series that’s all about who will be the king.\
The premise sure sounds like it will join these ranks. Anime is full of overblown violence, especially in shows with a very serious tone. There’s also a realistic art style to boot. After a few episodes, though, you notice you spent more time with the characters rather than looking at titans eating humans.\
Attack on Titan never feels like it’s even trying to join the rank of shlock grimdarkness. This is a very humane story, one where the characters are much more important than what happens next. It doesn’t even sink into exploitating their suffering. It’s far more excited with the variety of humans to linger on one detail.\
Calling Attack on Titan a story that loves humans sound silly. Heads are being chopped off and there are a lot of assholes around, but that’s the strength. It looks at humanity’s worst aspects, admits their exist and still refuses to give up on it.\
In fact, it’s a criticism of such misanthropy. The titans are distorted versions of us. That’s a visualization of how misanthropes see humanity – as senseless animals just bent on destruction. Yet the whole purpose the titans exist, just to chop humans to destroy them all is the logical end of misanthropy.\
It’s not a caricature, though. The creators understand why misanthropes exist in the first place. Cruelty is everywhere. Sometimes it’s cliches about how the elite only cares about themselves (Thankfully, the series doesn’t linger on that too much). Sometimes we get a more interesting look at how assholes are born. A military police officer can’t hear the explanation of how all these destruction is going to get humanity anywhere. Right now his own world is under attack. We care more about our home environment than we do about humanity as a whole.\
Caring about the whole isn’t easy. The series presents two ways of doing it. Either persevere as if nothing is happening and hide behind the walls, or make great sacrifices, risk losing everything but also gain everything.\
It’s not an easy choice at all. The ideal situation is that Erwin’s plans will work, but there’s no guarantee it will. We’re always encouraged to take risks, but the reason it’s a risk in the first place is because of the possibility of failure.\
Failure is an ever-looming presence in Attack on Titan. Plans never go as expected, and sometimes even Erwin isn’t sure where to go from that failure. The series asks whether the risk is worth taking even if the plan fails. It doesn’t present a simplistic, complete failure. The characters always gain something from the risks they take. A complete loss is easy to write and doesn’t leave much to explore. Rather, it asks whether what was gained was worth the exchange.\
While this focus on dealing with failure is admirable (and possibly pretty rare in these types of anime), it sometimes become repetitive. The series never sinks into milking its tragedy. We see titans eating humans, but just enough to understand the horror of it all. The camera never lingers on dead bodies and titans chewing on a human. We still get an overpowered enemy for the ending, though.\
The last part of the series goes in a different direction. It’s a nice risk, but I’m still not sure whether it was worth it. It’s an extended action sequence that’s well-animated and exciting, but can feel too out-of-place. Up until then the series was concerned with the characters. We got various worldviews and personalities and saw them interact. The training arc is especially great. The action sequence relies on more on what will happen next than on the characers’ personalities.\
There are still character moments there. A moment of banter between the elite soldier defines what makes this series so engrossing. The way each of them talks is modified by their personality (Oluo’s narcissism, Petra’s empathy). The action is also entertaining enough. It’s well-animated, unique to the series rather than just generic sword swinging and uses extended, moving shots. There is a kinetic energy to it. The camera moves as the soldiers fly with their gear, and that transmits this motion more effective.\
Too bad their enemy is pretty dull. It borders on invincible. Fighting an all-powerful enemy can be used well, but only psychologically (As in Harlan Ellison’s story about mouths and screaming). An action scene against an enemy who can block each attack quickly becomes repetitive. There’s a reason why the last fighting scene in Medabots is so short.\
The enemy is given the occasional downfall and these are the most intense moments. Anytime it breaks out and finds a way around there’s a sense of been-there-done-that. At that point, it just felt like the creators was dragging the series on and piling on tragedies.\
Up until then, it constantly kept moving forward and didn’t linger on unnecessary details. The reason we get these time skips because we don’t need 40 episodes of Eren’s childhood to understand him. We’re given enough to understand and then it moves on. Why linger on the least exciting section? Maybe they’re trying to appeal to an audience who’s in it for the action. At least they gave them unique action scenes.\
Overpowered enemy means the ending isn’t very different than what happened a few episodes before it. The lack of conclusion isn’t the big problem. The manga keeps going, and the series doesn’t put all its money on the Big Conclusion anyway. The conclusion is not satisfying enough, but it doesn’t negate all that came before. The problem is that not enough changed when it ends. Change is only hinted at, but the enemy hasn’t been really defeated and not a lot of progress was made. I did not want all points wrapped up, but I wanted a lesson learned. A good ending is one that wraps up the themes, not plot points.\
The series also gets credit for changing my view on realistic character design. My previous experience was with Monster, where everyone looked like real people and no one looked interesting or unique. Animation gives total control. The animators decide everything – the size of the head, the shape of the eyes, the color of the hair.\
There is supposed to be a good reason to include a detail. If not, it’s just meaningless fluff with no purpose. That’s why, in cartoons, the characters tend to have ridiculous designs that are either interesting to look at or to inform us about the character’s personality. Attack on Titan has this attention to detail. The facial expression especially have a lot of work put into them. Levi has small, narrow eyes that reflect his world that’s nothing but killing titans. Eren’s eyes are wide but muscular, which fit with his idealism, extremist views and desire to go to the world outside. Petra also has such wide eyes, but they’re softer. She’s more emphatic than anyone around here.\
It also avoids the shounen trap and let women look like women. A lot of shounen anime give the women breasts, but not actual female beauty. It’s no attempt to subvert gender norms. The femininity is removed without something to replace it. Here, though, women are allowed to look like women whether they’re mother figures (Petra), hardened warriors (Annie, Mikasa) or wild eccentrics (Hanji, Sasha).\
It’s a good moment to say that the series avoids all cliches of misogyny and feminism in its representation of women. The women in Attack on Titan are allowed to be human beings, not walking pin-up posters or bland strong women. They have characters and personalities just like the guys. They do drop the ball Mikasa, but that’s less because they try to make her strong and more because they forgot to give her a personality. Why do we waste our time, asking whether a sexy schoolgirl with a one armed scissor is feminist when this one gets it all right?\
Despite the small flaws, Attack on Titan is well worth the fame. It’s good to easy it became so big. There are at times when it feels unstoppable, like it’s hell-bent on becoming the best anime ever. Almost every scene has purpose and every dialogue exchange contributes to the characters and worlds. Even when it becomes just an extended action sequence, it’s fantastic. That’s how good it is.\

    For all the reviews I am going to do,I am gonna keep them short and straight to the point. I know I don't like when a review just rambles on about nothingness or a minor part of the whole anime. \
\"Shingeki no Kyojin\" or also known to many as \"Attack on Titan\" is a jaw dropping, almost perfect, dramatic, action packed, emotional roller coaster, badass, and phenomenal anime. This anime was quick to to spread and soon joined the group with all the famous anime's such as Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, etc. I mean, how could one not talk about Attack on Titan?? It\
          \
        had all the traits to become as well known and respected as it is today. After finishing each episode, you can't leave. You just want to keep knowing more. It almost becomes impossible not to watch the whole season in one sitting. I literally watched 25 episodes in a single night before an 8 am class. YES I HAVE A PROBLEM. \
Story to me is a ten. A perfect ten at that. From the first episode you are drawn in from the horrific gore you are forced to watch. The story is incredibly brutal. Death after death after death. It may not even be an important character, but their passing will still haunt you due to the pure bloodshed, sounds of their cries, and screams you hear. The idea is incredibly unique. I mean titans? It is such an odd and interesting concept you can't seem to understand right from the beginning. Here are these gigantic human like creatures devouring humans as their fuel to live. THERE ARE EVEN VARIANTS OF THESE CREATURES I MEAN HOW COOL IS THAT. The humans fighting system is so darn unique. The directional movement gear makes for amazing fighting scenes. Causing action packed and intense scenes. Humans literally fly through the air like spider man with these things while wielding swords to kill the titans. With this concept and the way the city is set up, it creates a beautiful battleground that is nothing less then perfect for the anime. \
Art: It was the first of its kind. Unique art that may seem weird at first glance, but grows on you quickly.  I really do think that this anime has to be watched in HD. I watched in HD and holy firiggin moly. The difference with HD and non-HD is monumental. AS YOU CAN TELL MY POINT IS TO WATCH IN HD PLEASE FOR BEST EXPERIENCE. \
Sound: The sound was great. When in fight scenes the cutting and slashing noises were on point. Along with the air that comes with the maneuvering system. All the sounds made sense. But oh my god the noises the titans made will give me nightmares forever. Absolutely terrifying. I watched both the DUB and SUB. I absolutely loved the sub. THE DUB WAS AMAZING TOO. But for some reason there is a big debate about it. I think the voices were perfect for each character. I think you will all agree if you watch the dub. The music during the episodes to me wasn't really important. I was too focused in on the story and fighting to even realize the music. That's how good this story is....seriously guys its amazing. My eyes were locked on and I heard nothing but the characters and the sound effects.  Intro song was outstanding as well. I liked listening to it. I mean its not something I blast in my car but it was really good. So in conclusion 9 is definitely a fair rating. \
Characters: One of the easiest 10's I will ever give in a review. Right from the first episode you feel each characters pain after learning their back stories. You truly do feel for them. Its like you become emotionally attached to them. I love that about some anime's and Attack on Titan really connects you with the characters. I will do the main characters so I don't ramble on. I PROMISE NO SPOILERS!!!! \
Eren Yeager: What an inspiring main character. Eren overcomes all odds every time you think he is down. Out of all anime I have ever watched, he could be the most determined to reach his goal. My favorite part of Eren, is that he never loses sight of his goal. He goes through some horrific, life changing, emotional events. But he still never loses sight of his original goal. I love that in characters.  He is extremely emotional, but love-able. When he cries you feel for him. There are actually some scenes that almost brought me to tears because you really do feel the pain he is experiencing. Couldn't of created a better main character. He inspires almost every other character in this anime and that's what a main character should do.\
Mikasa Ackerman: Such a bad-ass. A strong female role character. Her skills are mind boggling. The way she uses the maneuvering system to kill the titans is such a unique style. She compliments Eren well. I mean thank god....she is his right hand man. The best part of Mikasa is she knows how strong she is but is not even close to cocky about it. Actually quite shy about it. Humbleness in characters is a given for me to like them. I just love how she isn't a weak female role and actually kicks titan ass. Hopefully through the next season she keeps tearing up those titans! \
Armin Arlert: Hmm it is not really easy to describe Armin. He really is quite complicated. A little blonde boy who is very smart but extremely weak. He is not confident in himself at all which hinders him of using his actual ability. But throughout the anime he does grow and use his speaking ability/smarts to his advantage. He is so emotional. I think the voice acting for him was the most important. During some of his speeches and scenes the voices made a huge impact. It showed his true passion and emotion he has towards other characters. If you aren't attached to Armin at first, wait a coupe more episodes. TRUST ME IT WILL HAPPEN I GOT ATTACHED. (three main characters)\
Enjoyment: I mean I watched 25 episodes in one night... not my proudest 8 am class. So definitely enjoyed this anime thoroughly. One of my favorite animes of all time. A ten in my books! I think you will all enjoy this anime, seriously its worth your time. \
Overall: I give it a 9. 10 is called a masterpiece, and I just sadly can't call this a masterpiece. I WANT TO SO BADLY, but I sadly can not. If I had to give a very precise rating a 9.5 would be it. A really beautiful piece of art. Season two is gonna blow up for sure. \

    The action, the pain of seeing people getting slaughtered, the happiness of that small victory for mankind...\
Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, Where should I begin?\
Well, first of all, I want to compliment Production I.G and Wit Studio for making such an outstanding anime serie. It had the impact of 150 episodes inside just 25 episodes.\
Story: 10\
The story is really good. It has its ups and downs just like a real war and it shows us a part of the anime world where almost nothing is perfect. This gave me a different impact than any other anime serie. It is a really rough serie\
          \
        to watch espescially the beginning. If someone dies, he/she dies and can not be brought back in some kind of magical way like seeking 8 orange balls or whatever tricks other anime use. It actually shows you the real traumatic experiences right in your face.\
The story obviously takes place in a postapocaliptic version of the world that is now in hands of a dumb but too strong species called the titans. I think the whole story takes place in Germany, beacause of the names and artstyle.\
Art: 10\
Really good art, all scenes were shown from a good point of view. It looks awesome how they go out to fight. The angles you see the fighters from and the expressions of the charactersare just perfect.\
Sound: 10\
The voice actors were great and realistic. Well done. The openings sound really good and the songs give a good image of what the serie is about. The effect and background music were great too.\
Character *Spoiler* : 9\
The character development is amazing. When they are done with their heavy training and finally became official Cadets I felt great. It felt so horrible when I saw a lot of these guys almost instantly die beacause humans are just so much weaker than titans, even with such effective gear.\
Enjoyment: 9\
I really enjoyed watching thisserie fullof action and pain and I hope season 2 will be just as great as season 1, but because ofreasons i gave in ''Character'', I didnt enjoy it 10 out of 10. I actually shouldnt have enjoyed it 10 out of 10, because that would mean i didnt feel anything for the story.\

    I am a big fan of Cinemasins Everything Wrong With(EWW) and screenjunkies Honest Trailers so this review will be in their satire comical style. I repeat SATIRE/COMICAL style. You have been warned.\
Finally after enjoying the comradery of One Piece, the joy of Toriko, and the laughter of Naruto(not shippuden), welcome to depression within the first five minutes of the episode. Awe in amazement at a society that looks predominantly European speak flawless Japanese and a dub with a horrible European accent.\
Meet our heroes, Eren, a guy so caught up in revenge against the evil Titans that he will ignore superior orders, ignore his mother orders,\
          \
        and become a person unable to control his urge to kill titans. But man he has worked hard!\
Eren's friend Armin, no one's favorite. He is a soldier with the inability to defend himself or others physically, but that does not stop him from giving people the best tactics ever. Sad that no one likes this smarty! Eren's older sister Mikasa. The most badass, calm(usually), smart, soldier the humans have. \
These heroes must face the most misunderstood villains since Gatson from Beauty and the Beast, the Titans. Seriously he was just concerned about Belle since the Beast kidnapped her. No one in this story understands much about the Titans except Eren's father, but that bastard is secretive about it so no one. When they're not killing them, 1/3 of the series will spend time naming Titans, experimenting on Titans, observing Titans when one should run away,  and determining whether Titans have intelligence. Instead of doing the thing everyone has in mind, but has not openly said, give Titans CLOTHES to wear.\
So if you want to watch a lot of people die, innocent creatures tortured, and a fucking cliffhanger ending then please enjoy Attack on Titan a.k.a Shingeki no Kyojin\
Honestly, I loved this anime. It is action packed with a nice pace, great visuals, and relatable characters. You fall for Eren even though he is hatred driven. Armin is my favorite character because he is one of the most realistic and the Titans really do need some clothes.\

    I will start by completely praising the artwork, story, sound (yes the freaking opening). The artwork was a really good 10. Just seeing these massive titans being cut down by blades had me screaming on the inside. The sound was perfect and fit every single time. The story is amazing. Man kind being protected from these titan monsters by building huge walls and training people to basically cut the titans down is creative and unlike any other anime. \
Despite this anime being completely influenced on horror it was able to attract the attention of anyone who has heard of the word anime. It is a\
          \
        must-see for anyone who loves to see the will of survival in people's eyes. I wasn't even able to really find any flaws in the anime itself in my opinion entirely I think it was created almost perfectly.\
I will say something though, don't get too attached to a character. Just don't....\
This anime does an amazing job at getting to the watcher's feelings. Friends turn to enemies, people turn against eachother, suspicion rises, but even in the brink of total destruction there are those who are willing to put their lives on the line for their friends, family, and HUMANITY! \

    Attack on Titan is a survival horror anime where humanity is on the brink of extinction from colossal beings known as titans. It maintains a dreary pace throughout with characters dying left and right, and lamenting their  impossible situation.\
The art for this show is gorgeous with vibrant background and foreground textures and fluid animation during fight scenes. \
The music is also very complementary and thematically fitting for the show. The voice actors do a good job filling their roles\
Unfortunately, the story of Attack on Titan falls rather flat. An immense amount of time is wasted on story arcs that could have very easily been\
          \
        shortened. One of the arcs for example devotes a total of nine episodes to moving a bolder, with most of the time being spent back and forth fighting, but very little plot advancement. The only intriguing plot element pertains to finding out about the true nature of the titans but unfortunately, this aspect remains unresolved by the end of the show. A second seasons is needed to expand the show as the story remains unfinished otherwise.\
The characters of this show are also quite poor. Attack on Titan has a huge cast of  characters, however the drawback is that almost all of them remain undeveloped. Some of them are there for the sole purpose of dying. Since they hardly get any meaningful characterization however, it is difficult care when this happens and it feels that the show is trying to entice you through cheap shock factor.\

    I watched Attack on Titan on Kissanime.com. Recommended to me by a Youtuber.\
Note: this review focuses more on the negative aspects which could have been better managed, its an easier way to rate an anime at least in my perspective. \
For this anime I will focus on two main problems:\
Problem#1)\
       The anime made a poor use of its 25 episodes. This includes several \"Moral Dilemma in my head\" moments were the character just thought out what he should do or the \"The world is cruel, Fight to survive\" message. This could have gone better if they did not slap\
          \
        it on your face in every episode or if they had made the characters more acting on the matter. Although the moral messages are meant for adults or teens to understand, the anime is clearly for children so this creates a conflict between the two. Second, there are flashbacks which provide no useful or interesting background information and just reinstate what we already know or can conclude, which are meant to be fillers or suspense delays. -1\
Problem# 2) \
       The story does not focus on a consistent plot with a clear problem or antagonist.  The sort of thing you see in \"Make up shit as you go\" anime *cough* Deathnote *cough*. This shows that instead of following the route the writers originally chose for their story they get stuck on some other problems to focus the anime on the main characters only and please the audience, this is laziness by their part. There are moments in AoT which depict the people inside the wall as poor \"Pigs in a Pen\" and other moments where I actually wish they died for being such disgraceful jerks. Also the objective for the scouts/MP Brigade is not clear, so your goal is to protect the people inside the walls, so you give that up for some maniac who can turn into a titan. Then you choose to sacrifice 50% of your soldiers to help this maniac and obtain a supposed \"titan origin code\" from under a cellar. Then you give that up because, by pure coincidence, in the middle of your mission  you happened to find a never before seen female titan (which you already had traps for) and instead chose to capture it. Who's in charge of all these dumb suicidal decisions anyways, maybe that bald pervert who appeared in two episodes... Decide what the route for this story is already! Chose a problem: the titans, the traitor, or protecting the people and don't change your mind midway. Please, writers. -1\
Story/Action:9( It was an action anime, it had action. Original story) Art: 8 Sound:7 (titan screams, ODM gear annoying, few BG sounds) Character: 8(not in love with the teen drama style, had some character development) Enjoyment: 7 (was fun... Like action movie fun) \
Overall: 8/10 (tries to be interesting, Action anime, has action!) (7.8 rounded to 8)\
The review ends here.\
Personal Note: This anime tries to be logically illogical. So you have nice transitions which explain how ODM gear works and the agricultural techniques used by farmers inside the walls, etc, etc. But yet you cannot give a simple explanation of armored/size of titans, how Erin or Aaron (don't care) controls his titan or why none of the commanders have any common sense, more than the teenagers they command at least. I guess they just forgot to add that in, like they forgot the original problem of this anime. Because to them pleasing the curiosity of viewers is more important than explaining elements which help the actual Anime. Also my name is Armin , I say the most obvious things like why don't we attack titans...from the back...with cannons! and i'm a strategy genius! However, these personal views did not affect my way of grading this anime. I just hope the second season explains all this stuff.( it won't)\

Greatly enjoyed watching this. There were times when all the deaths made me want to rip my hair out (which is a good thing. Not a lot of animes make me want to do this when someone died), but the action is great, the characters are great.\
 I like how all the characters look ordinary (hard to know who the MCs are if they're all lined up) and great character development. Liked how the character's reactions were realistic (instead of acting like a hero without fear, etc) and how they acted like how a normal person would in their situation (Ex: How Hannes ran away\
          \
        with the children instead of trying to be the hero and kill the titan, Armin breaking down when you-know-who died, the soldiers seeing you-know-who in his formation and assuming he's a threat and taking great care to restrain him just in case, etc).\
The art is great and the animation is even better. All those 3dmg scenes are amazingly well done and the voice cast really fits my vision of the character's voices. \
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and I highly suggest that you watch it. There's not a lot of animes that are as well-done (enough that its probably on par with Naruto, Bleach and One-piece on popularity. maybe even more) yet still be realistic with emotions as well as not drag on for more than 200 episodes. \
Story: 10 (really, who would've thought of big humanoid monsters eating people? And made it into a great enough story that can actually seem believable if it were not for the giant humanoid monsters in it)\
Art: 9 (As I said, I really enjoyed it (the blue-ray version, not the TV version)\
Sound: 8 (I like the OSTs and the music. Voice cast did a great job too. Eren does yell a lot though)\
Character: 9 (Great character development and realistic with emotions/actions)\
Enjoyment: 10 (Really liked it. So far, its the only manga I've actually caught up with the updates)\
Overall: 9 (Great anime, great storyline and probably one of my favorite animes so far)\

    Okay so i just have to say after hearing of all the hype and popularity surrounding the series here in the west i came in expecting an anime as good as death note, since death note had the same amount of praise and popularity in 2007. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. I realize i would've been a lot more satisfied with the series if i didn't let people's high praise and acclaim for SnK influence my expectations. it is a VERY over rated series, but all that aside, here is the review:\
\
STORY: 6\
The premise and setting is excellent. The execution, not as\
          \
        much. the first episode created a fantastic set up that by the end of series, ended almost absolutely no where. I feel the main plot/point of the series, to find the origin of the titans and use  the knowledge found to end the rein of titan terror and to set humanity free, deviated greatly and the focus of the series became these sort of side issues that i honestly didn't care about. Dialogue is very unnatural. i found it hard to imagine actual people saying some things in real life. But probably the worst thing about the story is the fact that in the end, we are literally back at square one. Like everything you just watched might as well have not happened and the circumstance would have been exactly the same.\
ART: 10\
The art was so great it almost redeemed everything wrong about the series.The 3DMG was animated in a way that provided flawless motion and captivating movement. The gore added a sort of surreal dark-like element but wasn't over the top at all, which i appreciated. The character designs were great. There were no purple/pink/blue haired people. It was all realistically animated but almost dreamlike at the same time, being so vivid. Great animation.\
SOUND: 8\
Sound was awesome. The intensity of the music aided in making the action scenes even more enjoyable. The openings and endings sounded great. Nothing stuck out or sounded out of place. The music backed up the scenes very well without being overwhelming. The reason why i gave it an 8  instead of a 10 was because i never felt pressed to listen to any of the Soundtrack outside of watching the series. None of the OST's were particularly fantastic, but they were a perfect fit for the scenes they were put together with.... if that makes sense.\
CHARACTERS: 5\
Probably the most disappointing aspect of SnK. MC was your typical revenge driven hero who could never seem to formulate any thoughts or concerns  beyond his own goals. Heroine has no other sense of purpose aside from protecting MC. Her devotion to him is almost robotic. MC's side kick was the only character who had a shred of realistic depth. And by that i mean he was the only one who thought of things outside of his own set of objectives and purposes (his being to be of use to his friends, which he sort of achieved in a round about way by thinking of ways to solve the big issue instead of his own personal one). Side characters were so unremarkable. Every time one of them died and their names were mentioned i literally couldn't remember who it was, which means they served no purpose other than being a corpse added to the death list. \
ENJOYMENT: 6\
Even with its flaws, i still enjoyed the whole post-apocalyptic feel to it. I also enjoyed simply watched the images, since the animation was so fantastic. I was sort of bored at times though. Progression is very slow. And i would've been totally fine with the slow pace if it paid off in the end and if the things happening in the slow pace even mattered a whole lot when it came to the end of the show, but like i stated earlier i felt really unsatisfied with the fact that in the end everything i stuck through proved to be pointless, as in the situation is almost exactly the same as prior to all the work, battles, ect. No new information surrounding the titans was brought to light, there was still no way to effectively exterminate them, the main issue and conflict held no progress toward resolution what so ever. Which sort of made me question why i even watched any of it in the first place. If you're bored, looking for a show to pass the time with, this is it. If you're looking for something worthwhile to enthrall you, you might want to look elsewhere.\
OVERALL: 7\
I would've given this a 6 but the animation so so fascinating i had to add an extra point solely for that. I mainly wrote this review to warn people not to start watching SnK expecting it to live up to it's praise and acclaim. The first episode may trick you but please dont get to hyped up cause the direction it goes will only prove to be disappointing. I mean it is good, just not as great as what everyone cracks it up to be. but definitely a solid 'good'.  \

    Shingeki no Kyojin, also known as Attack on Titan, was supposed to be the next big thing, a shounen to match the height of Dragonball, Naruto, etc. In many ways it did do such a thing, being very enjoyable to watch, however, Shingeki no Kyojin also suffered various faults that made it very frustrating to watch. \
Mainstream media has been on the survivor bandwagon for a couple of years now with The Walking Dead on TV and The Hunger Games on the big screen, so it was only a matter of time before we got an anime that was about human survivor. Attack on Titan\
          \
        is that anime. The premise of this anime is very good and very original, titans are attacking humans and so humans built a big wall in order to stay alive. This is a very interesting concept because it makes humans look as if they are trapped in a cage. This concept is very original and has a lot of potential from the start. What Attack on Titan does very well is play around with this concept, this anime does not only explore what humans do inside the walls, but also what they do outside the walls. The walls create a beautiful setting and there seems to be something happening all the time, whether it be inside or outside the walls. \
At first glance the animation is superb. If one was to blindly watch this anime without taking the time to actually look at the animation they would think the animation is superb. However, if one does take the time to actually look at the animation, one would find many flaws. Reused shots, still shots, reused animation, flashbacks to previous animation are all examples of where one could see that this anime was under financial restriction. However, don't let this fool you, Attack on Titan is extremely beautiful. As stated before, the walls are a beautiful setting for this anime and the animation does a great job in showing this. The titans in particular are drawn extremely well and one can see a difference in almost every titan.\
And now we get to what I feel is the weakest part of this anime, the characters. It's very sad when I watch an anime and think the supporting characters are cooler than the main characters. Supporting characters, such as Levi and Hanji are interesting and make the show very enjoyable, while the main character Eren, for me, almost ruins the anime. What really grinds my gears with Eren is the fact that he doesn't seem to be learning while the anime is progressing. In one episode it will seem that he has learned a valuable lessen while in the following episode he will realize that that lesson was stupid. It is this lack of character development with the main character of this anime that really makes me sad. As stated previously, the supporting characters are very interesting, however, the fact that you only see them every other episode for a limited time makes me rate the character very low. \
Attack on Titan is very enjoyable. It is an action anime that doesn't let you down on the action. The very original story is enough to keep most people coming back every week. However, I feel that characters such as Eren must improve if this anime will be a classic. Season 2 promises us more action, more titan, and hopefully more character development. \

    10/10 everything: When Isayama came to Tokyo in order to pursue his dream at 21, that changed the anime industry forever. At 31, he's come to be a bestselling author that sells millions of copies and has had an anime which is being talked about by your classmates, your guy buddies, or by some person at the restaurant--or anywhere. I don't believe anyone can create a masterpiece like him: a battle manga that is out-of-this world, but somewhat connected to ours with its universal themes; political and melodramatic. \
Is there such a thing as perfection? No.\
Well, maybe in anime, there is (LOL). \
This one only\
          \
        comes one in a millennium. I am listening to the first opening song right now, Crimson Blow by REVO--and that's just one of the MILLION things you'll love about Shingeki No Kyojin. Imagine a music that drives you crazy: its tension and energy that makes you want to get back it. It becomes a living piece of the anime, that once heard of, you will think of a thousand memories you've had of it. \
Basically Attack on Titan is your not-so-typical science fiction that revolves on some appocalyptic society--and yes, IT IS F*CKING BETTER than the Hunger Games, Maze Runner, or any other film adaptation of books--one with blood and cannibalism involved, at least. Because there is such little to love in a genre that is not loved by many, the story is compelling to the point that it is LIKE A DRUG. \
Year 775--that was the setting, when a new breed of Titan appeared from outside the heavenly walls that sheltered and protected humanity: the Colossal Tital, kicking a hole out of Wall Maria and thus shattering every life that is in it. Wall Maria, one of the three walls humanity built, was invaded and immediately became Titan territory.\
But, the event wasn't just destruction; or the downfall of humanity we will all frown upon...\
...it was the day our protagonist was recreated: Eren Jaeger. \
'YAMERU!!!!!!'\
'I have decided to kill them all. Every single one of them.' \
Shit goes on, but not all hope is lost. Eren, who was probably ten at that time, travelled to Wall Rose along with his overprotective, adoptive sister Mikasa and good friend Armin. It was that time that they offered their lives to become cadets--to be trained as soldiers, it's either the battlefield or the farming. And Eren didn't even hesitate. It was like all his life, he was meant to be the slayer of Titans, and nothing ever broke his will (as Reiner once said). He was almost too perfect a character.\
'Too Perfect Characters'\
Watching the characters do their thing, got me curious. Observing them at some point and appreciating how beautiful and unique and special each of them are not makes me stop watching, despite how I'm supposed to be functioning in my normal life. Compared to other anime characters, these characters do not have a 'necessary evil' (other anime have irredeemable villains)...but they were united against the Titans, and I guess it was that struggle of keeping themselves alive every single day and protecting humanity that became the roots of their stronger, better selves. Jean, for example, who once opted for a lazy and comfortable life in the Interior, became a great leader soon after the fall of Shinagasa District (he's almost had the same determination level with Eren). Note: it doesn't have to be the Titans, either. The greatest enemy in this world, might be a different beast--it is human nature. Take Mikasa whose parents were killed by ordinary humans who just wanted to make a trade for money. What I mean is, these characters at some point lead us to something: You'll never know until you never try. \
Let's talk about the best characters created in this planet (in my opinion, apart from Eren of course): Levi, Mikasa and Hange. Personally, I am in love with Levi and could have been his lover on another timeline, but let's not get onto that...Levi is a stoic captain, greatly respected by his comrades, with his fearlessness and hidden passion to kill Titans. No wonder if you open Pinterest you'll often see fanart commissions of LevixEren--because they are parallels. What makes Levi different from everybody else, is apart from the fact that he'll probably live longer than the other characters, he'll live trying to piss others with his dry humor and he will still be beloved. He doesn't get anyone bored with him. Strange enough, it's a wonder why he doesn't have a girlfriend.\
Shall we get started on Mikasa? MIKASA. The beautiful, raven-haired girl, who saw how cruel the world was but still found it beautiful. It was no longer about keeping her childhood memories alive with Eren, or protecting him for the sake that they're family or shit--Kami, she is in love with him. She stayed by his side for as long as she could remember, she couldn't imagine a world where she wasn't. It was also his existence, perhaps, that added to her indomitable strength. ('I am stronger than you. All of you.'). What I love about her is, as her voice actress said--she's bad at expressing her emotions. She isn't perfect, but she has this morality. To save humanity. To save Eren. She 'is' perfect--well, for me. It made me curious how the author, Isayama, must have been a feminist. \
Hange is voiced by the same goddess of a voice actress that voiced Temari. The moment I heard her voice, my soul got more uplifted. Because most of the time, only the voice actress can truly convey the message of the character itself, enflaming the burning touch of the story. The difference between her and the Scout soldiers was her perspective that somehow there will come a time where humans and Titans will come along (that's how I see it). With her wicked passion to slay the human-devouring Titans, comes an inner longing for peace soon to be shed light through enough research and experiment, and most of all dangerous 'attempts'. It's like, you can't risk not risking--you'll die not knowing or not finding out. And I think Levi and her teammates respect her for it :) \

    Four years ago, a show was released.It was so popular and it broadened the anime medium to a crazy degree.A year later, the show had the delight to be put on Netflix. Over a span of two months was continuously watched by Yours truly.Little did this person know about the high popularity and as of now,May 11,2017 at 2.45PM,yours truly is now caught up and is currently on episode 6 or 7 of the second season of this show.And at this point, you should know what this show is by now.And if you don't know this show,you are very very rare species\
Note:\
This review is not\
          \
        made to be an introduction but my actual thoughts on this show.\
So minor spoilers will be about.\
\
Another Note:\
This review is made in occasion of the second season airing this season.While the season exists,this review will not mention the second season until the actual review of that season is made.EVENTUALLY\
\
Shingeki no Kyojin can be summed up in three words:Yelling, Dying, and Confusing.IF you don't know actual the premise of AOT, look at the synopsis because I'll be waisting my breath talking about the plot.The actual plot of attack on titan was such an interesting plot at the time.The motive for the story made for this story is amazing and the setup for this plot is extraordinary.Despite the amazing concept,the actual pay off is less than stellar.The story sets up so much and I really thought Eren,our main character, was going to accomplish more.The first episode promised so much to be discovered, like that Colossal Titan that messed up everything and that armored titan.The Colossal Titan shows up twice in the whole show and he is never seen again.We don't know what's in the basement, we don't know why Eren was chosen to be a Titan himself, we don't know why Titans don't eat each other if they can eat other Titans who are actually humans too, there is even an intermission card on the final episode that tells about a guy who was curious and dug a hole at the wall that surround the city,He was never heard from again.The largest problem I had with this show is that for every thing explained and wrapped up, a bunch of more things are unravelled and not explained.This show doesn't focus on wrapping up though, I understand that,but it could at least just try.Instead its the characters that get the limelight and some of them are hit and miss and if they are not that, they are going to die anyway.\
Preaching about the animation is like praising a broken record because the animation is spot on.The scenes involving the 3d maneuvering gear is amazing to look at in action.The style of Attack on Titan is distinct too because of how they outline the characters in a bold black line and the eyes of the characters are very detailed.The facial expressions from nervous to angry are nice too and blah blah blah everything looks nice.\
\
The sound of AOT is very epic.Things are more often loud than not.From the actual foley to the voice acting and even the soundtrack.I like how Hiroyuki Sawano combines the epic chorus with the sinister techno.Both openings are very epic.Despite how ICONIC the first opening is,I kinda like the second opening more with the chorus singing along and the well did 3D CGI.No one seems to think the first ED exist and I couldn't blame them since the second ED is way better and more memorable to listen to.\
If AOT slips up is with the characters.Ranging from character personality to plot armor.Starting with the one who everyone knows in love,Eren Yaegar or Yeager or whatever.A good 73 percent of Eren's dialogue is him yelling.He wants to murder all the titans and thats about it,but at the end of the show I think I could count on one hand how many Titans he actually kills.He is very headstrong and stubborn and there were times where I cheered for him and other times where I wanted Mikasa to punch him in the face.Speaking of Mikasa, she is hands down my favorite character.She is a bit overhyped though, people call her one of the most clever characters in anime and I can't really give her that award because she doesn't get as much screen time as everyone else. Mikasa is cool,awesome, quiet , and is not a very outgoing person but she is only when she needs to be. Armin was very hard to get used to.He is the character I relate to the most.One of the weakest being very clever but when things get out of control just sit there and scream like a baby.With Armin though, remember than I couldn't tell if Armin was a girl or a boy.It got that far.And all the other characters are the people who fight alongside these three to stop Titans from screwing up humanity.There's Sasha, another favorite of mine,the others who I forgot their names but remembered their faces,and Levi who is a very different character.While you expect a guy with a grumpy face and condescending attitude would be a jerk but he is actually a cool dude.He likes to clean, he is never surprised and when he actually does beat someone up it's very entertaining(or is it just me?).The problems with the characters is that there are so many of these characters being put in front of the camera.AND THE DEATHS.Here is my tip on predicting if someone dies in this show and identifying the important characters.:If they are not in the opening or endings(particularly the second ending),and depending on screen time if at all during particular moments, there is a very high chance of them dying.The death are over the top too but the actual impact of the deaths are missing because of how useless they are.No one's death besides the one at the beginning of the show really don't affect the plot at all.But I get it, It doesn't make sense to kill off the main character Game-of-Thrones style.It's just that there are times where the show really should have trimmed off the fat.cough*cough*Jean*cough*.\
\
Despite the glaring issues in this show,it makes it up by doing everything else right.The premise is very extraordinary and being in this world of AOT is fascinating.Also, when things go awry, you can't help but to just sit down and take in all the chaos that is happening.I feel like this is one of the shows that actually deserves it's hype.I may not have enjoyed this show as much as others, but the fanbase around this is very large but it is justifiable because,despite my nitpicking,this show is genuinely very good.I also like how the fans don't obsess over it sooooo much to the point where people can't take it seriously unlike...FNAF**shudder**.\
So after three years, I go into the second season with one goal in mind:to finally come to some kind of conclusion with all that's happen so far. And right now, is Attack on Titan Season 2 fulfilling that goal?\
That is only something for another review to answer \
Overall-8\
I think my view on the fanbase is so only because I haven't seen the dark side of the Attack on Titan fanbase.And won't be seeing it any time soon.\

    Toward the end of the series, a certain character tells Erin Yeager that in order to overcome monsters [titans and internal conflicts] one must also abandon their own humanity. This advice encapsulates the tone of the entire series that had been so dedicatedly upheld by the writers and director: the feeling of existential nihilism and all is for nought. Countless times the characters try to retain what little separates themselves from the Titans such as trust-building and compassion towards each other that the audience considers it commendable. Such held beliefs only further the tragedy when the humans cannot achieve any goals relying on compassion or\
          \
        camaraderie for each other. In this series, love doesn't conquer all, neither does teamwork. The titans as enemies do not admire their opponents, the humans, for how honorable they fight. Therefore, the human warriors throw all that to the wind and have learned to fight horrifically, as depraved as needed be, showing no mercy. The real eye opener is that this shift in tactics shows hardly any gain as well, which leaves humans in the complete dark making them wonder, “Hell! If fighting honorably won’t win the day, and fighting dirty doesn’t help either, how are we supposed to defeat the titans?” This is Existential Nihilism, the lack of any glimmer of hope, lack of any salvation, that no matter how the humans fight to survive, it is all for nought. This series can be thought of similarly to trench warfare during WWI where one army in the trenches would jump out (sometimes tens of thousands of troops at a time) and charge towards the enemy trench just 100 yards ahead through no man’s land only to be cut down completely and utterly by the other entrenched army. If the charging army actually won the forward trench, what cost in human life was it? Followed by, was the charge worth only a 100 yard gain? Attack on Titan juggles all these questions. Civil War general William T. Sherman said that, “There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.” Same with this world that there’s nothing rewarding or glorifying when the humans and titans fight each other. Attack on Titan makes sure to drill it in that their world is a horrifying reality of war.\
\
Simply read this ppg for the final review, if you are not interested in reading further. I gave this series 5/5 Stars (10 out of 10 equivalent on MAL) due to outstanding story, characters, music, voice acting, and overall direction. I anxiously wait for how this story will continue. Plenty of Macguffins weren’t fully explained, but not forgotten, (What the Hell is in that basement??).\
\
The anime I had watched up until this series had all been about empowering the protagonist and celebrating the intelligence of the main character. Whether that be Jotaro Kujo (from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure) finally outsmarting Dio Brando (which felt so good to watch!) or Gon Freecs and Killua Zoldyk (from Hunter x Hunter) teaming together to overcome the powerhouse Gaki, I always felt hope that though these characters may come across challenging foes, the final fight would not amount to nothing. Attack on Titan turns the tables by making humans prey and the titans predators and sticking to the nihilistic tone that was established early on and continued throughout. Wherase Shonen shows would spend time to teach the protagonists skills to dramatically improve outcomes, this show deconstructs that trope and argues that in the Attack on Titan world, all effort is for nothing. In one instance, an army of 250,000 soldiers stormed the titans to try to regain lost lands, and only 200 returned. In another instance, a squad of top brass cadets spent 3 years mastering their combat skills only for half to be wiped out by the titans within 30 seconds of their first encounter. Hell! If Quantity didn’t work against titans, maybe Quality will! Neither works. Back to f***ing square one! This deconstructed approach on the Shonen genre doesn’t empower characters, it humiliates them instead and makes me feel awful and sympathetic towards them. \
The original theme songs are excellent because the opening choir lines invoke a sense of urgency. It is a collaboration of choir, rock band, brass fanfare, and synthesized string section. This epic hodgepodge also implies that when watching this series there are no rules regarding anything, everything is up in the air, and nothing is really predictable. That is the exact tone of the series. The presto tempo established by the electric guitar rifts impresses an image of stampeding humans towards or away from danger. Chromatic modulation upwards also paints a frantically growing danger, as if from the humans’ perspective the titans are closing in on them. The rest of the soundtrack is much like this. \
The dedication to the absurdist, nihilistic tone I thought was outstanding. The tone was consistently depressing to the point of being emotionally draining. I almost cried during many instances of intense emotions and combat helplessly watching comrades falling by the hundreds wondering, what’s it all for? Though one may think that this depressing sentiment would lower my rating of the show, the fact that Attack on Titan was so consistently sombering and never randomly something else makes this series focused.\
The only silver lining in this Lovecraftian world is in the love that binds all the cadet characters together. In addition to there being I feel a romantic spark between Erin Yeager and (Insert Name Here), there is a brotherly love that Erin has towards his comrades. Because of this love they have, when certain characters are on the brink of insanity, camaraderie love reals in and reassures each other. Much like in real world combat forces, even though cadets and marines may despise each other’s opinions, they are willing to lay down their lives saving each other. What a reassurance (this is deconstructed when two cadets debate over whether or not this altruistic philosophy is effective or not. Does it really pay off, or do humans just expect each other to save their friends? Plus, “love thine enemy” has no place in this battlefield). Paternal and maternal love for Erin occurs when specific veteran warriors take him under their wing. The scenes where friendship and camaraderie are developed are refreshing breathers between actions.\
This series struck me to be similar to Albert Camus’s 1947 book, The Plague. Both stories deal with a quarantined city where humanity tries to survive through an absurd existence. Both are Absurdist stories. Though most survivors huddle together accepting their penned up fate, both main characters refuse to sit idly by and instead try to make a difference, no matter how small that difference is, or how difficult it is to achieve. From accepting fate to trying to change it shifts these stories form Absurdist literature to Existential literature. The difference between both styles is that in Absurdist literature, the characters passively accept fate. In Existential literature, the characters try to actively change fate, or try to fathom it and persevere despite setbacks. The titans’ motives cannot be understood. They are Lovecraftian like Cthulhu (or the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise) in that no matter how much effort the humans put into understanding their enemy (as knowing is half the battle!) nothing new is learned. How wonderful. Despite that setback, the humans persevere and continue trying to learn about the enemy if only modicum of knowledge is gleamed. This defiance towards the inevitable makes this story Existential literature.\
“Once upon a time, there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly, that everyone died! The end!” “That didn’t make me feel better at all, Patrick!” The point of that famous Spongebob scene was that Patrick’s fable was supposed to provide a moral to the story, despite how hard the ugly barnacle’s life was. But there was no moral. The barnacle just lived an absurd life. No matter how patiently Spongebob waited for Patrick to provide meaning to the ugly barnacle’s existence, none was provided, the barnacle simply was. Same deal with this show. The titans do not kill humans for any other reason other than because they do. This is not lazy storytelling to blame the writer for. Such is the nature of Existential Absurdist literature. A retelling of Patrick Star’s fable for Attack on Titan would be, “There were survivors huddled in the last village on earth. Many of them were eaten by grotesque Titans. That’s it! No reason why!” What a slap in the face that is! So refreshing to watch an anime that slaps me in the face! I mean what was I expecting? A kick as protagonist slicing titans by the hundreds? How shortsighted of me.\
This show also provides insight to what life must be like on the second highest rank in the food pyramid. Until this show, I never appreciated that we are on the top of the food chain, unrivaled by far, every other animal subject to us! I never considered how horrifying it must be to be second place and to be abused by the first place monsters. In this series, Titans reign supreme, humans come second. Though we are still in second place out of millions of other species (which is pretty damn good placement!) humans are driven to the brink of extinction. This show turns the tables and humans become the prey. \
I am very intrigued that this series is so popular with the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong people interestingly see themselves as the walled up humans living in an absurd reality where outside of the walls exists and impending colossal threat. Hong Kong interprets their “titans” as the Chinese government. This realization is so moving to them that the Chinese government banned all of Shingeki no Kyojin in mainland China. The manga and anime are influential enough to be censored by mainland China. That’s points in my book. Freedom of Speech! Freedom of Press! USA! USA! \
Thank you for reading all of this review! I know I had a lot to say, and didn’t always organize how to say it, but thank you for sticking through it to the end!",

    Attack on Titan is a great anime which follows the main character as he vows to kill all the titans who have nearly caused humans to go extinct. The art in this anime is incredible. It is amazing to watch and the shots are beautifully composed. Although, sometimes there are stills instead of animated shots which is common in anime but this doesn't take away from the visuals what so ever. The sounds is also very well done and the anime has a great first intro. The character are well done but probably won't be your any of your favourite anime characters. This show is\
          \
        very enjoyable to watch but is very brutal. For me the brutality was a plus and was fun to watch but also heartbreaking at times. The story kept you theorizing about everything and what it all means which was great. I am very excited to see what will happen in season 2. Overall this is a great show everyone should watch with a compelling story and stunning visuals.\

    Attack on Titan sounds better to me than Shingeki no Kyojin, even though it's a grammatical nightmare.\
Story:\
So, we have basic shounen storytelling here. A boy experiences something (in this case his mother being eaten by a titan) and swears to accomplish a goal (kill all titans). We see him grow stronger, overcome odds and gain additional powers. However, the setting of Attack on Titan feels very fresh, the plot not being a repeat of something else (though apparently the story is influenced by Muv-Luv Alternative or so I read). I have two problems here though. One is the pacing. All the time that they skipped\
          \
        could have been used to make us more attached to the characters, but they become who they are very fast. That's wasted potential. More annoying is the fact, that it has no conclusion. I know, this is an ongoing manga, but it could have had something of an ending. Instead it just kinda stops.\
6/10\
Art:\
At first I was really impressed. This artstyle and animation have movie quality and they don't take much of a hit as the show continues. The characters and titans all look unique, the scenery is looking really good. The CGI effects could've been a little better, but I've seen far worse than this. In total, this is one of the better looking Anime of its time.\
9/10\
Sound:\
Attack on Titan has gained a lot of praise for its soundtrack and rightfully so. The mood of the music is almost always spot on, though they did use some songs that didn't fit at all two or three times. The first opening is great, the second still good but inferior. The second ending is very good, the first is okay. The cringe-worthy German makes it miss 9 points by half an inch.\
8/10\
Characters:\
First of all, the characters all have unique personalities, which is a very good thing. Some act more reasonable than others, some are brave, some cowards. This works out really well, but there are some minor flaws. One thing is comic relief characters like Sasha or Hange as well as comedic scenes in general. This is a pretty serious show and they feel a little out of place. Another thing is the amount of characters. I have a hard time feeling sorry for somebody who dies if I can't even remember who that person is. This got better later on, but in the first 5-10 episodes I had problems here. Still, the characters drive this anime and they do it well.\
8/10\
Enjoyment:\
Surprisingly, I had a hard time digesting the brutality of the early episodes, but I guess that was a necessary step to show that this is not a \"nobody ever dies\" anime like other shounen often are. As the characters grew on me I got more into the show and enjoyed it more. I guess you just have to be in the right mood to start watching Attack on Titan, but it gets better the longer it goes (even to the point where I found it to end too soon, but a second season will surely happen).\

    To be honest, I was hesitant to watch this one due to all the hype surrounding it. However back in the summer of 2014 I watched the clips of the two openings and immediately went to iTunes and bought both songs before even watching the show.\
About a month later I gave it a watch and it quickly became one of my favorite anime series. Not since viewing Death Note in 2010 had I been so engrossed in an anime, staying up to early hours just to view the next episode.\
Story (9):\
This is one of the most original concepts I've seen in anime. It's an action\
          \
        series in which the humans are having to fight for survival against these giant humanoid creatures called titans that kill humans for no known reason. A wall was constructed to keep the titans out and it worked for years. However one day  an abnormal titan broke the wall allowing the others inside and plunged the human race into hiding while those in the military fight for humanity's survival.\
What I like about this anime is that the danger of the situation is real. No character is guaranteed survival. Not even the main characters, not even the important characters, not even the fan favorites. Any character can die at anytime, and in some brutal ways.\
This show is heavy from the beginning. The first episode is memorable due to how horrifying the violence and numbers of deaths in that single opening episode. A very important loss that motivates the main character happens in an unforgettable scene. The fear of these characters (both important and nameless ones) is apparent as they realize their hopeless situations too late.\
There is a lot of good action. The characters have to rely on their equipment, strategy, and chance (as even the most strategic plan can still fail due to poor luck). That alone makes this anime stand out among others in its genre.\
The situation is serious and it treats its audience seriously too.\
However it is not flawless. One complaint I have is that some of the conversations can go on for longer than necessary. One instance in particular are Armin's monologues. At one point I even said outloud, \"Okay, Armin, you made your point, can we move on with the story?\"\
In all I was intrigued with every episode and couldn't wait to find out what happened in the next one. I eagerly await the second season.\
Characters (9):\
\
Out of this huge cast there are only two characters I'd say I dislike. Ninety nine percent of the characters are believable and endearing which gives an even greater impact when they are suddenly slaughtered.\
To begin with I like the main character Eren. He is far from perfect and his personality may not be the best, but his determination and lust for revenge is what keeps him going. It's easy to feel this kid's struggle (keep in mind he's only fifteen) as he's watched so many of his friends fall. Despite all that he holds tight to his goal, and cares deeply for his friends, which I find admirable.\
Next is the main female Mikasa. I do like her as a character, especially her devotion to her friend and last remaining family-Eren. However I feel that she is probably too perfect. Even with that she still remains a likable character.\
The character I feel has the most development in this anime is Jean. He starts out as a selfish jerk, but over the course of the twenty five episodes grows into a likable and relatable character.\
Of course Levi is awesome. I can't write this review without mentioning him. He is such a unique, mysterious character. I actually didn't like him at first, but he quickly grew on me within a span of two episodes. While he may act cold, it's clear that he carries a heavy burden and cares deeply for his subordinates.\
For the sake of keeping this review brief, I can't go into every amazing character. Such as Armin who also grows from a timid kid to a great asset with his skills of strategy. The goofy, yet brave Sasha. The energetic and eccentric Hanji who gives some comic relief in this otherwise desolate world. And of course my favorite character Krista/Historia. \
In all I found the characters to be a strong point of this anime.\
Art (10):\
I love the art in this anime. All the characters have a unique design. Even the minor characters and the titans themselves are given distinguished features.\
The backgrounds are beautiful. I like the whole medieval vibe the setting gives off. The scale is huge-both inside the walls and outside. I like watching the characters zoom through these setting on their maneuver gear.\
That brings me to the animation. Everything is solid and fluid. The action scenes are entertaining. There is so much detail that brings those scenes to life such as steam rising from a titan's injury, or debris slamming into those standing by when the wall in knocked in. \
One of my favorite scenes is when one particular titan is fighting the other titans-and the movement when he uses his teeth to fight as his arms are out of order. I've watched that scene countless times due to the fantastic animation (I can't talk anymore on that scene without revealing a huge spoiler). Pretty much there is nothing sloppy as far as animation is concerned.\
In short this anime is visually pleasing to watch.\
Sound (10):\
As mentioned earlier, the whole reason I watched this show in the first place is because I like the opening songs so much I decided to give it a chance, and boy am I glad I did.\
The two openings, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" are both catchy songs that gets the audience pumped up to the fast pace of this anime. Of course I love \"Guren no Yumiya\" quite a bit more than the second opening.\
The original soundtrack has a lot of amazing songs all which go perfectly for the scenes they accompany. One in particular is actually titled, \"Attack on Titan\" which is used during some memorable moments and I was happy to find that song on iTunes as well. In all this is one of the best anime soundtracks I've ever heard.\
The voice acting in the original audio is stellar. I can't think of better voice actors for Eren, Levi, and Armin-each voice fit the characters perfectly. I was actually disappointed when I watched one episode of the English dub after hearing the fantastic work of the subbed voices. However to its credit, the English dub actresses for Annie and Mikasa did a good job.\
Enjoyment (9):\
I think it's no surprise by now that I really enjoyed watching this anime. It pulled me into its story and made me care to find out what would happen in the next episode. \
Some parts of this anime might be hard to sit through for some audiences. This isn't a happy story. However, I think that's what makes it so effective-it's not meant to be happy. There is a high certainty that none of these great characters will make it out alive, or even if the humans will win. Again that's what makes this story unique.\
Conclusion (9):\
It's been a long time since I saw an anime I liked this much. It has a great story, likable characters, a real struggle for those characters. The art is amazing, the animation fantastic. I would rate the soundtrack among my top five favorite anime soundtracks.\
In all I would recommend this anime to everyone thirteen and older. Anyone under that age group might be turned away by the violence and seriousness of the story. I watched it through with intrigue and would gladly watch it again.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin was the first anime that I ever watched, and I can't think of a better way to start my journey.\
The storyline of Shingeki no Kyojin is very unique. It's not every day that you see titans running around and people flying through the air. The suspenseful theme of the show leaves you always wondering what will happen next. And the pace is flawless. I never felt bored, yet I never felt like the show was moving too fast.\
Both the art and sound in this show are fantastic. I'm the kind of person that will drop a show if the art style bothers\
          \
        me too much, so finding a show like Shingeki no Kyojin makes me happy. The soundtracks are also pretty amazing, and they definitely fit with the theme of the show.\
While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I only really fell in love with a few characters. I still liked other characters, but only a few really 'clicked'. I believe that this is where the show went right. There's a character for everyone. All of the characters are very unique and well-developed, and many have interesting backstories that are fun to learn about.\
The emotions that are evoked while watching a show is very important. Shineki no Kyojin did a very good job of \"hitting me right in the feels\", as I like to say. This made it a much better show overall. You get very emotionally attached to some characters and find yourselves feeling the same things they do. There was a mixture of laughter, tears, and everything in-between incorporated to create this fabulous anime.\
In the end, Attack on Titan is an amazing anime, with a great plot, amazing art and soundtracks, and great characters. I would recommend this to anyone who is new to anime, or even if you have been watching anime for a while. Anyone can enjoy watching this fantastic show.\

    Attack on Titan? Weird name eh? But the anime itself is weird, so kudos there.  I mean, come on, giant humanoid creatures eating other humans, what's fun in that? Well, read my review and find out why a lot of people praise Attack on Titan, I'll be calling at AoT from now on. \
\
----------Story--------- 10/10\
When it comes to story of AoT, we should never look at it from the main character's point of view but look at it as humanity's fight against titans, not as Eren's fight against titans. Eren is our main protagonist by the way.  \
So, due to unfortunate circumstances and\
          \
        a tragedy, Eren has sworn to kill all the titans, a herculean task which sounds near impossible. Now, this may sound like a revenge plot which many people may consider cliche but there's actually more, THE SETTING! THE GOD DAMN SETTING! Honestly, I've never seen a setting like this in an anime before, this is what I would call unique, sure there have been attacks against humanity but nowhere like this. AoT's setting is what moves its story, humans are at the verge of extinction because of these titans who eat humans, they created huge walls to protect themselves and they've got a pretty large area safe inside the walls. Probably around Japan's size maybe. \
But this setting is so intriguing, there are so many mysteries and questions that are answered as the anime progresses, of course not all of them are answered. Questions about titans, questions about walls, questions about who built those walls, so many questions, that it keeps you constantly interested. Another great thing about story is the \"WHAT THE FUCK\" moments, there were so many episodes where I was gasping, total jaw drop moments where you internally scream inside. \
\
----------Art/Animation--------- 10/10\
Art style is fantastic, perfectly suits the anime too. The titans look creepy, the characters look solid (Not literally) and there are several moments where you can actually see the hard work they've put in, like when the whole city landscape is shown, each individual building has to be drawn at the correct place. All in all, the art style is vibrant and gritty when it needs to be. \
Animation on the other hand are top notch as well, the 3DM gear characters use allow them to fly around, a bit like spiderman but much cooler, those animations are fantastically animated. The animation is godlike smooth at times. You don't see any jitterish animation in combat, it's fluid and perfect. \
\
----------Sound--------- 10/10\
HEART RACING! Seriously, special special kudos to the soundtrack composer Hiroyuki Sawano. \
The soundtrack is so perfect, it makes you hopeless, then hopeful again, hopeless and then hopeful again, it's the constant tension and \"What the hell are they going do?\" \"Oh my god, they are fucked.\" feeling in the soundtrack. It's just perfect. \
One moment, the soundtrack will be high and phenomenal, pumping your heart up for a grand battle and in the next second when it becomes a one sided massacre, you'll feel it in the soundtrack, it changes accordingly and I am sure everyone who watches AoT will love it. \
The openings and endings are good, first OP kind of lets you know about the state at which humans are, hopeless but still holding the will to fight, the second OP is more like \"Wings of freedom\" haha. I enjoyed both of them. \
\
----------Characters--------- 8/10\
Rule no. 1 - Never get attached to any of the characters. \
Rule no. 2 - Read the first rule again. \
Your favorite character who you fanboy/fangirl about can get divided into pieces and get eaten brutally in front of your eyes with a horrific soundtrack, not to mention the despair filled cries of your favorite character and there's nothing you can do about it.  Hajime Isayama, the manga writer, he's cruel and you can do nothing about. He just wants to see his characters burn LOL. AoT is the Game of Thrones of anime. \
Why I gave it an 8 was because most characters don't leave an impact, except Levi maybe, because he's badass. Eren and others are given the treatment because main protagonist but everyone else nah (As of first season - 25 episodes). \
Most characters in AoT have this bland feeling to them, sure they are entertaining and fun to watch but since none of their backstories have been revealed yet, you can't actually sympathize or do anything for them. But sure, the characters are fun. \
Potato girl hahahahahaha. \
----------Enjoyment--------- 10/10\
I enjoyed? OH MY GAWD (I am an atheist), I ENJOYED IT A LOT! \
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERFECTIONIST ANIME EVAR! \
----------Overall--------- 9/10\
FOR THE MOTHER OF GOD, give it a try lol, watch till at least the 5th episode, if it's not your type, move on but I don't think most will xD. \
I enjoyed Attack on Titan a lot, I have a lot of sweet memories with it and it certainly is one of the most rewatchable anime. \
I have this habit of re watching the good scenes of AoT again and again, just for the kicks of the soundtrack and tragedy hehe.\
So, yeah people - Give it a shot. \
Overall - An anime with a intriguing story, epic soundtrack and animations. ",

    How do I even write a review about this tremendously heartening story! I just want to say that I cannot wait for season 2 and it's so very soon. \
This anime is sure as hell not mediocore, and I am glad that I'm not a cynical person who judges top rating anime for it's high rating.\
I really did enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin takes you to another world and the charachters devolopment is great and I knew that ever since I got goosebumps during the first episode. \
Shingeki no Kyojin is full of horror, action, grief and proof of true friendship and loyalty. I\
          \
        loved all the 25 episodes. Let's wait for the second season! \

    Hey look! A mainstream anime that's actually good. That's great! Wait what's happening? Oh no! Typical anime bullshit is creeping in! We have to stop it! No it's too late! Nooooooo!\
That would be my description of this show. \
You might like this anime if:\
-You like shonen\
-You want an anime with a good ammount of action\
-You're looking for a show that will draw you in immensely\
-You are an anime newcomer. This show is perfect for introducing people to anime\
You might dislike this anime if:\
-You're not into shonen. This will probably not change your mind\
-You hate typical anime bullshit\
-You don't want to get through the bad parts\
          \
        to get to the good ones\
-You dislike edgy main characters. The edge is strong with this one\
Story: 8\
First half is PHENOMENAL! The introduction to the setting of this anime is perfect, the feels hit very soon, and somehow this show made me care for a character that had maybe 10 minutes of screen time! This anime has probably the best first episode I've ever seen! And it didn't stop there! It started introducing great characters and adding in great comedic relief just to suddenly hit you with drama again. It had perfect balance! Not to mention all the twists and turns that made the story interesting! And then the second half came. It started treating you, the viewer, like an idiot, adding characters with dumb ideals, that seemed forced and made a reveal so obvious, that, when it occured, it almost felt like an insult. Not everyone has to feel this way, but I definetely do. Also plot convenience is convenient. Ok, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but i feel offended when I think about how good the first half was. \
Art and Animation: 10\
This show's animation is one of the best ones out there. Without spoiling much the scenes that need to look good look amazing, and the others are great too! The animation is extremely fluid, to say the least. Some scenes even left me with my jaw on the floor! It looks that good. The art style is also nice. Character design is decent and the titans are probably one of the creepiest enemies ever. To sum it up: This show is a joy to look at.\
Sound: 11\
I usually don't do this \"eleven out of ten\" bullshit, but this is an exception. I am going to go on a limb here and say, that Attack on Titan OST is the best anime soundtrack ever. You should just listen to it by yourself! I do almost every day since watching this anime a few years ago. Let me mention the opening as well. If you haven't heard it somewhere, you are probably a robot. It's almost as famous as the anime itself, if not more. It deserves it though as it is FANTASTIC!\
Characters: 7\
This show's three main characters are: Edgen, a scared smart guy and Supergirl. Two out of three may be not liked by some people. Including me. Eren AKA Edgen is the most edgy character you'll see. You can understand it, but that doesn't change the facts. He is not the worst main character, but he feels kinds replacable, and that's a huge sin for an anime. Armin AKA Mop Top is the weak, smart, easily scared guy. His character is one of the biggest stereotypes I've ever seen. Mikasa AKA Supergirl is  like the mascot for this anime, but her character is actually quite complex. It probably has something to do with the fact, that she has an entire episode solely for her backstory. And that she's totally awesome. The side character do their job well. There are comedic relief characters, rival characters, friend characters, teacher characters and leader characters. Basically anything you'll expect out of a shonen. But they are all quite likeable. Well until the second half of the anime. The characters introduced after that seem forced. They do have SOME character, but they mostly seem like they are there for the sake of being there.\
Enjoyment: 9\
I started seing all of the mistakes of this anime while rewatching it. I didn't notice them before because I was having so much fun. It lived up to the hype it got, at least in my opinion! I can't wait for the second season, as it may get rid of everything I dislike about this anime! I can only hope. I even stopped reading the great manga just to wait for the anime to catch up, no matter how long it takes. That is saying a lot about how much I liked it. Even with the mistakes, it's the enjoyment that you feel while watching that counts the most after all right?\
Overall: 8\
Without rewatching it I would give this show a nine. I kind of regret it now. But let me tell you this anime is definetely worth watching. The hype is one hundred percent understandable. If you haven't done this already go and watch this anime right now. It's as good as they say. Just don't rewatch it. Please. And don't delve on things too much. It may ruin the show for you.\

    A hundred years ago mankind was close to extinction due to man-eating titans suddenly appearing. As a last resort they built three humongous walls to protect them from these monstrosities. At the time the story takes place mankind lives in peace again, not worrying much about the titans outside of the walls. The military responsible for guarding the walls is slacking off 'cause there is nothing to do and the recon troops who do expeditions into titan-territory are not taken that seriously and are called a waste of resources. In this rather peaceful scenario the unthinkable happens: Titans break the first wall and remind mankind\
          \
        of the ancient day's terror. So the batlle for mankind's survival begins anew.\
\
This kind of apocalyptic scenario holds a lot of potential: The struggle of mankind against the nearly unbeatable foe, can we uphold humane acts at the brink of extinction?, can we fight the seemingly unavoidable?.\
A story of despair, tragedy and drama is about to unfold. \
But it does not quite work. The promising setting gets ruined by its realization.\
First of the way of animating seems pretty outdated, everytime a character is supposed to look sad,concerned,serious or angry there are black stripes above his eyes and on his forehead. This does not amplify the impression the situation is supposed to present or depicts a realistic facial feature it just looks bad. In addition to that the supposedly looking nemesis of mankind, the titans, that are meant to look scary and frightening look godawful. One looks like Santa Claus, the other runs like a mentally disabled and so on, rarely any titan fulfills its purpose of being scary, they act more as comic relief and are so destroying the mood that is supposed to be generated. \
Next up are the characters and i had a problem with the protagonist Eren Jaeger. He wants to kill every titan and is not afraid of telling everyone but when it actually comes to killing one he is from being capable of doing so but still insists he would be able to. Other than that the characters are okay, some are better developed and implemented some are worse but I missed \"special\" characters, most of the presented ones are shallow and pretty simple designed with not much of character development.\
The story is a tricky point; I really liked the idea behind it but it starts incredibly slow. With \"only\" 25 episodes at hand there is no time for a slow start like you see in longer anime. This way a lot of the tension, which the scenario and setting in this series heavily relies on, disappears and it gets dull and sadly this happens for me. This results in the real action only starting at the end of this anime leaving you with a lot of unanswered questions and a barely progressed plot. The story also lacks authenticity at some points, i can not go too much into detail because of spoilers but the military strategies and political actions are highly questionable and, in my opinion, irrealistic for this situation the acting persons are in.\
I need to praise the soundstrack and openings though, they are fitting perfectly into the mood at the perfect time with the perfect sound, what the story tries to depict gets perfectly presented by the audial effects. \
TL;DR: Great idea with great potential but not well enough executed, story has too many flaws and plot does not answer enough questions or has not even really started, perfect soundtrack, pathetic giants totally not presenting what they are supposed to, average charater, mediocre or worse artistic depiction.\
I do think though that a secound season with  the plot really picking up steam could score a perfect 10, this season/series merely fulfills the role of an exposition.\

    When you cast away all the flavor and skin, at it's core it's a story about heroes which fight the bad guys, odds always stacked against them.\
That being said, the setting is very gripping, clever, and subtly hints at relevant and serious themes. Characters are lovable but don't feel like they get much development beyond the setup values they are assigned at the start. Yet still, I cared very much about them and my stomach was twisting as I was watching what was going to happen to them next. Which pretty much sums it up. Even if, at times, it doesn't offer much in term\
          \
        of complexity when you try to dissect it and analyze it, it is thrilling to experience. It's the best distraction I afforded myself this year.\
Some Pros:\
Great setting. Nice visuals, even if at times a bit too bloody, with a very attractive combat style, great music which follows it well and promises quite some nerd-chills. The way titans are colored, their facial expressions just make them exceptionally creepy, as if they walked down from a weird modern art piece. They only add more to the special atmosphere of the show.\
Some Cons: \
Untimely internal monologues which can eat up nearly whole episodes. The very short episodes, not even 20 minutes of original material per, create inappropriately small chunks for how slowly the story progresses at times. I watched it all at once, but I can imagine it being a bit frustrating to endure through so many cliffhangers. Combat feels like it is driven by personal \"anime awesomeness\" skill rather than teamwork or some other clever aspect a tad more often than I'd like. It feel like there was a missed opportunity here to avoid falling into that mold.\
Overall, it's a elegant take on action packed anime. I personally recommend it. \

    Oh, shingeki no kyojin. I remember when I was a fanboy of it here. A time when I saw animes with the brain totally turned off, and only called for action. I really enjoyed it, because of their brilliant, well-produced action scenes. And over time I realize that I did not like any character. In a tragic story of survival and serious like this, it lacks well-written characters, but no, they are totally shallow and poorly characterized. So let's go\
Story: A premise of humans vs titans, the humans trying to survive the titans, but soon after are humans who have seen titans against titans ...\
          \
        That's where the story kills, because from there arises a lot of idiot mysteries that are not solved , and that later more mysteries arise which again is not resolved. Shingeki no kyojin n is about exploring your world, it is about hiding your world. The mystery of shingeki in kyojin is childlike, you spend so much time waiting for a mystery that it is not solved. And not only that, it protects your characters, let's go to the characters ...\
Eren: A flawed shinji, it's interesting to be weak and whiny, because it makes him a more realistic character, but that did not do any good, as he turns titan, and with that he takes more courage and makes him blind with his revenge. It is an almost one-dimensional character\
Mikasa: Undimensional gary stu, has practically zero characterization\
Levi: Gary stu one-dimensional, this certainty has 0% characterization.\
Armin: He is only a fearful character protected by stronger characters, like mikasa, eren and levi.\
Secondary: Other characters that I do not care, and only so to cause shock to the viewer ...\
\
Story: 5/10: The story is very weak from the moment it contradicts the premise itself and children's mysteries arise.\
Characters: 3/10: The characters are totally shallow and poorly developed and very poorly detailed, it's the worst thing of the show.\
Sound: 9/10: The opening is epic, the soundtrack too, it fits a lot with the type of story!\
Art: 7/10: The animation is good, the design is not that creative, but it's good.\
Enjoyment: 8/10: Great fun with shingeki no kyojin thanks to its epic action scenes and epic soundtrack!\
Overall: 5/10: Not everything is so bad here, the animation is good, the action scenes are very well produced, and the anime has a serious and mature mood, has no fanservice or school scenes. The soundtrack is good, and the dubbing is good too. But in the rest is just a story lost in children's mysteries with completely shallow characters. Shingeki tries to be an evangelion of the present, but fails miserably in this.\

Story: 9/10\
The story goes that people walled off a large portion of land, and the wall is 50 meters high. The Titans never got in, until a 50m Titan appears and opens the outer wall. Hell breaks loose, and it is utter chaos. I personally enjoyed the story, as it was interesting and fascinating to learn how humans fought, what the titans did, etc. \

Blood. Lots of blood. The brutality in this anime is very gory. You see dead people everywhere, and in fact\
          \
        see some of them killed in front of your eyes. The setting in each episode is nicely done. The facial expressions of everybody is amazing, as it captures the horrors of war.\
Sound: 8/10\
The 1st opening really hypes you up for the rest of the show, and the 2nd opening is on par. There is background music when monologue happens, and when a characters persuades someone, there is dramatic music as well. Nothing really blows you away besides the opening.\
Character: 10/10\
This is where most of the magic happens. You meet people, you learn about their motives, their past, their  future, and potentially their downfall. The MC, Eren Jager, has his attitudes and personality change throughout the anime, and it transforms him as a human being. 2 other characters, Mikasa and Armin, are bonded with Eren on his adventure to save humanity. Each character in AoT has an important role, and cannot be replaced.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
I enjoyed AoT a good  amount. There were some slow backstory episodes that somewhat lost my interest, but the fighting scenes made up for it. The animations when humans use their \"devices\" are amazing, and I could watch those small scenes for a while.\
Overall: 9/10\
I would recommend this to people that can handle blood, gore, and want a good story. This anime definitely lived up to the hype, even though I wasn't apart of it.\

I love the anime because sometimes things that you didn’t expect just happens. Overall it’s an outstanding anime and is a 10/10 for me. I recommend this anime if you are just starting to watch anime or if you’re just bored. \

    Should I take the fanboy or hater approach? I know! How about I take the unbiased approach? Yeah, that's what I'll do! To begin with, Attack on Titan is not the best anime of all time. I personally have seen better animes. However, it is not a bad anime by any sense of the word. Rather Attack on Titan is very good...just not the best ever. What stood out to me the most about the anime was how gritty and dark it was. The art style does a great job at this, making the Titans look creepy with their constant smiles and exoskeltetons, making the\
          \
        blood frequent, and making the lighting in general dark. Though the art wouldn't, in my opinion, be considered pretty, it does a great job at capturing the desperate tone of the humans and the dark themes of man-eating monsters. The next thing that stood out to me was the story. I was drawn in from the first episode by the plot, and for that reason, I could not stop watching. If you like the classic tale of the underdog and the classic tale of vengeance then you will love this anime. It's like Rocky Balboa starring as the main character in Gladiator (but not a fail). Avoiding spoilers, main character Eren Jaeger, along with friends Mikasa and Armin, must climb the ranks of the military in order to get revenge on the Titans for destroying their homes and families. Eren is an awful fighter, but his strong will is what pushes him forward. The plot sounds simple (partially because I simplified it), but it works. I found myself cheering for Eren to succeed because I wanted him to win so badly. The third thing I noticed was the amazing action sequences. Though, I have yet to see very much anime, nothing I have seen compares to these fight scenes. They are extremely fast paced, yet easy to follow and make you wish you had some 3D Maneuver Gear of your own. I am still amazed at how good these were. Now, to the weak parts of the anime. For one, there is so much political dialogue that you nearly get bored with the show just before an epic battle scene peaks your interest again. These talks are what weaken the story for me completely and give the plot a 9/10 for me. Next is the character. There are some great characters such as Eren, Levi, and Mikasa. Then there are characters that are just there to constantly get in the way and mess things up. Some characters aren't even memorable, and I would find myself forgetting their names every once in awhile, and after the first five episodes or so, the character development slows though it doesn't go away. The next thing is the enjoyment factor. I love this anime, but I have to say that I don't see myself watching it a second time. The anime is almost too serious for its own good. There are just too many heavy emotional scenes, blood, and most of all, boring dialogue to get me to watch it again. This anime is great though for a one time watch and you won't regret it. Both openings are both mentioning as great OPs, and the sounds was very good, just not extremely memorable. This anime gets an 8 from me because it is fantastic, just not the greatest of all time.\

    I often come across as a snob, but what I truly abhor, and what often forms the basis of my seemingly snobby negative reviews, is boredom. Though I entered the anime world out of an interest in so-called \"art films\" (if you can really make a definition for that) and like to find shows and movies where intellectual engagement plays a part in my enjoyment level, I will give credit to a purely entertaining series when it is due. That brings me to Attack on Titan, one of the most popular series of recent years and one that, given its ubiquity in fandom as of\
          \
        2014, appears to be on its way to becoming iconic. Like other so-called \"classic\" series I fear it will reach a point at which criticism is impossible, not because it is devoid of flaws but because such status can make a series immune to being called out on them. Indeed, Attack on Titan is far from flawless, but its popularity, and perhaps even its \"classic\" status when it does come, are deserved in my opinion. It is a thoroughly entertaining series.\
Attack on Titan succeeds largely because its world is, if imperfectly constructed, terrifying and grim, such that I couldn't help but feel the hopelessness felt by the Titans' targets and, later, be stirred up by the war against them. In part, this owes to the show's visuals. The Titans themselves, more than being simply large and homicidal, are eerie, with human features but with proportions clearly just different enough from normal humans to be offputting. Their mouths open too-widely, they move in a slight \"waddle\" that makes watching them incredibly unsettling, and the gaze behind their eyes is simultaneously mindless yet completely horrifying. The arguments made that this show has promoted rightwing political beliefs could certainly be substantiated by this aesthetic choice, but it works wonders in establishing the tone of the show. Attack on Titan is, meanwhile, very violent, but while I would suggest the squeamish stay away, the violence in fact went a long way in allowing me to understand the terror the humans felt. Watching characters be mangled, chewed, and eaten, and seeing the expressions on other characters as they witnessed this occurring, it was near-impossible to distance myself. Regardless of whether I liked or disliked the main characters (and as I will discuss, I did have some issues in that regard), I could always feel their terror during these scenes. To be sure, it amounts to manipulation, but it is an especially effective occurrence of it, and I will give credit to it for giving the show the atmosphere it had. Certainly, the musical score, which is oft-repeated but appropriately intense, contributes, as do the fantastic energetic opening songs, which at this point have become about as popular in fandom as the show itself.\
I'll also give credit to the show's production staff for using money where it mattered most. Attack on Titan certainly wasn't a terribly high-budget series, and to the chagrin of the manga's fans, it frequently fell behind schedule; a recap episode was devised to give the team some time to catch up, a move which strikes me as a desperate one. But while static scenes are given over to still shots and to speed lines, the scenes in which the animation truly counted, such as those featuring the famous \"maneuver gear\" used to swing between houses or trees and fight the Titans, looked magnificent to me. Money was also spent on giving appropriate detail to the backgrounds, which is crucial in a series attempting to establish such an atmosphere; even before the Titans appear, the street cobblestones have the appearance of having seen too much wear and far too much human excrement, and the wildlands in which the Titans currently live are drawn as being especially verdant and biodiverse, highlighting the fact that the Titans bother no other living things besides humans and that they have created such a massive waste by leaving verdant land uninhabitable. An important aspect of Attack on Titan is its grim medieval-esque setting, and it is developed excellently here.\
It is aspects such as these that allow Attack on Titan to work in spite of its weaknesses, which are certainly there and certainly are not slight. For one thing, Eren himself makes for something of a frustrating protagonist; his seething rages and inopportune exclamations can come across as highly childish, in addition to making him somewhat one-dimensional. I'm certainly not alone in finding him frustrating; friends of mine with whom I watched this described him as being irritating, with one noting that a scene in which he gets away Scot-free with killing a character (a would-be murderer himself, mind you) made him impossible to empathize with. I didn't feel the same about that scene, and regarding his hotheaded personality, in this case I think the circumstances, which far outdo those of most \"traumatic backstories\" used to justify childish behavior, do provide good enough reason for his behavior that I tolerated him without necessarily liking him. Regardless, he is a polarizing character and is likely to remain so.\
I certainly liked the secondary leads far more. Eren's friend Armin, written as a sort of \"timid sidekick\" character, does grow out of that limiting descriptor thanks to some episodes that are devoted to him and his tactical abilities. Meanwhile, Mikasa, probably the show's best-known character, is also probably the show's strongest, I would argue. She is, in my opinion, one of relatively few physically strong female characters who is not written to have a key vulnerability or secret reliance on a male character; while she does care about Eren, she functions fine without him. In part, she has the role of keeping Eren's idiocy within bounds, an aspect that I appreciated, but while this is a common aspect in shonen anime among female characters, I did feel that the series gives her the license to reach her potential that many female characters are not given; considering how enjoyable her battle scenes are to watch, I would say she reaches it. While I would not necessarily go far enough to say that Attack on Titan is \"feminist\", I did appreciate that it invokes parity in several ways: the army uniforms are unisex, meaning that fanservice is practically non-existent, the female characters are rarely subjected to sexualized camera angles (I was certainly NOT talking about Mikasa's scenes from the viewpoint of one who enjoys fanservice), and positions of power, at least within the army, are roughly split between the two genders. Arguments over the politics of this show, as well as Mikasa herself, are bound to be lengthy and I will therefore hold myself back somewhat, but I personally found her compelling.\
Still, characterization is not the show's greatest strength, and Eren aside, the primary problem is that the supporting cast is very, very large. This might have been less apparent in the source manga, where it is (perhaps) easier to flip back to a previous page in order to refresh oneself on who a character is, but while watching the anime, it was somewhat difficult to invest myself in some of the characters' problems, simply because I had barely seen them before the drama arose. A common complaint against Attack on Titan has been that its pacing is slow, a point that I would echo somewhat with the modification that it is mismatched: early on, we get approximately two episodes to introduce an enormous cast of characters, and then perhaps 7 episodes total of plotting and planning. There is, to be sure, plenty of action in the show, and while watching it I frequently marathoned four or more episodes at a time out of anticipation, which is something I rarely do. Nonetheless, the show decidedly favors scenes of tactical planning over scenes of character development, and more of the latter was necessary for this cast to make the impact. I think that the show's battle scenes do make up for this failing somewhat, and the tactical scenes, which contain more visual aids and less technobabble than in similar and lesser shows, do remain interesting to watch; nonetheless, for those not familiar with the manga, it is hard to keep track of the characters.\
If the plot of Attack on Titan is its greatest strength, then one might ask if the plot is flawless. That's certainly not the case, for while I did genuinely enjoy this show's world-building, plot holes can be found if one digs deep enough. There is, for example, the bizarre case of the Titans breaking into the outermost wall and apparently leaving the next outermost wall intact until, conveniently, Eren and his friends have just become members of the army. Relatively little, meanwhile, is explained about how the humans came to build the walls in the first place, or how they were even able, and the show throws in a bizarre detail, that Mikasa and her mother were descended from a small group of Japanese people who made it inside the walls years back, whose significance it never really explains. Now, I certainly am aware that the manga has continued far beyond the point at which the anime is at (the anime, sadly, ends on a bit of a cliffhanger), and so some of this criticism may be irrelevent or become irrelevant as more is animated. Regardless, they don't ruin the show: the plot remains a strength because the show is fabulously entertaining. In spite of how frustrating I found Eren at times, and in spite of my various quibbles, the positive aspects do truly add up to something worth watching. I found it easy to invest myself in it, and that investment was not wasted, as I truly enjoyed the majority of the episodes.\
My complaints about Attack on Titan are not meant to dissuade anybody from watching it; rather, they prove that the show is entertaining and engaging enough to survive its flaws, at least in my experience. Whether it becomes an enduring classic or whether the hype it saw in the early 2010s will be short-lived, I think its popularity is deserved.\

#Story and Characters (10/10)\
-\
Well, there are many aspects of an anime - story, characters, art, sound and so on. But, if I think it straight - all the credit go to the story and thus to the original source, the manga. I am not taking anything away from the art and sound, they are great. But they are not the reasons for this anime being an out of the world masterpiece. It's the story and to be precise the philosophy.\
...\
I know there is no genre as Philosophical out there. But I think it's time we created one. If this anime wasn't about damn philosophy, then go and dig a grave for yourself. I think I will need to write an entire essay on the philosophical maestro. A review isn't a place for such elaborate discussion and also obviously, if I did this, it would be full of spoilers. So it won't be a review anymore.\
...\
I don't deny the Action, the Horror part. But come on! They are all mere tools to manifest the philosophical point.\
...\
I feel really sorry that this anime won't receive the appreciation and respect it commands. It's obvious, isn't it? 85+ % of the anime viewers are just school going kids. You don't really expect that these kids can possibly delve into such depths of philosophy . So, if you are just a school going kid and you think this anime is just another action, historical anime, then this is just what I expect. Do yourself a favor! When you grow up, rewatch the anime.\
But if you like to think about- how the world works, how the human civilization works, how human emotions and logic clash, the meaning of survival, the meaning of freedom, then don't miss out on this anime, it's your once in a lifetime opportunity.\
...\
Sad news... The way the story was developed, it's complexity and depth, I think it would take at least another 2 seasons to finish the series without rushing it. The first season was aired way back in 2013 and the 2nd season is going to be aired in a few months (Spring 2017).\
The story is so intriguing that when you finish the first season your inside would be craving to know what's next. The source manga hasn't yet been finished. That's quite depressing. The mangaka is sure taking his time. I really hope he finishes what he started. To the mangaka I say, \"Don't rush! Take your time. Finish it splendidly just the way you started it. This is your lifetime opportunity to seal your spot as a legend. Not just the anime or manga, your work has in it to put a fight for a place as a masterpiece among all forms of literature.\

Art (Downer) [8/10]\
-\
Yeah. Even such a great work conceded some flaws. Well maybe this isn't something that I expect to everyone to agree with me... but really the Titans (monsters) look actually funny, don't they? Their face, the way the run really are hilarious. Wasn't it supposed to be scaring the shit out of people??  I think the anime could've improved this. They don't have to blindly follow the way that everything were done in the original manga. When you see a flaw, I think you should bravely go ahead and fix it.\
...\
Sound [9/10]\
-\
Great. The sound is quite capable to keep the story tense. The first opening is such a great inspiring song.\

A true masterpiece. A milestone in the world of anime.\

    A lot of people say that Attack on Titan is overrated, but I don't think that means that it's a bad anime. The first time I heard about this anime was when my friends told me to watch it. I watched it and I love it a lot. \
 ~STORY~\
The story is very original and interesting. The story is what makes this anime very popular. It can catch anyone's attention.\
~ART/ANIMATION~\
The art is very beautiful. I really like the thick line art. The thing that I really liked a lot was the eyes of the characters. The actions scenes are amazingly beautiful.\
~SOUND~\
I really love the sound\
          \
        track, it is so beautiful. The first opening song I really loved, but I didn't really liked the second opening. The Japanese voice acting is amazing, and the English voice acting is... well... let's just say I didn't really liked it even though it has a lot of my favorite voice actors. \
~CHARACTERS~\
I loved all of the characters and I liked their designs. I know that a lot of people fangirl over Levi... but I fangirl over Eren XD. \
~ENJOYMENT~\
I really really really love this anime, and a lot of people would too. I am a big fan of dark fantasy and this anime is really dark. But that's why I love Attack on Titan. \

    Look, more than likely you already know this show. You know it's story, characters, and how action packed it is. Because of this im not going to repeat other reviewers and Im just going to sum everything up.\
~STORY~\
Amazing. Theres so much to be had and it takes more than the 25 episodes to cover everything. Thank god theres a second season on the way. If that doesn't answer everything theres always the manga or a 3rd season.\
~CHARACTERS~\
All unique in some way. Each character has a reason for what there doing and why they do it. This could be as simple as an easy life style\

~ART~\
This show is gorgeous...end of discussion.\
~SOUND~\
The music is amazing, the dub is good but not my favorite.\
~FINAL~\
This show is probably one of the most popular anime to date to anyone in the anime scene or not. I love this show and cant wait to see more. My only fear is that the show will go over 100 episodes total. I have no problems with this, however, I dont want it to drag out and have a very bad ending. Altogether, I recommend this show...word of advise though, dont get to attached to certain characters. Everyone has a chance to die.\

    Before I start, I just want to say that the manga is much better; it goes much deeper, and despite the things that are being dragged on It is much more successful in terms of plot twists and character development. I won’t compare the two too much, but I have to say that the time limit and the pointless dramatic scenes are what ruined the series the most. \
If you are the type of person that watches anime purely for enjoyment, then by all means go ahead and watch. If you are the type of experimented watcher that analyzes everything, then you probably will be\
          \
        very frustrated and disappointed.\
Story: Some aspects of it seem very promising. From the beginning I have been interested in the truth behind the titans, and in the possibility of a time loop, but sadly there are too few clues and it is definitely not one of the things the anime focuses most on. This could turn out to be a masterpiece with big twists if it wasn’t being dragged on and on with pointless drama. The drama’s not surprising considering the setting, but it’s hard to emphasize with characters weeping when you don’t even know them. If they wanted it to be truly sad and dramatic, they should develop the characters first, get the viewers attached, and then break them instead of animating 3737329 scenes with random strangers talking about their dead relatives. I also just don’t see how the author can bother to give characters full names only to kill them 1 sec later, it seems like he’s doing it for pure shock value, which is a characteristic of poor writing. Another bad thing was the slow pacing, filled with long footages of characters being upset about their dead friends. Sometimes it does make them more strong-willed, but becomes a pain to watch when done too many times, especially when it has no effect on character development. Even the training scene was pointlessly slow; the potato scene was funny and all, but training for 4 eps is too much when the whole season has only 25. Even though some scenes had really successful suspense, and came with nice plot twists as well, it could be done in a much more efficient way. \
Characters: My favorite thing about this show is that it’s one of the only shounen series that give significant roles to female characters, who wear the exact same uniforms as the males and aren’t seen as inferior at all. The cast overall is diverse, but since much of the time limit is wasted on pointless dramatic scenes the secondary characters don’t get any development even though some of them are really interesting in the manga. As for the protagonists, Eren seems to be the typical hot-headed protagonist, and Mikasa, even though she has incredible strength, doesn’t really stand apart from other strong female characters. Armin was a bit more interesting; Although he lacks the strength, he compensates by making strategies and being motivated. This type of character doesn’t occur frequently in shounen series, and because his flaws are more obvious, he has more room for development. The three protagonists have more deepness than the others, but their pasts are rather cliché and overly dramatic, as if the producers are begging to viewers to feel sorry for them.  It’s nice to see that the three complete each other well with their distinct skills and , but there could be room for more originality and character development. \
Art: The animation is very fluid, the animators were particularly careful about some action scenes, which seem to have way more frames per second than the usual anime. The backgrounds are really realistic and detailed, and the outfits and weapon used interesting as well.  Another good aspect is that the characters have distinct faces, which is rare in anime. Some of the viewers might be turned off by the Titans that look absolutely ridiculous, but this was intentional. \
Soundtrack: Definitely one of the best soundtracks of recent years. The first opening is so memorable it would be hard to skip. The osts were very fitting and some stood out as well. ",

    Before I watched this show, I thought Breaking Bad destroyed my anime career. I started watching real tv shows, I thought I was growing out of anime but Shingeki no Kyojin brought me back. \
On paper, the idea behind this show sounds very simplistic, I mean giants fighting humans, who hasn't heard of this kind of stuff? But on screen, the  idea is executed brilliantly. The animation is top notch, the sound track will get you pumped and the art will amaze you. You can see that they've put a lot of work and thought into this anime, they even show you blueprints of\
          \
        the weapons in this show, they even tell you the size of the Titans. A lot of shows don't do this, they'll just have a character fighting with a sword without going into detail on why the sword effective.  \
My only complaint about this show is the annoying monologues characters dish out, you just think, \"get on with it!\"\
Also, don't listen to these hipsters saying it's overrated. If this show didn't get so much critical acclaim, these hipsters would be all over it, trust me. \

By that time, I was hooked. Throughout all 25 episodes, I was engaged in the story and the characters are very well-developed. The only complaint I have is the ending. There are so many questions left unanswered, which I hope will be answered in the second season (maybe?). Just a warning, this is a very intense anime with gore and many deaths, so it might not be for everyone. I\

In my opinion this is easily one of the best animes ever created.\
The story is unique, humanity driven to extinction with only little left to do to escape their demise. It reminds of Game of Thrones in a sense that you do not know when somebody will die, who will be next, completely unpredictable, in contrast to animes that always have to end happily with the main characters getting married and having lots of babbies, blah I am sick of this, happy ending, how cheesy. (Spoiler) When Eren died for a couple of episodes I really thought he was dead, now that`s new. For\

        me, personally, when I am expecting even the main character to die, that`s how I know the anime is good, because I don`t know what the hell is going on and I am even considering that the main character may be killed of. (Spoiler) :) 10\
Art, one word amazing. 10\
Sound, I think it actually goes really well with the scenes, greatly synchronized and provoking the right emotion at the right time. 10\
Characters - I love all of them. One guy who is on a completely different level than everybody else in power (Levi). One mysterious strategist who everybody follows (Erwin). A girl with traumatic past in love with the protagonist, who is strrugling to overcome his relative weakness and get revenge, I think (not so much helping humanity). And Armin desperately trying to be a worthy friend. 10\

    Well, as I wait for the second season to come out, if there is going to be one. I decide to update my review with my new format. Attack on Titan is good, but unlike the last time I reviewed this series I have had some time to think about it and I really thought about it. This series isn't as good as I initailly thought it was. But it is still a really, really, good series.\
The bad. Where as there isn't much bad about this series it does have it's flaws, unlike the last time I am not blinded by the amazing animation and\
          \
        I have really thought about the series as a whole. Attack on Titan does have a strange pacing to it, at one point it is going extremely slowly, and at the next they get a whole arc done in a single episode. Another thing about it is the recap episode, I do not like recap episodes unless they ad something to the franchise, this is where Neon Genesis Evangelion succeeded, that series had so much happening in one episode that you would need a recap half way through series. But in Attack on Titan, unless you count every insignificant thing, not a lot happens at the halfway point, just to pick up during the second half.\
The good. Attack on Titan is a good series, like I said before. It has a really good and original story, but it really shines in the second half, where the pacing isn't as inconsistent and we actually get some character development for the only character in anime who actually has a realistically sized nose. The animation is up there, it's both original and looks like they spent a lot of time and effort on this project instead of just making another generic action anime. We have characters that didn't become the original cookie of the cookie cutter for so many people to follow. This series can have dark comedy while still keeping a serious tone and having characters that you can actually sort of relate to. This anime also had an amazing soundtrack that has music that shares the scene with the action instead of taking the back seat.\
Final Verdict:\
This series is quickly become the new Dragon Ball. People from many different fandoms, even outside of anime fandoms, tend to like this anime. so would definitely suggest it.\

    If are associated with the anime community you have heard of Shingeki No Kyojin (Attack on Titan) but is it as good as it is told out to be?\
Story: 6/10\
I'm not going to lie AoT Starts off quite smoothly, Attack on Titan progresses quite normally up until the Titan confrontation. The action is quite well done but to get to the action you have to sit through hours upon hours of recaps and people only talking; some episodes may provide better info on the current situation but many are simply recaps; hell one episode is a recap while cannons are being pointed at main characters.\
          \
        The Titans also progressively manage to intelligently wipe out high class ranking soldiers but as soon as main characters rear their ugly heads around the titans move more sluggishly and barely ever try to attack. As the show progresses, plot holes begin opening. It does have the eventual heartfelt moments that tend to last 4 seconds. Comedy is sometimes implemented and works quite well occasionally. Attack on Titan has some GREAT plot twists but still has plot twists viewers can see a mile away.\
Character 5/10\
This is the biggest shortcoming for the show.\
The main characters suffer no character development. They stay initially the same from begging to end. The main characters also show barely any regard for their dead friends or the safety of some of their alive buddies. Erin is always mad at Titans claiming to kill them, throughout the series he pretty much works for himself on his own agenda. Mikasa is a emotionless kick-ass girl who's top of her class,you've clearly seen this character many many times, but many times but this time she's almost two dimensional only caring for Erin and the occasional other friend, oddly she also is more animated than every other character. And we come to Armin, this little dude  only exists to spout information we already know and be saved from even the simplest of predicaments. However he is given some very heartfelt moments that come maybe twice.One of the most popular, Levi is one of the only one(s) who actually progresses within the show and is given somewhat heartfelt scenes.\
It’s pretty sad when side characters have more character development than the main characters. \"Oddly\" enough These are the most liked characters in the show mainly . These are the likable characters; every side character is relate able to a point. Even the antagonists in the show are more likable than the Angry Erin.\
Art 9/10\
For how much crap I've talked on the show ;The animation is absolutely beautiful  and the art is quite swell. However The background character design gets repetitive FAST!   There is also a large noticeable black outline on most characters. Some characters are more animated and more detailed than others (Refer to Mikasa). The Titans however are always new and terrifying.\
Sound 8/10\
The sound is done amazingly well, especially the First Opening. The voice acting is great with some characters but others have insanely overdone acting, dwarfing even Tommy Wiseau. Also The 1st opening is new and great sounding.\
Attack on Titan has so many issues that wouldn't be overlooked in other shows but they aren't really addresed, this show is a hit or miss situation; You may enjoy it but in my opinion, It's mediocre at best  \

    The setting, the premises, the story is all captivating and intriguing and makes you want to find out more. But then you get a few episodes in when the action really starts, and the characters just keep thinking/talking the same drawn out, repetitive, analytical, self doubt... over... and over... again. Every. Single. Episode. Overdrawn out explanations of what's happening, what the character(s) are thinking, the history behind certain actions. There's so much drawn out dialogue and inner-thoughts it's disrupts the flow of the story, and gets mundane to watch. It's still a 7 because the art is amazing, the action scenes are beautiful to watch,\
          \
        the setting is very interesting, but the character execution definitely falls flat. The character's are so vivid visually in their emotions, they don't need 3 minutes of inner dialogue (EVERY. SINGLE. TIME! So frustrating.) to explain the fear, confusion, or whatever other emotion they're feeling when their faces say it all.\
Edited to add: I was intrigued enough to read the manga, and it is by far, much better story-wise and pace wise. The manga really made me fall in love with this series. I get now why they stretch out the episodes so much (because of where the manga is currently), it's all filler, filler, filler. My score and opinions on the anime are still exactly the same, even after reading the manga.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin...Never have I thought that I would find an anime like this...An anime that instantly took the world by storm because it IS that good\
Story (9/10)\
SnK is a world where humanity now live in fear of giant, overpowered Titans whom exist to feed on humans. What was interesting is that humanity had to barricade themselves behind giant wall structures in order to keep the Titans out and although this was the case, the humans decided to fight back and created their own military tasked with protecting and hopefully someday eliminating the titan threat. Another thing I love is how dramatic it is, can\
          \
        you even imagine if the world we live in today was like this? I'm pretty certain that we all would act the very same way. The way everyone cowers in fear of a threat that they really can't get rid of, the emotions that occur when people watch their loved ones get eaten and that drive that the soldiers get whenever they fight back...Beautiful...Just beautiful...Another thing that worked quite nicely was the thing that everyone dreads....Fillers...SnK is one of the few anime where the fillers actually worked quite well because they nicely added to the plot and even gave more depth to some characters, as well as providing more badass action to it  \
Animation (10/10)\
Gorgeous is an understatement when describing the animation for this. The animation was pretty much a mixture of the old school and the new school, and the characters were drawn pretty well compared to the manga versions which in itself is amazing. The scenery in is just beautiful and then there's my personal favorite, the 3D Maneuver Gear scenes....Animation at its FINEST right there...However the Titan designs (Minus the human-titans) are quite hilarious to say the least, but the reason why that in itself is beautiful is because it suits them perfectly because of the way they act...Yes it has scenes where there are stills but honestly, what anime in the past 5 years hasn't had any\
Sound (10/10)\
The openings.....Japanese + German lyrics...Never in my life have I seen a phenomena that works so well.....And the...Hell I can't even describe the feeling, but in my case, whenever I listen to them with the sound at max volume, I get this feeling where I'm just super pumped up and ready for my mind to be blown..The excitement these openings give is just awesome and the same can also be said with the endings...Its sometimes hard to find an anime that has BOTH great openings and endings and SnK is one of the select few....Wait, you thought it ended there? Oh no no no no no my children, the fun doesn't stop there...The entire OST for this anime...There is without a doubt in my mind that its one of the greatest of all time. Like, they fit SO WELL with this anime, and in certain scenes!!!! Even the lyrics does the same thing, if you haven't heard this soundtrack yet I HIGHLY recommend that you do, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED\
Characters (9/10)\
There is literally no named character that I didnt like in this anime...They\"re all just great and different in their own rights\
Eren - The main protagonist of the series, is a hot blooded kid who's determined to slaughter every single last titan there is. One reason why I sympathize and respect Eren is because he watched his own mother die in the most brutal way possible, and whats worse is that they parted whilst being on somewhat bad terms with each other. On the other hand, Eren is really stupid when it comes to battle and tends to foolishly rush into battle without thinking and or makes questionable decisions which then usually results in himself and sometimes the people around him getting hurt or worse killed...Regardless, the reason why he is like this is because he truly despises the titans, and can you blame him? The kid watched his MOTHER die!!!! Imagine if you were in that situation. How would you feel to lose someone THAT close to you? \
Mikasa - Mikasa is the most badass female MC I have ever seen, she is just a monster in every sense of the word, her fighting prowess  is just so phenomenal its impossible to not respect her skills. Her personality on the other hand is kind of dull but I see it as maturity and determination to get the job done....Her flaw is that when it comes to Eren's safety, everything else takes the back seat and because of that she herself has done a lot stupid things, but I get it....Eren is her only family left and I too would do anything to protect my only living loved one\
Armin - In the beginning I couldn't stand Armin because he was that type who was a coward/crybaby and was just utterly useless, but as the series progressed he really grew out of his stereotype and surprised me the most out of everyone. His analytical and strategic skills are top notch and he is ALWAYS thinking ahead and of a sound mind and that in itself is very admirable\
Levi Heicho - The greatest thing to ever happen in this anime....Humanity's strongest soldier....The midget clean freak....The devoted, trusting and very capable leader...The best to ever use the 3D Gear, Captain Levi of the Scouting Legion...He is literally Mikasa times 1000, except his personality is just great (Even though he hardely shows any emotions lol) Levi is clearly my favorite character, but the amount of epic moments this guy has had....I swear if there was a scale of epicness he'd be off the charts\
Honourable Mentions - Commander Irwin, Commander Pixis, Sasha, Hanji, Annie, Reiner, Jean,Ymir, Hannes, Levi's Squad memebers. All these characters are equally as great as the ones named above for reasons too many to state at the moment\
Enjoyment (10/10)\
One thing this anime did really well was the art of using cliffhangers. SnK is that type of anime to incorporate so many epic moments, people, fight scenes, comedy and wtf moments into one episode and then would end it on an awesome note that just leaves the viewers wanting more...I can't tell you guys how many times I almost lost it during this series...When you add the OST in....You will have the best time of your LIFE when watching an anime\
Overall (11/10)\
There's nothing more to be said honestly, this anime was just perfect....It did things to me that I didnt know were possible...The emotions I felt from watching this were over 9000...This is EASILY the anime of the year\

    Since the hype about Shingeki no Kyojin is rather hard to escape my girlfriend decided to watch it, and so I watched along. We watched it in one go.\
And to be honest it wasn't really worth the time for me and not for her either.\
I partially understand what people may find awesome about this anime but all the things that felt over dramatized, unrealistic or outright stupid simply outweighed the good points for me.\
Story: The story of Shingeki no Kyojin is at least rather unique and it does a lot of things right. It's not really easy to predict and it keeps luring with questions\
          \
        and raises the desire to know what's going on. Having it end in a titanical cliffhanger that feels like the whole 25 episodes were just a small beginning is not so cool though.\
Art & Sound are both very good, I got nothing to complain about here.\
Character though... Shingeki no Kyojin has some nice character development, and I liked how they built up a real story for most characters, with a proper past and a nice way of presenting things piece for piece to try and keep things interesting.\
However Shingeki no Kyojin felt like it really chewed through every last totally overused cliche of people fucking up absolutely everything constantly. Up to the point where it felt like however evil and overpowered the titans are, the biggest enemy throughout the anime were people who failed at everything they touched, and not because the titans were oh so strong, but rather because they were oh so darn stupid.\
After just 7 episodes or so I could pretty much predict every upcoming death as in: \"Well, since no one get's his job done properly anyway, there is no way this operation is going to go well without all the really important people dying.\" and every single time I was proven right. And just watching a bunch of people fail predictably and horribly for several episodes on end just trying to get one single thing done is really no fun for me.\
So all in all it was rather hard for me to enjoy watching this, as it mostly frustrated me.\
Mind you though, for people that love to have protagonists failing around all the time and just barely winning by pure luck or getting their shit together in the absolutely very last second (after half the cast died of course) Shingeki no Kyojin may actually prove to be really fun to watch.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin was a very entertaining show to watch. It had a captivating plot, powerful soundtrack, and an interesting art style. I believe that it deserved the hype that it got, but contrary to the beliefs of the majority of its fans, it was very flawed.\
The plot of Shingeki no Kyojin is new to the anime world, but it is very similar to that of The Walking Dead; the world is overrun by man-eating creatures who have only bloodlust to motivate them and the surviving humans must find a way to continue living. SnK has a very original take on this subject matter, \
          \
        though, and that is most likely why so many are drawn to it. \
Athough the plot is quite outstanding, the characters really lacked in development. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin got a good amount of development, but almost all of the supporting cast was lacking a reason for their actions, and for some, they were killed before we could learn anything about them. The viewer do get glimpses of the stories, but that's all they get. I do have to say that since we cannot get to appreciate the characters to their fullest, it is easier to cope with their deaths, and if the show decided to tell the story of everyone in this huge cast, there would be a hell of a lot of filler episodes.\
At first, the art style of SnK seems fantastic. I personally thought it was the best art style ever, until I decided to watch the dub and I noticed the still shots and the inconsistent character designs. Without a doubt, the action is extremely well done, but their animation budget was focused primarily on those sequences and the rest of the show is rather average.\
SnK's soundtrack is probably my favorite. The opening and ending songs are extremely addicting and I found myself listening to them every second of the day. The background music always gave the show an ambiance that was like no other. Sure, the amount of songs is fairly small, but the quality is still over 9000.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is a very good show with a lot of good qualities. It has flaws that may or may not bother you, but I found them to be unnoticeable. If you do not mind gore then this show will most likely be on your list of favorites for a while. It is fun, but I know that over time better shows will come along and SnK will be pushed aside and forgotten.\

    Now, before I probably gush at this popular anime, let me just disclose that this was the one that got me back on the anime scene, so I probably will be a bit bias because I didn't judge as harshly as I do now.\
So, Shinjeki No Kyojin, Attack On Titan. It had a good start. Got some good character development, good development on the world, good amounts of gore, some humor mixed in, and, good, upbeat, rock title themes. Another thing to note is that there was pretty much NO romance. This season, anyhow. Kept it nice and serious, stuck to the story, and I\
          \
        have no quarrels with that. That's what Fanfiction is for. Yay, no fanservice!\
It's a really nice start. The second season is due to come out next year, and my hopes are high. It was unbearably addicting to watch, and I'm glad I got to it after it was already complete, otherwise I would have probably died from waiting so long. \
Some flaws to note are: filler episodes. I have argued in the past that they were completely relevant to develop the characters more, but the episodes did nothing to advance the story. Another thing is the kind of cliche bunch of characters. Again, I do like all of them, still in early stages, but looking at them closer just makes me feel like it's been done before. All got some dark past, but at least it still ties in with the story: Eaten by a Titan! Well, in one case. \
Overall, if you haven't watched this anime yet: where have you been? This show will take you on a roller coaster ride, whether you're accustomed to gore or not. Original premise, besides the eating humans thing, edge of your seat moments all around, and I don't think you'll cry. Probably. Maybe. Message to readers: Go add this anime to your hitlist! (unless you REALLY don't like gore)\

    For me, this is one example of something that starts off REALLY GOOD, and losing momentum as it carries on.\
Before starting the rant, I want to point out that I still regarded SnK as \"Very good, 8/10\". I must admit that the concepts of SnK are unique and innovative, the style and pace are neatly configured, the plot is great and the premise very promising. It's a gem, admittedly, but with think layers of dust on it.\
After watching the first two episodes, I thought this anime was a strong contender for a 10/10, with a story that is as mysterious as captivating and an atmosphere\
          \
        so different from the foreign to Shonen playground, and the graphics are just breath-taking. I couldn't even imagine that such strong start can fade out, but sadly, it did.\
The ONE thing that mad this anime so hard to fully enjoy for me was the Characters. I can't get over the fact that most of the SnK cast are one-liners with absolutely no depth and no quirks, likeable for two episodes then subdued or killed on the next ones. Levi saves this category from a 1/10 really, as my loved Mikasa became so much of a one-dimensional, overly-attached character as the story progresses (she wakes up from a coma and she says \"Eren\" before even breathing .. let alone the fact that \"Eren\" was pretty much all the script she has in the last episodes).\
Having read the manga, another thing that bothered me is some of the extra scenes of random people saying random stuff and filling the 22 minutes with unnecessary \"dialogue\". It would have been much neater if the writers sticked to the original text, or put some gorgeous still scenery from the SnK world.\
All in all, I wasn't bummed because of the lack of quality of SnK, but the high contrast between the expectations and reality lines.\
Very good nonetheless.\

    Story 2/10 \
In terms of story the only thing that'll grip you is the plot of this anime and the surreal situation around it. Giants taken over world? Live in a damn cage? Pretty interesting, but the story itself about a teenager putting so many asspulls and breaking universal laws is interesting enough for me because objectively Kyojin has a very weak story. It's dull and dead beat entertainment. Nothing about it different from anything else other than the typical revenge shonen story. No explanation or anything with asspulls, when it tries to be serious story, but hey it's a shonen. What the hell do\
          \
        you expect?\
Art 10/10\
Despite the story being completely half assed, the art is gorgeous and unique in its own way with very high production value. It's eye candy. \
Sound 7/10\
Sometimes the sound just doesn't fit the atmosphere and the OP/EDs are good, but they have nothing to do with the overall plot/story. \
Character 1/10\
I will say this two times that you can get it. The characters in Shingeki are uncharismatic idiots. The characters in Shingeki are uncharismatic idiots. \
Motivation for most of the characters? Haha, no explanation. Development at all? Haha, none. Any depth at all? Haha, none. Dialogue is at least coherent? Haha, none. Likable characters? Haha, none. \
The fact that most of the characters lack any depth due to the fact that while introducing a shit ton of characters, they don't explain anything about them either while they just die off. The only character with backstories is the hero and heroine of the show. Not surprising. \
Enjoyment 4/10\
After figuring out the fact that after the first 4 episodes were just carefully thought out for hype and attention grabs i quickly became disinterested as this show was turning into a shonen mish mash. I did not enjoy this anime at all. I saw potential in the anime, but they just wasted it away by having a weak story and having very weak characters. \

    Okay, where do I start... I will start with the story.\
Story - Amazing. Absolutely amazing! Original, and not a cliché-repetitive story, that there's millions of anime made with the same plot line. It has a good mix of everything, not too much, not minimum of gore, not too sad, not too happy. Just the perfect middle of everything of my liking. \
Art - Okay, I had a bit of confusion with this one. I personally didn't like the change in between Season 1 and Season 2 of the Anime. In my opinion, season 1 has a much better art style, original(I will be repeating this\
          \
        word a lot.)\
Sound - A SOLID FUCKING 10! I wish I could give more than a 10. Okay, SnK Season 1 and Season 2 Soundtracks are absolutely fucking amazing. Epic. Just epic. Some songs are really powerful, can hit you, and make you cry with the emotion. Soundtracks are really well picked for certain scenes. If you don't want to watch the anime, I highly recommend checking out the Soundtracks. (I reccomend \"YouSeeBIGGIRL\" and \"Call Your Name\".)\
Character -  Okay, not a 10, in my opinion. Some of the characters are disliked by me (Levi for example..). Some of them are angry for no reason, and 'edgy'. Overall, the character designs are wonderful, the outfits as well.\
Enjoyment - Well, I enjoyed it. I read the manga, watched all 2 seasons, Junior High and OVA's, so I guess that said a lot...\
Overall -  Awesome! If you like Funny/creepy/weird Titan-people(???), Fighting, and repeating of the word \"Eren\", then be my guest. \

    The Video Review is up on my channel, but here is the Written Review.\
The most hyped anime of 2013, Shingeki no Kyojin, but you may know it as, Attack on Titan.\
Story - 8/10\
100 Years prior before the main story, Titans, giant humanoid things appeared out of nowhere and started feasting on humanity for no reason at all, nearly wiping them to extinction. The remaining humans live inside huge gigantic walls, separating them from titans. Cut to present day, humans are living in peace away from the titans to the point where some have never seen a titan before and therefor never experienced the fear of\
          \
        titans. That is until a giant Colossal Titan suddenly appears and breaks down the wall, and all the other titans come in and have a buffet.  \
Eren Jaegar, one of the inhabitants inside the wall witnesses his mother being eaten by a titan,  he decides to make a pledge, and that pledge is to get revenge on the titans. So and he and his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert join the military so they can fight the titans. The story seems simple at first, but later on gets interesting, not going to spoil it because it’s a pretty big spoiler and it makes you believe it’s something, but shows you something completely different.\
One colossal problem with Attack on Titan story is it’s pacing. The show has a tendency, well to drag for long stretches. It is broken into arcs, but they are really long arcs for what they were trying to do. For instance, they take quite a while to move a rock. They take their time to find someone and don’t actually start fighting titans properly till 5 episodes in. \
Characters - 8/10\
There’s a lot of characters in Attack on Titan, and all them pretty much don’t have plot armor. And because of that reason, I’m only really going to talk about the 3 main characters and a bonus character.\
Let’s start off with the main protagonist, Eren Jaegar. Eren is driven by a desire to kill titans, and thus making him the most dangerous human around, because his motives are so blood thirsty. Because of this, you find it really hard to like him because he really only has one motivation, and his character develops very slowly overtime as he learns it’s just not all about killing titans. He grows as he interacts with friends and teammates, learning to become a leader, although that does take a while. \
Next on the list is Mikasa Ackerman, the natural born badass of the series. Mikasa is shown and described to be equal to 100 soldiers. She does not hesitate when it comes to the protection of Eren, as she was given the mission to protect him for life, by any means.  Because her character is depicted as a quiet monotone unstoppable soldier, her character is not really that interesting outside of that. She’s got an interesting past, but I found that the past doesn’t really matter too much in a world like Attack on Titan. She’s pretty much there to be the badass character of the series, but then someone else comes along later as well.\
And lastly out of the main characters we have Armin Arlet. Unlike the other two I just mentioned, Armin is a coward, and not physically combat ready. He serves as the weakest of the two, but however he is the brains, as he formulates plans for his friends and how to get around titans. At first, I hated Armin, because he was just a whiny character and didn’t take any action, but however he learns over time that he isn’t burden, however that path takes a while, and the longer it takes, the more I start hating him.\
Another character I started hating but loving overtime, was Jean Kirstein. Jean is a complete coward and he admits it as well. He only joins the military in order to gain the prosperity of always being inside the inner walls and thus saving himself and shielding himself from the titans. He literally speaks his mind and doesn’t give a damn about what he said even if there is no honour in it. But you see him develop greatly over time, and you can actually love his character. \
When there’s a lot of characters in show like Attack on Titan, and with the amount of people getting killed in the show as well, you’re going expect some throwaway characters. Honestly there were many characters that died in Attack on Titan, I felt from little to nothing for them, because they weren’t interesting or as likeable. However they do also have an array of likeable characters that you don’t want to die as well, it’s just that the ones who were killed, were not given much screen time before their timely death. \
Animation and Sound - 9/10, 9/10\
For the art style, it uses I would say somewhat simple, yet effective art style. For the characters they are surrounding by a thick black stroke, to really highlight them as individuals. Because of this art style, it really shows the terror in the characters eyes the moment they face a titan, it’s almost scary to a point. The designs on titans are probably some of the most disturbing horrific faces I’ve ever seen. And if they were intentionally doing that, they’ve made faces of terror alright. The part where the anime really shines, is during the sequences when the characters use the 3D Maneuver Gear. You see them zipping across the city like Spiderman making it really free flow. These action sequences are the best part of the animation, it flows so well if the style, and fits really well with the theme, as they’re fighting for freedom and these 3DM Gear lets them do that. Seriously that thing is dope. \
For the soundtrack, I’d say it goes really well with the themes and scenes of the show. It really has this military feel orchestra. When there a moments in the anime there is a slight feel of hope and achievement, the music goes very well with that. And when everything goes bad and destruction and agonizing is happening, the music shifts perfectly to accompany it. Plus the opening song is amazing, gets you really pump by literally its first line, however it does get replace half way in, by an opening not as good as the first, but it grows over time. \
Enjoyment - 9/10\
When a show is overhyped like Attack on Titan, you go in thinking it’s the greatest anime of all time. Even though it’s not the greatest anime of all time it’s definitely worth the hype. The story gets really interesting as the series progress. It starts off simple so that anyone can enjoy and follow on. It was really fun watching the 3DM gear in action and watching your characters develop and hoping they don’t die was great as well. The soundtrack is really fun to watch and sing as well, especially that first opening. There’s a lot of things to like about Attack on Titan, also from the fact even though most of the characters are still in the teens, they’re really mature. And I enjoy the mature themes in this anime. However if you are looking for something silly, this is not it. Although some of the titans movements really kill the mood sometimes. \
Verdict - 8.5\
As for the story on Attack on Titan, I give it an 8, for I believe it starts off simple, but gets interesting later on. However that does take a while, and there are parts of the story where it does drag. \
For the Animation and Sound I give them a 9, for I think the animation style may not appeal to some people. However it is a well animated series, especially during any action sequences with the 3DM gear, it doesn’t drop. And the art style really fits the mood of the show. The soundtrack is also great complimenting the style as well. Plus the epic opening theme.\
For characters I give it an 8. If the writers were able to make me hate characters so much and love them in the end, they’ve done something right with them. Even some do take a while to develop, they do become interesting. However the ones that did die, I really couldn’t care to much for them, as I didn’t find them as interesting as the ones I did.\
For my own personal enjoyment, I give it an 9, because I really love action anime, and this is definitely worth the hype. The story got really interesting to the point where I spoiled myself and read the manga. There’s also so much epic scale sequences in the anime where it really gets your heart racing.\
And after rounding that all up, I give Attack on Titan an 8.5/10. And I recommended if you’re a fan of full scale epic war fought battles, this is a great anime to watch. It is a well animated series. However I also recommended this anime to anyone wanting to get into anime, as its simple start up is easy to grasp. And it being an action anime as well, can really appeal to many people.",

    I get the hype. \"Attack on Titan\" is simply amazing, full of great characters and terrifying monsters. Those giant mouths are just creepy. \
Story:\
The idea of humanity being trapped behind walls to hide from giant monsters that love to eat humans is amazing. It seems very hopeless at first because after the giant titan destroys the wall, how are they supposed to defeat them? Humans die all the time and it's very harrowing. I really love the darkness of this anime, even though there is hope. Every time things start to get better, something bad happens, which makes it very suspenseful. I also have a\
          \
        lot of questions and really hope that they'll answer them in the next season. \
Art & Sound: \
I really hated the opening change. I never skipped the original one because I absolutely loved it, but the new one was so horrible compared to it. Why not keep it, argh! The battle music was always on point, very epic! Loved it. Same goes for the animation, the titans looked so human and yet not human at all. \
Character: \
The characters are very interesting and realistic. Those in power seem heartless at times, but they simply react in their interest or the interest of humanity as a whole. However, you could see their inward struggle sometimes. The younger ones that decide to join the military, all have their reasons and are often frightened. Same goes for experienced people. I also liked how a lot of people in the Survey Corps seem to be a little mad, I think you probably have to be if you want to survive as part of the Survey Corps. I think Mikasa is my favourite with her unconditional love for Eren and immense strength. I enjoyed Hanji a lot because she doesn't look at titans the same as all the other humans and her freakouts are hilarious. \
Enjoyment: \
Absolutely amazing! I was constantly on edge because of all the cliffhangers and I had to force myself to stop watching and then watched something else for some time because I knew that if I started one episode, I wouldn't be able to stop. You never know what happens next and who will die. I also liked the balance between action episodes and episodes without action. I never felt bored and I also never felt like too much was happening at once. ",

    Attack on Titan had the potential to be one of the greatest works of fiction and it completely squandered that opportunity. Here's why - The first few episodes establish a world where massive hunks of meat with eerie grins rip people's heads off on sight and for no reason whatsoever. No one has the guts or means to kill the damn things. You can feel the helplessness, the horror and the dark vibe of the series. You connect emotionally with the characters and the series sucks you in. \
After a horrifying yet heartily entertaining start we want more. What's gonna happen? How can you fend\
          \
        off a giant baby looking tub of meat that doesn't give a fuck about anything other than ripping you and everyone around you to shreds? Turns out there are people that can fly through the air at 100 miles an hour with 2 glorified machetes and slice those bitches like a shef in a sushi joint. Slice here, slice there and that 10 metre hunk of terror suddenly becomes ridiculous and comical. What the supposedly mere human characters do in this series suddenly becomes supernatural. \
The series literally makes fun of its strongest selling point. Suddenly, you have \"titans\" running around like babies, jumping around like frogs and characters swirling around in the air like katarina in league of legends. If that wasn't bad enough, the pacing grinds to a complete halt and everyone with a German surname starts arguing for episodes on end. The series suffers from a severe DBZ syndrome of having characters talk shit for way too long for no reason. \
Ultimately, the titans look like they could use super-sized diapers, the characters end up being shallow, the story goes nowhere and you're left wondering what the fuck happened to all the black people. \
However, the series did have monumental potential and the first 2 episodes are a testament to that. 15 metre giants running through everything and everyone without a single care in the world is something you will never see once you switch your PC off and from the start it was the series' pivotal strength.  Titan fighting scenes are gargantuan in scope and execution. The sound effects accompanying them are nothing short of spectacular. \
But that's about it. Everything else might as well been written by Tommy Wiseau. Shallow characters, constant deus ex machina solutions to killing something that at the beginning was established to be near unkillable and pacing that will leave you confused.\
 Watch it for the action, don't take it seriously and you'll be mildly entertained.\

    Quick Review. Okay! Shingeki no Kyojin is about a teenage boy named Eren who vow to kill every last titan, due to his mother's traumatic death which leads him and his two friends- Mikasa and Armin to join the survey corps (a unit that deals with the extermination of titans. Story-wise SNK nails it on the mark and really drills you with the fact that the world is no longer nice but is merciful-less. My brain tells me that the art in SNK is not only beautiful in scenery, but also shows depth in making each character look different; by different this ensures that we\
          \
        know who is who. While I understand the hype SNK receives it manages to entrance me with it's Opening and Ending- my personal favorite is Feuerroter Pfeil und Bogen- by Linked Horizon. Let's start off by saying that while Eren is a shounen protagonist he pretty much exceeded in a higher category than others. This pretty much with his morals set strong and it helps him reach his goals, while with Mikasa I probably sympathize with too and Armin helped strategically in battles and controlled his emotions well. Turning out to be pretty long review, but bear with me I just want to express SNK's brilliance by compiling all that I can. Now I can stop- that is I won't get too much into the negative because there's very few of it in SNK + The anime is well adapted from the manga. Yelling cause I need season 2. AHHH IT'S THE COLOSSAL TITAN EVERYBODY!!!\

         Shingeki no Kyojin, better known as Attack on Titan, is one of the most popular anime of this decade, and possibly one of the most popular ever created.  But if you ask me, this popularity was incredibly undeserving of this anime.  You see, what usually happens with anime is that people are unable to see past their initial beliefs and never put any effort into actually examining the show to find out whether or not it really is deserving of the popularity that it gets.  And Attack on Titan is one of those shows.\
\
         Personally, I have no issue with the story or its OST.  Both of them are very good, and the execution is handled well.  I can definitely say that there were a few moments where I was sitting on the edge of my seat, heart beating frantically in my chest, while I waited for the events to unfold on the screen of the tablet that I watched it on.  This was years ago, before I started becoming more analytical in my approach to anime.  Now, watching it again, I got in six episodes before I dropped it.  No, the story wasn't the issue this time around; rather, it was the art and the characters.\
     First, the art.  The character designs are godawful, and had I not rewatched Attack on Titan, given a few years, I would've forgotten the names of every single character because the designs were just that unmemorable.  They didn't try anything particularly new with the designs, and that pisses me off.  The most memorable trait of any of the characters' designs is Mikasa's scarf, but that's literally it.  One of the most memorable traits from Kill la Kill's Ryuuko Matoi (aside from her personality, among other traits) was the band of red at the front of her bangs.  Such simple choices like that make a character not only memorable, but also recognizable from a single look.  And the color palette is AWFUL.  The color palette, if you don't know, consists entirely of brown and burnt orange and it's absolutely ugly.  The colors mix hideously, and it makes the show very unenticing compared to any show made by the far superior studio Kyoto Animation, which takes time to carefully plan and create shows with beautiful color palettes that make you want actually want to watch their shows.\
     Now, moving onto the next topic: the characters.  I'm not referring to their designs this time around.  This time, I'm talking about their personalities.  Each of the character's personalities can be described in a single phrase.  Eren hates Titans.  Mikasa wants to protect Eren.  Armin is smart.  Levi is a \"badass\".  And speaking of Levi, that brings up another point.  Levi exists solely to kill Titans and be a badass.  That's his only purpose in the entire show.  There is an astounding lack of character development in the show as well.  However, there are three exceptions to this one trait thing: Reiner, Bertolt, and Historia.  If you read the manga, you know that Reiner and Bertolt experience serious character development in some of the more recent chapters, and so does Historia.  Obviously, I'm not going to go into detail as to their development.  That's something that you'll have to find out for yourself.\
     Overall, I'd give the show a 5 out of 10.  Despite its shortcomings, it was not an unenjoyable experience and I will likely watch season two, if not to only review it further.  Thanks for reading.\

    I, personally, loved this show, but this is a review so i'm gonna try and be objective. This storyline is quite interesting, though watching only the first season will leave you with an unfinished feeling because very little of the plot is revealed. The art features dim, faded, warm colors which i think really suit the story. Also, the artist have done a great job drawing the characters in motion. It almost feels like you're watching them in 3D! The characters feel very real, because of the motives and backstory they have, though you will meet some stereotypical ones here. Character development is done just\
          \
        right. The opening song is probably one of the best you'll witness. It just builds up some feelings and emotions while you hear it and  then you watch the show which perfectly maintains those feelings. To sum up, i highly reccomend attack on titan. \
There ya go, i don't need to go any longer than that because i have nothing bad to say for the show. \

    Before you read this review, I'd like to let you know that I am a huge SnK fan. I read the manga, surf the SnK subreddit on a daily basis, and talk with my friends about it all the time. The series as a whole is phenomenal IMO, but, even though I'm a massive fanboy, I don't think season one is the masterpiece everybody says it is.\
((a few season 1 spoilers))\
Story: 8/10 - It pulls you in with a zombie/godzilla type story that it teases with its first few episodes. It's intriguing, but not that original. However, past episode 5, this changes dramatically, and it\
          \
        takes a 180 by episode 8 and the direction changes almost entirely. See, this series pulls so many 180s that some are left disappointed because it's not what they originally expected, and this happens A LOT, especially in the story arcs past the first season. But let's not focus on past season one, though.\
What started out as a story of the last bit of humanity fighting for survival quickly turns into flesh mechs, flashy reveals, betrayals, and WTF moments that aren't explained until later on. This series likes to show some bizarre, random ass scenes that either aren't explained until much later or not at all. It teases you with something about Eren's dad's basement, but leaves it too mysterious for you to care. It shows the Colossal and Armored titans at the beginning, but they don't show up for the rest of the season making you think they were a one-and-done deal. It raises more questions than it gives answers, leaving many frustrated; by the end of the season, when the main villain of the second half is defeated, she legit locks herself in a crystal, therefore giving NO answers about who she is or where she comes from. The villain is given hints of a backstory regarding her dad just as she's being beaten, but it's not elaborated on at all. See, the story teases you too much. It leaves you unsatisfied; the 4 year wait only made it worse. On top of all that, there's an end credits scene that acts as another 'reveal' but only leaves you confused as HELL.\
Aside from those gripes, the story is good in that it is consistently interesting and well-thought out. It is very mystery driven at some points, and the build up to the fights is tense as well. There are pacing problems, though, so the episodes are best watched in a cluster.\
Art: 10/10 - The animation of SnK is wonderful. It's among the best I've seen in any anime. It's movie-worthy. Studio WIT did a wonderful job. The manga's art is subpar, and even straight up bad for the first few volumes, but the anime just nails it. The backgrounds are always beautiful, the characters are always highly-detailed, and the fight scenes feel so smooth. Absolutely no complaints here.\
Sound: 10/10 - Another perfect 10, Sawano did an amazing job on the soundtrack, and the sound effects are satisfying as well. Sad moments are occupied with tear-jerking OSTs, and intense moments are only made more intense with the soundtrack. It includes my favorite anime OST ever, Vogel im Kafig. Also, the ODM gear sound is very satisfying and it's something that you don't feel when reading the manga.\
Character: 6/10 - I will admit right here and now, the manga, especially the later arcs, fix a lot of the problems I'm about to state. Doesn't excuse the fact that I hate how Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are characterized for the entire first season.\
Eren is your typical shounen protag with a distinct goal, stubborn personality, and edgy \"i swore to kill the all!\" lines. Mikasa is your usual female lead that's obsessed with the main character - she is given pretty decent development in the first half (ex. ep. 6), but she's simply really annoying. Constantly being like \"Eren! Eren! Are you okay?!\" Armin is annoying, though he became my favorite character in the manga. He's your standard bookworm that gets bullied and such, and never believes in himself. He's obviously really smart and can think of good plans, but it takes half an episode for Eren & Mikasa to convince him to do anything. The side characters aren't given enough development until season 2, and the characters they DO focus on are pretty one-dimensional. This is the worst aspect of SnK season 1 by far.\
Enjoyment: 9/10 - The first time I watched SnK, I was new to anime. I loved it. I binged it in just a few days. When I watch it with my friends, they love it as well. It's an anime a lot of non-anime fans watch. It's popular because it's simply fun to watch. The fights, glorious animation, soundtrack, and jaw-dropping reveals outshine most of the negative. Seeing the characters flying around on their spiderman-like gear fighting giant naked men is so intriguing and satisfying.\
Overall:  8/10 - Very enjoyable anime with pacing and characterization problems. It's one of the most popular anime for a reason - the simple yet intriguing premise, and the quality soundtrack & animation. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece and you should be pleasantly surprised. Again, a lot of the problems are fixed in later seasons/the manga, especially the characterization. I actually wrote an analysis of why I think Eren's characterization is genius. \

    With season 2 underway a friend of mine that's not very versed in anime was asking me about my thoughts on attack on titan before they started watching so while I have it on my mind I figured i'd make a spoiler free review just in case someone is interested and hasn't been told much about it as well.\
Overall the story is very interesting in my opinion. We start off in a world where humanity has been all but destroyed by giant monsters called titans except for the people living inside the walls that protect them. It follows Eren jaeger (who's childhood dream is to\
          \
        explore outside the walls) and his friends after the titans get through the first wall and kill thousands of people including his mother, which leads to him becoming obsessed with killing all the titans. A quick warning though, there is gore in this anime, which may be a turn off for some. \
The art and animation are great, almost nothing ive seen in it to complain about in both seasons so far other than a few cgi scenes for a titan in season 2 that really wasn't all that bad. The music is always great and fitting and the voice acting is very well done to were even I can tell that the actors are doing a fantastic job. Even the english dub which I just started watching is very well done in my opinion.\
Overall, the series is a roller coaster of action, emotions, great characters and world building that is very well done and keeps you glued in and wanting more and more every week.\

Story 10/10\
Concerning the story I think this is pretty original. This Anime is (currently) being faithful to the Manga if you're like me and you like to compare things then I suggest reading the Manga just remember it will obviously be full of spoilers.\
Art 10/10\
To be honest the only reason I gave this a 10 was because of the animation. The animation for Shingeki no Kyojin was just plain awesome! Every single action episode had me sitting on the\
          \
        edge of my seat.\
Sound 10/10\
 I must say I LOVE the opening and the soundtrack they have for battle. It's one of those things that give goosebumps because the soundtrack fit so well with the current scene.\
Character 10/10\
I must say I don't really like the impulsive yet committed Eren but quiet yet strong Mikasa and the weak yet smart Armin characters were going pretty well. They seem to have picked 2 main strong and weak points with each character and I thought that was pretty cool.\
Enjoyment 10/10\
 If you're a freak like me that can't seem to find an Anime with enough action and enough hint of romance I suggest you watch this one.\
Overall 10/10\
Overall this is Anime is one of the best I've ever watched and it's certainly made it into my top 5 and I die a little on the inside after I realize I have to wait a week after each episode.\

    There are occasions when good art and good story come together, shake hands and make love. This is one of those times. For some the content may be too violent, but people who like survival, action, suspense, tragedy, nice art and soundtrack, it's great. \
But let me be honest here and very blunt – Attack on Titan, as an anime, is more like a commercial to the manga series. Why do I say so? Like any commercial, it is attractive, interesting, it may have something so catchy in it that might get addictive. Just like this series: After episode 5 it’s like a roller coaster\
          \
        ride that you can’t stop until you have reached the end point. But like a commercial, you just get a glimpse of the product, but you won’t get a complete conclusion. This is either a good thing or a bad thing – depends on the person. \
I am one of those who finds this as a good thing. When the anime series started, the manga was no where near completion. So many series makers decide to do fillers to give anime some kind of an ending. And you do not know how deeply i hate and despise fillers.  I am quite sure many people would agree with me on this. But this amazing series actually followed the manga so well! And I think this is the reason many people liked it. But still, even close to following the manga, they had to end anime it at some particular point. And that particular peak had to be epic. And oh boy it was epic. But to reach that point there had to put more detail on some aspects (aka some people call it as a slow storyline, or a dragging of storyline, but i see it more like detail that adds more beauty to the anime as general - Marco's cape scene for example). To my mind they ended it at a good part. \
They also left little wonders for us - so we, now, as we have finished watching the ’’commercial’’, shall go and buy the product.. the manga. Such a perfect little scheme, eh? And i still loved it. Because I am glad I found this series. As far as the manga is out, it won’t be a letdown. \
\
Spoiler free, a and kind of simple review i wrote some time ago and added some things to it:\
STORY: 8 - Story is very good: it's well thought out and complicated enough to keep your interest up. Bunch of people living inside a walled community that is surrounded by threat– Titans, oh those Titans. What the hell are the they? What do they want from humans? Is it just the flesh they are after? Or something else?  And why do some look so retarded that you feel like laughing out loud sometimes? Are they really the only enemy? Can they become allies instead?\
I thought at first that the story was just good people vs. bad Titans. But nope. It’s way more complicated (i am especially hinting to the last episodes) And that’s why i liked it, the surprises can either be obvious or quite surprising – depending on the person. \
ART and ANIMATION: 11 - Ok, this is where this anime SHINES. Art is truly outstanding. I think that's what really caught my eye in the first place. What i really love is the detail they give to the eyes, and some other aspects for example: the backgrounds, the visuals, the freaking 3DMG scenes that make you drool of awesomeness. Spider-man people! (Drooling like Hanji here,  haha okay a joke) I really do not see anything bad about it. The scenes are great and epic. They really give out the ''wow'' effect. Definitely the reason why i really love this, because i love good art and good animation. Any video you try to edit with this anime will turn out awesome. Really, if I could, I'd give this section a 11/10.\
SOUND: 10 - Also, nothing bad to say.  The OST is nice. The first opening spread like a decease, but i think in a good way. I guess many people have replayed it lots of times? Some say they are getting tired of it because they have heard the opening so many times already. But hey, you can't deny you hated it, otherwise you would not have listened to it so much. I discovered that second opening song is actually better as a whole, and if you put them together you get some kind of special effect with them.. It’s up on yt somewhere. Anyways, very good music.  \
CHARACTER: 7 - I have noticed that every character has some kind of trait to them. \
A bit typical main character – Eren – trait: strong will and determination \
Then there is the heroine – Mikasa- trait: good fighting skills and intuition\
Their friend – Armin – trait: smart\
etc, I think every trait meets its purpose in the series.  \
My favourite is actually Armin because he is one of the smartest characters around.  At first he is weak, but your opinion will change of him as you reach in the middle of the series. Something he lacks he replaces with great mind, and I like that. The other one who will get a lot of character development will be Jean. As for other characters, the Sasha and Hanji are very funny. And Rivaille definitely makes this show ’’cooler’’. The way he stays strong at times, i really felt sorry for him and at the same time my admiration towards him grew.\
Later on you will see that some characters can be either good or bad..\
ENJOYMENT: 10 - Anyway, this anime is overall very enjoyable. One of the anime you have to watch in High Definition if possible. It just keeps you on your seat and time just flies when you watch it. At some times the anime should be renamed Attack on Feels, yet that is what makes Shingeki no Kyojin a good anime that deserves the hype it gets.\
Overall - 10 - Because the enjoyment I had with this anime was just way above anything else I have seen recently. Awesome art and animation. Great adaption. :)\

    I don't know why this anime didn't appeal to me as much as I thought but it took me a long time to finish this...\
The story is very unique I have to say. It seems to be one of the most popular anime out there, even people who didn't watch anime started watching because of this. It contains action, humor, mystery...a lot of good stuff although it did seem to be like others when you think of shounen anime. They fight out monsters just like a bunch of other anime but good thing they did make the story in their own way with the characters,\
          \
        setting, and plot twists a long the way. \
The art is a lot different than some anime art but just in my personal opinion, I didn't really like how it seemed a lot more like a drawing than other anime designs. I know that anime is based from drawings but this particular one was just not much to my liking. Other than that, the characters all look different(the main ones at least) and the scenery is beautiful.\
The sound is really intense because this anime is obviously intense and it consists of a lot of yelling. The openings are really catchy and they don't exaggerate when they're fighting the titans. The sound has good emphasis drama when needed and I guess that's really all that matters.\
The characters were very unique although Eren was a little generic like the typical shounen boy protagonist and Mikasa as the typical skilled girl protagonist who is attached to the main boy protagonist. As I said, these cliches were cancelled out by their unique back stories which changed their characters to make them seem cooler I guess and liked by the audience even if it was a little overdramatic.\
I thought I'd enjoy this more but I give it a six because although it is interesting, I didn't want to watch the next episode sometimes which caused me to take breaks between episodes. The fights were interesting but it got old pretty fast. I wasn't really sure what to enjoy besides the fights.\
Overall the anime is good if you like action and mystery but it is a bit over hyped. \

    Hype-Short for hyperbole: To promote or publicize an idea often exaggerating its benefits \
\
Like any medium in entertainment and art anime sometimes produces something which reaches completely ridiculous levels of popularity which rises above all competition, becomes a cultural icon symbolic of the time period from whence it was created and even transcend the boundaries of the hardcore fan base to be totally mainstream. Typically critical opinion is divided on such juggernauts with some critics attributing its overwhelming success to it being a brilliant work within its genre while others considering it to be a cash cow that calculated a formula to agree with the\
          \
        minds of every hardcore entertainment devourer. It has certainly happened before in anime from Code Geass(2006-8) to Sword Art Online(2012), the former being rather decent and the latter being a disgusting trainwreck. It would seem then that there is no real formula for what is hyped an the process is rather random. However, as popular and hyped as those previously mentioned shows were, none of them has quite matched the monolithic purge of today's subject Shingeki no Kyojin. Since is it impossible to live up to something that is by definition exaggerated I will at least attempt to discover with this review what makes this cash cow tick and how it managed to captivate so many wide eyed audiences, anime fans or not.\
STORY-.The main premise of Shingeki, while not original, is interesting enough to create some good mystery and ideas right off the bat. Its a simple idea of man being threatened by a greater force which taps into a rather primal fear that we all share that perhaps one day we may no longer be on the top of the food chain like we have for so long. It does however leave the series with quite a simple end goal to work towards: kill the giants before they eat us. Because of this Shingeki has to do something else with its concept to keep people watching and it does this by adding layers of mystery and intrigue on top to keep itself fresh while relying on heart stopping cliffhangers and tension to make the whole fighting giants shtick more intense. \
Despite this sounding all very fine in theory I would be lying if I said that Shingeki executes its blend of action, tension and mystery perfectly. Probably one of the reasons Shingeki made its rather unusual sounding premise more exciting and appealing to shounen watchers as well as fans of more mystery based dark fantasy/horror anime is by over utilizing the plot twist as a narrative device. If all there is to do is kill giants then you obviously have to pull some twists but Shingeki milks this. It applies an 'everything you know is wrong' attitude to each story arc and episode where it will flip your perception of where the story is heading and change everything you thought was going to happen regardless of whether it makes sense or not. Shingeki's main mysteries are not actually that difficult to figure out with 2 of the most notable ones being flat out guessed by the viewership when the show first aired. Its is the progression of the plot however that is unpredictable which is both a positive and a negative for it and that is down to a few factors. The first of these factors is something that the fan base give Shingeki a lot of praise for and that is removing or lessening the shounen trope of 'plot armor' meaning that more characters die in this series and stay dead than in other shounen series. While this is a refreshing idea these people are slightly deluded as the plot armor removal in Shingeki only applies to the secondary characters, the main characters still have ridiculous plot armor, even escaping from situations that seem impossible or highly improbable to escape from. Yes, despite the initially horrifying and intriguing premise and setup, Shingeki opts for quite a few bad narrative mistakes which sometimes diminish the believability of the show and break immersion with its dark and serious world. One of these mistakes is the previously mentioned asspulls which attempt to justify some of the series more brutal twists and turns. Though while these asspulls are definitely there, they never flat out ruined the tension of the show for me, they just made me question what the writer was thinking in pulling them and subtracted from realism.\
The other issue is the pacing which is rather hit or miss. The pacing at the start is very fast and that really works in the Shingeki's favor, giving a real feeling of desperation and excitement and really gets you hooked. After a few episodes the show slows the pace down for a rushed training arc which breaks all the feeling of adrenaline that the first few episodes give. Luckily it picks up again afterwards for the next arc which feels a lot more fleshed out and kept me engaged much better. The pace does noticeably slow down as the show reaches the second half, with more focus being given to slower plot progression that breakneck tension before picking up again for the finale. I felt like the show could never really decide on what it wanted to do with its pacing and feel so just messed around. There were parts where it was balanced and really matched the tone of the story such as episodes 1-3, 5-13 and 17 onwards but there were hiccups that can't be ignored. If there's one place where I have to give credit where it is due it would have to be that for only a 25 episode series Shingeki has pretty impressive worldbuilding. The rudimentary social, political and historical aspects of the world are touched upon within the series which is something that I enjoy seeing in post-apocalyptic anime like this. Though, while impressive, it is by no means groundbreaking and I personally feel the series should have been longer or spent time to go into more detail on this good backdrop.\
Despite all my negatives though, Shingeki is still a solid action/thriller series with some good tension and always keeps you coming back for more. The nitty gritty details don't always make 100% sense and if that bothers you then you're probably going to dislike this show. Though for me they were never tension breaking issues and i'm purely trying to point out the flaws of the series to the kind of blind fanboys that so often cloud the review section here on MAL. Similarly, detractors of the series, usually harsh critics into complex, realistic stories like me tend to ignore the series' merits. To me, having great tension, worldbuilding and pacing like Shingeki has at its best is a narrative success worthy of due merit and certainly explains some of the show's wild popularity but Shingeki is by no means a perfect execution of its initial concept.\
Story-6.8/10 Good concept and tension, very gripping but asspulls, over using twists and pacing hiccups drag it down\
CHARACTERS-Shingeki's characters are much like its plot, a lot of potential with some good and bad results in execution. I'm going to be talking about the main 3 characters as well as the supporting cast. Firstly, I have to discuss possibly the biggest issue Shingeki has with characterization and that is what I like to call character over-saturation. Shingeki has too many characters to handle! I know that such a detailed world needs lots of people to populate it and make it feel alive and realistic but its all about how characters are used more than the characters themselves. Fullmetal Alchemist(2003) and its remake Brotherhood(2009) for example also have a very detailed fantasy world and many characters inhabit it but all the characters are used well in the plot. They add character to certain areas and parts of the story and many of them have an active role in it. Many of Shingeki's characters end up feeling like titan fodder rather than entities that have an impact on the plot which can be an issue. It would be fine if these were background characters being used in this way but a lot of them are actually recurring secondary characters. It gets to a point where you can't remember many of the characters names because they only appeared for 5 minutes in one episode about 5 episodes ago and you were meant to remember them because OMG THEY JUST DIED. This makes it hard to care about many of the deaths in the show as only a few plot important characters die in the series while LOADS of the other unimportant secondary characters die and at first it works as a way of enforcing the feeling of danger and fear the show wants you to feel but after a while it gets kind of boring. Beside that though, this can be ignored if the main cast are good, so are are they? ehhhhh kind of...\
Of the 3 main heroes of the story I believe 2 of them to be well characterized but I feel as though I have to start with the primary problem, our main character, Eren Yeager. Eren's initial characterization and personality I will admit is not bad and kind of understandable if a little cliche and similar to other shounen protagonists. He longs to be free of the walls that bind humanity but after they take away his home and family he swears to obliterate them from Earth. He is certainly a frustrating character to watch for the first 15 episodes as his single minded desire for revenge tends to lead to his actions mainly being reckless and without regard of consequences. This would be fine IF the story had Eren learn that this leads him to unforeseen consequences and greater suffering, a character progression which would fit the theme of humanity working together to fight a common enemy. But instead Eren is constantly rewarded for being a reckless douche and punished any time he attempts to be more calm and collected in the face of danger. This is possibly the weirdest execution of a revenge character progression that I have ever seen and needless to say it doesn't really work and feels contrived. It dosen't help that Eren is practically insufferable as a character for the majority of the show due to previously mentioned reckless douche persona that he never gets over. So if a series royally screws up its main character, can the others make up for it? Actually, they kind of can.\
Eren's friend Armin Arlert is a rather tired archetype of the shy kid with not much confidence in himself but thankfully his character progression is handled much better. He shares Eren's desire for freedom but has no confidence in his own abilities. His friends and various events throughout the story help him come out of his shell and start to help the fight for humanity with his talent for strategy. The progression is by no means original but its handled well here and the development of his character is both justified and clearly visible throughout the series, a huge step up from the characterization of Eren.\
And saving the best for last we have Mikasa Ackerman, possibly the most complex character Shingeki has to offer and also the one that the fanbase latched onto when they saw it. She is Eren's adopted sister and a complete badass in every sense of the word but thankfully the writers didn't limit her character to that and actually gave her quite a bit of depth. She was one of the only characters to  be given a full backstory of events prior to the start of the series and a very dark one at that. Her dark past has seriously warped her worldview causing to be both overprotective of her remaining family and also very apathetic towards the overall situation of the war against the titans. The story's first major arc after the training arc really gives her some great character moments and pulls throws lots of curveballs to the viewer about what she really cares about and what she lives for. Unfortunately after about episode 9 the show kind of just stops developing her and instead just keeps re-iterating what we already know about her which is quite disappointing. However, she still remains pretty much the best thing about Shingeki character-wise and I hope the second series has some more development for her. \
As far as the other major characters go, there are the members of the trainees which get introduced to the story early on and some are more important than others. The more interesting ones include Annie Leonhardt, a mysterious girl who has some conncetion to the plot but who hasn't had much individual focus on her character yet and Jean Kirchstein, a cadet who initially wanted a peaceful life within the walls but then becomes a leader after witnessing the horror of the titans. He's actually quite a believable character and probably would have been a better protagonist that Eren. A lot of these other characters have quite interesting personalities but don't get much focus so I can't judge them as characters but they certainly do their job well in the story in providing a good backdrop for the detailed world Shingeki has constructed.\
Characters-7.0/10 Good supporting cast(if a little neglected), 2 of the main characters are good, DAT AWFUL MC THO, character 'over saturation' is a slight issue.\
ART-Remember what I said about giving credit where it is due? Well now I have to give a whole bunch of it because this show LOOKS AMAZING. This is to be expected as it is co-produced by Production I.G, the geniuses behind bringing Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex(2002) to life and always have top notch production values. The art style is very effective in conveying the kind of dark, gloomy feel that Shingeki attempts to conjure up with its bleak color pallete and very foreboding atmosphere is constantly reflected in the designs of the cities and landscapes which look like a world on the edge of collapse. The character designs are fairly standard stuff but the designs of the titans are truly terrifying and definitely whack up the creepy factor of the show's concept. Some of the landscapes are totally breathtaking such as the fields outside the walls and the buildings of Trost which conjure up a medieval feeling but are also totally unique to Shingeki's world and add to the richness of the worldbuilding itself.\
The animation while nothing special most of the time really pulls out all the stops when the 3D maneuver gear is involved. These sequences, especially during the fight scenes look absolutely jaw dropping almost to the point of being distracting but mostly do nothing but add to Shingeki's sense of breakneck tension. The animation in the 2 opening sequences is also rather noteworthy for being pretty top notch as well and also matching the 2 opening themes. Shingeki is also pretty well directed, something I often notice as an editor an media student. I would expect this of course from its director Tetsuro Araki who directed Death Note(2006) which despite being mostly dialogue driven had its fair share of fantastically directed scenes. Araki brings his epic, sweeping directing style to Shingeki which is totally the right show to receive this treatment given the premise resulting in some of the best singular scenes I have ever seen in TV anime.\
Art-9.6/10 Breathtaking art style, animation and direction\
SOUND-Ah i'm really not making a particularly balanced case for this but Shingeki's aesthetic qualities are all pretty flawless. The soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano can be summed up by 1 simple 4 letter word and that is: Epic. And I mean epic in its original sense of being grand in scale, not in the internet sense of being anything on the level of a cat playing piano or an episode of Naruto. Not all the grand orchestral pieces, sweeping choirs and rock ballads are instantly memorable but damn are they effective in conjunction with the show's epic conflict and battles. They are also masterfully timed with what emotions the show wants you to feel. The show wants you to feel hopeful and pumped BAM it plays the engrish rock ballad 'The Reluctant Heroes' to aid that feeling.The show wants to create a sense of scale and make a battle seem epic BAM it plays the sweeping 'Counter Attack Mankind' complete with choirs and fast paced electronic beats to place you there on the battlefield for mankind's freedom. The 2 opening themes are also worthy of credit. The fast paced and so gloriously OTT 'Guren no Yumiya' along with the symphonic, German inflected 'Jiyuu no Tsubasa' literally bleed adrenaline through the screen and are one of the reasons that Shingeki glues you to the screen.\
The voice acting in Japanese is mostly fine, general stuff really. I will give special mention to Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa who manages to capture the character's equally stoic but unstable demeanor perfectly. The dub was something that I did not have particularly high hopes for when I saw the trailer as the voices sounded like Funimation's usual bunch doing their usual thing and I feared that effort had not been put in to make the dub anything more than passable as happened with Soul Eater(2009) and other recent productions. However I was quite surprised at the outcome after buying the DVD and sitting down to watch the dub with some friends. Bryce Pappenbrook actually does a fairly decent job of making Eren a more understandable character and actually made him easier to put up with(which trust me is not easy). Josh Grelle did a good job as Armin if a litte prone to play to the archetype.  Trina Nishimura's portrayal of Mikasa seems to go the other way from the japanese track and makes the character practically overflowing  with emotion which I felt was kind of cheesy and a bad ADR decision which is a shame as it was a very strong performance otherwise. The supporting voice cast are all pretty good, mainly playing to the characters basic archetypes but having enough range to carry all the emotional and more complex scenes the show has at points. \
Sound-9.0/10 Epic OST, good voice tracks both Japanese and English, some questionable perfromances, mind blowing openings\
Enjoyment-Some would say this is the most important factor in deciphering Shingeki's popularity and I would totally agree. The narrative issues and characterization shortcomings are things I just had to point out seeing as this show has an absurdly high rank on this site and people's reviews do not seem to be pointing out its issues. I first saw Shingeki when I was just getting into anime and it was being hyped to no end. Not knowing much about the medium, I thought it was the most awesome thing I had ever seen. As a much more seasoned watcher now I can recognize it flaws but I certainly cannot deny its impact upon first watch. It was a show with a great premise, kickass action, nail biting tension and some notable characterization and worldbuilding for only a 25 episode series so far. The story iteslf always keeps you watching if you are willing to overlook some of the more questionable plot elements. Some people who demand realism and have a fervent distaste for plot holes may find their engagement and immersion broken on many occasions. If you can just let yourself be caught up in its epic scope then you may find the mystery, tension and detailed world brought so brilliantly to life in animated form enough to patch over its narrative shortcomings and you will certainly enjoy it. \
Enjoyment-8.0/10 Very enjoyable experience due to tension, premise and world executed with more epicness than any hollywood blockbuster has to offer, not too great if you go for close analysis\
Final scores\
ONS(Overall narrative score, Story+Characters/2)=6.9 Grade: C \
OAS(Overall aesthetic score, Art+Sound/2)=9.3 Grade: A+\
OFS(Overall final score, average of all categories)=8.08 Grade: B \
Conclusion-I find myself torn on this one. Here I have a show that had an awesome concept, kept me riveted throughout and had a lot going for it to climb into the pantheon of anime greatness. Upon first look it really seems to get there at least moreso than other overhyped garbage like the subject of my last review Mirai Nikki(2011) but upon my close critical analysis after mulling the series over in my mind after re-watch I realize it could have been so much more without some mistakes in key areas. Shingeki no Kyojin is not a great show, but it is a good one which is more than I can say for a lot of things that get hyped by this community.\
I am EvaGeekDewayne and this has been my opinion, please do remember that, it is the key to co-operation in this barren land we call the internet.\

       I haven't read the Attack on Titan manga, and don't intend to. The art seems terrible from what I've seen and honestly I just don't want to spend the money. So, I went into this anime relatively blind, knowing only that there were Titans, they got attacked, and alot of people seemed to like the outcome that is this series. So what did I think? Well, Attack on Titan has its good points, and it has its bad. Let's start with the story. Going into this anime, I expected the story to be very simple, with more focus being placed on the\
          \
        characters. The reasoning behind this is the premise that is provided in the first episode; there are Titans, and they attack. As the story unfolded, I realized that I could not have been more wrong. Attack on Titans is, for the most part, a plot driven anime. The viewers are quickly yet smoothly thrust from point A to B, and the only character development that takes place either happens along the ride or directly before a massive fight scene (will talk about later). The story is paced expertly, and while the twists are notoriously predictable, the show is good enough that you can know exactly what is going to happen next and still enjoy yourself.\
  And then there are the characters. Attack on Titan features a main trio of sorts, which consists of Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert. Whenever there is a group of main characters that the viewer is intended to follow from the beginning of the story to the end, one must always look for four individual archetypes(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles examples will be used for the sake of simplicity)- the heroic main guy (Leonardo), the badass-selfish-lonely jerk (Raphael), the smart one (Donatello), and the pretty and/or funny one (if Michaelangelo was human you can bet your ass he would be good looking). In a group of three, one character usually ends up getting the best (or worst) of two of the four archetypes while the other two follow form (Ex: Harry Potter is the hero, Ron is the lonely jerk, and Hermione gets the other two). In Attack on Titans, that character is Mikasa Ackerman, who gets the Raphael archetype and the pretty one archetype. And sweet Mother Theresa on the hood of a Mercedes-Benz is this character annoying. Mikasa is quiet (note: not shy), beautiful (surprise there), funny when she wants to be (but never one to laugh at somebody else's joke), just absolutely amazing at everything (top of the class and all that), and, wait for it, absolutely amazing at everything. She's essentially a female Sasuke as Sasuke was in his very first appearance, except Mikasa never developed afterward and instead of having the badass purpose of killing her sadistic older brother, Mikasa just wants to protect the main character with her life. Granted, her character isn't entirely worthless. Mikasa is reallly good at killing things, but wants to spend her life protecting Eren, creating a sense of  conflicting irony that becomes clear at key moments with her character. Speaking of Eren, he starts out promisingly enough, then quickly falls into the background after the tenth episode (can't really say anything more without spoilers). He isn't a good or bad character, just painfully average.  Armin Arlert is the smart member of the group, and easily the second best character in the series. He has actual growth, is written intelligently, and contributes to the story. My favorite character would have to be Annie Leonhardt, who basically gets more character development than every other character in this series combined in all of the ten minutes for which she actually has dialogue. Once again, can't say any more about her without major spoilers.\
   From a special effects point of view, this series is fantastic. The soud is brilliant, and the manner with which the CGI is incorporated into the animation is brilliant. As a result, all of the fight scenes stand out and are just all around awesome. The art on the other hand, is average. When there isn't any fighting going on, expect a lot of still shots and facial shots.\
  Overall, Attack on Titan is a decent, but overhyped and overrated series. Go in expecting nothing more than mindless action and you'll get more than you bargained for. Go in expecting a well-thought out anime fraught with meaning and you'll spend the rest of your live wishing spent that time watching something else.\

    At first, I was hesitant to watch this anime. After just a few glimpses of all the blood and gore that it is comprised of, I was immediately scared off. Aside from the violence, the Titans were disturbing enough that I thought I would have nightmares were I to ever watch this anime. If my friends had not consistently praised this anime, I would have passed it off as an anime I would never watch. Luckily for me, my friends were persistent in urging me to watch it, which is a decision I did not regret. It was as violent and disturbing as I feared,\
          \
        but there were so many elements to this anime that I had not given it credit for at first glance. The whole concept of it was so refreshingly novel, and the storyline was incredibly realistic. Of course, by realistic, I don't mean that the Titans and the 3D-Maneuver Gear are real, but rather, the way that situations turn out seem so much more like what might happen in real life. Everyone enjoys a happy ending, but there is a certain appeal those cheesy animes don't have that Shingeki no Kyojin does. The only reason the \"Enjoyment\" level is an 8 is because I don't particularly enjoy the sights and sounds of blood and death. I would definitely recommend this anime!\

    First, I'm sure the hype around this series is what ultimately ruined it for me. I live in South Korea, where Shingeki no Kyojin is feverishly popular, even by those who would not willingly call themselves anime-watchers. Too much hype = disappointment.\
Additionally, I watched Shingeki no Kyojin simultaneously with Deadman Wonderland, which probably also dragged my view of this series even lower.\
The Good:\
I love this shadow-box style that litters the images of this anime. It's very unique and has a good gritty, old school feeling that is pretty much the sole reason I watched the whole first season.\
The Bad:\
The story is dreadfully lacking in character\
          \
        development, particularly in everyone but the female lead (who is very cool, I will admit).\
Everything else:\
There are some things that just sting like bees throughout each and every episode which unfortunately kept me from enjoying this anime.\
As I said before, I live in South Korea, and giants attacking a small enclosed city has so much potential as a deep and meaningful metaphor in today's rather jaded society, but Shingeki no Kyojin lacks a great deal of elegance and instead shoves this metaphor down your throat. Unfortunately, so far, the anime has yet to come to any minor or major conclusion and drags on, just as real life, so it's a little too ... depressing. Depressing isn't always bad, but it just doesn't work with a cast of largely unlikeable characters. (Deadman Wonderland, which also brought a very depressing life to your front door, was extremely more elegant in how it handled character emotions and pulled together relationships. Since I watched these two together, Shingeki no Kyojin was relatively very poor in comparison).\
I really cannot stand the the Star Trek red shirt syndrome this anime has. Those that have watched will understand, but I will not elaborate for fear of spoilers.\
Along that same line, many of the relationships are overly forced and unnatural, which usually is not that hard to pull off in a military anime, but Shingeki no Kyojin still manages to have clunky relationships with strange personal battles that provide little progression in the story. They do create situations, but because of that, the situations are painfully forced and a little too contrived.\
Overall, the styling is interesting. The dialog is forgettable. The characters are less-than-loveable with very little character growth. The story is fast but feels slow. It's a bit of a mixed bag, and I don't believe I will be watching any further.\

    This may seem like one of your regular reviews on one of the most popular shows of the season, but just bear with me.\
Attack on Titan, as you may know, was one of the most highly anticipated shows of the season. Well, no offense to the show or anything, I'm just going to say right now that it didn't really have much competition in the first place. Let's see what's in our endless pool of mediocrity for the Spring and summer Seasons:\
Free\
Brothers Conflict\
Karneval\
Watamote\
Another Gundam\
DogxScissors\
Moe\
Moe\
Moe\
etc.\
So yeah, my point stands that Shingeki no Kyojin is good considering what it's been up against. Right now, modern anim itself\
          \
        is swimming in a pool of panty shots and adorable huge eyes. I guess you could say that's why I started Attack on Titan with a bit of a lower expectation. That was a big mistake,\
First thing that I noticed:\
The opening, Guren no Yumiya. I have been watching anime for about 4 years, not as long as any of you, but still, I've seen a fair share of openings, and with the exception of your once in a lifetime perfect discovery, like FMA or Toradora, all of them are the fucking same! They're bubblegum J-Pop that I'v heard so many times that basically, whenever I listen, it feels like I'm getting raped in the ears by a fucking cotton candy machine. Guren no Yumiya, and not to mention the second opening that is equally if not more cool than the first one really start you off with an \"Oh, wow, I could really get into this.\" Kind of mood. Allso, the beginning German statement to start it off (Which translates to \"Are you eating? No, we are the hunters,\" btw) Really gets that feeling of baddassery. And it's not just the openings and closings either, the transitional soundtrack has a really dramatic touch as well that really fits every scene it's put in. Bravo.\
Okay, Many people have been getting on the case of the weakness of the characters, but I, for one, think it's a good mixture. You have your three main protagonists, Eren, Armin, and Mikasa, who fit really well together even though they're less comparable than God to the Devil. A lot of hate has been given to Armin in particular. Yeah, he's a pussy, I know, but still. His intelligence dramatically surpasses the stupidity and ignorance of the human race, and I think that's what helped him survive so far. He's a weak character, but they cant all be Kenshiros, that'd be boring as fuck. It seems there's a good mixture of personalities here throughout the anime. You have potato girl as a comic relief, (Really, who the fuck cares what her real name is?), Revaille/Levi, the calm, collected commander who is the source of fangirls all over the world's screams and blown ovaries, and then a bunch of other characters who all have their own special way of being useless or useful in whatever ways seem possible. \
As for plot, I'd say it's a pretty creative twist on the cliché theme of monsters taking over humanity, and damn, it had a really dramatic start for the first episode. There was so much going on, between the terror of the wall being broken, to the death of Eren's mother. I really enjoy the story personally b/c you don't know what's going ot happen next. It's really exciting. There's only ONE thing. The future is depending on fucking teenagers for god's sake. ORIGINAL. *Cough cough* Evangelion... *Cough*\
The art of the story has fantastic movement. The 3D maneuver gear is one of the coolest technologies ever invented in anime and it looks so cool as they're swinging through trees and houses and shit. The design of the titans, however, creeps me the fuck out. If that's what it's meant to do, good. They did their job correctly.  \
\
So yeah, there's my review. Overall, this anime gets a 9.5, which I think is fair.\

    This is my third review, so bare with me as it may be a little down.\
There will be SLIGHT spoilers that won't affect the series, so don't be offended.\
Shingeki no Kyojin, in other words, Attack on Titan.\
When I first watched this, I was an immediate fanboy of AOT.\
Though after watching more, it changed. Most reviewers here reviewed this series on just 7 episodes, with that, you can't judge a proper show.\
With reading the manga and up to episode 16, I could make a fair review.\
The plot? Ehhh it's kinda more like Giant zombies with fucked up faces eating humans even though they're titans.\
I'm having problems\
          \
        with this plot really. Giants eating humans even though they need to, along with NO weapon that could damage them except blades? Not to mention the fact that they're just running around butt-naked.\
A giant who breaks through the first wall, then just disappears? I mean, shouldn't this be like, MASS destruction? Not to mention the sudden titan teleportation where the characters were guarding. I mean, wtf since when could they teleport?\
As for the actual plot of this series, it's pretty much one of those things where it's like \"Oh let's search for this! It's our goal!\" and it never gets there.\
Another problem is that there is too much talk, and no action.\
The MC? Well he's fueled by rage, which I don't mind, but Misaka? Don't kid with me.  She's \"good' at everything while following a guy while she's somewhat better in certain things. The prime example would be a Lion following a Dolphin, it's laughable.\
As for the enjoyment, I enjoyed it, I mean slaughtering titans with rage sure is fun, but as I said, too much talk in this so if you're looking for action with a ongoing anime, DO NOT START THIS. Wait until it ends so you won't be tickling your dick every week for more titan fapping.\
I'm just disappointed with the fanboys hyping this up just like SAO, just because the reviewers like it so much they immediately slap a 10/10 on this series while it does NOT deserve it. \
Story is decent, art is good for the show, the sound is really good, but the character? Ehhhhhhh. *no comment*\
Overall I'm giving this a 7.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin. An anime that I have seen so many people go crazy over. Of course, I was extremely curious as to why this is so. So, I watched the first episode, and watched up to 13 (turning point in the story + latest episode) in just one day, and I have to say, their actions are justified.\
(I have watched 13 episodes at this point of the review)\
So lets start with why I think this is such an amazing anime. The titans are the main antagonists of the series. The beings who terrorize the humans and eat them just for the sake of doing\
          \
        so. The sound of this already makes the titans seem extremely scary. \
However, the anime takes one steps further, combining extremely excellent writing, well-made visuals, sound effects and background music to totally immerse the viewer into the anime, allowing the viewer to put themselves in the main characters' shoes, and making them feel as if they are part of the battle against these fearsome creatures. You will actually feel how scary the titans are, and wish you could do something to destroy these creatures once and for all, just as Eren Jaegar, the main character, does. \
Moreover, every episode keeps you on the edge of your seats. You almost never know what is going to happen. Every episode is fresh, exciting and leaves you wanting more. \
At this point in time, that's all I can write about this anime, but if you havent given it a try, you should. Its not called one of the best anime of 2013 for no reason.\

    Attack on titan(Shingeki no Kyojin) is a series that will, most likely, be forgotten in the next decade. I will admit that attack on titan is extremely popular as of this moment of time, but never did it reach the status of most popular. The 3 sections I will be going into depth are story, characters, and enjoyment. Art and sound are more subjective to the viewers tastes and when the work was made so they will have smaller parts in the review.\
story-\
To a viewer that has not watched anime made pre 90's the story may be exciting and amazing, but if you have watched\
          \
        pre 90's, then you might have watched a series called zeta gundam. Zeta gundam has a couple of similarities to attack on titan. First off, they are both very dark stories. In attack on titan, humanities is in fear from the titans that are beyond the wall. In zeta gundam, on Kamille's(the main character of zeta gundam) colony, the titan faction of the earth federation are abusing their power and are taking advantage of the civilians. Other similarities are both main characters moms are killed by their series titans, their dads are never around, both main characters find out they can pilot(control) a large humanoid object through a life or death scenario, and the obvious point, both enemy factions are called the titans. There are more but they would be considered spoilers. The point being made is that, for me, this is not the first time i've seen this story, they are fairly similar that I was having relapses to zeta gundam and remembering it, but in the defense of attack on titan, why fix something if it isn't broken?\
Art-\
Art is a very hard thing to put a number too as its all personal preference. I will say for this that, for individual frames, its great, for animation on the other hand, its very hit and miss. The 3D animation with the maneuver gear is amazing, but when it comes to face to face conversations, the only thing really moving is the characters mouth. That shouldn't be really acceptable now a days since everything is digital. When it was cell painting(hand painting) it was much harder to have many things happening at once with the budgets they had and how each frame needed to be hand painted. While now everything can be done through a computer so you can have hair movement while they are talking and have other things going on. There is a pose with levi looking to his side, and over the course of his scenes, when ever they had him looking to his side with the same clothes on, they just changed the background, reusing the pose. This is a prime example, like evangelion, of poor budgeting, sure the first few episodes looked great, and so did some ending pieces, but the center you could see where they cut corners.\
sound-\
By far the better portion of the series, the openings were very energizing, the soundtrack was good. The vocal tracks in the series are very good, while everything else just was there. The endings for me were forgettable. The majority of it is just personal preference, which it did fit my preference so it worked for me.\
Characters-\
Oh the characters. This issue comes along with the story problem i had, the characters seem like rips from zeta gundam. Eren is almost an exact replica of Kamille, Mikasa is what would happen if you mixed Fa and Emma together. Captain Erwin and armin to an extent are much like Quattro Bajeena. There are a multitude of examples i can list off here but i feel ive made my point. But at this moment in time, it feels like Armin is the most original character I've seen.\
Enjoyment-\
Now this is where i believe is the most crucial point of any series, did you enjoy it? I could care less if it has the best visuals, the sharpest sound, best story or what else, if I didn't enjoy it, then I didn't like it. For Attack on Titan, i enjoyed PARTS of it, but not the whole thing. The pacing of the series really jarred me because not only do they have episodes that take place over years, but they have episodes in real time, which when you combine the fact that they never tell you how long its been between gaps, it feels like you are never fully amerced into the show. And the \"read the manga\" ending really killed it for me.\
overall-\
Like I explained in the enjoyment section, enjoyment is what really matters to a show, so enjoyment is always the overall grade of the show. Now given that this is the Wit studios first series, they are learning how to make a good anime, and they picked probably the best manga to make an adaptation for, but you'd think they'd learn from the gainax's animation spiral for evangelion. If they had taken their time and spent the budget better, then it would have looked much better then just throwing thick black lines at us.\
\
final words-\
If you are new to anime or love shounen then attack on titan is good for you, but if you've been around a while and watched certain series then you might start noticing certain aspects that might make it look less appealing.\

Because of my anime experience, I do not see the appeal to attack on titan, but maybe you do.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is a story with amazing setting, but it unfortunately fails to deliver. It focuses on a boy named Eren that wants to save the world, which is a concept regurarly recycled and unoriginal. The whole plot seems to be finding the way into Eren's father basement, but the characters seem to forget it all the time and instead the story focuses on delivering cliche drama and lazy plot twists. I don't want to spoil the story much, even though not much happens, however it's pretty average at best. \
What anime excels at is the art and sound. The animation is truly beautiful\
          \
        and fits the premise perfectly and so does the sound. The opening sequence of Attack on Titan is a great introduction to the anime and sure catches attention. What this anime does also well is portraying the world where humans live in fear, and animators aren't afraid to show us gruesome images and scenes, which entraces the viewer and creates a great atmosphere. This, in combination with the perfectly fit sound makes this anime very enjoyable to watch.\
Now... the characters. Eren is a typical shounen protagonist, who wants to be the best at what he does and wants to save the world. His best friend - Mikasa, is a quiet girl with amazing skills who follows Eren everywhere. The only character who seems to have some sort of development in the entire series is Armin. The rest of the cast are one dimensional characters that are easily forgotten.\
Despite the anime's flaws, Shingeki no Kyojin is very enjoyable, but enjoyment =/= it's good. It's an average anime at best, extremely overhyped and lacks depth and character development, which is the show's crucial downside. The cliche drama this show tries to pull doesn't work very well if the viewer can't connect with the characters. Therefore I rate this anime 6/10. It hurts me how much it fails to deliver on its premise but oh well..\

    The anime, Shingeki no Kyojin, is about Little Eren Jagger and his two friends. Little Eren Jagger discovers he has asspirations to become a First Class Titan killer and fight off those who betrayed him. He also has a very, very temporal anger issue he needs to get taken care of. \
Upon discovering this anime I was excited, but that excitement was drained out like a sewer drain. \
This anime was misleading, for I did not see ONE Kyojin throughout the entire show. There were titans, sure, but Kyojins were nowhere to be found. And what is this Shingeki business? It sounds like some kind\
          \
        of sushi. I didn't see that either. What I look for in anime is titles that lead you to the right place. This was the completely polar opposite of that. \
I would not recommend this to any one, not even my pet. Do not watch this \"Shingeki no Krook\" or \"Shingeki no Lies\", because the only wall it breaks is the wall of my trust. \
And, I would also like to point out the blatant RIP OFF of Boku no Pico, a finer anime. There are three main characters in the show who look almost identical. I will not stand for this\

    It's been a while since I've touched any anime after being let down and disappointed by so many before, in general a lot of them just seem like their strong points were never good writing and character development, but rather relying on pretty artwork, over-the-top cute characters, dumb, contrived, plot lines, and/or zany antics. Although I was skeptical about Attack on Titan, as it looked like just another gore-action fest, I was surprised by how strong the writing and character development was, it's easily among my top 3 animes after finishing this first season. This series got me started watching anime again after I lost\
          \
        faith in this medium.\
The action scenes are really, really, cool, along with the Spider-man like devices they use to maneuver around - but these are used to serve the story, rather than the story serving them. I also found the plot pretty interesting, but what makes the show stand out is how it connects with you at such a human level, dealing with characters, emotions, and choices that were very easy to empathize with; this makes you feel for the characters and the dilemmas they face. The characters and story are portrayed in such a human, believable, way. This is perhaps what pulls me away, and out of, most animes - relying on having such eccentric, silly, unbelievable, plots or characters with stupid catch phrases.\
However, Attack on Titan is not without faults, it does get a bit too heavy-handed at times, interjecting at the climax of action scenes. The monologues are sometimes overly melodramatic or extended, with constant flashbacks, which at times I felt pulled me out of what was actually happening. At one point we're pounded by a scene with the protagonist's Mom to the point of exhaustion. Despite these flaws, the writing is strong and the characters believable.\

    ...This anime...\
I had absolutely NO expectations going into this anime... maybe I should've had some. Nah, what's the point, it would've surpassesd them all.\
I tihnk the best adjective to describe this anime is \"Godly\". Or maybe I've just been so many shitty anime coming out recently that I got so fucking excited watching people battle taller, sexual organ-lacking, fat blobs of what they claim to be sunlight.\
Shingeki no Kyojin gives you a gut-wrenching feeling as you go into it and you come out. It gets you on the edge with the end of each episode and makes you lose your man card. Starting slowly, it\
          \
        picks up pace. \
The flashbacks were used really efficiently as well. While giving you all the action you need, this anime doesn't fail to shit all over your emotions.\
The art and animation was great, no doubt. But the music made your ears orgasm like there was no tomorrow. It is not impossible to get turned on by the soundtracks that made you want to shit yourself at the most epic moments of this anime.\
My favorite part of this anime was the anime's whole message in a sense of Pathos and Ethos. Emotionally... well fuck you too. If you watch Clannad and cry this anime was a spike ball to the face because after it-- \"Oh I would cry but I lost my tear ducts during SNK.\"\
Logically... It was brilliant. It made every single human I knew, especially myself, feel like an insignificant piece of crap that humantiy could do without. It was amazing-- pretty depressing, but amazing. \
I wouldn't be surprised if this anime single-handedly solved some major world conflict just because. \
What would it be like to live in a world where people had something more important to focus on instead of some petty differences that cause wars these days? ",

    The more i heard about Attack on Titan, the more i wanted to watch it.  Most of my friends praised it for \"how good it was.\" Of course this was on my list, and after i finished \"Shiki\" I knew i couldn't put it off anymore. Did it live up to it's hype? In a word, Yes.\
First off, the animation is spot on gorgeous. From the opening to the end, everything looks beautiful. This is possibly the best animation i've seen yet, the CGI effects work good with the animation and it doesn't stand out as looking out of place. All the character designs\
          \
        are unique and well animated. During action scenes, it doesn't lose quality and each action sequence can look different from the last. The sounds are on point as well...the music goes well with the parts they're put in and the music isn't overused. From the sounds of Titans stomping, to soldiers drawing their swords everything sounds crisp and clean. The show is set in the year 845-850, everything has an old-timy look, while having its own unique aesthetic. While the show is set far in the past the weapons or tools have a semi-modern look to them while keeping their own unique design and not being out of place. Every scene is shot very well, rarely there will be a dull scene. Even scenes containing mainly dialogue are executed very well.\
On to the characters...The cast of this show have amazing and interesting personalities which were showcased very well and not over done. They were all very interesting and entertaining to watch. While the show has a fairly large cast of characters, it doesn't fall into the trap of having too much, some characters do get more screen time than others which is a bit disappointing but that's a small complaint. The main cast of characters; Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are characterized very well and as the story carries on you grow attached to them and the supporting characters as well. Some of the support cast such as Levi are awesome characters, and while they are show stealers they don't totally eclipse the main cast which is good. One group of four characters in particular, i found myself caring deeply about them only after 2-3 episodes of being introduced to them. Like i said before, all their personalities are fleshed out well and they are all unique and interesting characters. Sasha, Reiner and Jean were some of my favorites aside from Levi and Mikasa being the best in my opinion. The show does a good job of showing growth as well, in the beginning i found Armin whiney and rather annoying, but towards the end i actually liked him. Jean started out as an arrogant selfish jerk, and towards the end i liked him as well. In terms of characterization, this show delivered perfectly.\
The story was very good as well, sometimes i will admit i found myself a bit bored more in the beginning. Once the story picked up however, i was much more interested and my desire to watch grew. The show didn't have cliffhanger endings to most of the episodes, but i was still eager to watch which is impressive how the show had that effect on me. The story took quite a few twists and turns, and was written very well with no plot holes and no wasted time on filler like episodes. Flashbacks were only used when necessary, which was seldom. When the anime started, it was a pretty simple premise. As the story progressed, it evolved far past that and became something very unique and interesting, with obvious room for continuation by the end. Certain episodes would focus on specific characters which i liked alot. The story was centralized around Eren mainly and the rest of the army, but certain episodes and parts of episodes would zero in on specific events which was done well and kept me entertained. The ending gave plenty of closure with obvious room for season 2 (which is coming.)\
In all this was an amazing anime, the only cons are things you have to sit down and nitpick. Attack on Titan was a very solid, consistent and unique anime all the way through. It was interesting, entertaining and delivered a good story which evolved past what it was made to look like from the beginning. I enjoyed watching it alot and i'd definitely watch it again. To anyone thinking about giving this a chance i highly recommend it if you like dark fantasy or action genre anime. \

    I don't think I've ever watched an anime that made me say \"what!\" out of disbelief so many times. \
The first time I heard of \"Attack on Titan\" I thought it was about attacking on those Greek figures like Cronus and Gaia, but nope. I was wrong. \
\
Story: \
Wow, the plot isn't cliche! That's a first. The was so much action going on though that I didn't know when up was down and left was right. My mind got a bit jumbled at times to the point where I had to backtrack and made sure I actually saw what was really happening. I do understand\
          \
        this is only the first season and there is a manga, but I didn't really catch the story line. I just found a lot of attacking on titans and titans attacking. Kind of like an introduction, and giving us a rough idea what each titan looks like and acts like, as well as some characterization and development in the characters. But again, this is only the first season. I do expect more plot to come in next time. But there is a thing called too much action, and this wins the prize. I slowly realized at the end that this might just be another Bleach related series.\
I found there was a whole lot of anger. I think every character got angry at one point. There needs to be more...angst, more happiness.  But at least there was emotion though. I did capture it. Did it rub off on me? Yes, and a bit too much I think. \
The symbolism and theme was interesting too. The key...I'm interested in the key Eren has around his neck. I think this is symbolism for protection for Mikasa and of course the land they live in. I love the post-apocalyptic theme and I do hope the author does a back story on how humanity ended up in this place.  There was also a clear theme of love and friendship, family, trust, and determination. \
Art:\
Oh the art. The shininess, the light, the... holy crap the detail! If there is one thing that attracted me to this anime was Eren's eyes. Oh man were they ever beautiful! I don't think I have ever seen an anime show with eyes as detailed at those. I think the only eyes I can think of that comes close is Toothless' eyes in HTTYD. And this isn't even Dreamworks! \
I did find the Titans rather...odd though. I found the anatomy off at times. Even in the humans, I spotted a few heads a bit bigger than they should be. But the Titans, I don't know if it's the manga artist style or the animators, but I did find their bodies strange. \
The colour was amazing though. There was a lot of blood. Oh man...a lot of blood. I can see why this is rated R. And the imax experience was a nice touch! I actually wish I was watching this on a imax screen to get a better experience because wow, I would've been blown away more. Although I have the feelings I would've gotten motion sickness from all the turning in wires those characters did and the camera following them. \
Sound\
I am mighty impressed with the sound/ music in this, yes mighty impressed indeed. The music matched the scenes very well at times and the action sounds were very realistic. I would've like to hear more natural sounds, chirping birds, wind, etc. but the screams, buildings falling and crashing, and other man made noises were really well done. They even got the metal against the wires! the first song of the opening I think I ended up listening to it for three hours straight once. The second opening song was what I imagined the national anthem to be like in their country. \
Character:\
Like I said up top, there was some character development. I don't want to go into detail, but lets just say some shy characters come out of their shell and become really good bad-ass fighters. However, I don't think I'm a fan of Eren. He's a bit stereotypical. He's gone though traumatic moment and wants to get revenge...that's about it. I don't really know what other goals he has yet besides ending the Titans. Mikasa I do like. Like Eren she is a bit stereotypical, the shy girl becoming a total bad-ass and top of her class. Typical heroine. But she's like the male version of Ichigo from Bleach. Armin is like the baby of the family who cries when someone pinches him. I do love the development of this character and gradually becomes a very likeable towards the end.  \
There is a lot of supporting cast. It made my head spin at how many there were. I'm still trying to figure out who is at the top of the military, besides the kind, and what the levels are below it. I did find some supporting characters that were killed off way to fast, and some that should've been killed off from the very beginning. \
Overall, a pretty solid group of characters. I'm excited to see them transform more! \
Enjoyment/Overall:\
This was the type of anime that will keep you at the edge of your seat at times, and will make you walk away at others. There were a lot of \"WTF\" moments and moments where I was just bored out of my mind. There were repetition of fight scenes, fight scenes, fight scenes. The training episodes were pretty interesting, but not as much to make me go OMG! I didn't get into this anime as much as  I would've like to though. I do understand this is very popular because even my friends who don't watch anime are recommending this, meaning it's reaching outside the anime community to people who watch Pretty Little Liars and 90210. Anyways, maybe I'm crazy, who knows. I hope this is just an introduction to the whole thing because I can say, I'm excited to see where it goes.\
 I will recommend this to anyone who enjoys bloody action scenes. It is a fun anime to watch! Who doesn't like blood and action? Overall, I give this anime a 72% on the Titan scale. ",

    Shingeki no Kyojin, or Attack on Titan. Everyone knows this series by now, but I figured I'd use it as my first review's victim.\
Back then when I started watching it, it was because a friend nagged me to no end because it is the best thing ever or something pretty close to that, and eventually I gave in. I wanted to know what the ruckus was about. I picked it up around the time episode 20 or so was being aired.\
As the score suggests, I did enjoy it, quite a bit. There are some reasons why it's not higher, though.\
Story = 7\
The story picks up\
          \
        really fast during the first two episodes, and I still find it quite interesting despite knowing what's going on. It makes very good use of driving questions. I really wanted to know who the hell that huge titan was, and started to formulate all sorts of theories on it before knowing that I was doing it.\
Despite how well it starts, it slows down to a snail's pace for many episodes before interesting things happen again.\
The pacing, however, is terrible. It hurts me to say it because sometimes I want to watch it again but I end up skipping chunks of episodes altogether. It isn't enjoyable on a second run due to how inconsistent the pacing is.\
Even with such a setback, it manages to still be memorable and I highly respect it. I shouldn't forget that the few sad moments it has are very effective. It really knows how to kick your feels and then kick them while they're down.\
Since I don't like spoiling twists, I won't do that, but I'll say that some of the twists are so overdone and cliched that they truly take away from the experience that the other, actually good twists achieve.\
This may just be me, but I felt that the jokes were really forced. Perhaps I've been spoiled by funnier shows, but I rarely did more than snicker at the show's attempts at humor.\
TL;DR: All in all, the story does nothing really new because the whole human against invaders theme has been done to death, but it does it in an original way. The 3D maneuver gear is a brilliant concept all in all.\
Art = 8\
The art style they went with to tell this story at first felt very out of place to me, because in dark stories like this one I tend to expect something more akin to Berserk. Even so, the style grew on me at least to the point where it doesn't bother me anymore. If anything, the animation during some scenes is so beautiful it left me in awe. Other than what I initially thought, it is a quite well achieved visual style, with the line thickness varying and the backgrounds showing (not sure if this was intentional or not) high amounts of red. To me, all the red in the backgrounds really added to the general feel of the show.\
There is a lot of visual language in it, and I had my fun analyzing the tricks that the director used in a few scenes that stuck with me. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'll skip on that.\
TL;DR: Very good drawings and animation. I didn't like the shounen style at first but got used to it.\
Sound = 8\
Just like the visuals are pretty good, the sound that accompanies them is also noteworthy.\
Sometimes the choice of BGM is unbelievably bad (coughepisode6allovercough) but during the most important moments it is impeccable.\
I can't talk too much about the English voice overs because I was instantly turned off by it and decided to skip it altogether, even when I usually prefer watching things in English. The Japanese version, on the other hand, is magnificent. Eren and Armin especially have very good actors. Other than a handful of really stupid choices of BGM, the sound is great. The titan roars are crazy good. A specific titan in the forest of giant trees does a chilling scream that I still go back to rewatch every now and then.\
About the OP and ED... my opinion is very unpopular. I think the first OP is very overrated and the second should be given more of a chance. At least, I liked it more. The EDs are both good in my opinion.\
TL;DR: All around great, save for some funny music that's out of place.\
Character = 5\
This is where I felt disappointed to no end, because some characters had so much potential.\
Eren Jaeger is a complete copy of Edward Elric, and being a very big fan of FMA I really disliked that. I wanted Eren to be his own thing, not some whiny kid that doesn't even compare with Ed. He just wants to be Ed.\
Mikasa reminded me way too much of Lan Fan from that same show and that's also not good at all. She was to Eren as Lan Fan was to Ling Yao. Very very bad thing to do. There's a lot of ways to make characters, but plain making clones is unacceptable to me.\
The rest of them are more debatable. Armin did remind me of Al but I'll let it slide because I liked Armin more than anyone else in the show.\
I should admit that at least the main trio makes stupid mistakes and overall they have weaknesses unlike other shounen heroes.\
Most of these characters felt very underdeveloped. I didn't really learn anything about any of them that I hadn't guessed after taking a glance at them first. Maybe I'm alone in this, but I found Levi boring. Other than his insight on life, such a superhuman-like character really broke the whole atmosphere of dread and hopelessness the show had achieved until he appeared. It really made me wonder why the survey corps don't just send Levi alone on expeditions since he's so goddamn untouchable.\
Other characters like Jean were more interesting but they were nothing memorable either.\
TL;DR: Predictable, one dimensional characters. Incredibly forgettable.\
But hey! At least Eren gets his ass kicked a lot, unlike other shonen heroes!\
Enjoyment = 9\
For a first time, at least, it is something impossible to stop watching. I ended up binge watching it in the middle of a college term. I plain couldn't stop thinking about what the hell was going on. Once you watch all this season, then maybe coming back for some small groups of episodes every now and then is a good idea but rewatching all of the exposition and blabbing sounds unthinkable to me. Either way, the first time around it's great and a lot of fun. After that it's just finding flaw after flaw.\
Overall = 8\
I recommend it to people generally, if they ask me what they should watch and I know they like action. I showed it to my sister and she became a fan really fast. She doesn't watch anime generally and would rather watch sitcoms instead.\
This series became popular so fast it's almost funny, and I can understand why. It uses (admittedly cheap) tactics that get inside a person's head, like themes of humanity against something. That crap works like wonders and that's why it's been done so many times in zombie apocalypse stories.\
I would have gone more in depth but I'd much rather avoid spoiling anything too important.\
Just go watch it. If you like the first two episodes, chances are quite high you'll enjoy the rest. Expect boring ass pacing though. You've been warned.\

    Well.....what can I say about Attack on Titan, or Shingeki no Kyojin if you really must. My personal opinion......I mean.......does one of the best action anime ever created do it justice? Look, in defense of me being a fanboy, i've seen plenty of over hyped anime that haven't held up to there names at all, but AoT, knocks it out of the park and then some.\
Story-9/10\
Attack on Titan's story had a powerful amount of suspense that kept me interested the whole time. The story has one reoccurring theme, does everything look like it's going to work out? Well, give it a second, something will happen\
          \
        to turn everything to shit. This repeats over and over throughout the story, and the show even ends on one of these (don't worry, I won't say what happens). This seems boring, but it really kept me interested in what was going on. The only complaint that I have about the story, which could very well be answered in the next season, what happened to the colossal and armor titans? Are they also humans with titan changing abilities? It seems like the show forgets they exist, especially after the female titan is introduced. \
Art-10/10\
The animation for Attack on Titan is incredibly well done. The use of dark colors really set the mood for the story. The characters are well designed, but let's take a second to talk about the titans designs. I don't think I've ever been so horrified by derp faces before The titans, surprisingly, are some of this shows best work. However, there is one thing I must talk about before we move on, the butter smooth, titan fighting scenes with the 3D movement gear are stunning! I don't know how the animators managed to animate all the objects in the background, while making the character look like he's moving at the speed of light, but damn, that's impressive!\
Sound-10/10\
This soundtrack has 2 things that I really like, heavy orchestrations, and epic choir moments. This shows soundtrack is depressing when it wants to, and upbeat at others. When it comes to the big decision, sub or dub, I don't think it matters, both are fine. The dub is good, but doesn't really stick out, so it's really just up to your preference on that remark. The opening themes and ending themes need no discussion, you've already heard gurren no yumiya more times than you want to admit, they're very catchy and do a good job of getting you hyped.\
Character-8/10\
The show has 3 main characters, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Each character has there own advantages and disadvantages, and all 3 stick with each other throughout the series. The other characters, well, they're kind of bland, they don't have much to them beside little gags here and there. Levi is short and badass, but you don't learn any more about him other than he was part of a gang. I guess it's OK that we don't learn much, because, well, most of them end up dead by the end anyway. That's really my only problem with the characters.\
Enjoyment-10/10\
I loved watching this show, it was an absolute blast to watch. The entire time, I was interested, and I rarely saw myself checking how much time was left on episode. Season 2 couldn't come quicker.\
Overall-9/10\
If you haven't already, go watch this show! You can stream it pretty much everywhere, and it's well worth your time! \

    A very strong Anime that is really good to get you into the genre...\
OST is bae\
Characters are typical shonun but there are clear enjoyable standout characters that are different like Jeanne or Erwin (Who is based of Erwin Rommel)\
Action scenes are great..\
Art Style is unique but weird at the same time..\
Story was pretty good but the ending was mediocre..\
I like how this anime first does everything to make you feel like Humanity stands no chance and then after the Battle of the Trost...The tone is slightly changed to there being hope..\

Before I start my review I need to say that I have not been a big anime fan for long, but I did grow up with Dragon Ball, Pokemon and Digimon. But, even though I havn't watched/liked anime for to long, I still know a good anime when I see one, and Shingeki No Kyojin is not a good anime, it is a great anime.\
Shingeki No Kyojin (Or attack on titan) have the best anime pilot I have ever seen, Eren's mother had about 3 minutes of screentime before she was killed of but still, I cared as if i've seen the show for years,\
          \
        the scene gave me goosebumps and it really had an impact on me. \
The Story is great. Humans are on the extinction because of man eating tyrant monsters that are eating only for enjoyment. I guess Ive always kind of liked the post apocalyptic settings in animes and shows in general (I am a big fan of the walking dead) \
The characters I think is the strongest part of this anime, like I said, Eren's mother's death made me feel quite a bit. Also, the death of marco, a character I didnt know the name of before he died, made me feel quite a bit, only by seeing Jean's reaction It almost made me kinda sad that he died.\
Overall I give this show a 9/10 for its heartfelt friendship between the 104:th cadets and for the gutwrenching titan-eren scenes\

    I'm going to try and be brief, I just finished watching this. And as of right now I'm not entirely sure why it acquired the popularity it has received. Don't misunderstand, on it's own it is a decent series but there are at least a handful of things that make it less than stellar.\
1. The overall atmosphere of the show, at it's best it can be described as very depressing. I can't think of a single episode that was even remotely upbeat. I'm not saying that being bleak is a bad thing for a show but with all of the death and destruction that goes\
          \
        on throughout it's tough not to come out a little sad after each episode.\
2. The characters, while we have our main three in Eren, Armin, and Mikasa the rest of the cast is expendable. Without going into spoiler territory I found it difficult to keep track of characters and their names based on how frequently they died. I merit that to the author wishing to keep the readers, or in this case the viewers, on their toes since we won't know who is next. Kind of poetic when it comes down to it but still annoying when I shouldn't get too invested because they could be dead 2 or 3 episodes after being introduced to them. Aside from that Eren is a difficult lead to get behind, and I know this comparison will tick some people off, he reminds me of Shinji Ikari in some respects. While Eren initially is quite the opposite they both encounter these moments where Eren and Shinji have some sort of moral or ethical dilemma which slows down any momentum the show had. After a while you just tire of Eren's internal monologue because you know by the end of it he reaches the conclusion we knew was going to happen. He staggers too frequently and has to have someone constantly giving him some sort of advice to keep moving forward.\
3. Pacing, the pacing of the show at times is well done and at others feels drawn out. There is about a 4-5 episode arc that should not have taken near as long as it should have other than to feature a \"villain\" and show many many people die in the process. I understand establishing a character but we didn't need that many episodes dedicated to it. Since this relates to pacing in a way I will mention that the ending is abrupt/inconclusive, setting up for the future second season. I'm not familiar with the manga so it's possible the anime caught up close enough they figured they should stop and give the manga-ka enough time to create more chapters. Either case what I assumed would be the end for the season and what turned out to be were two different things entirely. Not that that is a bad thing but rather I felt like it was a stalling tactic for Production I.G.\
After all of my complaints I will mention the positives, the animation style was unique and, as I would expect from Production I.G., well done. The sound didn't catch my attention until I started marathon-ing the series but it was reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's score from Inception which is a good thing from my perspective. And honestly despite my complaints I did enjoy the show and invested in the characters that lasted more than an episode or two. We were left with a tease of what's to come and I plan to continue watching when the next season comes.\

      Gorgeous. This word can fully describe everything what I think of Attack on Titan. Gorgeous plot, gorgeous characters, gorgeous dark fantasy world, gorgeous art style&spec effects, gorgeous music, gorgeous structure of the show, GOD – IT’S ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!! There is no other anime like this, that could be so GORGEOUS IN EVERY WAY! It just doesn’t have any flaws at all! The way WIT studio has shown this anime is so brilliant, unique and groundbreaking that I have no other choice than to say: ”This is an Everest of anime industry”... , and I swear on my soul – it’s true.\
\
         To say that I did not expect something like that from a newbie studio (which WIT really was back than) means not to say anything at all. Their first project… and such a success. That can only be recognized as a work of genius, and in this case genius is a whole studio. Most of all I can praise the producer – Jouji Wada, the director – Tetsurou Araki and the composer – Hiroyuki Sawano.  The magic that appeared on the screen immediately dragging me to the fantasy world; the flawless music consuming me like a black hole and bringing me to new dimension of overflowing joy; the endless feeling of agony, pain and hopelessness but still not surrendering, not backing down and to the very last breath struggling emotion – the enjoyment is indescribable. Everything that our heroes ‘ve been through and each and every emotion they’ve felt –  I felt as well: when they were happily crying seeing each other alive – I was happily crying with them; when they were angry or frustrated – I felt the same; when they where dying on the battlefield or sacrificing themselves to save their sworn brothers – I was dying there as well. The creators ’ve managed to show every single detailed emotion on the faces of main, and secondary characters as well, and ‘ve made you to walk through this path along with them “from the cradle to the grave”.\
  The story line is thought-out, unique and figuratively does imply to our real world in many aspects of life such as social differentiations and human animal nature. Beautifully done job by Isayama Hajime takes you to new horizons of dark horror fantasy and allows you to feel its greatness on your own skin.  The art style is colorful and detailed, and in addition to high level 3d animation and dynamic effects puts some kind of enchantment on you and makes you 5-year old kid that still believes in miracles. \
  Special attention must be paid to the soundtrack. Hiroyuki Sawano has done an unbelievable job by composing an epic music, that makes your blood boil and your heartbeat frequency increase. The openings and endings are also something more than just mind blowing. \
  Characters are versatile and do reveal full spectrum of emotions as you see them suffering, dying, suffocating from the bottomless feelings they go through but still sacrificing their lives to reach the greater goal – TO BE FREE!\
  The degree of pleasure that I received from watching this anime is 150%. Something such incredible in every way, where each of its components suit more than perfectly and draw a picture of unknown beauty can be seen only once in a decade and I am very happy that I did not miss to see it. \
  Rating it 10/10 I call it an impeccable creation of the mastermind and best out of the best from what I’ve seen so far.",

    I'm going to start with the positives of Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan), because I like to give credit where credit is due. Also I am reviewing the subbed version.\
Art: The art style of AoT is probably the strongest point of the anime. One thing it does a good job of is setting the mood, and delivering instant contrasts. Characters can be in a gorgeous, flowery meadow on a bright sunny day in one scene, and be fighting for their lives in a fiery, blood-soaked city in the next scene. The animation is smooth and the character art is sharp. The action scenes are\
          \
        well-done. You can usually always tell what is going on. No ambiguous bullshit.\
Sound: The sound is well-balanced. You will never be listening to a character talk, and then be blasted in the face with music making it impossible to hear what they're saying. The background music is never louder than the characters, nor is it too loud. The sound effects are great too. All of them fit with whatever action is being performed on screen. The music is...okay. It's not bad. Most of it is just forgettable. There are probably about three memorable tracks in AoT, including the intro theme.\
Now it's time for the bad, and unfortunately, these are some of the most important elements to have in an anime...let's start with the-\
Characters: Our three main characters are your typical stock characters. The frontman has a short temper, the girl is always serious and is horny for the frontman, and the third is a whiny nerd. I can generally roll with that, but the secondary characters are even worse. You have your stock badass, stock mad scientist, stock commander, stock asshole who realizes he's an asshole very early on, stock person who eats a lot but miraculously doesn't put on pounds, etc. There wouldn't be anything wrong with this if there was SOME kind of trait that sets them apart, (as most animes tend to do) but you will not find that here. Whatever they are, that's what they are. Nothing about them ever changes. They don't seem to learn anything and frankly, you can't help but feel annoyed when an unimportant character dies and a main character flies into an emotional rage. The audience feels alienated because they never really even knew the character or cared about them. Overall, really boring characters.\
Story: *Sigh* You really can't describe how bad the story to AoT is without spoiling anything. Really I would be doing anyone who hasn't seen this anime a favor by spoiling it, but since I'm a fair person I'll do a spoiler free review of the story: It's a disgusting mess that is so ridiculous and laughable, it almost plays out like a bunch of elementary schoolers trying to LARP. Now what do I mean by that? The story feels improvised, stupid, and meaningless with so much over-the-top action moments thrown in that make the \"everything is hopeless\" personalities seem quite ridiculous. For example, a character will monologue and whine about how hopeless everything is, and then turn around and kill titan after titan, while a character who vows to kill \"ALL THE TITANS!!!\" seems to ignore all the training he went through, and instantly gets killed. Overall, the story is a broken mess that is laughable at best.\
Enjoyment: A turd could have a beautiful aesthetic (art), and make a great splash (sound), but it's still a turd (story, characters). So yeah, enjoyment was almost nonexistent, a two is all it's gonna get.\
Overall: I wouldn't go so far as to say there is no anime more overrated than this one, but it is up there. If you haven't seen this anime and you're thinking about watching it, I will help you decide. If you enjoy intelligent stories, with likable, and unique characters, THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS ANIME!!! If you like bland, angsty animes with well thought out action scenes and really nothing else, then you'd probably enjoy it very much.\
Also, I don't really blame the people behind the anime. It is based off the manga, so to be fair, I blame Hajime Isayama.\

    \" People, who can't throw something important away, can never hope to change anything\" - Hajime Isayama\
'Epic', the word which best describes this anime. Joyful to hear the next season is coming out soon since the first season seemed more of an introductory.\
The best thing about this anime is the fast-paced action, unlike some of the typical shounen animes where there is more of \" I am gonna protect my friends\" and battles which cover 100+ episodes.\
Adding to this the protagonist seemed very different to me and less stereotypical. He just wanted to kick the titans' butt for the sole purpose of expanding his world,\
          \
        to be able to walk freely outside those walls. This is hardly the case in your mainstream shonen anime, where there is some sort of main goal but the battles usually take place because you mess up with the protagonist's 'friend' (who is more of an acquaintance from 3 days ago in certain *ahem* shonen animes).\
AOT however did have some flaws as well. The character development of the many important characters was below average or just average enough. What's really important in these kind of shows, where death is always lurking by, is the development of the characters. Without revealing the names to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, when most of the characters died, I didn't feel emotions swell up in me. Maybe it was because there wasn't enough time for development due to the amount of fighting this show has. Hopefully the second season gives us some more of the development part.\

    So Attack on Titan... many people have recommended me this and I saw how popular it is and how everybody just loved it. When I kept hearing about this, I thought to myself, \"Maybe it really is as good as people say.\" Well it definitely is as popular as people say BUT, it is absolutely not as good as people say. Yeah, saying that it is over-hyped is kinda lame, but this anime is definitely over-hyped and not as good as some may say along with others (Tokyo Ghoul, SAO, Deadman Wonderland, Akame Ga Kill). Although I've never touched the Shingeki no Kyojin manga (and\
          \
        I possibly won't touch it) I could say that this series definitely had a lot of potential. Giant human-eating Titans is definitely a cliche since who knows how long but that does get people's attention and I'm pretty sure people have had dreams of giants chasing them. This is another reason why people would probably like it, they have fears of giants and they just get hooked, or they just like bad anime or gore. I respect those who like bad anime, and those who like AoT. The thing that is cringe-worthy however, is the fact that people believe this is the best anime that has ever been created, it being ranked #3 in ranker.com for \"The Best Anime Series Ever Created\" with Death Note being at #1 and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood at #2. This anime is definitely not best ever made, it is one of the most mediocre ever made. I would definitely listen more to the criticism about this anime other than the good things because there not many good things as there are bad about this show.\
There is no plot to begin with. I'm not gonna say much but in a nut-shell, *SPOILERS* They get attacked by titans > people die > one guy is a titan-human > they go attack titans > people die > there is another titan-human > people die > titan-human fight! > one turns into crystal > the end\
There is absolutely no plot development and people even say that this season was for just exposure for the characters and to give a back bone to the titans, the thing is, there is absolutely no character development other than one character: Mikasa. \
This brings me to the characters. I really dislike main characters that are crying about everything all of the time (Tokyo Ghoul). Eren is a really bad character that just relies on his emotions so his fear and depression always gets in his way from him achieving anything. He is a very stupid and very weak character that relies on every other person around him to do stuff. Mikasa, the one character that appeals to every guy, is the only character with little development but even so, she is just a character focused on guys too like. I don't know why she has a crush on Eren because he is stupid and useless overall. She is another character that relies on her emotions too much as well. Levi... oh Levi... where do I start? Well, this is basically Mikasa but without emotions. Levi is another character that is focused to appeal for a gender, usually females. These two character are basically just there for fan-service and nothing else, especially with all of the fan-yaoi of Levi. Sure they make Mikasa and Levi look strong but like I said, they have little character development, which Levi has a separate OVA instead of being a apart of the season and is also labeled as a \"shoujo\" genre, but they are purely there for the fan-service. Every other character is as flat as their cardboard art style.\
Now for the art, I can't really judge on the art-style for it is the creator's decision and likes as to how they stylize it so I'm just going to give my bias on it. The background art is simply amazing, the setting in a European country is awesome and I really like it but the characters... they look like they were literally photoshopped into the pictures. At first I liked it because it was unique, and I still think it's a really good unique look, it just doesn't fit this anime. The animation was ok, not too bad but also not amazing like other anime. I'm sure many of you have your own opinion but this is mine, I respect yours and you respect mine.\
The music is good overall, especially the first opening theme, \"Guren no Yumiya\". It's a great song but sadly it's like the only thing that is a 10/10 in this anime. I also like the ending song but the second OP and ED aren't as what you would think from this, the second OP fits but I'd rather them have kept it to the first OP. Now the sound effects, folly, and other things as such are pretty well put in in this anime, no complains there.\
Dub vs Sub? I watched all of it in Dub but I also seen the sub but not all of it. I preferred the sub, but that's totally up to you, it being a very subjective topic. In my opinion though, the english dub sounded like chickens fighting in a cage. Eren was a very terribly made character with that voice and the others sounded either like they were emo or like an old man yelling at \"those meddling kids!\"\
Overall, this anime was very interesting when I watched it but the more I watched, the more I realized how flawed and poorly made this was. This was a mediocre anime and there WAY more anime out there that can put this to shame, sadly not many people will think the same or even be willing to open their minds and watch better anime. at best, I'll say this anime had so much potential and does keep you a bit interested into seeing what will happen next (although everything that happened was predictable and you can see through all the plot twists like glass). This anime gave me question after question, being answered by ten more questions and many plot holes...MANY plot holes. I am sad to say that this anime is bad because they really could've made this great, 'many' people just like it because they haven't seen a better anime. I would only recommend this anime to people who actually enjoy mediocre horror shows or gore, but even still there are way better gore and horror anime out there. I give this anime an overall 4/10. Disappointing but it's fun to talk about how bad it is. I really do recommend that you skip this and watch another better anime like Gurren Lagann, FMA or Death Note or something.\

    Attack On Titan, you might have heard that name once or twice in your life. In your head, you're probably thinking, oh geez.. another lame gory anime. To others, that's the case. But personally for me, it's the other way around. I loved every minute of it. The story and everything else were well-balanced. No fanservice (sorry to you pervs out there). No ecchi. Just pure awesomeness. There is indeed a reason for its popularity. But since all animes aren't perfect, I'll admit AOT has some flaws. But overall I give it a 10. Because so far, this is the first (and best) action anime\

        series I've ever seen. \

    AoT is such a good anime, I wished I watched it before. Before watching it, I insulted the series because I was annoyed by how everyone around me were sprouting green hoodies with wings in their back: \"Ugh, it's that anime again.\" It could also affect your opinion of the anime if someone you dislikes likes/loves the anime. \
Trust me, that's not what's important!\
I was browsing through One Piece's Trafalgar Law's voice actor wiki page randomly and I saw how he voiced Levi. \
I decided to give the anime a try, since I loved the voice actor's voice so much although the overall plot of\
          \
        the story seemed to \"weird\" for me; giant Titans eating humans who are protected by a long wall. \
I love the characters, and it's amazing how the anime can balance reality and fantasy scales. In mannnnnny anime, warrior girls often have extremely long, pretty-ed up hair which I find absurd. Like, how are you going to fight in battle? Of course, it's anime, their hair magically doesn't get cut off or pulled out by the enemy. Mikasa, on the other hand, starts out with only medium hair, yet Eren points out that it's too long and she should cut it because it would get in the way of battles. The other female characters would tie their hair up if it was long. Finally, something that is realistic. \
I am a sucker for non-romance anime, and I love how there is practically none in this series. Eren and Mikasa have a brother-sister bond, and it's no more than that other than weird fans that insists there is something who are hungry for romance. If you like romance anime, then watch an anime of that series, not this amazing anime. \
The protagonist, Eren Yeager, is my favorite character. He has strong morals, an unwavering determination, although innately he has no talents. \
This anime has all 10/10 marks, but the only thing that I'm not happy about is how short the military academy part was. I think it would be more enjoyable to see more academy stories during the timeskip instead of just skipping ahead. This would make the audience more settled with the characters and connect with them more on a deeper level. \

    Where do I begin with Attack on Titan? It's become one of my all time favourite anime series as it's exciting, thought provoking and takes you on a highly emotional rollercoaster ride with the frequent twists and turns in the story. \
Right from the start I was blown away by the absolutely stunning animation - Wit Studio really did the world of Attack on Titan justice, as well as the character designs. I was truly captivated by even the tiniest details, from the colourful flowers and blades of grass to the spectacular views of the cities and landscapes. I was so impressed with the quality\
          \
        and effort put into the series that I purchased all five animation books online.\
When you see the series for the first time, there's no way to predict what's going to happen next. Absolutely no character is guaranteed safety - there are plenty of situations when everything is fine one minute before suddenly taking a disastrous turn for the worse. There's never a dull moment, with many surprises along the way and more than enough questions that arise to keep viewers in suspense. \
I couldn't find any faults with the soundtrack, as every song and instrumental piece does a brilliant job in creating the perfect mood for every scene. For example, the first opening theme by Linked Horizon is super catchy and gets your adrenaline going for the thrilling events that are about to unfold. In contrast, the ending theme is much more chilled and a  pretty sight for the eyes. I like to think that the ending theme provides viewers with the opportunity to relax and come to terms with anything that's happened beforehand. \
In terms of voice acting, I personally prefer Japanese with English subtitles, as the cast features so many talented voice overs that are a genuine pleasure to listen to. Yuki Kaji and Marina Inoue are among my favourites; they both did a fantastic job with playing the roles of Eren and Armin respectively. I thoroughly enjoyed the English dub for Attack on Titan, however the only problem I have is that the screams- both Titan and human- can be very screechy in comparison to the Japanese audio, hence why I scored a 9 out of 10 for the sound.\
I would say that Attack on Titan is an absolute must see for any anime fan - it's popular for all the right reasons. It's so easy to find yourself caring for the characters and rooting for them in their ongoing battle against the Titans. I can't say that there are any characters that I dislike, as the majority are well developed, very easy to relate to, and have intriguing backgrounds to boot. If you haven't seen the anime yet, get to it - you're in for a real treat.",

This is anime is wicked!!!...KUDOS to the makers and author/s, to everyone involved with SnK.\
A heart pounding anime with a very unique plot, story, and characters. You will really keep on guessing on what will happen next and your excitement builds up after every episode. \
What's so great about this anime is that, every character is important, whether they're the main or the supporting\
          \
        cast, no character was pushed aside for the other character to shine. The female characters were tough, they showed strength during attacks,  and the will to fight for their lives (unlike other animes wherein the women are weak, batting their eyelashes in fear)\
The opening theme, Guren no Yumiya was the perfect song for the anime.\
The art was superb, it wasn't over nor under rated.\
This was the only anime that made me feel nervous and excited at the same time. I hope they pick it up again for a sequel\

    I read this manga more than an year ago when it was one of the top selling mangas in the Japan and instantly liked it . I would not expose any spoilers here but All I can say is This anime has performed very well on the manga till the present episode . \
Pros : \
+ Stays true to the manga\
+ Strong Plot \
+ Plot execution done very welll ( if you dunno , read the manga and read the prediction on mangafox,will definitely surprise you ) \
+ Detailed world \
+ Beautiful Art \
+ Good Animation \
+ Original world \
+ Likable Character \
+ Strong Plot\
          \
        Twists\
+ Amazing OST \
+ Good suspense and gore \
+ Good characters and development\
Cons : \
+ Females a lil too sexy ( compared to the manga , seems like fanservice )\
+ Shounen - like cliche sometimes ( you will know ) \
+ Manga thrilled me more ( personally seemed more darker ) \
+ Stretching some mysteries too long \
+ Don't see how 25 episodes will cover this in a way \
+ Some aspects might disappoint people ( eg superpowers ) \
\
Story : \
An original  story , much better than the typical zombie fest and i must say much more scary as well ( manga ) , The anime seems more action packed but the thing i liked most is how true the anime stays till now to the manga , It's flowing exactly like the manga which certainly makes this anime very good . \
Many animes loose their shine when they diverge from the original story line but i fail to understand how much or what they will or can do in just 25 episodes . \
Art : \
Aside from the overly beautiful females which seem like more of a fanservice aspect , I think the anime are far outclasses the manga , the only thing is ,I would certainly have liked an ever more darker appeal in the art which just like the way reading the manga felt . \
As an example Misaka looked so ordinary in the manga , compared to the other girl , Misaka is ordinary , I was really surprised at how beautiful she suddenly looked in the anime . \
Other than this simple fact, The art is really really well done and having read the manga first ,I loved the art, the action , the opening and the ending as well \
Sound : \
The Art and sound department are the strongest aspect of this anime, the ost really bring life into each scene, whether it's the death of an important character , a family , or a sad scene but so far , the sound department has been great and this is one of the reason I give this anime 10/10 . \
I have liked mos of the OST's so far even if i felt some one english or some other ost a little out of place and another one perhaps repeated at a wrong time . Overall the soundtrack has been very good ,perhaps not as good as Yuki Kajimura , but still amazing . \
Characters : \
This series some really lovable character, the main character and for once we have a great female lead unlike many other shows we have seen , We have a protagonist who cannot do everything by himself , we have side characters who actually matter .\
We are presented with a wide array of character , some of them being the frontal ones , both the personality and designs have been unique . Although there hasn't too much character development till now ( and i talk about the manga ) , I still think they maintain their characters quite well . \
\
This Series is enjoyable and addicting , The writer has managed to keep the suspense alive and the series interesting , The plot is the only thing that carried this series forward so well. I would not say this is the best series , there are better but i thing they made a great anime version for the manga .\
It's definitely a must watch and perhaps the best anime till now for the year . \
Overall 9.5/10 , Watch it , won't disappoint you .\

    It's been a long time since I've been really excited about an anime... and to be honest I didn't have particularly high hopes for this one, either.\
I know the first season has only begun airing (currently the 9th episode came out today, which I haven't seen yet because it needs subbing and I don't speak Japanese), but I seriously could not be more excited about this anime. So this review is going to be based on what I've seen so far... hopefully it continues to be absolutely freaking epic.\
My entire experience with Shingeki no Kyojin can be summed up with my reaction to the first\
          \
        episode: I cried. I wept like a little girl. I would like to clarify that never in my life have I cried on the first episode before, and if you're not hooked by the end of the first episode, maybe this isn't for you. I felt the reactions of the characters to the horror occurring around them was very heart-wrenching and believable, and it effected me very strongly. I've seen the first episode 4 times, and 3 out of the 4 I still cried. This is a good thing in my opinion. It has a wonderful combination of action, horror, and drama.\
And you know what else is awesome? The amazing doesn't end with the first episode. It just keeps going! I love how they've thrown some comedy into the mix, as well - such as Sasha. Who wouldn't love Sasha? Coming from a female perspective, I really appreciate a complete lack of panty shots, too. What? The women are FULLY CLOTHED in this anime? That's right! And they totally kick butt! Sorry if you were expecting something else. This show is many things, but hentai is not one of them.\
Love the music. Sometimes I don't even notice it in parts, until I watch an episode over again (yes, it's that good), and then I suddenly realize how much it contributes to the quality of the scene. \
Finally, because Shingeki no Kyojin is something you have to try out yourself and no amount of praise I give it or how well I describe its quality will really make a difference for you, I want my last point to be about predictability. This is important:\
THERE IS NONE. Holy crap, I never know what is going to happen next. For a week I was screaming, \"MAIN CHARACTER. HE'S THE MAIN CHARACTER! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!\"\
Bottom line: Man eating giants. Cried on first episode. Epic ever since. The most interesting show I've seen (anime or not) in years.\
Seriously, just watch it. \

    Shingki No Kyojin- better known as Attack on Titans has registered as one of those rare animes that created an incomparable hype just within the release of 3 to 4 episodes. The art was magnificent and title was intriguing enough to make most people watch it off the bat. I took my time in watching it. Before going onto the main review I would like to say that an anime should be judged on the basis of what we have rather than of what it would turn into. You will understand what I mean later in the review.\
Story:\
The story in the most basic sense is\
          \
        typical - three friends living in a town ruled by a Monarch within fortified walls, witness one of the walls breached by huge beings of flesh - Titans, that are driven by the only force to annihilate humans. The protagonist - Eren, out of anger and revenge, swears to destroy the titans while his close friends - the typical sane and considerate girl and wimpy boy, are alongside him. He meets people and secrets are unveiled... no need to go into additional details.\
Now the story in essence was typical - the Titans and their purpose was new but the need for revenge, hidden power that makes the protagonist stand out and then people appearing who share that power... while not that common, it was still not the most unique idea. AND even if it was unique - it was expected. There were no major plot twists for me. I knew who the two major Titans were (trying my best not to give point blank spoilers) and... well there is little else to the anime.\
The season ending reminds me of Accel World, Highschool of the Dead, Deadman Wonderland... all of which ended with the first season and left me disappointed. Here too, we don't have to consider if it has the potential to be amazing or perhaps how good the manga is. We need to consider the episodes we have and the ending... it was just blank. I will probably alter this review if the next season is to be released but till then, the story ended with little revelation, little advancement in the plot and furthermore - little satisfaction with Annie being captured.\
The way how Annie's crying/flashbacks hint us a purpose yet the protagonist keeps beating her out of revenge... anger making him blind... we have seen it too many times. Nothing special for me. And that is where the story actually ends. Disappointment.\
Art/Sound:\
There is no debate over the art. It was very engaging and interesting. I liked the character features - they were unique and believable without resorting to bizarre features as many animes resort to this to make their char's seem unique. The color tone complimented the era shown - the dull colors, the costumes and the gears. The environment and buildings and the physics that applied to them in the destructive scenes was also surprisingly well handled.\
The scenes involving the 3D Maneuver were impressive - the fluidity in motion and the coordination of the bodies with the gear, and the jerks and shifts they made, it almost made the gear look like a tool used in real life. Quite amazing.\
Another thing that I personally liked was how sick they showed the titans at times. Expressionless faces with strange body proportions running in awkward jerking style. It did make the monsters hideous and disturbing. Although the female titan seemed... awkward to say the least, I will ignore her. There were also slight moments when nose shapes and facial features would somehow... 'change' and I would wonder if there was too much of a problem with that face :/\
Coming to sound, the art sequences were well complimented with the soundtracks, and emotions and moods were noticeable. The sounds regarding slashes and the 3D gear was also well chosen - it gave quite a nice feel while watching the anime and of course, details like horse hooves and carraiges moving also enhanced the effect. The screeches of the Titans were again disturbing and well managed but I did have a problem with the roar of the female titan - I guess I have a problem with her in general.\
Characters:\
The characters were well managed in my opinion, though stereotypical in a sense. The main trio was extremely typical with the main protagonist driven by revenge and not having any skills... just raw sense of revenge. The rest of the char's almost felt as if one wrote down the common personalities in animes and then reproduced them - the jealous one with the brain who has a hidden sense of justice, the wimpy one with agility but little strength (can run away quickly), the serious female with extreme skills, the serious dude also with a lot of skills... the mad scientist even!\
Furthermore, they lacked their own definition of abilities - the anime had to define their abilities, rather than the viewer able to determine it. And even then other than a few char's the others were unable to meet up to the reputation they had.\
Having said all that, there WERE some good characters as well - Mikasa, though typical was balanced rather than a psycho like Yuno from Mirrai Nikki. Levi was balanced as well, not the cold hearted commander that listened to no one and only looked down on others (and the voice acting by Kamia Hiroshi also made him a likable personality for me :D ). FURTHERMORE, in an anime of such standing, some of the typical char's were supposed to be there so... to say the least, they could have worked more on the chars to make them better but they are still not pathetic... other than the idiotic protagonist to be honest who everyone relies on and... I am going to move on.\
Enjoyment:\
Now this is a controversial point. While the anime delivered some awesome scenes, art, fighting sequences, for me there were no plot twists - a rather disappointing ending and a pathetic protagonist. Meaning, most of the anime, I was hoping for the protagonist to die, there to be some twist, and hoping for a better conclusion. This means that by the end of the anime... I wasn't really satisfied.\
YET an anime has to be given merit and so it shall. My rating is slightly biased on the hopes that another season will air, however late and will pick up the story from here. Thus the over all rating is nothing above a solid 7. If I could have given 7.5 then I would have bu not more than that.\
For many people, I would again say that an anime has to be approached not from its potential or manga, but from what we are provided with. \
Thank you for reading! Feedback is much appreciated!\

    I've seen some great series, and some not so great series, but never before have I seen something capture my attention and completely enthrall me like Shingeki no Kyojin does. I feel as if the authors snuck into my bedroom while I was sleeping and probed my brain, thoroughly studied every last aspect of my personality to gain an understanding far deeper than my own, and then meticulously crafted an anime that completely fills and satisfies every one of my tastes to perfection. Not once do I ever find myself thinking \"they could have made this part shorter\", \"they should have done this differently', or\
          \
        anything of the sort. Watching Shingeki no Kyojin doesn't simply entertain me... When I watch Shingeki no Kyojin my mind starts racing, and it makes me feel ALIVE.\
Realism isn't generally something that comes to mind when you think of a story about giant human eaters and a brigade of spidermen who fight them, but Shingeki no Kyojin proves that even in the most outlandish of stories realism can still run strong. The world of Shingeki no Kyojin is skillfully crafted, and even obscure and minor details such as the inner workings of a mechanism or how something is manufactured were not overlooked. Gas runs out, swords break, cannons miss, hooks fail to anchor, equipment malfunctions. Indeed, perhaps the greatest thing about Shingeki no Kyojin is the gripping realism. Social interactions, dissension, civil unrest, fear and panic, gray morals, injustice, stress. All of these things are nearly omnipresent, but it isn't enough to merely list it out and say \"these are in it\", because it has all been done before. However, I have never before seen a portrayal of human nature as convincing and accurate as this, it's really something you have to see for yourself to understand. This combined with the extremely strong sense of danger makes the characters feel real, almost tangible. Death is a very real possibility for any character, regardless of how good of a fighter they are, and regardless of how important they seem to be. There are no easy victories and nothing ever goes exactly according to plan. In other series, characters wind up in dangerous situations and they might seem scared, but somewhere in the back of your mind you just know that everything is going to be OK in the end, and when a character is going to die it is usually somewhat foreshadowed and predictable so it doesn't usually come as a surprise. In Shingeki no Kyojin, any situation can take a turn for the worse and you legitimately never know if a character is going to make it through alive. The characters themselves are no different, and their feelings of dread, the look of complete terror on their faces when things go wrong and they stare death in the face, it makes their fear feel real and immerses you into their world. The characters are all unique and have a sense of individuality, but there are no overwhelming attention-grabbing personalities, which once again makes the characters feel more realistic and in turn immerses you even further.\
I find it extremely difficult to recognize any critical flaws in Shingeki no Kyojin. The biggest problem people seem to have is the pacing, but honestly I believe the pacing is perfect as-is. They could even things out and spend an equal amount of time on everything just for the sake of uniformity, but it would not make this anime any more interesting. Instead, they focus on the parts that are interesting (such as titan battles), and speed through much of the potentially boring parts (such as the training camp). This is not a failure, but a grandiose and spectacular success.\
If all you're here for is a quick fix of action scenes, you're not going to be disappointed, but you need to truly appreciate all of the finer details to get the most out of this series. Shingeki no Kyojin is masterful. You're doing yourself a disfavor by not watching it.\

    The first time I saw the synopsis for Shingeki no kyojin, I was not impressed. In fact I thought it would be a complete waste of time to begin watching it. Well. A few weeks after reading the synopsis I found the first opening of the series on the most played beatmaps of Osu! I thought: The opening can't be too horrible if it made into this list. So I downloaded it, played it and based on the feelings I got from listening to the opening, I began watching it. I wasn't disappointed. Right from the first episode I was completely sucked into the cruel\
          \
        world of SnK. One of the main reasons to why I began watching it was the end of the first episode. That's exactly the kind of strong episode to start a series. What I learned while watching SnK is: Never trust that your favourite character will make it to the end of the episode. The story, art, music and characters are all great. Especially the music. One of the best OST's I've ever heard. I really enjoyed the series, and it seems that I'm not the only one, seeing as the anime has ranked 14th on the best animes list on MLA. I really recommend watching it. Overall I would give the series a score of 10/10\
I beg of you, please don't overlook this series because it's a bit overhyped. It's actually a really great experience.\

Overall, i think reading the LOWER RATED REVIEWS for this anime is kinda bias. Of course all reviews are BIAS, but it all depends on the taste and preference of anime/manga. Because many of the \"BAD\" REVIEWS are from people who are too picky, they pick out too many details that they think would annoy them such as the ART--MAJOR PREFERENCE that MAY BOTHER PEOPLE, and STORY-ALSO ANOTHER PREFERENCE one should consider. And CHARACTER- is what SHAPES THE STORY. AND being TOO SMART and thinking to much of WHAT CAN HAPPEN can ALWAYS ruin the FUN in everything.. why don't you \"SMART PEOPLE\" just dive\
          \
        in for some \"CLICHED FUN?!\" sometimes.. you just gotta LIVE A LITTLE.. and sit back and enjoy the ANIME/MANGA as a WHOLE.. and of course.. you're gonna NEED EPIC BACKGROUND MUSIC if you read the MANGA.. ;) \
I honestly would say bias-ly that Shinegeki no Kyojin is pretty good, it may have cliches with the MAIN CHARACTER comparing it to OLDER ANIME's/MANGA's but what is there to not enjoy when it's put in a TOTALLY different STORY! I guess the thing that puts me on my toes for this ANIME/MANGA is because of it's ORIGINALITY with crushing HOPES till you think there is no more HOPE and then BAMMM a little miracle happens and it keeps that engine of FAITH going.. and the fact that there are SO MANY CHARACTERS they introduce to the AUDIENCE  they also get their own little time to bond with the other characters and it gives the audience a taste of how a lot of the characters have their own personal bonds to add on to the others, kinda COMPLETING the GROUP of FRIENDS until after the results of ****SPOILIER ALERT***blah blah blah..***********is saddening, but it's interesting, because ALOT OF FILMS/STORIES, there usually is ALWAYS A MIRACLE to stop the BRUTALITY that comes from the SLAUGHTERING of FRIENDS, but NOT IN A.O.T. it keeps going.. it's DIFFERENT.  But the HOPES comes from the REMAINING survivors and THEIR PURPOSE TO FIGHT! And the rush of time lapse is understandable, because the story is VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD, with not many FILLERS, and I personally LOVE IT FOR THAT. That way you don't have to keep wondering \"Where the HECK did the story go?!\" kinda thing. \
The Art itself is interesting, not the kind of animation I'd be interested but it brings out it's ORIGINALITY. Even though MIKASA may be the most UNREALISTIC, ANIMATION ITSELF IS UNREALISTIC.. ((~DURRHH to people who think she's too unrealistic)) The style of animation the artist has is not common, it's a mix of Idealized features **those beautiful anime EYES and realistic features such as the \"average-looking\" kind of anime characters there are in the anime/manga. Not everyone can look IDEALIZED. As for the DARK OUT-LININGS around the characters at times do strike me oddly, because it does get a bit annoying, yet it defines each character of the scene more, EMPHASIZING who's talking or just emphasizing the characters over all. \
The Music is pretty awesome! Even though it has ENGRISH SONGS in there, I can understand why it's annoying to other because out of no where the song literally talks about standing STRONG TOGETHER, so? What's the problem with that song if it's trying to communicate to the Audience that that's the will power of the SCENE?! MUSIC has a STRONG influence on putting an impact on how the Audiences watches the story/scene. So the communication of the songs are pretty good in MY OPINION. The first opening scene music caught my attention because it went well with the anime very well, because usually I'd skip the opening scene of EVERY EPISODES because sometimes I find them annoying. But oddly not in A.O.T. \
As for the character development, again like I said earlier, Erin is in some way cliched because of his MAIN role of being the MAIN character, What OTHER WAY CAN YOU THINK OF, TO MAKE IT EVEN BETTER!? :P so for THOSE WHO THINKS IT just makes the STORY TOO PREDICTABLE, how WOULD YOU COME UP WITH A MAIN CHARACTER that would make the story BETTER? I honestly would say he reminds me of Naruto, because his words tend to persuade a lot of people in the story, the POWER OF WORDS is COMMON in the REAL WORLD ANYWAY, and what OTHER ways can you persuade others anyway? Something we can all relate to in REALITY is the THE POWER OR WORDS IS STRONG, if it's coming FROM A person who RIGHTEOUSLY use THEM FOR A \"GOOD\" purpose. BECAUSE in our REAL WORLD, that's the kind of HERO we're all rooting for to stop the CRUEL WORLD.. **ANIME MOMENT!** ESPECIALLY when they can prove it through their ACTIONS AFTERWARDS.. \"Don't talk the talk when you can't walk the talk\" ~cliche.. yes i know.. yes i know..( -____- )\
As for Mikasa, she's beautiful in the anime/manga, of course, in anime/manga there always have to be that one girl who looks the MOST BEAUTIFUL! Her character is pretty strange from my view, because not a lot of ANIME CHICKS in stories like this is KNOWN to be the \"STRONGEST\" other than, the weak and frail girls who always need RESCUING.. but instead, it's HER who RESCUES ERIN. Her character overall is pretty DIFFERENT! And then there goes Armin, he's a weak guy, and yet he has a strong will power, which is kinda cliched, but he is pretty smart! so that's a PLUS PLUS for his character, HE'S NOT USELESSS!  **fist up in da air!** \
\
I lOVED THIS ANIME/MANGA so much, i couldn't wait for the REST OF THE ANIME TO BE OUT.. It kept me on my TOES even though i HATED THE GORE of the TITANS EATING THE HUMANS but i BEGAN the MANGA online all the way to the LATESt CHAPTER, of course while reading i had EPIC MUSIC ON which added ON EVEN MORE TO THE MANGA, and like i said before, the CHOICE OF MUSIC it had for the anime was already pretty good it just adds on more for the MOOD. I can't wait for the new chapters to come out, but I guess i'll have to wait for a good YEAR for them to get to Chapter 100! and maybe TWO YEARS to see if the ANIME will FOLLOW the MANGA… \

    This is an interesting anime that have some of the best animations ever (3d maneuver gear). The main characters are Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert. The reason why there are only 3 is because everyone else is pretty much dead meat. Wit Studio and Production l.G made Attack on Titan and did a very good job. The main story line to not give any spoilers is the main character Eren wishes to kill all titans. The show is done by director Tetsurō Araki which is one of my favorite directors, because he has made Gungrave, Death Note, and Guilty Crown. The music from\
          \
        this show was outstanding to me and really gave this show it needed to be one of the best shows i've seen. lt was done by Hiroyuki Sawano and he yet again done some of my favorite shows. He knows what to give for that extra boost that the anime might need. Now making this will gives me hope this could be a super great show, but until they make a second season this won't be a \"prefect show\". They still need an ending and without it feels like they will be felt a disappointment to me. All shows need an ending no matter how bad or good to get a sense of completion and yet this show yet again leaves on a cliff hanger. With everything said i'll give this show an 8.5 out of 10 for now. \
\
                                                               Spoiler Alert!\
\
Now some time for spoiler part for the people who have watched it. As the shows progress Eren given this for who knows why, but to find the answer is the basement of his house. Also, what ever happened to his dad? lt feels like he new what was coming and didn't say. That's my personal opinion, but he could've just been lucky who knows. Eren is devoted to learn how to control this power such as Annie and what i think the 50 meter titan and amour titan are has done. l have wondered if the titans came from the south and did someone make them? Now to Mikasa who is good at everything and yet to me is her \"flaw\". Besides that shes a kick ass titan killer how l think killed a few titans despite being only a newbie and never really facing one before. On that note l wondered how humanity knows how to even kill them, because they seem so dam powerful. Armin seems to be very hopeless to me in the very beginning, but finds out that he can use his brain to get out of sticky situations, such as being trapped in the house with all the titans and only have guns and swords. However being the smart person he is he finds a solution to the problem almost like what happened with Annie, but he took more of a gamble on that one in my opinion. Time for personal enjoyment and l really enjoyed it after hearing about this and l marathon the whole show in 3 or 4 days which l was never disappointed with ever always leaving on a cliff hanger besides 2 or 3 episodes. Great pace have nothing to say here really. Music done well as said before. Only real complaining on this is how its only 1 season. Besides that this show has been given a 8.5 out of 10.\

    Possibly the best anime show of this era...no...of all time. This anime has It all! It will have you in tears time after time again. Sad tears and happy tears are going to be shed. Perfect graphics and animation. Absolutely spotless art! You don't even have to know the characters that well and you'll already feel attached to them. The music was splendid and overall I just loved Attack On Titan and I can't wait for the ending! If you're having second thoughts about not starting this show you better chew up and spit out those thoughts because you won't regret watching this anime! And,\

    Attack on Titan, an anime that looks like it would be interesting and revisit the older days of anime, but instead had wrecked itself up too much to even enjoy and take seriously. \
Story\
The overall plot to it was not very original overall.  It was mediocre for the first part, then quickly got driven into a very poorly executed story and tried to make excuses to build itself back up, only to stay and even worsen it.  \
I was hoping for a humans vs. monsters thing exclusively, but instead the plot-twist where Eren is a titan screwed that up very well, and frankly\
          \
        I found very very poorly done.  The story drags on too much as well, with long-talks of characters, slow-moving episodes, just anything you'd see in an average Shonen anime.  I felt it did try to be something other than a typical Shonen, sadly it tried too hard and became what it was put out not to be. \
Of course there were also unrealistic aspects to where I could not take serious, such as Eren killing 3 full-grown men as a child who isn't even a child of war who someone like Guts from Berserk was at least. \
Art\
The art has some nice effort put into it.  The double-shading and double-tinting was something I liked and gave a good old-anime feel, but it still has a dreadful new-anime look to it.  \
The use of thick outline was just one of the poorest choices I've seen the art in an anime do.  What was the point?  From far away, the characters looks plastered and painted-over with it.  Not only that, just seeing character from far away, or somewhat close is pretty hilarious, of course this is seen in almost every TV anime.  Still, the art is nothing to brag about, I didn't like it too much overall.  \
Sound\
The OST to it was one of the better aspects to it.  There wasn't a whole lot of interesting music to it, but there were a couple which founded pretty nice.  But overall, nothing special in this anime.  It failed to impress me as well.  \
Character\
Along with the story, the characters are one of the weakest aspects to it.  The characters are thin as cardboard, and have simple goals that seem to blind them from anything else.  I feel what they do is unrealistic, such as Eren killing 3 full-grown men, then somehow attaching the knife in 0.5 seconds to a broom.  \
My memory doesn't serve me so well into the details of characters, but they were very annoying to me for the most part.  Even more annoying the Gantz characters who at least had a sense of realism to them by having visible good and bad aspects to them.  Attack On Titan does not, just bland, unmemorable characters I barely even remember.  \
Enjoyment\
Being over-hyped, and definitely overrated, I'm going against the majority in saying how much I didn't enjoy all 19 episodes i've watched of this.  Very little was enjoyable and impressed me.  Even the gore wasn't entertaining for me, everything was executed so awful in almost every way I detested.  \
Overall\
Attack On Titan turns out to be one of the worst anime I've ever seen.  I may seem like I'm exaggerating, but for the most part, I am not.  I felt 19 episodes wasted me time to where I could have watched some 90's or 80's trashy-but-fun anime like M.D. Geist.  \
This anime is a perfect example on how anime should not be done, by my opinion but also factually with development on story and characters.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan for those who prefer the english name is one of those anime that manages to leave two very opposite opinions among the anime community. One such opinion is that many people call this a masterpiece the likes of which have not been seen in a while, others however say that it is the most overrated piece of s*** ever but there is one thing all can agree on Shingeki no kyojin is definitely a special anime and its popularity can not be denied, it quickly became one the most popular and most talked about anime of 2013, it\
          \
        is this popularity and both sides of the argument that made me watch it as I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. After watching I am now certain that I belong in the former side of the argument. \
Story 10: \
Without giving to much in the way of spoilers Shingeki no Kyojin tells the story of a grim, and terrifying world where giant humanoid monster known as Titans suddenly appeared and started devouring humans, leading human kind to the brink of extinction, and in an attempt to survive the surviving humans secluded themselves behind huge walls bigger that the tallest of Titans and then proceeded to live in peace for a whole century, safe from their new enemy. It sounds like your standard extinction of the human race premise and it is for the first few episodes but later on it turns into a complex tale with some compelling plot points, and unexpected turns which forms like the story that shocks and also raises your curiosity as to what exactly the titans are, and to many other trivial matters. The story is also able to portray loss, tragedy, and sorrow and is truly touching at times and it makes feel those feelings for the characters.\
Art 10:\
Not much to say here, Shingeki no Kyojin looks amazing, gorgeous at times the art is great and it makes the characters, setting, and titans look top notch. Its also good that not much of this masterful art is lost once the anime kicks into high gear, when the action kicks in everything looks fluid, and well animated making some of the intense action moments truly jaw-dropping.\
Sound 10:\
The sound is also outstanding. The first OP is one epic song that hooked me from the moment I heard it, also it suits SNK perfectly as it embodies one of its great themes, the second OP is also epic and they both truly prepare you for what is also an epic anime. The background music is also great blending in perfectly with key moments and adding to the moment. The voice acting is also great and sounds, such as the roar of titans, and the sound of their steps as they move about sound realistic and strike a certain feeling of fear.\
Character 9: \
SNK has a big and varied cast of characters, however like with many anime that have many characters some receive next to no screen time with makes the viewer almost forgets about them, however the ones that do receive focus are actually good and they do get some development. I can not go into too much detail without giving away some of the plot or writing a very long essay but rest assured most of the characters are great.\
Enjoyment 10:\
I really enjoyed SNK it was epic, interesting, filled with great moments, an awesome cast of character, and one hell of a story all wrapped up in great visuals and animation, and masterful sound.\
Overall 10:\
Overall Shingeki no Kyojin is truly a masterpiece, one that tells a compelling story, with great characters, stunning visuals, and amazing music and sound design, one that is sure to give you quite the ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat and one that can make you feel the anger and sadness of its character, one that presents you to a grim and tragic world. It had been long since i had enjoyed an anime this much and i can truly say now that I have watched it that it certainly deserves its praise. \

    This anime. My god. \
This easily caught me and stuff. xD \
Okay story will be: 9\
It was really, really lovely. I enjoyed it and really felt the emotions and stuff in it. The storyline was really awesome and I find some things predictable yet somehow, they still amaze me though I knew that certain thing I predicted was like true and stuff. Some things were quite relatable (idek if that’s a word but hey, there’s nothing more I can describe it or something xD). Quite. Don’t get me wrong. Everything just fits in place and all of that makes it even cooler than it should\

        be. I absolutely liked this one here. \
I also admire on how it was like, it has already build up in the very beginning, because usually it'd take like halfway through before the tension builds up and stuff. \
Well there are some points were it's all taken slow due to, you know, carefully planning the tactics and stuff. Either way, it didn't really bore me at all and that is because their tactics are really interesting. (y)\
This may not be your typical type of art design, but hey! The battle scene were really, really epic. So the normal scenes might be like ‘meh’ but I tell you, the battle scenes are a HELL YEAAAAA! :))\
The expressions were also really weiiiiird buuuut. Whatever. The story and events will make oblivious of the art once you really get into it.\
It should’ve been an 7. But the titans were freaaaakin’ adorbs. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is a pretty great anime one of the top anime in 2013 and after watching this series. This anime is based on Titans attacking and devouring humanity that leads on path of extinction.\
Story 8/10\
The Story is awesome, its all about humans are nearly exterminated by Titans, Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survive by walling themselves in a city protected by extreme high walls even taller than the\
          \
        biggest of titans.\
This anime also place the amount of episode as well some related genres it has a great plot about titans and humans. I found this anime very enjoyable and keeping me watching into the next series.\
Art 9/10\
The Art is really the reason and the one thing is really noticeable the animation are far to great especially the 3D maneuver gear it was so cool and I have never seen any anime have anything like that it's definitely a must see. Another thing of this anime has a lot blood and other things that is not for children to watch. The character designs are seemed to be detailed well and Titans are also the Backgrounds. Attack on Titan is really far to great.\
Sound 8/10\
The Theme songs and the ending songs suit the anime setting very well and the battle music and some of the heroic action songs the anime is pretty doing a perfect times it has a great contents and actions of the song. I also definitely enjoy the soundtrack and some other things of this anime and it also have a great voice actors.\
Character 9/10\
The Character is outstanding and got a pretty deep of tragic scene and it also has a deep explanation of the main characters. Definitely the awesome battle scene and heroic death scene of this anime.\
Eren\
His adoptive sister, Mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin. Eren has a great hatred towards Titans and vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.\
Mikasa\
Mikasa is Eren's adoptive sister and mutual childhood friend of Armin. Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren following events in their past, and rushes to protect him whenever he is in danger. Mikasa possesses impressive fighting skill and strength even as a child. As an teen, Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility. She constantly worries for Eren's well-being and lives to protect him.\
Armin\
Eren's best friend, he is physically and emotionally weak. Even though lacking in actual combat, Armin is a genius on theoretical courses and can make plans even under extreme pressure. Even so, Armin kept on thinking that he is weak. He himself does not notice the things he does for Eren and Mikasa, and believes himself to be completely incompetent and hates himself for having to rely of Eren and Mikasa.\
The Character Also far great background and seeking revenge upon the Titans.\
Enjoyment 9/10\
I really enjoyed this anime especially the action scene. If you really like action and super power genres I recommend this anime. This Anime is not boring to watch trust me is great to watch during a fighting scene of this anime. I overtime watching this anime because of the genres and awesome arts and visuals so it worth watching of this anime.\
Overall 9/10\
Overall 9 out of 10 great anime great production. This anime is far to great to watch and I Highly recommend this anime to watch. Shingeki No Kyojin is a solid Action Anime great to watch.\

    If there is any anime that will be remembered from 2013, it's this one. Shingeki no Kyoji aka Attack on Titan had a massive hype build up prior to its release. Did it live up to the hype? To be honest, it had a few hiccups here and there, but it surely lived up to most of it!\
Story: 9\
The title is somewhat misleading. You'd think a show called Attack on Titan would involve you hunting these things down, but the truth is, the people live in fear of these mindless monsters. The anime rearranges some events from the manga (most notably the trainee corps' basic\
          \
        training) in order to introduce you to the secondary characters faster, and in my opinion, that was a stroke of genius. This allowed you to get emotionally attached to more than just the main cast, and gives you a sense of dread since any of them can easily die in this apocalyptic setting. \
I would give the story a 10, if not for one little problem: The uneven pacing. The show starts off at a crazy pace up to the eighth episode, then it slows down to an aggravating halt. Towards the end of the series, the action really picks up again and ends on a satisfying, if inconclusive, note.\
Art: 9\
The titans look pretty damn scary in some moments, then look absolutely retarded in another. The art and animation is very consistent for the most part, although I did catch it lagging in certain areas where it just became still frames with conversations continuing through. The animation of the omni-directional gear is an absolute joy to watch, and definitely sets it apart from its manga source. \
Sound: 10\
Even the staunchest critic of AoT cannot reasonably argue how flawless the effects and soundtrack are. From the chilling groans of the titans, to that burst of an activated maneuvering gear hook, everything sounds as it should. The music is well orchestrated and is used brilliantly to add dread or tension in the right moments. And then there's the opening sequences, where AoT is at its finest. Few series will get you hyped up and ready for shit to go down just from the opening sequences alone. \
Character: 9\
Quite a large cast, and virtually all of them have screen time and have a big impact on the story. And yet as powerful as some of them are, they still feel small and insignificant compared to their predators. Almost every character has a chance to develop as the series progresses, although we may have to wait until later before a certain badass female protagonist can evolve beyond her current state. \
Enjoyment: 10\
Incredibly thrilling and engrossing. Even during its slow moments, I cannot remember any moment where I once felt bored watching this series. Although the moments where the story develops can feel a bit time consuming, the show rewards your efforts of keeping attention with some incredible action. \
Overall: 10\
People are going to have something to say about its pacing, but as of right now, AoT is doing very little wrong and deserves the hype its getting. We may not see another season until at least 2015, but the second hype train is building up and is ready to roll!\

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack On Titan is a typical example of a shounen serie. It is worthfully one of the classic animes, that is highly recommended to watch. However it is far from the best anime I ever saw. Probably it will become higher in my list when the last season comes out and it has a real end.\
The story is basically about a boy eren who had witnessed the dead of his mother (that was killed by a titan) and after that devoted his life to take revenge on every titan alive. What isn’t that easy since they haven’t won any battle yet.\
          \
        I don’t think that you need to know more than this.\
So what did I like of the anime? Well without doubt the originality of the story. The way titans are brought was (at least for as far as I know) never done that way. They are dumb creatures sorted in much different sorts based on the difference in heights with only one weak spot their neck. The way they fight with their 3D-gears to reach that spot and those 3D-gear fights itself where just magnificent. The way they fly smoothly through the air. How a certain field can give so much advantage/disadvantage. Those concepts are just completly new to me. Just as I said before: the fights are just that great. Everything is like it would’ve been like 2000 years ago just with some sci-fi objects as the 3D-gear. Those walls and everything in the city is so well drawn that it suits perfect for background of the titans. It really gives you that feeling like you’re living to in that time. Some characters are magnificent and most of them are again very original. It is just because of that that it is a classic must watch anime for me. The main characters there voice acting is really well done. It just gives those emotions perfectly over. It just makes the characters who they are.\
“But after all those compliments only a seven? why would that be?” is probably a question going through all your heads at the moment. Well the first thing you need to know it that seven means good and that is exactly the way how I feel about this anime. However it had plenty of original stuff there was only one moment that gave me goosebumps. It wasn’t full of fillers or boring stuff. It just wasn’t good enough to surpass many other animes. It probably will at the end of the serie when there comes hopefully an epic end. But as the end is now, such open and nothing special. It just feels like there is missing something big in this anime. Thats why it “only” gots a seven.",

ALL THE FEELS!\
Action filled anime with really, awesomely, sexy screaming [Referring to a particular male titan in EP9]. Little plot twisting, high tension (jokingly from the strings of the maneuver gear), a massive play with camera angles.\
I overall loved Shingeki no Kyojin. The only downside to it, would be the slight dragginess which brought enjoyment from a 10 to 9. Personally, brought it to the top of my favorite list.\
Art would be 9 due to shadings. Wonderful art that doesn't rely too much on those magical feeling but occasional over darkened shadings. (usually seen in ember light\
          \
        settings).\
9 for enjoyment due to aforementioned reason, dragginess. Other than that, its filed with feelings and up most enjoyment.\
Looking back at my list, I do not need to even double confirm that Shingeki no Kyojin is ultimately the top of my favorited list.\
Is it worth watching Shingeki no Kyojin?\
Yes.\
You will miss out a good anime if you don't.\

    Obviously I haven't read the manga and I've only noticed this series once I saw an internet trend that has been growing in popularity in impressive pace. But to speak to the anime, Attack on Titan / Shingeki no Kyojin is truly a masterpiece.\
All professionals in the creative business know that good ideas are almost as abundant and ubiquitous as trash. Almost 100% of all failures as an anime are due to poor execution, not to poor ideas. That being said, great ideas that usually can either become a disciplinary classic or spur a massive output of merchandise products are hard to come by. Many\
          \
        of the great-idea anime/manga that I came across could only do one of these two things, but I'm confident Attack on Titian / Shingeki no Kyojin can and will do both.\
Ok now onto the actual review, as a visual work of arts the anime is stunning. The use of lines and coloring especially showcase master-skills. The cinematic-quality 3D effects that accompany almost every fight are handled by a group of outsourced Vietnamese animators, some of whom you might recognize from the EVA Rebuild movies (I'm promoting this because I'm Vietnamese ^^). I mean, holy cow who doesn't like a whole military of Spider-Man with blades / Deadpool with Spidey power, kicking all kinds of asses? \
Ok, in all seriousness, the character designs (still visually speaking) are the highlight of this anime. All of them look like they just begged to be re-created in forms of figures & art prints. You have the cool military uniform and the characters who are varied enough and attractive in their own way. The visual design of each character suits their personality really well too.\
While execution is still the topic here, let me just say that there are many facets of intricacies in the production of an anime. But to best sum things up, the directing overall is exceptional. The director knows the mood of EVERY SCENE, EVERY SHOT in the story so well, which is the essential but most difficult job for someone to transpire it from manga to anime, that we as audience feel immersed seamlessly and completely with it. Let me make a point here that this story & plot is incredibly rich, varied but condensed so that each scene is packed with moments that constantly consume our attention to the max. How someone can add appropriate editing to it, know when and where to use what effects (even sometimes not to animate at all), and manipulate music to complement the story and guide our sentiments at this level completely blows my mind. \
But what else can make it a disciplinary classic? Well the basic aspects of all disciplines of story-telling arts have been PLOT and CHARACTERS. First off, the story is character-driven which already stands it above so many other franchises I've seen, read & watched AND the characters are all so life-like. Maybe it's just me who has a thing for scarfs and cool-headed female but Mikasa is my pick for a worthy star of the show. Almost every seemingly Ms. Perfects are like her. They are not perfect because they are perfect, they are because other people, except for us the audience, are not granted access to their imperfections. In this aspect the story is realistic because it does not deviate from the universal truths about human beings. What those universal truths are, you will find out when you watch this, one by one, so I'm not gonna go into too much details. And while I do love Mikasa too much, no words will do justice to how awesome characters like Armin, Eren, Levi, Irwin and many others are. Like all great stories, the characters here are incredibly complex and there are no clear heroes or villains. Just you wait and see. \
Second, the PLOT is truly commendable. This is when I address the manga creator, Hajime Isayama. Call the plot at times convenient or not, Isayama-sensei is the god of the Attack on Titan universe, and he is a \"good\" god. I say so because he knows when and where to be predictable and when are where to be unpredictable. Being a good story-teller is like being a teacher and an entertainer at the same time, you guide your listeners in a way that excite them AND condition them for some development in their persons. I sure was excited at the combat sequences, the drama, the unknowns of his universe (the endless questioning about the titans, for example). But at the same time, I felt that both my brain and heart are very properly stimulated. My heart grew affected gradually, un-interuptedly for the cast of characters, one by one, sometimes two or three at once. My brain has to work too because of all the mysteries and the teasing that is going on. Who doesn't love working through hints given by the author to, say, figure out the identities of the special titans and/or the bigger forces at work here?\
Lastly, this is a long shot because obviously the plot is far from complete but I have an idea of how both the manga & anime (assuming they're gonna stay close together story-wise) are going. I hope to re-affirm in this anime some truths I already knew about human beings and the world that I live in. So far so good. I accept his metaphors unconditionally. Magic. To do that to me is as if he read my minds, or maybe I belong to his target audience pool. But I would certainly use Attack on Titan as examples for things I might go on to teach others NOT ONLY about entertainment, manga & anime, but also about life.\

    Attack on Titan is mediocre. It was a series that I was really enjoying at first, and eventually end up being a big disappointment.\
I had to admit, the thing that made it so curious to me was mostly the premise. It has a setting where mankind is almost wiped out by giant monstrosities and gets cornered behind huge walls. They thought they were safe there until a giant manages to break down their fortifications and lets the monsters into civilian areas. Terror and death spread as people die defenseless by the thousands and the rest need to retreat to other fortified lands where they work\
          \
        almost as slaves to support the overpopulation and the lack of food. From this description you are presented with a most interesting action / survival / horror, which is very graphical and doesn’t hold back to depict gore as the giants chew and swallow people.\
Sounds amazing enough for anyone to jump into the show but surely not because it is original. I had to admit that I believe most of anime is soft porn and pedophilia; Luckily this series has non of that.\
The series has a lot of eye-rolling moments. It is NOT a mature story despite having mature themes; and if some think otherwise they are simply ignorant. There's a lot of dumb things, cheesy dialogue, 1 dimensional characterization, and overused shenanigans. The enemies seems unbeatable at first but then some obnoxious emo teenager get convenient superpowers and defeat them by the dozens. And don’t give me any excuses of the sort “There is no other way such a story could be told.”\
Let's talk about the protagonist. So obnoxious! I never encountered such a predictable character in my life. All he does is yelling “I WILL DEFEAT ALL THE GIANTS!” It has an irritating always-angry, totally-stupid voice and no amount of dramatic backdrop manages to make him anything more than a plain stereotype. This guy was BORN angry; not became because of the titans. And just like all typical heroes he has special powers, special family, special friends,  plot armor, and in general has everything working to his favor despite being nothing but yet another ill-mannered youth.\
Other characters include:\
- An aloof girl who loves potatoes and talks like a retard; because all shows need a comic relief idiot.\
- A local aristocrat who exists to show what a selfish asshole he is, letting everyone die just so he can escape with his money and not thinking about it twice; since as well all know adults are all assholes and only teenagers are the goodhearted folks who do all the work and save the day.\
- Kidnappers who kill and sell people as prostitutes, just so we can hate them and wish them dead 10 seconds after they are introduced.\
- Some scared cat boy who is always crying and panicking, just to show how cool is everyone else. Worthless, irritating and yet another proof of why this show doesn't know what characterization is. They pretend he is a mastermind when it comes to planning ahead, but in reality he is the only one who sometimes thinks, while everyone else is an oblivious idiot. So technically he is a normal guy surrounded by retards.\
- And let’s not forget the protagonist’s “not-blood-related-sister” who seems WAY too interested in him to the point she can’t exist without being a needy pet with constant withdrawal syndrome.\
You can literally describe most of them in 10 words as the way they talk and act will border a slapstick comedy half the time. Everything they need to express, they do it by yelling or crying like maniacs, even when the situation hardly calls for them to act as such. Or when they try to be serious for a change, it still comes off as comical. You see a guy in the first episode giving the severed hand of a dead soldier to his crying mother and saying with a serious face “This is all we could save\". And by the way, your son died for nothing, old lady.\
Attack on Titan is not any different from all stories when the characters had bad childhood experiences just for the audience to think they are deep, as each of them is there just to cry in a corner, show us his tragic past and then go to fight the giants until they realizes they are completely worthless before the skills of the main characters and simply stops caring afterwards.\
Something rather fun to watch, was the numerous deaths of secondary characters. Not many convenient survivals and resurrections here; if you are caught by a giant, he is going to rip you to pieces and eat you while you are still alive and screaming. That makes the series really tense in a good way. That still doesn’t save it in the long run of course, since it is nothing but SHOCK to make the audience gasp with blood and violence and not some actually tragic death of important characters you will never forget. You only notice the gore and not the people experiencing it. Who are they? Who knows? You will forget them 5 seconds after they are dead.\
And despite the high mortality rate, eventually you realize it is something that counts for secondary characters. They serve only as cannon fodder in this show; they exist just to cry in corners, die miserably, and fool the unexpected to think no one is safe in this story. Meanwhile the main characters are oozing with the rule of cool and dwarf everybody else in importance, thus trashing the whole survival / horror aspect. If the audience cheers for them, as they wipe out armies of unbeatable giants, the tension is gone; it is still all about who is more overpowered and cool.\
At first you are thrilled to find out why the giants are eating people. They don’t need food to sustain themselves. They don’t have a personality or even intelligence which makes them grotesque and terrifying for not understanding their motivations. Well, most of your questions won’t be answered, since the story is left incomplete, and the little bits that get explained only serve to make you realize there wasn’t much to it. Half the interest things in this anime derives from the gore and the other half is the mystery of the unworldly enemies. So even if you are watching this for the thrilling emotion, you are bound to hate it after you realize it wasn’t that good to begin with. It pretends to be far more than it actually is; and that is a most basic zombie apocalypse scenario.\
It is full of interesting ideas as far as the setting goes, from detailed maps of how the human lands are run, to blueprints of how their cannons and steam engines that make them fly work. Later on you get even basic politics and religious fanaticism as the people react to the new giant attacks and all of a sudden some kids get powers. It makes it far more interesting than some generic video game world full of fortified cities and wilderness crawling with monsters. It’s not TOO detailed though and the truth is, most of them are there for show since they don’t matter much in the long run. And even if you just stick to the setting itself, it is quite simple despite its secondary details. The whole world is basically either houses where people live in or wilderness where titans roam around. Many claim that since the story is a mystery you are supposed to slowly reveal, it is excused for everything to be so basic. That still doesn’t change the fact that all you know about the setting is that there are some giants surrounding a city that looks like 3 perfectly drawn circles.\
The early episodes have extremely fast pacing but then it snails down to almost a halt. The first five minutes go wasted on summaries of things we saw just in the previous episode, and there are even recap episodes for events that don’t need more than a few minutes to describe. In a way this is a positive trait since it invests time into letting the viewer to immerse in the mood of the show. Much better to running through the events while leaving everyone and everything unfocused or not looked into. Sadly the mood is the only thing they focus on.\
The script heads for a constant thrill, which because of the slow pacing, makes every major event to last for several episodes, constantly ending with a cliffhanger. Although this can be a nice motivation for the audience to anticipate the next episode, they do it so many times and for events that could practically fit in only one episode. Tension loses its meaning if it happens all the time without proper relaxation points and after awhile you no longer find it exciting or edgy, exactly because it is always like that.\
Although this is not an issue with everyone, it is still a problem. The characters have no control over the events of the show; they are just reacting to them. No matter what happens, they will never choose what to do next; the plot is going to force them into what to do next. It makes sense for that to happen in stories that have to do with death and survival but it sure makes them pass as drones and unable to progress or develop further on their own will, despite their superpowers.\
You don’t even get a resolution to all this mess, since the anime concludes with an open ending.\
The artwork feels generic nonetheless. It tries to be very crude when it comes to proportions and perspective. Overall it looks appealing to the most part and it is well drawn with no errors in each character's anatomy. I can’t say it was very annoying;  it fits a story based on crazy stuff. It even included a catchy chorus soundtrack to make it even more intriguing. At the same time it censors most of the disgusting scenes where the giants are chewing people and replaced them with blood spills falling while the gore is left out of screen. If there is something I didn’t like, that would be the body figures. All giants seem to be randomly drawn and all human soldiers look like they have the exact same body figure AND uniform. It’s not like big boobs for girls or huge biceps for men would make it better but it sure feels weird to have everybody being skinny and flat-chested. The only thing that differs is the face and occasionally some rosy lips to point out that some of them are girls.\
I do agree though that as a whole Attack on Titan manages to build up tension right away. It is also good to see a show that is not about high school club porn comedies, because I know most anime is like this.\
As for how popular this show got? I am sure some other anime will come out to blow your brains out and people will be saying “That is truly awesome, unlike Attack on Titan\".\

    I am so glad that I watched this anime now, since the second season is already announced and going to come out in spring 2017. If I would have watched this anime not knowing if it was going to get a second season of it even was going to have one, my score for it would have been really low. \
with that being said,  I judge anime based on enjoyment and whether or not it executes it's stated genres to perfection. \
The action in attack of Titans was definitely there and it was both amazing and sometimes emotional. The shounen part of the anime\
          \
        comes into play with the storyline, you know the whole, \"humans/main characters VS Threat that can destroy everyone/thing.\" I don't find that to be a bad thing like most people do, and in this case i doubt anyone would have any complaints with how well executed this anime is. The supernatural/fantasy genres make this anime all the more interesting because it contributes to the action in the anime. The drama in this anime has to be the best part of the anime. The pain, trust/friendships and betrayals of the characters in this anime will leave you speechless. It is well done to the core. Expect the unexpected with this anime.\
With all that being said and as amazing of an anime this was, I couldn't give this anime a high score. The ending ruined it for me, rather it didn't have an ending. Too many questions left unanswered. too many things were unresolved, which is fine because it has a second season coming up soon. I will higher my score on this anime when I watch the seconds season. I recommend if you are thinking about watching this anime, just wait until the next season comes out, to start watching this one\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, or more commonly referred to as Attack on Titan, is a series that blew up in popularity almost instantly after its premiere, and there's little question as to why. Having a unique and compelling setting, brutal and realistic deaths, and absolutely amazing art and animation to bring the series to life, what is there not to like?\
My friend clued me in on this anime just as it was starting and I fell immediately in love with it. I marathoned it until the latest aired episode (episode 8 at the time) and wanting more I turned to the manga to sate my curiosity\
          \
        of what happens next. What's in the motherf@%king basement!? But, after picking up the manga I quickly realized this series was greatly flawed and all my excitement and drive for AoT was lost. I stopped paying attention to the series, despite all the uproar about it, and went on my way.\
A few days ago, however, I realized that the anime was surely finished by now, so I may as well give it another go to see if my latest impressions had changed at all. To my dismay, they didn't.\
This review will go over the strengths and weaknesses of AoT, going into detail the reasons why I feel so disappointed with how the series turned out. \
STORY - 4/10\
Much in the same way of Sword Art Online, AoT draws us in with its interesting and compelling setting. A new species of creature, the Titans, arose out of nowhere and have hunted humans to their final stand. Desperate for survival, the humans of this world have surrounded their race with towering walls that block them from the outside world and, more specifically, from the threat of the Titans. 100 years these walls have kept the humans safe and have established a time of peace, until a Colossal Titan appears and breaks through the outermost wall. Titans flood in through the new gap, and humanity is pushed back even further inside the cage they have constructed.\
The story of AoT is about humanity struggling to survive and fighting back against the threat of their impending extinction. The plot revolves around a group of people who are tasked with fighting against the titans and ensuring the survival of humanity. Sorry, let me rephrase that. That is what the story \"should\" have been, but unfortunately what we got fell short of this goal.\
Presentation is everything when it comes to a good story. No matter how fantastic and compelling your setting is if you can't tell it well then it's all wasted potential. And that's all I can see with AoT: wasted potential. The series starts out strong. Absurdly so. It sets up the scenario, it illustrates the titans as being a clear and devastating threat, it gets you seriously invested into what will happen next, and it even sets up a few mysteries for you to contemplate over in the background. And then, after a major event, the entire shift and focus of the series changes, arguably for the worst, and it hasn't yet recovered from that shift. I'll detail more about this in the \"Characters\" section of this review.\
ART AND ANIMATION - 10/10\
This is by far the anime's greatest strength and is no doubt largely the reason it has become so popular and widely acclaimed. It's likely this is the first thing you will notice about the anime from the very first minute you lay your eyes upon it. It's gorgeous. Stunning. Dazzling. Complete ecstasy for your eyes. There's no other way to put it. Characters are contrasted heavily with the environment, allowing for more detail to be put into both. Animation is some of the smoothest I have ever seen, boasting some of the most impressive and energetic action scenes I've ever experienced in an anime.Additionally, the quality of the art and animation stays fairly consistent throughout all 25 episodes. \
It's a perfectly reasonable thing to watch this show simply for the amazing art and animation. I can certainly say that I did, and I don't regret it one bit. It was this anime's saving grace for me.\
SOUND AND VOICE ACTING- 8/10\
The sound quality of AoT is overall outstanding. Where it really shines the most is during the action scenes, where there is a lot of face paced and epic scores used to get your adrenaline to flow. The screams and roars of rampaging titans are chilling, attacks and hits look and sound brutal, and the screams of the humans who constantly fall victim are done well.\
Voice acting is also really solid. The voice actor for Eren, Yuuki Kaji, really outdid himself during the moments when his character was fueled with rage and anger. Those are some of the most favorable moments for me in the series because of how well done they were.\
However, it's not perfect like art and animation is. There are some questionable scores used during some action scenes that don't seem to fit, and there are certain characters whose voice I really couldn't stand, such as the cowardly commander Kitts Verman.\
Overall, though, the sound design was much more a boon to the series than a fault.\
CHARACTERS - 3/10\
The characters of AoT are, without any doubt, the series greatest weakness. The 3 main characters are, in my opinion, unfit to be leading roles while the supporting cast is largely composed of bland and uninteresting personalities or are completely one dimensional in design. There's only a handful of characters worth their salt, but they either don't have enough screen time or are not significant enough to matter. Much of the wasted potential of this series comes from the main character, Eren, and what should have happened with him rather than what did. \
Instead of explaining who the characters are and their role in the story (you can easily just read their dedicated page on MAL), I want to talk about what they bring to the story, and why I'm so dissatisfied with them.\
> Armin \"Mr. Useless\" Arlert - This character is your typical smart-but-weak archetype who comes up with all the plans and tactics but is complete f@%k all in a fight. That in itself is fine, but for all he is supposed to be he accomplishes practically nothing in the series. Aside from having a single moment of glory, he is pretty much entirely irrelevant. Much of the realizations he has are either already known or are simultaneously figured out by someone more important than him, and in the end only really relays information that we've already found out.  My biggest complaint with this character, however, stems from his monologues of wanting to be strong and not having to be saved, and then not doing anything about that and having to be saved. Over and over and over.\
> Mikasa \"Mary-Sue\" Ackerman - While she is the most balanced out of all the main characters, this is largely the case because her only flaw is her complete lack of a personality. I mean that literally. It's her only flaw. She is downright amazing at everything she does, and is even stated to be worth 100 normal soldiers at one point. She can stand toe to toe with titans that just killed multiple \"elite\" soldiers effortlessly, despite being completely new to fighting titans (because lol). She is also obsessed with Eren. Or rather, she is obsessed with protecting him. Literally 80% of her dialogue stems from trying to dissuade Eren from doing reckless stuff or trying to protect/rescue him in some way. Aside from that one aspect, her personality is nonexistent.\
Eren \"The Plot\" Yeager - Yes, you read that right. Eren is the literal plot of AoT. I don't mean the plot revolves around him, or he is central to it. No, he IS the plot. And it's such a shame too, because it ruins his otherwise promising character. He starts off, just like the setting of AoT, very strong as a lead character. He's fun to watch, and you can relate to him because of the events that unfold. You feel for him. He's a good character because, while flawed, has a ton of passion and energy. He's hotheaded and quick to act out of rage and anger, and often makes stupid decisions as a result, leading Mikasa to having to try and dissuade him from doing something. But that's fine. He's a functional character.\
And then something big happens. (Slight spoilers for episode 5 and 8. Skip to next paragraph if you do not wish to be spoiled) What happens is what got me excited for AoT and compelled me to read through the manga. Eren sacrifices himself to save Armin, and ends up \"dying\" in the process. This is HUGE because this is the kind of event that shapes and molds the other main characters into respectable and powerful leads. Armin is traumatized and Mikasa shows actual emotion, which is awesome. There is a whole episode about remembering Eren and how he impacted Armin and Mikasa, and everything is pointing to how these 2 characters are going to develop and grow because of Eren's sacrifice... And then Eren comes back with a nifty new power up. Ugh.\
Now, that in itself is fine. But what isn't fine is what Eren becomes after this. No longer is Eren part of Humanity's struggle for survival. Form this point on, Eren is humanity's \"hope\". And everything and onward is about Eren. All other characters are reduced to insignificance in the presence of our leading protagonist. Everything that happens in the series revolves around Eren. Eren needs to do this! Eren needs to do that! OH NO! Eren couldn't do that! Quick, save him! (Spoiler, get used to that pattern, it'll be most of season 2)\
If you ignore what the series \"could\" have been, and, Eren still has some faults. Like stated above, Eren has a ton of passion in the beginning of the anime. And it's engaging. It keeps you interested in seeing how he's going to blow up. But near the end of the anime, you see almost none of this. No passion, no anger. He just frets over the deaths of his comrades over and over and gets really whiny when he makes a bad decision. Almost every time he fails at something, there needs to be at least 3-4 characters who yell at him for 5 minutes in order for him to do something again. Eren is just full of wasted potential, both for his character and for the plot, and it's likely that will never change.\
ENJOYMENT - 6/10\
Lackluster characters and missed opportunities aside, AoT is still a fun watch. It's somewhat like Gurren Lagann where you will enjoy it a lot more if you just turn off your brain and bask in the glorious visuals and epic battles. It does what it sets out to do, which is to entertain, and it does it well.\
Unfortunately, I'm not that kind of watcher, and a lot of the little things got to me throughout the experience. For example, a lot of characters in AoT have the tendency to jinx themselves right before a horrible event, especially Eren. Both Titan attacks were preceded with a monologue of how everything is going to be spiffy moments before the invasions, as well as many deaths happening to characters just after they, or someone else, explains how everything is going to be all right.\
Speaking of which, nearly all the deaths that happen in AoT happen to insignificant no-name no-face characters that are put there just to die. Only rarely do we ever see a character we know perish, and even then we barely know them. These characters, at best, have screentime for an episode or 2 before their death. There's no build up for them and thus no impact. Never once watching AoT did I ever fear for an established character's life (barring episode 5). However, I can respect that characters die quick and brutally, leaving no room for a dying speech that ever so populate anime these days.\
CONCLUSION - 6/10\
All in all, Attack on Titan is fun to watch for the amazing animation and the epic scenes, but not much more.\
My final score is:                     31/50 -> 6.2/10\

(Spoiler free)\
Shingeki no Kyojin or better well known as Attack on titans is a must-watch for all the action anime fans out there.\
The story take places in a medieval post-apocalyptic world where mankind, or what is left, is forced to hide in 3 series of enormous concentric walls set on hierarchical scale. At the center is placed the king and all the high-profile people, the second includes the 3 military corps and medium-wealthy citizens and the last, but not least, is where the majority of population is located, composed by farmers and artisans. Each boundary wall stretches for a dozen of miles of land.\
The reason\
          \
        why humanity is on the edge of extinction is, like title suggests, the presence of man-eating titans. Like a zombie, the only purpose who pushes those giants to attack are exclusively the human race. In fact a giant could live forever without feeding, but as soon as they see a man they just devour him for pure pleasure. Why? That is the million-dollar question which it won't be revealed even at the end of the first series, while on the other hand, you'll find little hints about titans origins. \
STORY 9/10\
The story structure is very fluid and each episode contributes to the overall plot so there aren't any fillers. Although this is a 'Shounen' genre and the action is the starring role, it never falls on predictable and big plot holes, and this is a very nice thing considering all those rushed series that forces unlike events only because the story calls for it.\
What it differs fundamentally from other fantasy anime lies in its Unique and Original story. More deeply, after few mins from the beginning you will get literally crushed in a brutal carnage. The first thing which strikes one is the appearance, followed by a dazzling lighting, of a colossal titan who stands above the 60 m walls. With just a kick he breaks through the majestic door allowing other minor titans to rampage the city. This is where the two protagonists Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackerman witness their mother's head rip off by a titan and the slaughter of almost all village people, gifting us one of the MOST INTENSE epic scenes i've ever seen. From all the blood shed in battle the red string of fate ends up binding to Eren,still unaware of the fact he has the key to save the world. With the burning fire on his eyes and a crazy note in his voice, he swears for vengeance and ~actual words~Killl Them All. (Omg Moment)\
ART 10/10\
The animation is Outstanding and you can see miles away the studio put a lot of efforts in it. The quality remains the same from the start up to the last scene, so don't worry about that, it won't undergoes any change during the episodes as so often happens in many anime. The characters designs are stunning and seem like underlined with a black pen and even the setting is well-finished in all aspects.\
What it won't certainly pass unnoticed is the three dimensional maneuver gear, a sort of equipment which allows great mobility to fight in a 3D space when facing the titans in combat.This device will grant you spectacular and breathtaking scenes, so get ready for some epic acrobatics feats.\
Whilst animation does his duty very well, the art on the whole doesn't goof on ridicoulus or childish situations, that's why i think 'Seinen' should be more suitable for this anime.\
The air you breath is filled with despair and the emotional state of each character succeeds on getting empathize in their situations. The personalities are truly fitting and the reason that makes humanity to fight is very motivating, like a war to survive, you fight or you die.\
SOUND over 9000/10\
Brace yourselves, Epic Osts are coming. \
Without any doubts the stronger point of the series, correction : of All the anime series. Seriously talking, the osts are so damned epics that you will get stuck in a loop without no chance to escape [Play-repeat..] [Play-repeat...] thus, once you get infected the only remedy is time, you know, time heals all wounds so i would advise you to make your peace with this. The pacing and songs suits up perfectly and make you sweating for excitement up to grieving from sadness, so get ready and make some room in your playlist. It will worth every byte.Nothing to say more, no, really , just go and download every track!! and spread the infection.\
Characters's voices are also great so if you are going to watch this series, do it in its original language, got it? Janepese voices make it better, i could say for experience since i watched the anime in japan sub ita the first time and then in my language. Result: it ruined the viewing.\
Eren's voice in berserk mode is very devastating..\
Why are you still here? The tracks!!Gogogo.\
CHARACTER 9/10\
Attack on titans has one of the largest character's arsenal ever seen: Tsundere girls,crazy yanderes ,dandere,big breasted women and cute lovely loli... Nah, just kidding. Fortunately for us, this alternative mediaval world doesn't allow this odd creatures to come in,  also because the part of the monster has already been given to the titans, so stereotypes characters, i'm sorry but you won't steal again the show. However, aot's world is a tough place to live. Being weak means you will be short-lived, thus, having a strong personality is the minimun requirement. Every character has its own pre-set nature, some will have a growth during the series, but despite this, they are unpredictable or just damned stupid, in poor words, they are Real, acting like a human. There aren't any fanservice or embarassing moments for the viewer---> 'sigh of relief'\
To avoid some serious spoilers i won't describe any of the characters,however, i assure you will love each one of them,and more than anyone else the stronger badass soldier of all mankind, Levi Ackerman. The studio has released 2 ovas about his past and the fact that 2 episodes are ranked 8,5 speaks for itself.\
OVERALL 10/10\
Since many people tend to skip all the review and just looking at the overall thoughts, (i do too) i saved you some things.\
Shingeki no Kyojin brought a full breath of fresh air in the anime world and it was right this series which made me get close to it. I didn't even know the existence of some masterpieces until a couple of months ago and i watched it for just pure chance..  ~manna from heaven~\
This anime has seriously the power to break the mental chains to all those closed-minds who still think anime are just childish cartoons. Take it from someone who's been one!! From a more mature point of view, Aot has nothing to envy to the most popular american series like Games of Thrones or ...(ok now i'm shooting in my foot) but regarding the enjoyment, they are almost on the same level IMO.\
It is a matter of mentality and fame. The latter can spring curiosity, and from curiosity you can gradually open the mind to see Japanese animation in a different and positive light, but this is still an utopian dream.\
However,put that aside, if you think action is the only protagonist of the series you're wrong, because a good slice of story is cut by dialogues and very well done flashbacks. This anime is so detailed and doesn't present any imperfections, so if you're trying to look for a needle in a haystack, i'm sorry, but you won't find it. The atmosphere makes you feel involved in every character situations, and you can feel the danger gets under your skin in all the fight against the titans.\
The first episode is stellar, one of the best start, seriously, after the first peaceful moments letting the viewer to acclimatize and introduce the story, an abrupt change breaks the quietness and the plot quickly gets off the ground leaving us with a big question that still bother me and all the non-manga-readers: Who are those special titans appeared out of nowhere and Why did they break the walls??! Maybe the giants are not the only threat for mankind...cough...cough. By the way, i hope the mistery behind the titans will be revealed in the second upcoming season so what are you waiting for? In this anime you will discover the pure meaning of epicness, bravery, courage sacrifice that will touch your heart deeply, you can't miss it, oh and don t forget about the tracks! ;)",

    Attack on Titan is not the best anime ever. It has some real flaws, including a heavy reliance on dialogue in inappropriate places. Occasionally, the animation suffers as the production company has rushed to get the show done in time. You can pick apart its flaws if you want. But I can only think of a few times in my anime watching years when I have gotten this sucked into a show. It's smartly unpredictable, occasionally shocking, and wildly entertaining. When the action ramps up, it's nothing short of stunning. I'm having a hard time waiting from Sunday to Sunday for it.\
In an uncertain future,\
          \
        perhaps on Earth, perhaps not...the human population has been utterly decimated by titans. These gigantic monstrosities, ranging from a few meters to perhaps a hundred meters tall, appeared a hundred years ago, eating through humanity at an alarming rate. A major group of survivors walled off a sizable area, creating a stronghold against future titan attacks. Three walls now protect the human population from these horrific creatures. Occasionally, a military group of scouts is sent out to check on titan activity, but few ever make it back. The size, speed and ferocity of the titans makes them a foe nearly impossible to beat; as they don't speak, there's no negotiating with them. As the series starts, though, there's a sense of peace -- not because there isn't danger lurking outside the walls, but because the titans haven't attacked for a hundred years.\
Erin and his parents, along with his foster sister Mikasa, live a somewhat normal existence in their medieval-European city. While they live in the most dangerous zone out near the third wall, the apparent truce between the titans and humanity has lasted so long that the risks seem muted. But their world is about to turn upside down...suddenly, a colossus titan rips through the main gate, allowing thousands of titans to pour into the city, devouring the inhabitants indiscriminately. The troops trained to fight these devils are gorily defeated before they have a chance to inflict much damage, and most of the populace is lost in the rampage. Erin and Mikasa witness horrific events no one should ever have to face and Erin vows to destroy every titan as an act of vengeance.\
A few years pass as we find Erin and Mikasa training in the military corps, attempting to become soldiers prepared to take on the titans. Equipped with swords, grappling hooks, and gas-powered blowers, they take to the air with their squads like well-armed spidermen. Yet titans are only vulnerable at a spot on the nape of their necks, and striking a killing blow is about as likely as bull's eying wamp rats. As primitive as their technique is, it's the only hope of saving the population from the titans, even if it promises near-certain death. But Erin is not about to give up on his revenge, and Mikasa isn't about to leave his side...\
Attack on Titan's tech specs run from mediocre to brilliant. The show has been running behind; a recap episode has already been announced as a way for the production staff to get back on track. Sometimes, it shows. In one episode, the character lines were far too thick, making a couple incidental characters look like those Colorforms I used to play with as a kid. And yeah, those kind of problems are a turn-off. It's a tradeoff for the action sequences, which are simply incredible for a weekly television show. Watching the troops race from rooftop to rooftop is stunning, and I can put up with windy speeches with limited animation to see the spectacular battles against the titans.\
Even if the animation doesn't impress you, the soundtrack will. Its opening theme is an intense earworm that dares you not to listen to it. (To give it its full due, I usually listen to OP themes once, then skip them to get more quickly into the meat of the show. I haven't skipped Attack on Titan's OP theme once.) While the slower EP song isn't as impressive, it's fine. The rest of the soundtrack is perfect, giving weight to the sequences it underlines. I do not doubt that this is a soundtrack many people will wind up importing; I can only hope it gets a US release.\
Story-wise, there are some minor gaps, but the overall package works. So let's start with the not-so-good. Erin is a little one-note; revenge might make for a good Mel Gibson flick, but it can't be a character's only motivation for an entire TV show. Mikasa is a little bland, and her voice actress doesn't help. There are too many characters, and quite frankly, they die so quickly that trying to follow them all before you're a few episodes in is an exercise in futility. Certain minor players are stereotypes, such as the king -- who in his five-minute cameo so far appears to be a complete idiot. Occasionally, conversations between squadmates go on way too long, especially when we the audience are thinking, \"Hey, aren't there titans around?\" And if you're queasy, watch out; while the gore isn't exploitative, there's plenty of it. We are talking about humans becoming giant fodder, after all.\
I give you all that up front because there are so many good points. Attack on Titan knows how to build and sustain tension. There are plot twists that I never saw coming, which is rare. Unlike many anime, the show allows its characters to grow up before they go into battle -- at least, they're of the age that they might qualify to join the armed forces in first-world countries. The angst they suffer is not from being put-upon teenagers; it's from seeing good friends get torn to shreds by half-skinned creatures that are from the depths of their worst nightmares. While the scenarios are wildly different, this is about the closest I've ever seen anime get to the raw intensity of a Saving Private Ryan. And while the characters aren't the most developed, the further the show goes, the deeper the back stories on our leads become. And when the action starts, it is amazing. It's thrilling, perhaps more so because the danger is real and palpable. The shows themes are very dark, yet its characters are hopeful that they can build a better life. You want them to succeed and grieve when they fail. Give it three episodes, and if you're not hooked, I'd be genuinely surprised.\
I've been wrong about shows a third of the way through before, and I could be wrong about Attack on Titan as well. Truly no one knows if this is going to wind up a winner or a stinker. But if I were a betting man, I'd bet on this one. Whether you watch it via Funimation or Hulu, watch it. Unless you hate shonen action, faint at the sight of blood, or are nitpicky when it comes to your anime, I highly recommend hopping on this crazy train.\

I've heard people say that SnK is an overrated anime, but I have never once heard someone say it was bad. But honestly? I think it deserves all the praise it gets!\
It has a great story, with likeable characters, and absolutely STUNNING art (seriously, sometimes I had to stop and just admire the art style).\

It's a good story. People are not at the top of the food chain so they've banded together to protect themselves against a mutual enemy. Plus I like the \"older\" setting. Feels like late 1800's Europe in some areas. The story isn't groundbreaking or revolutionary but it's a nice change of pace from modern or futuristic settings. \

I purposely put this behind \"enjoyment\" because I wanted to elaborate a bit more. Sasha, Hanji, Levi, those are some really good characters. They're a little generic (not boring or plain) as in they're nothing new. But good nonetheless. So why did I give it a 6? Eren. Entirely Eren. He's not fit to be a Main Character unless you're following that weird shonen trope where the MC screams and rages and throws all the fits and gets his way in the end. He  sees zero development as in he stays the same throughout the show. (I want to kill titans. Let me kill titans). But for some reason people find him inspirational. \
TLDR; Eren is the reason why the anime missed out on a 8 or possibly 9 rating.\
Overall: 7\
I had high hopes for this one from the first episode which was replaced by \"Eren, please...\" Go ahead and watch it since I still think it's a decent choice. But try not to dwell on how annoying Eren can be. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin, or some might call it Attack on titan brings us an outstanding story line that is original and very engaging, the story is very compelling, with its unique setting/background that essentially drives this story to its fullest.ou can almost never guess what will happen next.An art style that I really love. And most of all, it's just very engaging. don't want to spoil anything (just in case you are wondering whether or not to watch it) but Eren is basically a catalyst in a war against large, humanoid creatures called titans. Whatever was left of humanity made the decision to barricade themselves\
          \
        in a giant fortress with many walls. 100 years after the titans appeared, Eren experiences a tragic loss of a family member, which essentially sets his fate in stone: he wants to do anything to destroy all the titans.\

I play varsity tackle football, lift, keep up on all other sports, so I'd like to say I'm not one to get emotional, but this anime stuck me on a personal level and I couldn't contain the tears, it was just so sad!\
I started this anime when I was pretty new to the anime world. I wasn't really into the culture all that much. I mostly just watched Naruto, DBZ, Yugi-Oh, like any basic boy growing up. I went in to this expecting this to be\
          \
        mediocre anime, like some action, some sadness, some good resolve. I have to say I was in for quite a shock. Outstanding art work and animation (well could be in higher graphics). The story was okay, but the way the mystery is carried out is very well done (Holmes would be proud); the foreshadowing and resolution was grand and highly enjoyable. It was a well written anime. No random fillers, or useless information. The Music was okay. The main characters really shined, amazingly portrayed. Overall it was very enjoyable. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin also known as Attack on Titan is filled with tons of action, drama, and violence. The plot is that humanity is trapped around walls in which out the walls are blood thirsty \"Titans\" that feed on human blood and have no mercy. One day day the Titans do manage to break down the walls causing chaos. The after math of the chaos make the main character Eren join a army that fight against the Titans along with his friends. The music is AMAZING and fits the the tight atmosphere the characters are in honestly it gives me goose bumps when ever music\

        come in and gives you a bad feeling in your stomach making you know something is about to come up. The art concept is something to admire as well which the animators managed to make the scenes pop out. You can admire the dedication of every single scene that is animated. As for the characters there are a bunch of characters with different mindsets of what is going on in this disaster. I love to see how they all react differently and we learn about the character's background story as it progresses. This anime is filled with tons of action,drama, and sad moments that will hit you in the gut. Not to mention the highly detailed violence, if you're a fan of hardcore detailed violence then this is right for you! I highly recommenced this anime! Keep in mind that this anime is not yet finished since season 2 is said to come out in 2016.\

    Okay, so!! I finally got around to watching Attack on Titan and needless to say because of the score I have given it, I am very disappointed in its display. To summarize the start, the main character, Eren Yeager, lives in a large town inside a 40 meter tall wall which was build to stop the titans, which are large humanoids varying in sizes that prey on the humans and have done so for a vast amount of years. In order to prevent these titans from killing the rest of humanity, the humans formed a large scale military group that  divides into three sections:\
          \
        The Military Police, The Scout Regiment, and the Garrison Regiment. Now to start the anime off, something big has to happen right? Well it does. The appearance of a massive titan that destroys things and lets the other titans into the walls, blah blah blah. Attack on Titan has a rather indifferent way about its start as it does throw the audience into a state of panic within the first episode which is actually very promising. Well it was. But it was rather quite the let down in my eyes. After the first real panic, nothing really happens that makes as harsh of an impact. \
\
Alright I want to hit the visuals first, as I like to start with my what I enjoyed the most about the anime I am reviewing. I do give the visuals a very high 7, just short of giving it an 8 due to the fact that looking at characters that seem like they might be cardboard cut-outs makes me rather enfurated. Yes that is exactly how they look with their dark,  heavy outlines and their stiff movements. Later on in the anime, whether I just got so used to it or it actually getting better, I noticed that they weren't as bad as they were in the  first episodes, but still rather visible. But! As I said, this was my favorite part and there is a reason! The CGI. If you can even call it CGI. The way the motions panned out during  the fighting and during moments of intensity were rather flawless and very well done. When the characters were jumping between buildings, I felt an exhilarated rush. Very well done. Coming down the effects of the blood and the smoke, which a lot of animes seem to struggle getting to work properly with the animation style they use, Attack on Titan did very well. None of the blood felt out of place and the gas always had a clean flow, not a mess of whatever was trying to be done. \
\
Going to put the sounds here because I feel its best to get it out of the way. Starting with the intro and the outro, I did very much enjoy the thrilling start it gave you feel when it through the visuals with splendid music, the outro did a very nice job of doing its job as to settle down after an episode of iffy feelings. Now down to the part that matters here,  hated the voice actors. Jean's voice I think was the ONLY voice in the entire anime that didn't make me hate it even more. Its not that I thought the voice actors were bad, no they AMAZING at playing with their voices to fill the emotion that the character was feeling and a damn wonderful job of getting a sense of feeling it was real, BUT NONE OF THEM MATCHED THEIR CHARACTERS! AT ALL! Switch them around a little and boom, perfect voice acting! That simple! And they failed! Was a total disappointment. The background music was also rather shallow. Like, I always heard it, but it just never left an impact or just didn't feel like it really did its job to involve me in the scene it was playing for. I think the only sounds that were done well in this, were the sounds of cutting the titans and the sound of blades. Not really much else.\
\
Oooo boy, characters. Here's where I'm really gonna take a massive chunk outta this anime. There was NO character development. no visual sign that anyone was actually changing. And whenever they did, they threw it away half an episode later like it never happened. There was nothing to show that these people were learning. It was a constant stalemate in their grown. The cast of the characters was also a mess. No one really had a purpose in the way anyone was connected and made any connection someone had to another seem almost worthless. Eren's only reason for being this character that he was, was because he was mad and wanted to kill all the titans. His whole purpose was very  cliche and dull. Not to mention how underly dense he was, which made him all the more terrible of a character. Arata, Eren's best friend, REALLY HAD NO PURPOSE WHAT SO EVER. He was there, he was smart, he was weak, he hated himself. He really didn't serve a purpose. Anyone really could've done the same job he did. Misaka, a girl that was taken in by Eren's parents, was there solely for Eren. Yes all MCs need their girl, that is certain and I think she did play a very strong role. Now her existence should've made  Arata's nonexistent. She was already this god character at Eren's side all the time. Why would he need more? The only other person I can see being worth mention is Jean, who Eren had multiple encounters with and really should've been the one in Arata's place as well. But he was way to unstable of a character. Everytime he had a chance to be useful, he blew it. Now, I know what fear can do to a person. It'll make you think irrationally, prevent you from moving properly, all around just make it hard to function the way you want.  But what I don't understand is this irrational fear these people had. Where all their courage, all their determination went EVERY damn time something happened. I guess I  could understand it when it comes from the civilians, but the military regiments were despicable. I really just couldn't believe that after 4 years of this really harsh training,  dealing with overcoming fear in these harsh environments, they would just be terrified each and every time. It was worthless. Getting scared after seeing your comrades eated  is certainly scary, but these people grew up KNOWING this was happening for hundreds of years! And then got trained to fight against it! The emotions shown in the  characters, important or not, was very terrible and I can't give it anywhere over a 1. \
\
Now, it's rather hard for me to just attack an anime without really trying to give it some credit so I will say I did very much enjoy its story concept and the idea they put in place to give this anime life, but unfortunately, it just had too many flaws. The fact the anime's first 13 episodes took place in 5 days, 7 of those episodes being in 1 day, really bothered me. I know that that day have a VERY important meaning and was very crucial to how the anime would play out, but I feel that it would've made more sense to do this with an anime that had more episodes. So I feel that they just failed in giving it the proper girth that it should've had to make those episodes actually have a meaning. Now onto the actual fighting with titans, it was awful. There was this build up saying how strong these titans were, which was rather clear, but certain people, naming here Misaka, killed multiple titans by herself without even breaking a sweat. Now why couldn't three or four cadets, who were in the same position she was, not do what she did as a group? It just didn't add up. Either everyone died to one titan in half a second, or the titan was killed effortlessly. There was never an in between. Thus simulating a very large difference  all the characters and their abilities. I did also enjoy the mystery behind the titans. I thought that the fact that nothing really ever got found out easily was very great and a big  plus to the anime. I also found it a great surprise when Eren's trump card was released so early in the anime, not 20 episodes in when it just happened to be convenient for the author to change something up. \
\
Wrapping up my review, I think a 4 is really the only way to rate this anime. Even though there was so much going on in this anime, the episodes felt too short and really not  enough was ever explained. Then came all the inconsistencies with the characters' personalities and the mess of what was always going. To top it off, the scenes were never really clear either. Something would happen, have no connection to anything, throw you back into a flashback, explain its purpose, and the put you back at the beginning with something new to go off of. BUT YOU WERE STILL CONFUSED HOW TO HOW THE HELL IT WAS PLAYED OUT. Just too much of a mess in its presentation. I do give my enjoyment for this anime a 3 because it was just never there. It has too many flaws and not enough good points to balance it out. BUT! I did end up finishing the entire anime.  So, with that said, there was something about it that made me want to finish it, there for, whether I like it or not, I'm still a statistic in the watched poll. Hopefully we will see a vast improvement in the second season if there is ever one to release.",

    ( This is my first review )\
Okay I intend to be completely honest with this not matter how much hate I get.\
First off lets start off with our main characters : Eren , Mikasa and Armin ( I will also include Levi )\
Eren is one of the MOST annoying anime characters to have as your main character, all he does is talk about how much he hates and despises the titans and how hes going to kill them all, but  he is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY USELESS, to a point where it honestly pains me to even watch him. Some people may like him but\
          \
        I find him to be annoying.\
Mikasa is so boring its almost like she doesn't even have a personality, that's how bad it is, honestly there isn't even much to say about her other than shes very skilled with no reason why?\
Armin now Armin isn't so bad he is just trying his best to find someway to be useful and I can respect that, but as a character there isn't much to him.\
Levi he is pretty much the same as Mikasa no personality, all we really know about him is that he likes to clean, and that's it, other then that he is pretty much just bland.\
 ( honestly this show would have been better if it focused on : Jean, Sasha and Marco )\
Now story\
Overall the story is good. My only problem is, they talked more about fighting the titans than ACTUALLY fighting the titans, and that really bothered me. And for me I didn't even pay attention when we were learning about the titans, maybe this is just me but I just found it boring.\
The sound track is amazing and that's I really all I have to say about it ( I feel like music isn't something you can describe and more of something you'll have to listen to yourself )\
Now for the art\
Overall the art was good, \
 the backgrounds were absolutely gorgeous. \
The character designs were on point, and the titans were animated so well, I really give props to the animation studio.\
Overall attack on titan is a great anime with awful main characters, with a great story, great art, amazing sound. My only wish is that the creator gave them better personalities.\

    Attack on Titan makes me sad. Not because of the gruesome deaths or that killer soundtrack. It makes me sad as a critic. \
The first part of this show is fantastic. I went into it spoiler free and loved the twist of the main character. The characters (That we were meant to pay attention to) were all fantastic. I didn't like Mikasa a whole lot but it was fine! If this could just be based off of those first twelve episodes alone I would give it a solid 10/10 but they didn't stop there.\
The second half hurts me emotionally and spiritually. Because the art improved,\
          \
        the sound was still killer, and the scenes were badass. But something was lacking, and when I found out what it was it really shocked me. The story takes a massive plummet downwards as it shifts focus away from the good characters and on to the bad ones. Levi is a horrible character and a Mikasa reprint and she's not even good to begin with. The antagonist is REALLY REALLY easy to see coming before it happens as the show hand holds you as you pick up WAY TOO MANY clues that are too obvious. \
Even the smart character Armin (Who is the best character in the show) finds a clue that he explains later all velma style that gives it all away. BUT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES WHEN HE FINDS THE CLUE. It's drawn out, boring, and sometimes repetitive. There is one scene from the final episode that is awesome absolutely fantastic, and because it's a fighting show the final fight has to be huge! but it's forced, and really stale.  Because of the sudden drop in the second half I have to give Attack on Titan a 5/10. Because it's a 10/10 that becomes a 1/10 and I can't rate them seperately so it drags that first beautiful and highly spoiled season down. If you don't know anything about this show then just watch those first twelve episodes in awe. After that there is nothing to look forwards to. I will not be watching the second installment of this series because of this. \

    That's my first review, and most likely it will be the only. I'm not a native speaker so excuse me in advance. \
I'd like to say that I'm not spoiled by thousands of episodes of different anime series like some other hardcore anime fans. Many of us saw those people who like to showcase their unique tastes and tell us that we understand nothing and things we like are tasteless and lame compared to things they like.\
I'm not like those people, and here is my opinion on Shingeki no Kyojin. I prefer to consider genre of anime and rate it based on requirements for this\
          \
        particular genre.\
I was expecting to see some badass heroes to hunt and fight big monsters and kill them like a bosses. Characters should be cool and strong, plot is unnecessary, music and animation should be top-notch... But what I actually got is a really complex and deep anime with original setting, interesting characters, emotional drama and intriguing plot. Sure, nothing of this is absolutely unique, but still it got me hooked right from the beginning. It has a Fullmetal Alchemist's vibes in it and I really liked FMA.\
The story is interesting and has some unexpected and shocking twists. Some moments felt a bit slow and overloaded with talking, but the build up is worth it. Some people may call it predictable and simple, but I don't. It's good and I'm interested to see what will happen in season 2, untill then I can't give it a final rating.\
Art and animation looks very good, it's not the best I've seen but far from the worst as well. Even if there are some still frames and not very impressive CGI, overall it looked great and action sequences were awesome.\
Sound is simply gorgeous! Epic soundtrack which gives goosebumps and good, fitting voice actors.\
Characters are likable, at least for me they are. Some people will say that those are cliche characters for anime genre but I don't care, as I said - I'm not spoiled by watching hundreds of anime. There are all types of different people in this series, none of which made me hate them. Many of them has character development and it's good. The main characters are likable as well, they've got emotions, strong and weak sides, like normal people do.\
Enjoyment...what can I say, I enjoyed this anime a lot! All parts of this anime work together to make immersive, sometimes dramatic, sometimes funny, sometimes epic moments. I was captivated from the very beginning and felt whole spectre of different(good) emotions.\
Overall it's a great series with strong story, original setting, lots of different and interesting characters, filled with epic moments and great soundrack. Most of the people who watch it will actually like it, maybe not as much as I did, because I'm not as experienced, but still it's worthy to check. If you consider yourself an anime guru or otaku-God who only sees beautiful in some alien-brutal-philosophical-gay anime which only chosen ones will understand, move along it's not for you.\

    The first 5 episodes of this series were awesome as hell, but it quickly went downhill form there, the series slowed down a crazy amount and it almost became unbearable to watch. The story was mediocre at best it was really nothing original to be honest. My major problem with this series was the characters themselfs, Eren being your typical shonen main character, he really had nothing to him other than his hate for titans and that was it, Mikasa is the worst in the entire series, she had no reason to overly obessed with Eren other that he killed a guy with a broom-knife\
          \
        and saved her life but thats really it. There was no reason why Mikasa was so op in series there was no transistion from her being normal to being able to take on 20 titans while a person from the Jaeger corps that had alot more years training gets killed by 1 titan.\
Every series has problems but a series with that many problems gets praised for being the holy gail of anime isnt right in my own opinion the is really just a mediocre anime nothing really more to it \

      Can you spell OVERRATED? Because after watching and reading this mess of a series, that's all i can come up with as to how it is so popular.\
  Don't be deceived by it's art direction or the booming opening. This series in no way deserves the praise it gets as \"The next great anime, of this generation.\". The story has a bit of a mystery in the beginning, in a veiled attempt to hook it's audience into sticking around. This mystery however gets dragged out with a pay off that falls into the realm of \"IS THAT IT!!!\" levels of stupid (when\
          \
        you finally figure it out). \
  As for the characters, well they are practically nonexistent. Every one of them falls as flat as the paper in which they were conceived, and never get any better. I often even found it hard to remember who the hell was who. Don't go getting attached either, because this show/manga, has a nasty little twist. People get eaten, yep eaten. That's all well and good I guess. However the \"gore\" and \"shock value\" as so blatant, and misused that after the first few losses you are completely over it, you may even forget that the characters in question were ever a part of the story to begin with. Seeing as they aren't around long enough to care, and are flat and unlikable.\
  In conclusion I can't imagine why this series has risen to the ranks it has, other than it being a lot of young kids first \"real anime\". In the end however it just failed to be anything better than a sub-par mess, with no substance from start to finish. Attack on Titan is a waste of your time.",

    I'd like start by saying that i have not read the manga for this series and i don't plan on doing so since i'd like to experience attack on titan in its best possible form. \
Story\
This anime has a very interesting story filled with plot twists and cliff hanger endings in each episode that makes you want to continue watching with some scenes having you at the edge of your seat. The only weakness i saw in the story was that the anime did not dwell more into the characters backgrounds like you would see in other anime. They could have done this to extend\
          \
        the amount of episodes for the season but i think this might have been done intentionally since we know that most of the characters featured in the series did not come from a bed of rose but instead had very tragic pasts. So i think a decision was made to leave out those parts in order to make the series more pleasant to watch.\
Art\
When i first saw the trailer for this series, i could not believe the level of detail the artist went through to bring the titans to life and making it comparable to that of high budget movies. The art and animation guys who worked on this seems to know what they were doing by using various techniques such as slow motion, still shots etc to prevent this from going over budget. These techniques were cleverly done to ensure that the visual fidelity was maintained throughout the each episode as well as to create a serious and epic atmosphere for the series.\
Sound\
The soundtrack is one that many forms of media takes for granted where many would just add one for the sake of having something playing in the background but I am glad the anime team for attack of titan did not take this approach. The soundtrack used in this series was outstanding. Each track was played at the right time time to enhance the atmosphere that was being portrayed on screen. The voice acting was great as many might expect from most anime nowadays with good dialogue to match.\
Characters\
Each character has a unique personality which sets them apart from each other with some being more likable than others but that's to be expected since there is so much diversity here, you can't be expected to like everybody. I don't want to spoil anything so i won't go any further into what sets each character apart and how they develop throughout the series.\
Enjoyment and Conclusion\
When all of the above categories comes together, it creates one of the best anime series of all time. This is my personal favorite anime series of the year and it's sad to see that it is now the end of the first season. I just hope the second season is not too far away and it uses the same team the first season did. Overall, This is a must watch for anybody who enjoys watching action anime and also a good recommendation for those who are just starting to watch anime(given that they are at the appropriate age of course)\

    Shingeki no kyojin is one if not the best anime/manga ever, its plot,\
music, characters, intense political matters, and action make it a must\
see, and i believe every person should see it. I'm serious when I say\
do not trust anyone who rate this poorly, I'll explain why: \
Negative reviews say: \"it has too much dialog, most of the time they're talking\"\
The dialog part of the episodes help setting the plot, to me they are\
important if not the most important ones, they help you understand,\
they reveal crucial plot matters, maybe you can't notice that on the\
moment but in future episodes you'll comprehend the point why \"the\
talking\" matters.\
          \
I've seen some other reviews saying: \"its too slow\", the pace on the anime may seem slow at times (they're referring to the \"talking episodes\" I guess) but only to people who want to know everything on the first episodes, that is NOT how good series work, Isayama created this series on a way that only gives you little information at the time, that helps building the tension, maintaining the mystery at all times, makes you create theories to explain why things happened the way they did or what will happen on the future episodes, and also, its because the anime can't solve everything on 25 episodes because the manga hasn't ended yet, trying to adapt the whole story, giving it an original -just anime- ending would ruin everything, as it happened on akame ga kill for example..\
Now that i've explained how the anime really works i'll give my opinion on the series.. \
Shingeki no kyojin is a superbly animated adaptation of the manga, that I read every month, with awesome visuals, mostly on the battles -it's amazing to see the three-dimensional maneuver gear on action- every sequence with the 3dmg is so beautifully animated it exceeded my expectations. \
Shingeki no kyojin helps you feel inside the story, that may be because of the amazing ost of the series by Hiroyuki Sawano, but mostly I think its because every character on shingeki no kyojin is so human, even the strongest show their emotions at times on the series, that makes them really believable and easy to love, its easy to feel what they feel, when they feel anger so do you, when they cry you cry together, when they feel despair also do you, with every episode you'll get even more doubts about the titans as well as the characters or their past, and Isayama never gives full answers, at least not all at the same time, so it always leaves you interested, wanting to know, its an anime where you'll never know what will happen next.\
I highly recommend it as well as the manga. I gave it a 10\
because there's nothing higher.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is a sobering story that begins with humanity (seemingly) pushed to the brink of extinction. This show has massive action and morbid death appeal, but it is also very dramatic and shows the impact of such an environment in its characters, and their desperate struggle to survive.\
Story: 7/10\
The story follows the military force made to combat gigantic humanoids known as Titans, whose sole objective seems to be devouring every human in sight. Next to nothing is known about these Titans, and without revealing too much (or too little), this series demands a sequel. \
Art: 5/10\
The art in this show really makes you\
          \
        wonder how quality like this still occurs to this day. This art will satisfyingly portray a human body being obliterated in many different ways, but otherwise it completely disrupts or simply removes any tone or mood from the show.\
Sound: 7/10\
The sound effects in this show are good as far as the horror genre goes. Expect to hear human bodies being crushed, blood splattering, people freaking out, and stereotypical dramatic music.\
Character: 6/10\
The characters in this show struggle to stand out from one another. As a body is hurled into a tree or has its head plucked off like a grape, you wonder if that character wasn't important just a moment ago. Oh well, moving on.\
Enjoyment: 8/10\
This show is for people who love action, combined with terrifying enemies (in concept anyway) who constantly eat everyone, for no apparent reason. If plot is secondary to violence and emotion, then this show is perfect for you. \
Overall: 7/10\
It's difficult to judge this show without a sequel to follow it up with. The action is good, and the story is adequate and actually somewhat surprising towards the end. What kills this show is the forgettable characters. They're all too depressed, too detached to make me feel a connection with any of them. This show was a cheap laugh at horses being punted into orbit, but that's about it.\

STORY: 10/10\
The story is based on humanity having dwindled down to a very small number within huge walls, trying to co-exist with \"titans\" that will try to eat them alive or just chew them up and terrorize them.   The story is about three characters Eren, Armin and Mikasa and their trials and triumphs in a world where they are at a serious disadvantage.   Eren is a determined youth, who wants to take down all of the titans, but doesn't have  the ability to control himself to be able to do that, but he'll never quit.  Armin is what I\
          \
        consider the \"peaceful diplomat\" of the group, he's not violent and he doesn't like fighting but he uses his sheer guts, wits and passion to get the point across, but some people don't like him and view him as a weak character.  Mikasa is a character with a big heart that is overshadowed by her still emotions, making her one of the best fighters in the whole series, her hardships make her a great candidate for fighting. \
The plot continues and it's left with a cliff hanger that makes you want to reach out for more and more, you just want every part of this anime to show you everything.   The way the anime touches on certain political and difficult issues makes me want to see it every week.   \
You can count on some major development with the three characters, seeing how people would act in a real dire situation and how the issues of having not enough room for too many humans would go.    The titans themselves are just terrifying to look at.\
Art: 7/10\
I like the art, I love the fighting scenes I love how bright and crisp the animation is but I do not like how it has a 'gone over with a sharpy marker' look to it.  The titans don't have this problem, only the human characters.  That probably should go, it's really obnoxious and very noticeable, it looks like they messed up trying to be america or something...lol..\
The titans are awesome to look at, there are so many different styles and their smiling or crazy faces just makes you feel terror in your chest if you were to see that.   If you were to see a gigantic titan walking in your direction with a marred smile, you'd run knowing you'd probably get killed by it.  \
The backgrounds look so fresh, like they are real places.  When you see the wind moving the grass around, you kind of wish you could take in the breeze yourself. y'know?\
Sound: 10/10\
I can't say anything bad about the music, it's spot on and always fits the moment.\
Character: 8/10\
Eren, Mikasa and Armin are the only characters that you should be allowed to get attached to in this series.   You must know before going intio it that your favourite supporting might die or get killed in action.    When you know that, you can accept that their development will be minor because they might die, but they'll die valantly, crappy or just get eaten in general.   You might feel something or nothing because there is so much violence happening at the moment that you cannot process why these supporting cast characters died when there is SO MUCH going on at one moment.\
The anime puts you in the shoes of the three main, if you get attached to those characters specifically? You can somehow get the emotion that they are feeling at the moment in time, whether it be sadness or shock or anger.\
If it's about Eren, you feel what Eren feels at the time and etc.\
The supporting cast is important and infallible, but you can't hold a gamble on if they'll die next week or not, lol.  My one favourite sub characters hasn't died yet, so I'm surprised.\
The titans don't seem to have a personality, they are just creepy and scary and terrifying to look at.  The ones that are different or seem more threatening are much more scarier than the other ones.\
\
Enjoyment: 10/10\
I enjoy catching up with this anime every week, I enjoy the plot devices and I'm curious about what will happen.  I'm interested in the politics of it too, which is weird.   I like seeing the more 'elite' characters coming out now that there are only 8 episodes left.\
OVERALL:  9/10\
There are a few things it lacks, but considering circumstances, it's still pretty awesome.   It could do better if the sharpy mark look was gone, if they didn't kill off so many characters every week so you can't get to know the supporting and if they told more about the inner wall politics and how they live much more.   \
The story is solid and even though people are giving it a 4 or 5 here and there, they just don't see it how most of us do.  I wouldn't give it a 10 because the art style is so weird that I'm constantly looking at it and cannot look it over.\

    So, I've given Shingeki No Kyojin an overall rating of 8/10, but what does this mean? Given that on a scale of 1-10, where 5 is 'average', it means that Shingeki No Kyojin is a great anime which is let down by a couple of factors. Bear in mind that this review will end up being mostly subjective (so you may disagree with parts of it entirely), but I will attempt to give an objective view where possible.\
I do not feel it appropriate to go into a detailed breakdown of each aspect of the show (story, art etc) at this point in time, but they\
          \
        will be mentioned throughout this short review. I have not included a description of the story itself, as that's in the synopsis.\
Let's talk about the good points; the story, although by no means completely original, is fantastic. The lore of the world is well thought out, and it accurately portrays the desperation of the human race on the brink of extinction with sub-themes such as internal strife and the problems which arise as a result of the lack of habitable land. The sound is fantastic throughout, from the amazing opening song of the first 13 episodes to the music used for dramatic effect through the course of the show, the sounds never fail to make the show feel anything less than epic. The animation is nothing short of amazing in some scenes (including the opening), although there are a few still shots during dialogue-heavy scenes for what I assume are budgeting purposes. The anime is extremely enjoyable throughout, and always keeps the watcher gripped.\
Now to the bad points. There are two main reasons this anime deserves an 8 rather than a 9 or 10 so far in my opinion; firstly the lack of significant character development of the main character, Eren (beyond the first episode at least). Although the major and minor side characters are all different and well written, I feel that something is missing in terms of Eren's character development. More importantly though, in my opinion, is how slowly the story progresses at times. Being a reader of the manga, it seems obvious that they are trying to squeeze as much anime out of as little manga as possible, which in turn causes the overall flow of the anime to suffer a little.\
To summarise, the good points heavily outweigh the bad points in this anime. I feel inclined to say that the show is by no means perfect, but is let down by a couple of small problems (which is why it isn't up in the 9's and 10's in my ratings). Although I've given it a review rating of 8/10 (which some may consider low), I would recommend giving this show a try to fans of just about any genre of anime.\
Thank you for taking the time to read this review.\

    Story 8/10 \
Shows and books that use a struggle for survival as its theme often tend to be very good. This was the case with this show. The story did take a very unexpected turn which completely changed the feel of the show (well it did for me anyways). In some ways this made the show more interesting but it was a bit of a letdown for me. \
Art 7/10 \
Took me a few episodes to get used to the art style in this show, personally I thought some of the characters looked terrible and most of the titans did too \

The first\
          \
        opening for this anime was amazing, the second opening was not as good but it was still enjoyable and both suited the feel of the show\
Character 7/10 \
The main characters all had their backgrounds explained to some degree but we only saw decent character development from two of the characters in the show (Armin and Jean). I have heard people say Eren had good character development but I believe falling into an endless spiral of hate can't be classified as \"good character development\" \
Overall 8/10\
Attack on Titan is a great show but I do believe it is a little over-rated. Two of the main characters had terrible character development (Eren and Mikasa) which I hope will change in the second season. However the story of this show will keep you watching and telling yourself \"only 1 more episode before I go to sleep\" over and over again.",

    If you haven't already seen my profile, then one of my favourite anime series is Shingeki no Kyojin. If I remeber correctly, it was third on my list. I also want to warn you that this is a fangirl review and I am not responsible for any broken laptops, computers and mobile devices. \
Story:\
At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much of a story to Attack on Titan other than killing Titans. But as I watched further into the series, it was a lot more than that. A whole lot more. It showed what was really went on behind the scenes of the military.\
          \
        The story was also very captivating. It seemed to put you its mouth, chew you and eventually spit you out. I also found the Titans and the theme of isolation (behind the walls) very interesting because on of the branches of the military, the Survey Corps, goes out beyond the walls. And there's something else that could help humanity, but could also brutally destroy it as well. Don't be deceived at the first glance of the premise, because it's a whole lot more than you even think. Hell, I even thought that this was just about fighting these humanoid creatures at first glance. It was so much more than just that. I contained a lot of dialogue which I really liked. It could be really sad and tragic at times. There are also a few comedic scenes with Sasha Braus 'Potato Girl' which I thought was excellent as well. \
Art and Sound: \
The art was stunning! Everything was really well drawn and the character designs were also very nice. Even the cities and walls looked realistic and I just wanted to go outside as soon as I'd finished this and look at how beautiful nature really is. I also really liked the animation for when the characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop at high speed with these really long swords! Wow! It really made me want to try this myself one day. The OSTs were REALLY FREAKING AWESOME. Just freaking awesome. They made you want to go out and kill the Titans it was so good! After I watched the anime, I decided to go out and download BOTH of the openings they were so great. \
Character:\
I don't think that I have seen such unique characters before because they don't really fit into any set archetypes. We have our determined and very loyal characters. And we also have characters that maybe the viewers could relate to a lot more than others. We also have our 'strange' characters who (really) like to clean and who is scarily obsessed with Titans. We also have our funny characters who really made me laugh sometimes. All our characters have some sort of development or growth. I think that three of them are in my favourite character list. \
Enjoyment:\
I enjoyed this to the FREAKING max. Hell, I enjoyed so much that I bought it on DVD when it was released. I've been telling my friends to go out and watch this just because I want them to know how awesome this show is! Currently I've been collecting the manga so I can read it soon. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime adaptation of the manga written by Hajime Isayama. The story follows Eren Yaeger, a boy that wants to join the fight against the Titans that hold him and the rest of the human race within the confides of three walls. \
Now, this review comes from an amateur anime fan who is gradually progressing to be an anime fanatic. And this is definitely the series that spurred me into doing so. TV bores me nowadays and I rarely find myself compelled to keep watching, and HOLY CRAP I have never been so excited to watch the next episode of something\
          \
        before. It certainly didn't help though that I watched this with a group of my friends and we were restricted to watch 3-4 episodes each week. So when the last episode finished and the plot took a major turn we all exclaimed our shock and went the rest of the week talking about what we hoped happened next.\
Plot - 8.5/10 - Getting into the story, I don't know exactly if there is anything similar to this anime, be it in genre or a similar show all together, but wow this idea seems super original and creative. It also caters to many different aspects and the story line develops superbly. As I said earlier, I have never been so compelled to keep watching something. The anime staff did a wonderful job of capturing the twists and turns that the manga offers, and even the fillers fit into the plot and made sense. There were a couple parts that I personally felt were predictable or could've been done a different way so that's why I feel an 8.5 is a good score.\
Art - 8.5/10 - Wow. Just wow. The characters aren't particularly well drawn, in my opinion, but everything else is gorgeous. Especially the scenes involving the 3D manuevering. It's truly beautiful, but maybe I rate it so highly because I don't have a big means of comparison.\
Sound - 9/10 - When I think of sound I think music, so when the opening theme is Guren no Yumia (Opening 1), I can't help but be blown away. It paired with the opening scenes was honestly incredible. Then the music played during the episodes fit perfectly as well. The other side of sound regards the sound of objects and what not, which I must say, was also brilliant. The 3DMD, the Titans, uhhhh, eeverything was amazing. \
Characters - 8/10 - Each character got their due, each character fit the plot, almost every character got first season development. What more to want? Need a show with gender equality? You got that too. The only negative was that I don't particualrly like some characters, so the lower score has to do with personal opinion.\
Overall - 9/10 - I'm not an anime conossieur in any regard, but I bet for as many animes as I plan to watch, this one will always be one of the best ones out there. It picks you up, eats you, and holds you in its stomach until you are finished with it (Titan reference). If you haven't watched it, do it. Though I bet you already have, because everyone talks about it, and deseverdly so.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin starts on the premise of mankind being on the brink of destruction from titans. From there, it focuses on the main characters ambition in destroying all the titans. From the above it would seem like your pretty average anime but for multiple reasons it's plain amazing.\
Attack on Titan literally has the best music soundtrack i have heard in an anime. If i could rate the music above a 10 i wouldn't hesitate. Every single piece is amazing an appropriate. The above also goes for the art, the animations, especially when they are using the 3D gear is plain bad ass.\
As far as\
          \
        the store goes, the reason it's so good is because it takes a very mature stance on everything. It doesn't sugar things like most anime. When people die, they die painfully and in regret. The expressionistic aspect of this anime is what makes it a 10 for me. In no other anime have i seen emotions expressed so perfectly. Sure ther are definitely characters in other anime that are like this, but Attack on Titan is the only anime in which every character is living and breathing. Never before have i felt emotion when your average grunt gets killed.Yet this show makes you care for every single soilder that gets stomped on by a Titan. Despite being only 12 episodes in, i would recommend this anime to nearly anyone and give it a straight 10. \

    Okay, okay, I'd like to point out that this is my first review of an anime and I generally think highly of everything, and therefore can't see the bad things that are so obvious to others.\
Um, story wise I think they did a great job. The underlying story idea seems rather basic to me \"some monster/alien/enemy is attacking human kind and they have to fight back and save the world\". I find it a bit cliche (mind you I'm doing the same thing in a story I'm writing... heh...). But they way the story is presented just... works. Even though it's a simple idea, they\
          \
        layer things on top and it comes out so wonderful that you can't help but love it, that is, unless you don't like that sort of thing, which is fine too.\
Art! Ohmygosh! It's fabulous! I've watched other anime... well, only a few, but the animation is very smooth in SnK. The way they draw the characters looks prety acurate to me, but you are free to think for yourself.\
I recall reading that some people are put-off by the black outline around the characters, but I honestly didn't notice it until they said something. I guess that sort of thing doesn't bother me. \
The only thing I don't like is that there are a lot of still images used. I wouldn't mind so much if it was only a few, but sometimes people talk over pictures that move slightly across the screen. Geh, I'm not sure how to explain properly.... It's like a slide show sort of, as if they were too lazy to animate what's in the image or something.\
Eh.. the sound is pretty good, however it's not something I really think about. I don't even know how to review it. \
I was really pleased with the characters in SnK. They all seem to have individual personalities that work perfectly for them. I'm also happy that there aren't any stupidly cliche busty girls or overly muscular boys. It just seems that everyone has a figure appropriate to their personailty and the training/work they do. \
Mikasa.... as much as I like her I don't. She just seems crazy overpowered and even though that's pretty cool, it seems a bit too much. If she just rushes in and saves everyone then how can we see them grow? Those times when she doesn't rush in are great though, as you can watch other people fix their own problems in interesting ways.\
Eren is my favorite character by far (because I always fall for the lead male... sigh). Mind you, when they were training to use the 3D manuver gear, I would have prefered if he struggled a bit more, and not just because of faulty equiptment. If everything is easy then you can't watch them struggle to grow! *pouts* But whatever, at least he isn't as super perfect as Mikasa.\
I absolutly love this anime! And, I'm ashamed to say, so much that I went back on my promise not to read the manga until the anime was over and caved in. No spoilers though!\
Everything about it screams \"watch me! you'll love me!\" and I do. It makes you want to know how everything works out, how problems are solved and if they will all survive. \
Over all I give it a 10/10 just because it has me hooked completely. Even though there are flaws I'm willing to over look them because they rest is so compelling. \
\
Just watch Shingeki no Kyojin for yourself and see what you like about it. Good luck and enjoy :D\

    Many people are totally fascinated by this anime. Many anime fans started to watch this anime and claim that this anime is the best one of 2013. Let me assure you that it is true. It is not that I started to watch this anime just because many anime fans did. I alway chose anime carefully. Don't wanna spend hours in front of the screen because of a meaningless trash.\
I appreciate when in anime are some things to think about. Something serious like a hidden thoughts on the background. \
I haven't finished this anime (16 episodes out right now) nor do I read manga. (I\
          \
        am anime only fan actually) However this anime is totally astonishing. The mysterious background and the whole story about ancient race of titans fighting endless war with humans. It is amazing idea and I am so excited to find out what will happen in the next episode. Every episode has some epic scenes and important things for the plot. It seems it is not gonna be another never-ending anime like Naruto or Fairy Tale (I am Naruto fan by the way). \
***Just a moment please, have to replay the Shingeki no Kyojin opening song...***\
The animation is a bit different from other anime series. It took me some time to get used to it but I like it now. Action scenes an beautiful. Characters are very well made. I like especially the fact that this anime very often focuses to inner feelings and thoughts of the main characters and even of ordinary soldiers around. \
Also one important thing I have to mention. This is the first anime I have ever seen where both openings are like pure epicness itself. Yea there are some anime with good openings but I think Shingeki no Kyojin has the best ones I have ever seen. And not only the first one. The first one was epic and I really don't know, trust me I have no idea how the hell did they manage to make the second one even more epic and brought in there even more awesomeness.  \
This anime is the proof that even new anime could be very fine and valuable. This anime can compete with all the old anime legends. ",

    To those who rate this less than a 9: You're watching the show but you're not actually seeing it.\
This show is absolutely phenomenal because it's so real and relevant. Hands down the best anime I've ever seen. The characters aren't perfect: they're human. They get scared, sometimes their fear clouds their logic and they act frustratingly irrational, and no they don't always make the right decisions. Plans don't always work as you wanted them to and sometimes people die because someone didn't make the right choice despite the fact that they tried their best. Just like in real life there are situations were there isn't\
          \
        even a good option and but the characters are forced to make one regardless. The show mimic's the same unbiased cruelty that we see in everyday life. SNK doesn't just kill off random background grunts. The characters that die here have names attached to their faces and are people with family and friends just like the main cast. The fact that SNK forces to you associate a name with a face makes their deaths hit you harder because you realize how in reality death shows no discretion and anyone can die at any given time. Everyone's life is game. \
\
This anime is also really relevant to modern day politics. You can see the whole 99% v.s. the 1% dilemma here. I'm paraphrasing the show here but one quote by Commander Pixis goes \"The titans will be the instrument to [humanity's] demise not the cause\". The show/manga often points out that humanity will be the reason for it's own demise and hints this largely due to  political corruption. \
POTENTIAL SPOILER: Eren points out in his trial (to those with political influence i.e. the rich and military authorities) that everyone is so interested in pushing their own selfish agenda that they are blind to what's at hand. We see this same dilemma today in various aspects of politics. Large corporations pay off politicians to create legislation in their favor even though it jeopardizes the rest of population's well-being and sometimes the world itself (as can be seen with the global warming issue). \
It might not be so obvious in the first season (if you haven't read the manga) but the second season of SNK will DEFINITELY make this more obvious. I can go on and on about why SNK is amazing but I don't want to actually type it all out. Don't just take my word for it. Analyze the show and see how awesome it is for yourself. It's critically acclaimed for a reason. ",

    Mankind's extinction or extermination has been a thing for a while in all of the Sci-fi genre. The adrenaline of finding a way to escape or even face the threat to survive and prevale is what keeps us in a tension state, and you can only see yourself in that situation: \"What would I even do if I was there?\".\
Shingeki no Kyojin inmerses in a world where humans are close to extinction, and they are forced to be confined within walls. These walls protect them from their biggest threat: The Titans.\
The show's main hook is its pace, throwing at you lots of shock factor elements\
          \
        at the beginning, and brings exposition and exploration of its own world, ideas and mythology at the right moment. \
The anime also holds a very high production value. Its music and animation are some of the reasons why this anime is so popular. \

    I watched Shingeki No Kyojin during the summer, because I kept seeing it while browsing the internet and wanted to find out for myself just how awesome this anime was. I certainly wasn't prepared for the thrill and emotional suspense I experienced along with the characters. This anime, apart form the whole Titan thing, is so realistic and so raw at times that it grips you so hard and doesn't let go until you get absorbed in its world. Some may say the story is a bit cliche or that sometimes it is a bit serious, but for me it is definitely one of the\
          \
        bast anime I have ever watched.\
Story 9/10\
People claim that the story is not very original, as the protagonist is a teenage boy who experiences severe emotional trauma by losing one parent and then sets as his life's purpose to avenge the death of his loved one by destroying whichever caused it. He then sets on a physical and spiritual journey in order to prepare himself along with his loyal friends. Although Shingeki No Kyojin may follow this pattern, the characters have so much more depth. Eren, after having watched his mother been devoured by Titans, vows to eliminate all of them from the face of the earth. Along with his two best friends, Mikasa and Armin, he joins the military in order to train himself. However, as the story progresses, more and more questions are raised and we come to doubt even the most basic things that we know. What happened to Eren's father? Why do the Titans keep eating people even if they don't need them to survive and digest them? What the hell is in that basement? The situation is constantly changing and you find yourself glued to the screen to find answers!\
Art 9/10\
The animation is one of the best I have seen so far. The way the characters move when using 3D maneuvre gear is breathtaking. It feels as if you're watching it in 3d and you're with them when they set off to fight the Titans. Moreover, each character has his own characteristics, as they all originally came from different countries. The details of their faces also have distinguishable differences, such as the shape of the eyes. \
Sound 9/10\
The opening of this anime is perfectly fitted to the whole atmosphere. It is so epic that it runs through your body and prepares you for what you are about to experience. The German also help you get in the right mood and keep the connection with Eren's ancestry. The second opening is also epic and makes you want to put on your gear and join the Recon Corps to fight Titans too. \
Characters 10/10\
The thing that amazes me most about his anime though is the characters. They have so much depth. Firstly, the anime doesn't focus only on Eren, but also follows the story of his friends, Mikasa and Armin. They also have backstories and they have an impact on Eren's choices and behaviour. Furthermore, we also meet several other characters who interact with the protagonists and we learn about their backgrounds, their hopes and dreams, as well as the way they act during the battles and attacks from Titans. Each and every one of them has a different way to deal with grief, loss and desperation and their actions play a significant role in the story. We are not limited to one point of view, but we get to learn more about everyone in the anime, not only as soldiers, but also as children. They are not afraid to show emotion, they panic, they fear death, they show that they are humans. How would we react of we were in that universe? I don't think we would act much differently and that's what amazes me. The creators have managed to convey that humane aspect to their characters so well that we empathise with them and feel their pain. Everyone is likely to die and is not guaranteed survival because if his/her role so far. The deaths in this anime happen so fast that sometimes we don't really get what happened. Even the strongest ones get killed or injured. There are no epic deaths or sacrifices. Death is not beautiful. It is cruel and that is the way it is portrayed in the anime. \
Enjoyment 10/10\
Shingeki No Kyojin will definitely glue you to the screen and you will not rest until you finish it. The animation, the story and the battles will leave you breathless. The most amazing aspect of this anime is that there are no guarantees. When a battle takes place, it is not at all sure that the characters will survive or that they will come out intact. There is no pattern in the way this anime progresses and that will sure keep you pumped and excited. \
Overall 9/10\
I highly recommend this anime to everyone. I believe it will be discussed for many years to come and the end will steal our breaths away. So if you haven't watched it yet or are contemplating it, go watch it. Seriously, do it. You won't regret it.\

The story, from what i can tell so far, really does deserve 10/10. It is unexpected, especially the latest episode, you can find out yourself but watching it. \
The art, is amazing, the detail of the death of people, usually i hate stuff like this but i genuinely love it. \

For the Ultimate Experience of BLOOD, TITANS, POTATOES AND THE BATTLE FOR HUMANITY'S SURVIVAL. AND ALSO, GET READY TO SING THE FIRST OPENING EVERYWHERE YOU GO! YES, EVERYWHERE!\
*SIE SIN DAS ESSEN UND WIR SIND DER JAGER*\
Attack on Titan. When it first came out I was just starting to explore the anime world. I remember that everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, was talking about that show. No matter where I went, It would be there. It came in many forms: Ads, Top 1 in the \"most popular\" list, a girl from school humming to the theme song. There was just no escaping it! So,\
          \
        I sat down, finished SAO, and began Attack on Titan. After the first episode ended, I was just left there, still as a statue, wondering:\
\"Why on Earth did I wait till now to watch this. This is a freaking Gem!\"\
And then I watched 7 more episodes in a day. Yeah, the shop ended quickly for me.\
THE PLOT: Humanity is threatened by huge humanoid creatures called titans. The scenario itself is very interesting. It's not your typical Zombie apocalypse, it's something different, something new! And I think that's very good for the anime.\
THE CHARACTERS: Eren, a young boy who, after a certain incident, wants to wipe titans of the face of the earth. Mikasa, the coolest character who often saves the main character out of his own stupid plans, and Armin, the strategist. The characters are not special in the anime, they are just some of thousands of people who suffered because of the titans. But because they are so \"ordinary\", their actions matter more.\
THE SOUNDTRACK: Asides from the opening, the soundtracks are very dynamic and they highlight the scenes more than you can imagine.\
THE ART: The art is truly outstanding. This show is soo well  animated! From a bloody scene, to Eren's eyes, everything is amazing.\
Overall, I think that there is a reason that this show is do popular. I highly recommend it.\

    What an epic anime!\
The plot is so original yet simplistic, I thought I heard it somewhere else. It turned out I haven't. At certain points I felt the anime had that Evangelion essence.\
What I liked:\
-The pace is simply perfect, and this is what I like the most about the anime; probably the best thing about it. Everything progress within a perfect tempo. I never felt bored at any time because I was watching useless content in the story progression or because the narrative was focusing too much on a character's drama (as most of the anime out there does, iugh).\
-It has the perfect portion of\
          \
        drama, action, character development, plot twists, etc. Every scene is there for a reason. The structure of the episodes is so well organized, even the episodes titles and the lore facts between scenes.\
-It hooks you. You can't blink an eye. Every dialog is so valuable, every epic scene is so intense...\
-The plot itself can be used as an analogy of certain aspects of the society.\
What I disliked:\
-Sometimes I had the feeling the animation were not so good or smooth enough.\

    Attack on titan is an anime about large genderless naked men running around cities eating people, breaking shit and being general dicks. \
The story follows Eren yeager; He lost someone he loved and now he's filled with more edge than a swimming pool filled with razor blades. If you could imagine shadow the hedgehog with swords instead of guns that's basically Eren.... \
Mikasa is amy, she's obsessed with protagonist to an unhealthy level. \
Then you have Armin who's just tails. his personality trait is that he's smart and admires the protagonist.\
\
Sure there's other characters in the show but considering how attack on titan derives great\
          \
        pleasure in introducing new characters and killing them off immediately after said characters are introduced means that there's not really a stable supporting cast. And though there are a few outstanding characters like Levi and and sadist doctor they hardly get any screen time.\
\
The story of season one pretty much revolves around Armin, Mikasa, Earen and friends/cannon fodder  trying to figure out who the female titan is despite the female titan's identity being painfully fucking obvious. Since the female titan resembles someone who the group has already meant....This \"Conflict\" is dragged out by several episodes.\
\
Despite its short comings in story telling and character development attack on titan is a truly phenomenal work of art with crispy  animation, brilliantly choreographed fights, and a depressive atmosphere filled with tension and danger.  Because of this I'm giving it a 7.\

    Let me start by saying Shingeki no Kyojin is one of my all time favorite anime & I will explain why\
Story 10/10 - Is it unique? Yes & No. No because the idea of humanity driven to extinction is not really anything special BUT the idea of WHAT is causing their extinction plus HOW they're defending against it accompanied by the later on WHY they are put in such a situation in the first place is super original. A simple idea can be a masterpiece with the perfect amount of execution & planning and AOT not only delivered that but it also adds a lot\
          \
        of original content as well. I've been watching anime/reading manga for as long as I can remember and even while watching AOT back when season 1 was released I was left speechless - simply because I couldn't predict what was going to happen. I was always left sitting at the edge of my seat after the end of every episode thinking of all the possible scenarios that can happen & every episode never seizes to surprise me. The story is gory & dark & all the brutal deaths are not just put in there for shock factor. Nope, not at all. It brings a sense of realism because your fav character can die just like that in such a cruel world. \
Animation 10/10 - The art style is very unique compare to a lot of typical animation style we normally see. From the thick black outlines to the gorgeous detailed pupils.. One thing I really have to praise is the consistency in the art. You can tell they spent a lot of time on each episode given the amount of detailed in artwork. It's simply gorgeous and the way the 3d maneuver gear is animated is eyegasm. \
Sound 10/10 - One thing I believe AOT is known for is the soundtrack. IT'S EPIC. The openings & endings are PERFECT. The background music is amazing during the important scenes, especially during the action scenes. It really pumps me up & I get super excited.\
Character 10/10 - Lets start with our 3 MC (mind, body, spirit)\
Eren Yeager: The spirit of the group - He is one of the most badass but not badass MC around. What I mean is the author takes an average MC and twist and turn him into someone we can all relate but not relate...ok let me further explain this before I confuse myself. Similar to a lot of shounen MC he is kind, brave, and he has one main purpose that drives him to become stronger. Different from a lot of MC he isn't that strong despite his hard work & he often lose in fights. I like that because if you think about it, just because you work really hard doesn't always guarantee success. He is someone with a lot of good qualities & also with a lot of flaws. I read a recommendation from someone who is obviously hating AOT for the sake of hating. How do I know that, because they stared the sentence with \"Eren is a coward..\" and if you even watched 30% of AOT you would know he is anything but a coward. His character does develop as the story progress & he does get stronger (both mentally & physically) \
Mikasa Ackerman - The body - One of my favorite character in the series. Unlike a lot of shounen where the guys are the strongest, she is one of the strongest character in the show (other than Levi). But like all characters in AOT, they have flaws. Although she is often very calm & rational, she lets her feeling take control when it comes to Eren. A lot of people does not like that about her, but she does develop a lot in the manga. Seeing her character development is really nice.\
Armin Arlert - & last but not least, the MIND. Armin character is great. He starts off really weak and fragile but he has one of the greatest & most imaginative mind in the story. He might not be strong physically but he offers great strategies & he is a huge asset to humanity. Throughout the anime/manga he is often faced with a huge problem and he usually* figures out a solution. One of his greatest flaw is that he doesn't have much confidence in himself. Even when he offers a solution it is always accompanied by something like \"i think\" \"it's just my speculation\". It's like a disclaimer just in case it doesn't turn out well lol. Unlike Mikasa who isnt afraid of dying because she's strong or Eren who isn't afraid of dying in general, Armin is. He takes the time to analyze the situation before taking any sort of action. Out of the three, I would say he has the most character development as the story progress. \
As for the rest of the characters, they're all great. What is great about AOT is theres a bunch of different personality & characters to choose from. We have CAPTAIN LEVI who is strong but a clean freak, SASHA the potato girl who has sharp intuition but simple minded, Hanji Zoe who is weird and energetic...etc. What I'm saying is you are bound to find a character you like because they are all so different but good luck because someone you like might end up dying a horrible death so try not to get too attached.  \
Enjoyment 10/10 - the only thing I didn't enjoy is waiting a whole month for a chapter & dying for a new season to be animated.\
OVERALL 10/10 - I have to say, a lot of people I see that gives AOT under 7 are usually (not all) haters. It's crazy how much this show get hated simply for being popular. I understand that everyone is different and we don't all share the same taste, but when they back if up with \"the plot is too generic\" \"the art is ugly\" \"the characters have too much flaws\" \"it's way too hype\" it really makes me face palm. \

Story was good. Titans was something different and very frightening. There was alot of unanswered questions, which makes the viewer think alot at the end and think about whats going to happen in the following season.\

Enjoyment 5- parts of this show were really badass and up beat.

But the badass parts were epic, but in my opinion not worth the watch. Epic parts don't outweigh the boring parts.\

Right?\
RIGHT?!?!?\
Ok, lets get on to it. So, shingekyee no kyeeojyeen is about a guy named eren who loses his mother to the titans, a bunch of naked human like creatures who want to eat humans for unknown reasons. He trains to become a soldier, to take out all titans! Also by his side is the completely useless armin, and the completely bada$$ mikasa. Yep. The plot is actually pretty deep but I don't wanna spoil anything\
\
The cast is\
          \
        big, but small (because most of it dies). Well, theres eren, the guy who wants to kill all titans to avenge his mother. He is clearly p!ssed off. Meanwhile, his 'sister' is by his side, and she is very op, but she does get development and is a great character. Then theres the useless armin, who develops the best, going from a weakling to a strong fighter. Hes gr8 too. Eren is an ok character I guess, if not a bit average. Besides that, the only other memorable characters in this anime are levi, the ultimate bada$$, Sasha (potato lady), the crazy titan scientist (forgot her name XD), the female titan and a bunch of warriors who I cant remember BECAUSE THEY\
If this anime excels at one thing, its the ridiculously amazing animation. The art looks AMAZING, extremely detailed and memorable. So you would think, with amazing art comes bad animation. NOPE. The animation is extremely fluid (especially during the action scenes), and rlly brings the show to life.\
But if the anime excels at another thing, its the amazing soundtrack. Rlly tho, its amazing. All I gotta say. Just search for the aot ost on youtube or something\
But yeah, aot is definetly worth a watch if you like action, a well written story, amazing animation, amazing ost, and pretty good characters.\
On the positive side:\
AMAZING ART AND ANIMATION\
AMAZING OST\
well written story\
pretty good characters\
On the negative side:\
There is a lot of dialogue (something I don't always like)\
Its not over (3 years of wait for a s2)\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, or Attack on Titan if you will, is a very good anime. Despite what many critics say, this anime really is in it's own class.\
Story-8: Shingeki no Kyojin has a pretty interesting story I'd say. I mean, naked giants eating humans that are on the borderline of extinction isn't original? Not to mention the crazy humans trying to fight said giants. Seems pretty legit to me. However, this anime isn't all fighting and being attacked by giants (though a good portion is), there certainly is a good emotion toll with each episode. From the characters' flash backs, to people dying, to the\
          \
        badass captain cleaning like a maniac, this anime really is great. As I have watched the entire series so far, I can easily say there were definitely a lot of plot twists and a lot of gore. \
Art-8: I would say the art in this is above average. I think the artists drew out the expressions of the characters and the setting superbly. Though, giant naked titans waddling around is certainly something different. \
Sound-8: I would say that the intro and outro music is top class. Once you've gotten hooked into the anime you can't stop singing. \
Character-6: The character development as of now, isn't great. I would say the only major character developments are during the beginning and towards the end of the season. Though the characters in general diverse greatly in personality and looks, which is rare to find now a days.\
Enjoyment-8: At first, I wasn't too interested in this anime, but as I kept going I really got into it. The story was very slow at first, but it went from zero to one hundred real quick.\
Overall-8: This anime is simply a classic. You will love the story, the characters, and the silly-looking titans. You must watch this!\

    There is no doubt in my mind that Attack on Titan is currently the best anime in production.  The reason for this?  Shingeki no Kyojin has more heart behind it, and it taps into some of the deepest human emotions.\
I am a huge fan of series that attribute the lead character's success to the relationships in their lives; it is a tried-and-true strategy to win over the audience, because so many of us can identify with characters who rely on their friends, family, or \"true love\" to inspire us and pull us through the toughest of times.  But this is not what\
          \
        Attack on Titan uses.\
Attack on Titan is about the human will to survive--no!  The human will to truly live.\
Eren gives face to the frustration and anger a person feels when confronted by their own powerlessness.  His single-mindedness in avenging mankind grabs your heart as his voice cries out that he will not be kept in a cage.  While he is initially obnoxious, you can appreciate his struggle to improve and willingness to sacrifice everything else for his mission.  (Meanwhile, you also get to enjoy the eye-candy fight sequences led by prodigy Mikasa and legendary General Levi.)\
But I don't want to deviate from my main point.  Eren captures the hero that all of us want to be.  Not necessarily the strongest, smartest, or \"best\" in any category--but the most dedicated to his cause.  The most unwilling to surrender.  The most inspiring, heart-wrenching, and energizing kind of hero.  This is what you find in Attack on Titan.  This is what captivates us.\
From a practical standpoint, I will state that AoT is gruesome, gory.  If you are repulsed (and you have every right to be repulsed), then I would be lying if I said it changes.  But the first two episodes do the rest of the series justice.  When recommending the show, I only require that the first 2 be watched--beyond that, they can drop it.  So I propose the same trial-run to anyone else considering this show.\

    Attack on Titan is definitely one of the most confusing shows for me out there. While I find the art and soundtrack stunning, I believe there are huge flaws with the way that the show is structured which prevent this show from having any depth. Do I recommend this show? Absolutely, as there is a lot to learn from this show while still being enjoyable. There are minor spoilers in this review, but if you really haven't seen season 1 in 2017, then you're practically asking for it.\
I would say the biggest issue with this show is not how \"overrated\" it is (I can understand\
          \
        why it is popular, the show is very entertaining), but rather how the show has no purpose. I know that the manga is much farther ahead than the show, but that's not what I'm reviewing. Throughout the show, you are amazed by the stunning combat and the mystery of the titans, almost forgetting that there is no purpose to the show besides survival and learning more about the titans (except that there is no base ground to learn about the titans from, as we don't even learn the origin; all you learn about the titans in season 1 is that some humans can transform into them). Survival isn't necessarily a bad objective or theme in a show either, as that is the premise of Mirai Nikki, but the difference between these shows is that the characters in Mirai Nikki have their own goals, while very few characters have goals in Attack on Titan.\
My opinion on some of the characters:\
Eren: the only one with an actual goal besides killing Titans (finding his Dad's basement of pr0n), however he does nothing to progress towards this goal throughout the show, only talks about how he's going to find it. It can be assumed that he also seeks revenge on the Titans after losing his loved ones, but pretty much every character has gone through that.\
Mikasa: Does nothing besides look cool and protect Eren's ass.\
Armin: I have no idea why he is even a part of this show. He's smart but has no talent in combat, unlike Hange who is smart and talented in combat.\
Levi: Does nothing besides look cool. Also he cleans\
Annie: Serves as a distraction from the fact that this show has no premise during the second half of the season. Pretty good distraction as she possibly acts as a catalyst for the rest of the show, but thats about it.\
None of the characters really show any change or development during the show, making them all very boring and uninteresting.\
Enough of me beating the hell out of the show though. I did enjoy a lot about the show. The soundtrack was amazing, making for some cool hair-on-end moments throughout the show (Eren's transformation in Episode 24) and so were the visuals. Combat was well animated, making the recon corps look like total badasses every time they did stuff. I definitely enjoy watching this show and will continue watching it until it ends, but it definitely has flaws (I do believe that the direction the show is going in during season 2 will change a lot in terms of purpose).\
I'll end my review with a nice analogy. Attack on Titan season 1 is like a small wind up toy that you let go, and while it's very entertaining to watch, by the time it's finished, you realize that nothing really happened besides the fact that it traveled some distance. But you better believe you're gonna do pick up that toy and wind it up again just to see where it ends up.\

    Defiantly incoherent in its ability to tell a story, this monstrous showboat is laden with nonsensical and unrealistic plot holes within even its own fantasy world. Carried by its strong initial premise and an enormous rearguard of aesthetic, this show does surmount its flaws, catalyzing a nonetheless enjoyable ride. A ride devoid of developed characters and consistent storytelling albeit, with its author clearly indicating a lack of forethought in all areas; evidenced by the grotesque abundance of unexplained time skips that are abused in retroactive reference for the purpose of unforeseen plot advancement. This common gimmick is used by writers incapable of chronicling a consistent\

This is probably not the same as it is for some people, as i have read the manga and can see a little bit into the future, but literally no one changes/matures over the course of the series, especially eren. Thus, there's a disconnect for me personally where I just cant identify with or care about anyone because as people they all kinda suck. However, the secrets and the world manage to hold the plot up,\
          \
        so overall i must give this a positive score\

    A world where Titans, giant humanlike creatures predating humans loom most of the land is driving mankind to the brink of extinction. You only have one choice: To fight. The only thing is, you are grossly at a disadvantage. You have the lack of knowledge against your enemies and the remaining population are surrounded by walls that cannot be destroyed by them. What will you do? Will you be satisfied and live life like caged animals? Or you fight? Fight for your freedom?\
That is the setting of the anime Shingeki no Kyojin or in English, Attack on Titan (I prefer to use Shingeki no Kyojin\
          \
        because in context, it doesn't translate to \"Attack on Titan.\")\
Is the story any good? Or is just plain b******t?\
I started to watch this anime from a recommendation from a classmate. I thought the story was nice and started to watch it. Guess what I found? A masterpiece with a very good story and as well as action scenes of battling Titans.\
The story centers around Eren Jaeger, a seemingly normal kid who lives with his mother, father, and his adopted sister, Mikasa Ackerman, along with their friend, Armin Arlert. They were living in peace inside a three-layered wall, named Wall Maria, Rose and Sina, free from Titan attack on the last century. Remember, they WERE living peacefully inside until a giant Titan, taller than the walls and an armored Titan broke a hole in Wall Maria and broke their hundred years of peace.\
As a result, the Titans who were waiting outside flooded in and started their killings. They ate most of the populace, including Carla Jaeger, Eren's mother. Because of that, Eren swore revenge against Titans, swearing to kill each and everyone of them, sparing no one.\
The story, from its expositions and its arcs proved to be totally great in terms of blending well with the theme and being just utterly fantastic. The events were well-articulated, well-planned and well-executed because of its dramas and the seldom comedic routines (there were some) even with the serious theme and the development of the story. Although it had a cliffhanger at the end, it was discussed in its second season four years later.\
Concerning about the art, I found it to be highly satisfying. The battle scenes perpetuated by the humans in order to gain freedom from Titans were great in terms of art. The character designs was also something to be very favorable. Eren's, Armin's, L**i's and not to mention the most pulchritudinous designs for Mikasa and Kr**ta were absolutely things I can't get enough of. Maybe I'm in love? No, that would be something not right. Maybe infatuation?\
The designs for Titans, however, I cannot understand why they were designed like that. No reproductive organs? Now that's a boring life for them. They have the faces of humans. Were they humans before? I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know. Although I liked the designs for the giant Titan and the armored one. \
The sound, the music, the OSTs and the themes were also great. The sounds perfectly portray the events happening within the episode and should be given attention. Once again, it makes me think about Nippon's music industry and the way they create music is too grand to be ignored. By the way, both the first and second openings made me learn a little bit about speaking German. Kampf means battle. Or so I think. Freund means friend. Or so I think.\
About the characters. Some of them shows quite a promise then dies the next episode. That's sad. Some is quite incompetent then survives the first season. Some of them seems strong then dies of a Titan attack. Some of them are ones you wouldn't want to die, but died. Quite disappointing. But even though that's that, plot armor never fails to show up. As long as someone has a heavy contribution to story, they won't die. Nevertheless, the protagonists and the side characters always make their way into my praises. Beautifully created artistic characteristics with their own personalities. To be honest, I liked Mikasa and Kr**ta the most.\
Then there's the action-packed enjoyment I suppose some of you had and will have. Constant battles against Titans  and dramas about fallen comrades also share the excitement you will feel from watching this anime. You can even say I thoroughly enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin so much I rated it 10.\
Overall, I would say that this was an another masterpiece created by the anime industry. If rating eleven was possible, I'd do it and I am serious. Great storyline with the perfect characters, also with great music and art with perfectly executed scenes to boot. I recommend you watchi this anime of you are a fan of action-packed scenes with lots of casualties and a little gore. Who knows? Maybe you'll like it.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan to us English speakers, is a rather outstanding anime that brings a new description to badassery. Though I do have to say it is very over hyped and overrated. That being said I still think it is an incredible anime that people should take the time to watch. I started out watching this anime without any prior knowledge of it other than the basic humans versus titans idea. As I was watching the series, I got anxious during each and every episode, it seemed anything could happen and from what I saw, anything could happen. There were a\
          \
        lot of turns and twists that I really wasn't expecting but was excited to see. The characters are very emotional and serious that makes them so endearing to watch. Eren Jaeger has a burning hatred for titans and has declared to everyone that he will kill them all, a statement which personally gave me chills. Mikasa Ackerman is Eren's foster sister and follows Eren wherever he goes and protects him the best she can. Armin Arlert is their childhood friend who follows them in their task of slaying all titans and rebuilding humanity. Along the way are more characters such as Levi(personal favorite and a lot of others favorite as well) and Annie, as well as others who join the military. The characters are passionate and fantastic to see, the action is pretty badass, the artwork is absolutely amazing, the music is some of my favorite, and the story is incredibly riveting and exciting. Definitely worth watching but don't give in to the hype, watch and judge it for yourself. I say before I thought it was over hyped but it's still a fantastic anime.\

even though I couldn't really make out what was going I during the more fast fighting scenes, it still looked awesome and I'm really looking forward to the second season.\
You get really pumped because of the amazing soundtrack.\

    Okay, if you want to see a series of the utmost strangeness this is it. A town or village is wrapped up like a cocoon behind a fifty meter wall made of strong cement and concrete. Outside of these walls are individuals who walk around naked one quarter of the height of these walls. What ever they are, they look humanoid, but with an appetite for human flesh. For the past 100 years, the walls have kept the village safe until one fateful day the secretive Titans as they are called appeared to break down the wall so that the walking demons could have their\
          \
        fill. And these titans are higher than the wall itself. Now a boy named Eren, vowed revenge against them for having his mother eaten by one of the demons in front of him while on the run with his friend Mikasa and Hanne. This horrible dream for which the people themselves feared had come true, a reality that not all walls can hold back an enemy no matter the size. Even water drops over a hundred years can break a wall. Now outside of the walls, Eren must become part of the military with very limited weapons to help their cause. But more often than not, the soldiers themselves cannot find out where or when these titans arrived to cause so much despair and terror. This series is not for the feint of heart, it contains a good amount of gore as well as horror scenes which will curl your hair. I have to say this is one for the books, I have seen all sorts of horror but this series looks very, very interesting. I would have to say anyone over eighteen can watch it. Under that age will give kids nightmares. One of the most original series to date. Highly recommended to those who like this genre. \

    Attack On Titan\
8/10\
Summary\
Attack On Titan takes place in a dystopian world where humans live in constant fear of having their city destroyed by 10 meter tall flesh eating humanoid creatures called “Titans”. \
The only human city introduced thus far has developed a military system used solely for protecting the city against titans. The protagonist, Eren Jaeger, has passionately and zealously strived to join the military division called the Scout Regiment that goes beyond the confines of the city to explore and eventually reclaim land that the titans have inhabited.\
In the midst of an attack by the titans, while Eren and the other soldiers are defending\
          \
        the city, Eren discovers that he has the ability to transform into a titan. However, there are a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, Eren has little control over how he behaves while in titan form and secondly, many civilians and high ranking military members believe that somehow, Eren is working against humanity and for the titans. Eventually, after much deliberation, Eren is allowed to join the scout regiment under strict surveillance by the captain to help hunt down the extra-powerful abnormal titans.\
Upsides\
Attack On Titan is a well done and unique anime. There is the expected large amount of heart pacing action, but there is also a good amount of psychological action which often gets overlooked or forgotten. The psychological action comes in the form of the military members endeavouring to figure out whether there are more people with the ability to transform into a titan, who they are, what their motives are and why they have their abilities.\
Downsides\
The downsides are scarce and mostly inconsequential in Attack On Titan. However little, there are still a couple. The first few episodes may leave some viewers underwhelmed and disinterested as they mainly consist of the city preparing for and defending against titan attacks. Nonetheless, the series takes a dramatic turn for the better when Eren realizes his power.\
The only other downside might be that almost everything Eren does is over dramatic. The author might have gone a bit overboard on Eren’s charismatic and over-zealous qualities. It often seems like everything he says is meant to inspire either the viewer or another character. He does not often succeed in inspiring the viewer and his constant attempts at it can become irritating. ",

    Shingeki no Kyojin. Where to start? For starters, i REALLY enjoyed this anime. I don't see how anyone can say that it has a bad story. It is very different from other animes in a good way that gets you pumped up and excited. This anime makes you feel like you could get up and win a boxing match.\
STORY\
The story is slowish to start in the first few episodes where they have to grow up of course and train/learn how to kill the titans but when it gets into it it really GETS INTO IT. Sure there are other animes with monsters running around eating\
          \
        or killing people but the titans are a whole new thing. Not to mention the creators have made a new world with even a historical story to back it up and the mystery of where the titans came from...\
ART\
Great animation. Full stop.\
SOUND\
Great soundtrack with an op that gets you ready to dive into the next episode. Love the voice actors and their ability to scream revenge at huge man-eating creatures.\
CHARACTER\
I personally love all of the characters. Sure their main character is sort of typical in his revenge/determined/kill those things attitude but Eren Jaeger's  a VERY determined/revenge/kill those things character.\
ENJOYMENT\
If you haven't seen this anime WATCH IT. If you have a 5 min break and are really bored just watch attack on titan and you will wish that it was a 20 min break.\
OVERALL\
I think it is a 9/10 but a 10 would seem like I am an attack on titan \"big fan\" (who knows? maybe I am...).\

    Story(6/10): Not much is explained in this season and the story is very straight forward. Its not bad, just nothing new. \
Art(10/10): The art is amazing, its very detailed and well made. One of the best parts of this show and the best animated anime from 2013 by far.\
Characters(6/10): You have your generic shounen main character who's hot blooded, not a bad character just over used. Then for supporting characters the two main ones are Armin and Mikasa. Mikasa is a good character and Armin has the best character development in the show compared to the others.\

Overall(8/10): One of the best anime from 2010-2015 and the animation still holds up 4 years later. A must watch for any anime fan.\

    In my opinion, I think Attack on Titan is an ok anime. The concept is interesting anime, but the story itself has a bit of holes. I think the art was pretty but it wasn't anything amazing. The soundtrack was AMAZING though. It has some pretty epic music. It makes you feel so cool when you listen to it. I gave the characters a 9 cause a little biasism (is that word?

    Note: I haven't read the manga nor do I know anything on what's going on on it. This review is purely based on this particular season.\
\
This is my first review.  \"It has a huge potential to be a masterpiece\"\
\"This is going to be AWESOME!!\" I was so SOLD with the plot and teasers that I've seen. I was so excited to watch the entire series!!  But.. I was not fully satisfied, and got a little disappointed. If you are a sucker  for amazing, well-executed, no plot holes series, and epic fight scenes.. It may leave you with the same feeling\
\
Story - 8/10\
The\
          \
        sound of the plot will make you excited, and make you visualize \"W-T-F moments\". but, that bleep moment did not happened because the story lack good use of STRATEGY. Their strategy is very basic, considering that titans circumstances has been happening for a decades.\
The fight scenes might be disappointing, they usually just focused on slicing the weak point of the titan - again, no more plan, just plain \"target the weak point\".\
They only have two equipment, and if that fails and no one can save them, its the end for them. Attacking has no plan b, nor even plan c. If they got caught, they got eaten. They should at least taught of something when a person was caught by a titan, like how would they escape if they got caught? they should have an equipment for this. like, even their clothes, shoes, anything their wearing could be used as a weapon.\
\
I find how the fight scenes was animated to be pretty disappointing. Majority of it is just a series of photos. It was repetitive, no improvements since they first fought a titan, absolutely lack brains and balls. Character development will be discussed in the Character part of this review.\
\
Another would be the gate, and the walls. Canons and 3D maneuver should not be the only option. They should at least provided traps so the titans could not easily go to the wall, or better yet, dug a deep hole surrounded by sharp things below so they'd fell and die - good bye wohoo lessen the casualties.\
\
The thing that really frustrates me was the lack of training. They were only trained before they choose on where to go. Learning should be continues, especially in the attack, defense, improving strategy, retreat plans.\
\
I did not see any improvements till the end of the series. Improvements for the attack, guarding the wall, strategy. The entire series, I just watched people got eaten by titans bc their game plan is basic.\
\
\
Art - 9/10\
I love the thick outline art, it's refreshing look on a shounen anime. the burst of blood, the looks of the unfortunate ones, the smoke, the effects, etc, it was all great\
\
But for the animation, I was waiting for the fight scenes, but most of the time it was just a series of pictures. An absolute, real bummer because this series calls for epic scenes\
\
\
Sound - 8/10\
Nothing bad to pinpoint. It fits the scenes and all, but there were no particular sound that I was crazy about\
\
\
Character 6/10\
Absolute NO character development. Mikasa suddenly just become awesome with fighting, like referred someone with superb talent with it, and other character skill remained the same all throughout the entire series. Whimps remained whimps. And the supposed \"brains\" and good for reasoning, is not actually that great and mind blowing.\
\
Admirable character? It has a fun mix of character with weird personality. Oh, wait.. I can only give 3 character with non-mediocre personalities. If I have to pick my favorite, that would be Corporal Levi he he he so cool Lol\
\
Enjoyment 8/10\
Despite the problems of the story, it was still an enjoyable series to watch. It has funny moments so it I survived to finish  25 episodes. But it was slow paced, that's why it become repetitive. It just showcased people getting eaten, slammed, people looked afraid with an added character at the end.\
\
I enjoyed it, but I was not min blown because I could have think of alternate ways to make it better. It is not bad, but it has work to do to become a masterpiece.\

    It is not often that I enjoy an anime so full of violence and blood. Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the few that captivated me from the onset, even though many scenes made me cringe (LOL).\
Story 9/10\
The story is one of domination, horror, betrayal and comradeship... all set in an alternate reality where titans kill men in the most gory manner (like they're insects), and men struggle to eliminate the titans.\
My jaw dropped at the opening scene and wondered what I'd gotten myself into as I don't have a good stomach for gore, but the creator was quick to bring me into the story\
          \
        of the main protagonists and as it progresses, the plot also deepens. Viewers are treated to a world full of mystery, schemes, betrayal and comradeships. \
Characters 7/10\
I gave a slightly lower rating for characters becos they die off too fast for me to really know them. Lots of characters are introduced and lots of them die off before you can count to 10. This is probably my only complaint.\
Art 10/10\
I absolutely love the art style and special effects of this anime. The drawings are way better than the manga version which often had me lost on who's who and what's happening. In addition, the action scenes are awesome and well executed. I'm sure many fan gals fall in love with Levi like I did. *wink*\
Sound 10/10\
Absolutely outstanding sound effect and I love all the opening songs. And the VA for Levi - I love his voice!\
Enjoyment 10/10\
Shingeki no Kyojin is one hell of an exhilarating ride for me based on various aspects - its story, art style, effects and sound - one that I am willing to stomach all the gore it encompasses just to be on this ride.\

    I'll be honest, I had SNK on my backlog for quite some time, and probably a good chance of it remaining on there for quite a while had not someone offered watching it together with me. I didn't know if I would really get into it as much as a lot (and I mean a LOT) of people have over the past year, and given how much I frequent tumblr where massive spoilers are essentially unavoidable, i was worried that there wouldn't be much to salvage for myself to figure out instead of the internet handing it out for me.\
The minute I saw the first\
          \
        episode though, I was hooked. What I planned on turning into 2 episodes a day quickly shifted into marathons of 8 episodes a day. When I tried to tell myself to stop and make absorbing all the information from the show easier, my curiosity at just what the hell would happen next got the better of me. I couldn't stop watching it, I couldn't prioritize any other shows I was watching concurrently because I was just so engulfed into it. It shocked me honestly; I never expected this show to be as engaging as it was. It fascinated me about the world of SNK, the characters living in it, the struggle they have to put up with every day of their lives (fighting titans or otherwise), the determination, fear, ingeniousness, sacrifice... all of it entranced me and made me feel like I was really there and that I could connect with all the characters. \
Story: 7\
The story is pretty well done with a pretty diverse cast of characters and welcoming setting, as well as a lot of plot twists that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. I won't exactly negate points for it ending somewhat on a cliffhanger, because for the most part it does the cliffhanger job well. The biggest problem though that I had with SNK is its pacing. The first few episodes were remarkable in keeping a very fast pace while at the same time not rushing it either, which is a really hard task to accomplish in any story. However by about the midway point I couldn't help but notice things slow down to a incredibly slow crawl and not much tending to happen in each episode. While it does try and get back to the original pace in the beginning after that, it felt way more rushed and hard to swallow all the info, and it switches back and forth between those two paces pretty much until the end; it's just jarring. The other major problem I have is character involvement throughout the show. There are plenty of characters who are given the spotlight for 2-3 or so episodes, and then are quickly forgotten about and have no relevance anymore to the story the episode right after. This is very noticeable especially at the last 3 episodes with one particular character (that I won't spoil), and while I can probably learn more about the character whenever the next season comes out, as of right now I could not connect at all with the them; their reasons, motivation, nothing. They made an appearance at the beginning for a bit and practically nothing else until the end; I had no idea what to think when they showed up again, and honestly I didn't care either. Because I never got the chance to really care about the character, because they got very little attention as a whole, I was thoroughly uninterested in them. With all that said, the amount of times that happens is pretty sparse, and most of the other characters do get plenty of air time to keep most people interested in them.\
I should also point this out even though it's really minor (and pretty infamous at this point unless you live under a rock), this show has a very bad tendency of swinging the tone around really fucking fast and just as fast returning to the previous mood it was at. Most of the time this seems to be used for comedy, but other times it can really just make a scene way more melodramatic than it honestly had to be.\
Art: 8\
I'm not really one to judge art styles in anime unless it's excruciatingly bad (giant bulbous alien eyes anyone?), and SNK is definitely a pretty looking piece of animation. Lots of well drawn scenery and pretty good character designs. No complaints really.\
Sound: 10\
I'd easily call the sound department the best part of SNK. The OP/ED's are insanely catchy and all of the music pieces played during the show capture the mood perfectly. The tense parts are tense, action parts are actiony, horror parts have a solemn note being played... it's some really good stuff here. \
Character: 8\
Generally lovable cast of characters that most people should find at least more than one person they especially admire. While I did mention earlier that I wish some characters weren't completely abandoned, most of them are still pretty memorable regardless.\
Enjoyment: 8\
There's not much to say that I haven't already said; it was very engaging and I enjoyed every episode that I watched. Definitely felt worth my time to start up and finish the show.\
Overall: 8\
SNK is one of those anime's that just does a marvelous job of appealing to a lot of people right from the get-go and staying incredibly addictive from beginning to end. For that fact alone I would definitely recommend it to people to try out, and preferably not be like me and let it sit in a backlog for months upon months; believe me it's definitely worth watching if you need a good meaty show to chew into. It's got its flaws of course, but they can be easily overlooked by all the positives it has going for it, and I have high hopes for the second season when it comes out.\

    A large majority of new release animes consists of slice of life or moe with unoriginal themes and plot, so it is refreshing to see a new unique plot line including something that has never been done before.\
Attack on titan is about a young male who lives in a world where humans are no longer the dominant species, replaced by mindless humanoid titans who seek out and eat humans for pleasure. The surviving humans fled and protected themselves inside a city with unbreakable walls even taller than the tallest titans. A century passes and suddenly a colossal titan appears and destroys one of the walls.\

    Let's be honest: This is one of the very, very few animes of the 21. century. And one of the animes of all time. It deserves what it got and is in no way overrated:\
Everything fits perfectly:\
Music: The first opening gave you chills every time you heard it (Jäger!). The second was less epic but was kind of more opening-ish (Flügel der Freiheit~~~).

        the hype. Normally, you have nice (action-) animes but it's kind of hard to project what your head does to the manga images but they did exactly that. This was beyond awesome! This is either pure talent or hard word or both. You would expect something like this from a movie and now imagine they did this to an anime they release every week!\
Story: It does not matter if you read the manga or not, the story is awesome for both groups. I know there were more or cuts within the story or a rewriting of it on some parts but they transformed the necessary things the \"right way\". It's also one of the few animes where you can not wait to see the next episode and you simply read the manga or watch the \"already released\" episodes over and over. \
Overall: 11/10 because we are all Jäger (Hunter). Watch it. All 25 episodes are available. Some BDs are already out for sale. The manga is also ongoing (I heard it will end around 20 volumes, so we are good to go). I really want another season of this and looking at the popularity of this show, it will come.\

    Before I begin, I must stress  that these are my own views, and in the nicest possible way I don't care if you agree with them or not. Now on with the anime...\
Story (10/10) - Although at first the story doesn't seem to scream uniqueness at its roots, it is a generally sound concept, with humanity on the brink of extinction and the pressures that mount on society and its citizens being key themes behind its development. It would of been easy to focus this anime on the violence and action that is possible from the presence of the titans but I feel that\
          \
        their presence is better used in the way of character development and emphasising the psychological pressures of this dystopian world.\
Art (10/10) - In my opinion one of the strongest points of the anime. To begin the animation quality is magnificent the fight scenes as Eric and the others flow through the streets smoothly. The titans are strangely repulsive...strange in multiple ways... and the character art is gritty and dark at times which really does the show wonders.\
Sound (10/10) - Whilst I feel the soundtrack is nothing special, it does what is required of it. During the action scenes the music is suitably epic (As bloody vague as I can be -.-' , sorry about that!) and the voice actors do their characters justice even if they are playing a  infuriatingly weedy blond boy...\
Character (9/10) -  On the whole the anime tries it's best to create a little niche for each character and in many regards its successful. Each character has its own motivations and its interesting to see how they bring together the different personalities who are fighting titans for revenge, for duty or for food, together into one. The development so far has been excellent in that regard and the potential for further development provides this anime with a solid foundation.\
The reason the score isn't 10 is Armin... I personally feel his character is shallow and doesn't bring much to anime i'm watching for depth and for what seems to be a staple character this is disappointing.\
Overall (9/10) - Slating this anime would be pointless the execution is seamless and its gritty and dark undertones provide entertainment which is keeping me on my knees in wait for the next episode. Whilst there is room for improvement, I can't help but feel it's subjective to each person and for that reason I would recommend this wholeheartedly to everyone in the hope it provides a suitable nugget of 25 minute entertainment.\

    --This anime, this legend, this epic masterpiece is something to admire.\
-The story: I was a skeptic at first, asking people what was the whole thing about. Of course I knew it had to deal with large humanoids pillaging and murdering, however. I was down right wrong. \
After the opening I was like; alright let's see some titans get demolished. Then it started very timid and relaxed, well paced and I was pulled in immediately, thinking, I wonder where those so called titan slayers are. I was really surprised and I wasn't let down, as the story shapes, it gets even more serious and more serious,\
          \
        leading up to the action, which sets me on suspense mode for a large amount of episodes. I like the way I was always wanting it to get even more serious after each individual episode, it was exciting and not many action anime get my blood pumped and my face smiling as in, ''that was f***ing boss''. in the first episode.\
The story progression is so perfect, I was not confused, not tempting to replay an episode. The way the anime lays it down is genuine and you can sense the amount of work in it, progression quality is top notch.\
-The art: The art is fresh and unique; when you read that, it may sound generic, however. Truly this anime brings something new to the millions of anime out there, I've seriously never seen art work this amazing, words cannot make me visualize it for you, it's like one of the amazing wonders of anime. I hope more artists use this style; the art is very clean, it's not light not dark, it's simply perfect. Shading is phenomenal, the characters outlines are heavy. It's strange but, I get lost in the characters details, every single aspect is well thought out, well played, and well designed. It's above high quality, I can almost never catch the framing, it's so smooth and poly when it needs to be. The art is something you have to witness yourself, as it's too good to ever subdue someone through writing.\
- Sound: Sound is amazing. Everything has a sound, the foreground and the background which is astonishing. While the characters are talking, I can hear small chatter in the back, it was like I had to take off my ear phones for a sec, to make sure I wasn't in a cafeteria, amazing. The sound effects are also amazing, you can hear the reverb in the rooms, so if you're in a small room, everything sounds like it would be as if it were in a small room; if you're in a dungeon underground, it'd sound like a dungeon underground. Even the fire torches that light the wall have sound, it brings me ten times closer within the mythos, making me hear things like I hear in real life is really cool, and note worthy.\
- Characters: You'll be loving one character, two, or even all. Every single character has a deep tie within the story, it doesn't matter if you refilled supplies, or swept the floor, everyone in the story had a place and deep impact to the plot. I almost caught myself cheering in victory in my chair, or even holding my breath at times, I almost shed a tear twice in one setting. The character development is genius, and makes you fall in love with the characters, as each one has a theme or powerful view on humanity, and on life. The messages the characters share have deep meaning that can emotionally touch you and make you think after each episode, which I find very powerful.\
- Enjoyment: I'd take it up the a** for a season two to come out any day.\
- Overall: This is an unexpected adventure, the media and hype cannot express how legendary this anime is. The story is powerful, well made, well executed, and unique (emphasis on unique). The art is amazing and awe aspiring as you'll find yourself lost in detail and optimization this anime has to offer. The sound is of quality you'd find in any high grade movie, they didn't just use sound effects, I assume they used folly, meaning real life sounds made by experts in sound making and recorded for that purpose, if not, then it's even better, because not only does the sound have realistic quality, but it's genius.\
If this anime were to be described in one word, It'd be \"epic\". 10 in all categories, this is a must watch action anime, even my anti-anime friends find this enjoyable, and it got them to watch more anime. Thank the lord for the creation of Shingeki no Kyojin, Attack on Titan.\
Unbelievable masterpiece\

    This is my first review, so please be nice =)\
It might seem too early on to write a review, but trust me this anime is worth it!\
Story 10/10 : This anime is honestly like no other; the story is unpredictable and keeps on the edge of your seat. You can sum the story as \"Humans vs. Titans\" but there is so much more. I love how every episode tells us more about the parallel world it is set in and it's mechanics.\
Art 8/10 : The art is pretty good but definitely not the best I've seen.\
Sound 9/10 : Amazing sound but kinda repetitive (especially when\
          \
        people are being eaten), the OST is pretty good too.\
Character 9/10 : The main actors are quite clichéd, you have the not-the-smartest-but-has-the-undying-spirit main character Erin Jaeger (Naruto, anyone?) and his super talented best friend Mikasa and the meek Armin. That being said, the characters are well developed (even if they aren't 'long lasting') and you can't help but feel for them.\
Enjoyment 10/10 : The story is fast paced and there is just so much going on your eyes will literally be glued to the screen! I often find myself rewatching episodes; you will definitely love it if you're a fan of action!\
Overall 9/10: Love it or hate it, it is undeniably interesting, so do give it a try! =)\

    I don't really follow the hype much but this kept cropping on MAL up so I thought I'd give it a go. \
I've seen 9 episodes now and this seems like some strange cross between Jack the Giant Slayer and Assassins Creed. \
Not to say it's not completely riveting. The first episode will hit you like a train, I can promise you that much.\
Story - 8\
Well, can't say much for the whole story if I've only seen nine episodes now can I? What I have seen raises more questions than it answers. Mysterious dreams? Flashbacks? Abnormal Titans (Gigantic humanoids fond of manflesh)? Hmm it's all\
          \
        very interesting. Remains to be seen if this anime can provide satisfactory answers.\
Art - 10\
Wow, just wow. This is the first anime I've sat here and been really impressed by the visuals. The animation itself, particularly for the Titans, seems a bit jerky but the actual art is top-notch. Kinda reminds me of a similar style to an anime I've seen before, but I can't remember which one.  Meh oh well. Just want to point out several specific aspects though. One: The crests for the different army divisions, I liked those. And the facial expressions on the Titans. I will not be forgetting that crazy grin on the Titan toward the end of Ep 1 in a hurry.\
Sound - 10\
Another area I was impressed with. I enjoyed listening to both the intro and the end tunes and the soundtrack throughout ratcheted up the mood nicely as well.\
Character - 7\
Yeeeaaah here is where I have the biggest beef. The three leads are the three types of people I dislike the most. Impulsive angry guy, quietly dedicated prodigy and wimpy nerd. There's also a plethora of background characters who teeter on the edge of decent character development but never seem to fall either way. It's possible they will have some decent development in the later episodes so I remain cautiously optimistic. \
And the fact they all swing round like some crazy Tarzan-Ezio lovechild doesn't do them any harm either.\
Also I don't know if 'Titans' count as characters per se when they don't do an awful lot except stand around and look ugly but they definitely have something strange about them. Plenty of questions left unanswered.\
Enjoyment - 9\
T'is indeed a rather enjoyable show. Once you get used to the emotional bombardment you receive. \
Overall - 9 \
I guess you could say this would be a survival-horror, or some sort of action-thriller depending on how you view things. I have to admit it's a good portrayal of the siege mentality state of mind amongst defenders. Whilst not exactly horrific it could possibly be disturbing for some. It's definitely bloody, powerfully emotional and sometimes downright disturbing (note the Titan's expressions of glee when they find someone to munch on). I can only really compare it to zombie apocalypse flicks and say that, whilst zombie apocalypses made me look away and not care if I looked back again, Attack on Titan made me look away and want to look back.\

    Epic, exciting, and suspenseful; but it’s restrained too much by some annoying characters and pacing issues.\
★★★☆\
Everyone’s heard of this so I don’t have a lot to add. No snarky comments, no witty remarks. I’m sure someone wants me to tear this apart for being overrated and overhyped; that it’s actually a really terrible show like Sword Art Online, and anyone who likes it must be a goddamn commoner with shit taste. It’s so popular it’s getting a Marvel comic crossover.\
It has a great premise. It’s exciting and suspenseful. It manages to make silly looking giants genuinely scary, and so it does a good job of\
          \
        creating tension. It gives you little bits about its world like history and how its technologies work. Though, it has two major flaws.\
The characters are a little shallow, but they’re serviceable. There’s a huge cast so you’ll find someone you like even if it’s just for their quirk. The main character is annoying—which in itself isn’t bad. I’d rather have a main character that makes me feel strongly about them than a vanilla, blank slate. I’ll give the author the benefit of the doubt that he purposely chose such a main character. It’s a bold move, and that’s respectable. If you do find a lot of the characters irritating then good news because they become much more tolerable later on. Plus, because the cast is so big the irritating characters are balanced out by more sane ones.\
The biggest issue is the pacing. There are 25 episodes and it could’ve been cut down because there are too many slow moments for such an exciting premise. The moments that you do want to see are just glossed over, and there’s too much talking when it could’ve just been shown. Even some of the moments that are intentionally exciting feel stretched out. I’m constantly reminded of The Walking Dead TV series where parts in the comic that took a few pages are stretched out for a whole episode.\
And fuck if the opening isn’t exciting.\
The material is good, no arguments. If it had fixed its character and pacing issues then this seriously could’ve been a legendary show. Probably in the top 10 of all time.\

      Basically Shingeki no Kyojin comes at you with a War with titans. \
This anime was really great the story on this just made me glued to it. So let me get to the main character :Eren Jeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman. They both live in a world where there a titans. So many years after titans came walls. Walls were like city, and these city protected them. \
Until one day, they broke through. Eren Jeager had to escape his town. I won't say what happened once this attack was going on because I might give out spoilers, so anyway they go to\
          \
        a different 'wall' and then his goal becomes one thing... He wants to kill all the titans ; wipe them off the face of the earth, and this anime shows how hard he works toward his goal. He shows his courage, and his strength. \

    I have never written a review on MAL before, but this show is definitely worth writing one for. So, please bear with me! At first, I was extremely skeptical about watching Shingeki no Kyojin. I didn't understand why, after just 7 episodes, it was already one of the highest rated animes on MAL. Having said that, once I began watching SNK, my views completely changed.\
Story: 10/10\
In the world they live in, mankind is on the brink of extinction. Titans are devouring humans, and see them simply as game rather than a food source. We follow the stories of Armin, Eren, and Mikasa, as well as\
          \
        their fellow soldiers, as the humans continue to fight for their right to stay in the world that was once dominated by man.\
Art: 10/10\
The animation is Shingeki no Kyojin is outstanding. I mean, is there really much to say? Just watch an episode and you'll see how amazing it is, especially during battle scenes. The way they animated their 3D maneuver gear is flawless.\
Sound: 10/10\
Character: 10/10\
For me, there is not even one character that I don't like. With each episode, the characters develop more and more. Each character, as an individual, brings something different to the show.\
Overall: 10/10\
All in all, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the best animes i've watched thus far. It's extremely interesting and the storyline is unique. I will continue to watch the anime and read the manga in the future. I highly recommend this anime!\

    \"Refreshing\" is the word I find goes with this anime much like how a cup of tae goes with a sandwich.\
Let me just start of by saying I was one of those people who immediately shouted \"Over-hyped\" and could not be convinced by anyone nor would I watch it for any amount of money. If you are even remotely as stubborn as I am I hope this review will prove to be helpful to you.\
The story starts off good, we are quickly brought to an understanding of where we are who is who e.t.c. standard enough procedure. Its not long before we discover the \"titan's\"\
          \
        and the fear/horror that comes with them. The theme of helplessness is evidently portrayed quite early on also. So what you say? It starts the same as all the mediocrity out there? Well please believe me when I say that Shingeki goes against the flow of most shounen fight/action cliches. It wasn't full of kawaii, well endowed girls with questionable intelligence nor was the protagonist a perverted coward who got nosebleeds at the thought of a girl. In fact they kept life in this world as genuinely human as possible, there was no blue/green/pink hair people only had hair colors that we can inherit in our own world, and how people broke down/coped with fear/despair was very natural. This was invaluable, it was awesome to be able to feel how the characters felt it brought you into the anime and you \"lived\" each episode not watched it.\
The pacing is usually what makes or breaks an anime for me and they got it spot on, in all 26 episodes there was not a single filler episode in fact the first episode or two covers a few years(sounds too fast but you'll understand if you watch it) and they deliver just the right amount of information to you each episode, of course you'll have your questions but this is good it keeps you interested and your questions will be answered in due time. The plot wasn't exactly \"original\" but it was by no means predictable some times you had no idea what was going to happen next, it was exciting and at the end of each episode there will be some form of dramatic cliffhanger that'll you'll rocket out of your chair/bed and click next episode 1000 times and curse your slow internet. \
The characters much like the plot were unoriginal. The main 3 characters consist of Eren (Y)Jeager who is aggressive and impulsive, often making rash decisions, he's fueled by his hatred for titans and swears he'll kill everyone of them, unfortunately his emotions seem to be limited to anger and sorrow. Armin Arlert who is wimpy, thinks he's powerless and he thinks his friends think they're better than him, he turns out to be the smartest of the 3. Finally Mikasa Ackerman, it took me a while to figure her out which I enjoyed so I wont spoil too much but its very obvious she's one of those lost her parents, moved in with another family fell in love with protagonist types, they don't emphasize this at all but its obvious. Don't get me wrong though, while they are stereotypical its their personalities that really carry the anime. Deriving from most anime trust me when I say NO character is safe supporting, main or random there's none of this we're too important to the story to be harmed crap.\
I had mixed feelings about the ending on one hand the final episode gave me everything that I wanted it was full of everything it wasn't one of those endings where very little happens they revisit the past and everything is tied up in a pretty little bow and they all live happily ever after but on the other hand they ended on a HUGE cliffhanger and they did it so subtly it was hard to tell if it was even part of the the story or just fan service, they also did it in such a way that we have very very little to go on, as to what'll happen next but we still want more, if that was what they were aiming for then they succeeded.\
[8 | 10]\
If just one line on a characters face is off I can't continue to watch an anime so you'll believe me when I say the art was amazing, breathtakingly so.The cover though I found very misleading to me it kind of seemed like it was drawn  in a similar style of those in 2000/02 but its very modern, highly detailed and just amazing I can't say this enough, even if it turns out you don't like the anime you'll respect the art. They kept the world colored as \"human\" as possible. There was no overuse of bright colors nor was it dark and depressing, the city wall in particular was astounding, towering in the distance in most scenes you'd expect it to be flat plain and detail-less to save work/money but they didn't skimp out on even the tiniest detail.\
 In most fighting/action anime especially ones with very low budgets you'll notice some of the techniques they use to dull out the movement like exaggerated lines to induce a sense of speed or simply skipping the part where said character moves from point A to point B and has another character say how fast they were or something, the scenes in Shingeki however are completely fluent throughout it is guilty in some parts, however I can't say anything because it'll spoil it but those parts are there for a reason to draw your attention to something in particular, in fact if your watching Shingeki without this in mind you probably won't even notice.\
[9 | 10]\
I'm not really a music person and its difficult for me to talk about it descriptively but I'll do my best for those of you that are. The opening didn't really stand out as other openings have in the past in fact it wasn't until half way through when they changed it that I noticed I liked it. The first opening definitely reflected what happens in the first half of the story in that it carried the emotions people felt and the theme of human or \"humanity\" resonated through out. As for the second I may be guilty of being biased but I felt like it gave the impression that the story is being sped up and we were near the end and if it replaced the first one it would be misleading for some people.\
The sound effects were excellent, when I say this I mean there was nothing unnecessary, no honestly nothing. no talking from third parties, no over exaggerated noises from weapons, even the explosions were what you'd expect maybe even less so from the distance we are at in the scenes, some noises from people who are in despair are kind of cringy but they kept it so realistic and it was never over-emphasized. There was never a single moment where I felt the background music did not suit the scene or set a misleading/wrong atmosphere, and the voice actor is one of my favorites(I didn't notice until I watched it the second time) he also did Issei from highschool DxD and Shu from guilty crown so you might like it if you liked those because Eren is very similar in a way and his voice really suits the role Eren plays.\
[7 | 10]\
If you're sick of all the mediocrity, then you will like this. In some ways it is unoriginal and I've come to the conclusion that nothing is original but this anime really builds on whats similar and gives us something refreshing and new, the story is simplistic but they make the simple interesting, I can promise you there will never be a moment without suspense or excitement.\
If you were like I was before and you can't stand the thought of watching something so over-hyped to the point it literally foams out of peoples mouths like a hyper little girl who puts down anyone who says bad things about it, then here is some advice:throw away all of your expectations ALL of them or you wont enjoy the simple things, ignore other peoples opinions(only while viewing) it's one of my strong if not the strongest beliefs that it's very important to listen to and respect other peoples opinions, so do so but watch Shingeki with an open mind, if you don't the result is already pre-determined and you shouldn't waste your time. There will be some of course who will not enjoy it even after all I've said but keep it in mind, nothings perfect and it might not be your cup of tae but get out of your comfort zone and try something new on your own terms.\
Personally I rated this at 9/10 but from a critical point of view it only deserves an 7 or an 8 it definitely did not live up to all the \"Hype\" but it wasn't far off it, it was refreshing,exciting, interesting and well drawn what more do you need, make yourself a cup of tae and a sandwich, sit back and enjoy, if you're still skeptical just watch the first 2-3 episodes and make your decision then or feel free to pm/vm me I'd be glad to answer any questions related to this anime.\

    over a century ago.... mankind had a new enemy. The difference between mankind the their new found enemy was overwhelming.... soon mankind was driven to the brink of extinction\
story;\
Living within the safety of the walls,sina,rose and maria humanity was able to escape this new enemy.. the titans. Usually several stories talls and hungry for the flesh of humans. Humanity was trapped by that which kept them safe... the walls.Within these walls is a boy..... Eren jeager. Unlike most people within the walls Eren Jeager had the desire to go outside. He lives in the wall together with his two friends Arwin and Mikasa. he was\
          \
        mocked for his dreams to venture outside and to join the recon corpse, i mean why put your life in danger?.... were fine as long as were within these walls right?.....wrong. Their 100 year peace was interrupted by the colossal Titan who broke wall maria and allowed the Titans to enter the city.... this would lead to a tale of a boy revenging is murdered mother and his two loyal friends......\
I loved the originality of the series and how it focuses on the challenges humanity faces and the more realistic view of it. You get to see that it doesn't always go the way we want because in the end.... we are only human. This concept was amazing however i feel like to many plot twist were introduced but not actually played out. A lot of questions are left unanswered and I feel like the main goal is completely ignored in the brink of the plot line chaos. Don`t get me wrong the story most certainly has amazing plot potential but its a little like giving you 4 pages of 20 manga books...... It can be good and all but if none of the plot is actually shown... it doesn't mean much.\
Art: \
The art was awesome.... I loved the realistic style used especially the eyes. I was also really impressed with the amount of expression used in the characters...you were always able to tell how that particular character feels. The action used is the series flows really well and was quite impressive. Atack of the Titans uses really bright and accentuated colours as well as well detailed backgrounds \
Although i like how the art was animated a little differently i did not like the black bold lines that outlined the characters i felt like that put them out of sync with the background.\
Sound:\
I really enjoyed the first Opening Guren No Yamiya by Linked Horizon as i felt like it connected to the events in the series. The second OP Jiyuu no Tsubasa, also by Linked Horizon however i didst like ... although it connected really well with series i personally did not enjoy the opening song. The only thing i liked about the second opening was the line flugel der freiheit which means wings of freedom.\
character:\
I really liked the individual characters personalities as they actually reacted the way humans should in that particular situation. You go to see what humans really become like when put into that type of situation and how selfish we can really be. I also liked the concept of \" No`one is safe\" this refers tot he fact that anybody can die, even your favourite character could be dead within 5 minutes, this really creates a lot of unexpected plot twists.\
Because the characters are so \"human\" they also all have a specific personality adn they all react differently to the same situation this means almost everyone is different. For example; Eren is a revengeful boy who cares about nothing than killing the Titans that ruined his life, Mikasa is the close friend who cares about nothing but to protect her friend and Arwin who is the \"bookworm\" of the series who feels useless and like a burden as he feels like he cant help his friends.\
However i do feel that some characters could have used a lot more character development and were killed of WAY to quickly.\
Enjoyment:\
I really enjoyed Attack of the Titan i thought the drama and struggle the characters go through was entertaining and you feel empathy for a lot of the characters as they go through these struggles.. you connect to them.\
Overall:\
I must say personally i am a little be sceptic of \"hyped\" anime series as they are usually quite action based and there is usually a reason even people who don't usually watch anime watch them..... i am not that big of a fan of series with large amounts of action as i am more interested in the plot and its not uncommon for \"hyped\" anime serie to action packed i mean look at Naruto... So was it worth the amount of love it gets?..... i can certainly see why it is so popular i mean its original, has great plot twist and plenty of action without it being repetitive.  I know i should not judge a series by its cover however sometimes i cant help myself..... I am glad however that i did not let that stop me from watching this. I mean in the end it should not really matter how popular a series is as long as its good.\

    ~story~\
In a world where humans live in a world of giant\
man-eating monsters called Titans, humanity is on a\
brink of extinction and is secluded between three\
cocentric walls. Within those walls lives Eren Jaeger, a\
young eager child wanting to know what's life like out\
side of those walls, Mikasa Ackerman, the adopted\
sister of Eren, and Armin Arlert, their childhood\
friend.  Eren wants to see the world by joining the\
Survey/Recon Corps, soldiers that venture forth\
outside the walls on recon missions. One day,\
humanity received a cruel reminder. A giant Titan (I\
know that's redundant) completely breeches the wall\
that was keeping Eren and company safe causing an\
immense invasion of the Titans. \
          \
        After the devastation\
the 3 are left orphaned. After living for a while as\
refugees, they decide that the only way is to join the\
military and become a part of the Survey Corps to be\
free from the Titans.  The action is fast-paced and\
balls-to-the-wall and there's plenty of it. If there's no\
action there's some pretty intense drama.  There are\
also some light comedy there as well.  The more you\
watch, the thicker the plot becomes. I just don't\
want to spoil what happens but it's pretty awesome\
given the premise of the show.\
~Art~\
The characters were well drawn, and well proportioned. It is worth nothing that even secondary, and tertiary characters appeared well designed (as opposed to some anime’s where the character’s detail is a direct correlation with the size\
of their role). The city was amazingly well drawn,\
too.  The backgrounds were rich, the monsters were\
well done, and the animation was crisp. While I have\
no complaints here, it occurs to me that decent\
animation should be expected at this point. That, and\
animation alone does not make a story. This category\
is not weighted as heavily.\
~sound~\
Sound was rather amazing, yet again. Intro was good,\
outro was good, catchy. Irony is thought, if intro was\
about hope, about survival of humanity, anime itself\
was rather depressing. So, I guess that evens both\
out.\
Background music was well done as well. Fighting\
had fighting music. Depressing part had depressing\
music, as usual. Its soundtrack what I would listen\
again and again, as they were simply so epic.\
~character~\
The story is host to a broad cast of characters, many of\
which are realistically portrayed, making them relatable\
and go through equally relatable character development\
as they attempt to survive in this beautiful, yet cruel\
world. Main character Eren starts out as somewhat one-\
dimensional, but soon goes through his own\
developments, gaining credibility as the story\
progresses. The story makes excellent use of its plot\
elements, the universe it has crafted, the characters and\
so on. As the mysteries of the Titans and the world are\
unravelled, shocking revelations and plot-twists quickly\
follow each other, yet all of them make sense, are\
cleverly foreshadowed and drive the plot forward and\
rarely, if ever, feel forced.\
~overall~\
It was good. I agree,but it has it flaws, and it is definitely is not the best of 2013. It didn't live up to its hype. I was somewhat disappointed because everyone was talking about how this anime makes you feel all types of emotions, and that this is the best of the decade, yet, when I watched it, I didn't feel all those emotions everyone else was feeling. It didn't leave an impact on me.\

    Shingeki No Kyojin, highly acclaimed and recognized anime of 2013.\
And one quite capable, of sending chills down my spine, with the power, similar to that of a man going off. (If you don't get it, then you shouldn't be on the internet)\
This anime is so pleasurable to watch, and there are so many episodes with cliff hangers, and it made me go \"OH F**K WHY!??\", and I somewhat impatiently waited for the next episode to be released.\
The story is amazing in my opinion, and one that truly deserves a 2nd season. And I know I sound like a massive Fan-boy, of SnK, which I probably\
          \
        don't mind being called, but it's been awhile since I've watched something like this.\
The art is smooth, detailed, beautiful, it really does show the horrified and distressed looks on the characters faces. The backgrounds are pretty too, and nothing ever seems out of place.\
Sound is also really good, the voice actors did great jobs on voicing their characters and I think, really portrayed who their character was meant to be as. And both Opening Theme songs were really good to listen to, one of the best I've heard in any anime in a while.\
Characters were done really nicely, however whilst some may agree that the money did seem 'overly-serious', I think it was perfect. I'm going to leave it at that, so that anyone who has not seen the anime, can see the characters for themselves.\
I really enjoyed this anime, and I know there are thousands of others that can agree that this anime has been one pleasurable, spine-chilling adventure, that will go down as one of the hottest anime series ever.\
Have a good day everyone! :)\

    This is my first review so bare with me if it's a little rough. In the hopes of remaining concise and within the guidelines I'll just be going down the list.\
Story- The story kicks off wonderfully, very gritty and engaging.  I had read about this anime when it first started airing but never watched it until a couple days ago, but when I started it I couldn't get enough.  I watched the 17 currently aired episodes within two days.  The plot appears to be a rather basic revenge story in the beginning but soon develops into something deeper.  Webs are beginning\
          \
        to weave ( cliche I know ), and it seems like it's going to just keep getting better and better.  Family, friends, politics, human experimentation, so much begins to unfold and it is truly gripping. As I said before this show is very gritty, it has its fair share of dark and depressing moments, but also has its lighter ones ( Mikasa blaming the noise on Sasha farting nearly killed me it was so unexpexted ) and throws in rays of hope and sunshine as well.  It also seems to progress quite well, none of the episodes thus far feel like they're taking forever adding in too much filler but they also don't feel rushed.  Overall it just feels like every episode means something and has bearing on the actual story and character development, etc.\
Art- It's a new anime so the artwork is quite clean, and does a great job on facial expressions.  My particular favorite is the way the eyes are done during a characters more intense moments, as well as the lack of expression a couple of characters have which adds to their personalities and personas. Epic moments abound, and the action is always crisp and engaging and you can tell whats going on.  \
Sound-  The music generally seems to match each scenario very well, during the intense edge of your seat moments as well as the more lighthearted times.  The soundtrack just seems to fit the whole show very well, no complaints.\
Character- The characters are definitely proving to be my favorite parts of this show.  I love the premise and the art work and action scenes are wonderful, but the characters are just evolving in such great ways that I can't wait for each new episode.  The sheer range of personalities is wonderful, from gung-ho action heroes, the brooding reserved introverts, loveable eccentrics, and the attention seekers that make you grit your teeth at times.  But, again, what I am loving so much is their transformations, evolutions, and the depth that so many of the characters have.  I can't say enough good things about it, the characters are already some of my favorites and I've watched a plethora of different animes, and even out of movie and television characters!\
Enjoyment- I was wanting something intense, gritty, dark, something that would jump out at me with awesomeness and also the occasional ability to tickle my funny bone.  This show toppled my expectations! Already there's been moments where I have just been ecstatic with the intensity and visceral nature of this show.  This will definitely be a show that I'll be sad to see end, but it has tons of potential and has already built and awesome framework that I'm very impressed with.\
Overall- A very satisfying viewing experience with tons of awesome moments and epic action, as well as very emotional scenes and wonderful character development. Definitely a recommended watch, as long as you don't mind a decent amount of blood and gore, lol.  \

    For the record, this anime was my very first. And what a way to start\
Story:\
Giants eating mankind isn't exactly ground breaking but when done like this, it does make for a pretty good story. The struggle for survival and tales of loss make for some gripping and emotional scenes. Titan does however have bad pacing, expeditions that feel like weeks are only a day and 5 episode long arcs are only a few hours.\
I give it an 8 out of 10\
Art:\
Titan has some amazing scenes, if your story has Japanese spider men/ women with swords your pretty much set when it comes to amazing action\
          \
        scenes. The backgrounds nice and varied and the design of the city can really project the sheer size and power of the titans. The Titans themselves start off as incredibly intimating and downright disturbing monsters, sadly they start  getting derpier and derpier \
I give it a 9 out of 10\
Sound:\
Hiroyuki Sawano really pulled it off because titan has an AMAZING soundtrack, some of the tracks just get you pumped while other tracks give off the \"we're so screwed\" feel. \
Side note: That opening\
I give it a 9 out of 10\
Character:\
Arguably, Titan's weakest element is it's characters. The main 3 characters are sort of bland but they still remain relatable. Armin feels as though he is holding everyone back and he is week, which all of us have felt at least once in our lives. The Redeeming factor in this is the show's supporting cast, this is when the show's characters really shine as the supporting cast are lovable people whom you can really connect and relate to.\
I give it a 7 out of 10\
Enjoyment:\
In terms of personal enjoyment; I absolutely love this show. Its fight scenes are the things I need to satisfy my blood lust and those slight nudges of romance scratch my romance itch.\
But that's just me.\
I give it a 9 out of 10\
Final thoughts:\
Titan is a fantastic piece of work, amazing fight scenes, an interesting world and a lovable (supporting) cast of characters. If you're looking for some intense fight scenes definitely give this one a shot. However if you're not looking to see characters talk for several episodes, I'm afraid I have some bad news as Titan is very dialogue heavy that is not to say that it's all boring.\
Titan was one to take my \"anime virginity\" and I'm glad it did, it introduced me to an amazing form of entertainment and made me the otaku that I am today.\
Thank you, Attack on Titan!\

    I initially wanted to write a review of SNK after the series is finished..But I just couldn't ignore such a series and I ended up here...sigh \
Of course now that the series didn't end yet I would add my opinion of the upcoming episodes once they're aired so the ratting may differ (I hardly think it would) For now I would review episodes 1-11. \
Overrated and Over-hyped were the two words that kept me away from watching this show as they did for some ppl. I didn't want to be disappointed. Because normally when everyone keep telling you how great sth you end up getting\
          \
        high expectations and as I read low-rated reviews as well, I was beginning to question the show. \
Finally I decided to forget everything I've read and heard and actually watch the show and GOD am I GLAD I did. \
First couple of episodes were good..but...well they were rather typical and somewhat depressing, but it got all better when I got to the third episode and at the end of the fifth it was already 5 am but I remember saying F**K SLEEP and actually continued watching XD With such cliffhangers it is hard to not continue. \
The story is amazing, though I thought it was weird when I read the summary but I came to really like it. It's not completely original, but the pace and execution is amazing and that's what's so great about it. Instead of having each episode talk about a single event in which most of action anime do, the episodes are connected and each event leads to the next. The story is not all about unnecessary fights, there are full episodes that contain ZERO action but are still entertaining as they give us a chance to get into the character heads and helps us understand them better. \
STORY 9/10\
The art is different than the art in most anime. There's actually a unique design for each character including the titans which u would expect to be all the same. Because it's different it might now appeal to everyone but it's something you get used to after a few episodes so it's okay. The Animation is a complete win for this show, truly amazing. \
ART 10/10\
The sound was great, the opening fits the show perfectly, the ending was good too, they were both appropriate for the show and the background music was great But the voice acting...was WOW. great job there \
Sound 10/10\
Mikasa remained my favorite character throughout the episodes. Some ppl say she's an emotionless badass character that don't seem real at all, well I'm with you on the badass part but Mikasa actually shows a great deal of emotions especially towards Eren, she cries and gets unsure and loses her focus just like any normal person would do, but she as many characters in this show went through too much so the way they act is justified. \
I first wasn't sure if I would like Eren, he was too angry and too determined for his own good, but later on he reflected on how he was and now he's my 2nd favorite. I heard some ppl say he makes irrational decisions, but that's not the case at all, if you've watched the recent episodes you'll get what I mean. Eren's character developed greatly but there's still a little typical-ness to him. \
There are many other characters including Armin, who's may be physically weak but his brain is certainly isn't.  Many characters die which is a normal thing, even if you've been trained so well to fight, a real battle is different, it's gives off a realistic feel to the show. But I just wished I could see more...\
Oh and another thing SASHA deserves the best  Comic Relief Award\
CHARACTERS 8/10\
As for enjoyment you can already tell I did, you are on the edge of your seat throughout the whole thing. You can actually get powerful feelings from this show, you'll be scared, angry, determined, it's just amazing.\
Don't judge the show before you actually give it a chance, I'm surprised the show has haters, but you know what they say how much haters you have tell how successful you are and that's the case here. \
Faith in future anime RESTORED. \

    Well, that was one of the most 500 epic minutes of my life! So, finally finished it, one and only Shingeki no Kyojin, or to us Westerners, Attack on Titan. Gotta admit, if you want to get someone into anime, or are a newbie yourself, THIS. WATCH IT. JUST... Oooooo! Honestly, if you don't mind blood and violence, this is so catered to Western audiences. Even my Mum would watch this, and the only show she watches that matches our demographic is Game of Thrones and, if you're me, Law and Order :D (Bradley Walsh ftw!). Anyway, digression over, let's jam:\
Story: FINALLY! A story I\
          \
        can sum up! Massive, carnivorous, UGLY mofos called Titans wish to feed on the human colony, protected by three walls (which, on a side note, is what the wacko religious group worships). The first wall is taken and the second is taken and liberated throughout the series, the third protecting the central city. The humans devise a corp called Recon Corp to protect themselves, with technology called 3D manoeuvre gear. That's the general gist. 9\
Art: Love it. Western taste which is probably why I think the anime appeals to a Western audience. But I literally can't urge it enough - I even appreciated it more than some Studio Ghibli work and, from me, that's saying something. 10\
Sound: Unfortunately outshined by every other aspect, but still top notch. Have the opening on my phone I enjoyed it that much (Opening 1 at least) and while the battle and 'emotional scene' music repeat, it never feels repeatative. Solid 8\
Characters: The cast is much too vast (hey, I'm a poet!) to do bios n all, but these are the main characters. Eren: Main character. Follow his journey through the Recon Corp process and the Titan liberation. \
Bit Shinji-wingy from Neon Genesis. Still likeable. Armin: Eren's friend. Again, bit Shinji-wingey, possibly more so than Eren. Solid member of the Recon Corp though. \
Mikasa: Adopted sister of Eren's family. Will do anything to protect Eren. Very supportive of him. Good, strong female character. \
Cpt Levi: Has to protect Eren later on in the story, and is leader of Erens squad. One of my favourites.\
Commander Erwin: Simple really, Commander of Erens Recon division.\
Hange Zoë: Scientist who researches captured  Titans. 9\
I've pretty much give my overview at the start, but the hype certainly lives up and is one of the best shows I've watched. As stated, one of the most eoic periods of my life, and one of the best uses of 500 mins. Fantastic, solid show. 9\

    Okay, the rating on animelist for this one is pretty high-and that's fine, because out of recent animes to come out, I can definitely see some of the hype behind this one. \
The story/Enjoyment (8,7): It's good! From the very first episode, the ball starts rolling, and you're left in a lot of suspense as to what the hell happens next. There's plenty of mysteries, and it's an intruiging plot line: titans-where'd they come from? What's Eren's relation to them? What's with the walls?\
WHAT THE HELL IS IN THE BASEMENT? \
The problem is, there's twists and turns, and some of them are definitely more expected,\
          \
        but the overall plot line after the first few episodes starts to unravel agonizingly slowly. For people who tend to be more impatient (like me) you're left unsatisfied that for every explanation that's given in this show, there's a ton more questions left unanswered. It's the main criticism I have of this anime. All episodes into it and caught up on the manga alike, I still don't have any real clue what's going on, and in that sense it does detract from how much I enjoyed it. \
That being said, Art is fantastic, a solid 9. The character designs are cute, the uniforms pretty cool, and the backdrops are stunning. The lighting, the action-these are all top notch. \
When the heroes are swinging around in their 3-D maneuver gear, the perspective shots are amazing. \
Likewise for the sound. In my opinion, it's a 10. The music is absolutely wonderful. The  first opening  sounds great, and the soundtrack is flawless. The Reluctant Heroes and Counterattack of Mankind made me have to download the songs after I heard them. There's some really hair-raising tracks in this anime. \
Character: It's funny because so many of the side characters take the spotlight that you want them to have more screentime than Eren. \
Not that Eren isn't likable. He is, but out of everyone, I find that I don't care about him half as much as the others.\
Sasha is a doll. She's supposed to be comic relief-and she is, she's funny-but there's something so refreshing and charming about her character, and I really enjoyed watching whenever she was onscreen. \
Mikasa's good too, but in a more stereotypical way. Stoic, scary past, amazing skill-her and Levi seem to be made from the same stuff, and they're a good parallel of each other and their roles in Eren's life. \
Speaking of which-that's one thing that I'm definitely a little iffy about. There's a lot of argument on ships and whatever, but I want to point out that adoption still is family. Siblings who aren't related by blood are in no way less siblings than people who are. And I DO consider Mikasa as part of Eren's family. Where this fits into the romance is up to you-if you see romance in there in the fist place-but meh. \
Armin is cute and well written, Annie is extremely complex, and so are a lot of the other characters: Jean, Ymir, Connie, Hanji-they're all not only likable and worth routing for, but they have so much to them. They're well written and well fleshed out. \
There's plenty of great action scenes, great emotional moments-and if you're into representation, there's definitely plenty of interesting female characters who are just as important as the male. \
So yes. \
Attack on Titan looks at pretty solid 8. \

    No doubt the biggest anime of the year, it's essentially this years Sword Art Online, the biggest question to answer is \"Does It live up to the hype?\". The answer is yes and no. There is a really high chance that there will be a second season of attack on titan and that is where this anime will shine at it's brightest without a doubt. It needs another season to develop in my opinion and to start to truly shine, it definitely has the most potential out of any anime to come out in the past few years that's for sure.\
Story- The story in Attack\
          \
        on Titan is a very well thought out and realized one, even if it is a bit on the generic side. Generic in the form of \"We are humans fighting against a stronger force than us, but our tenacity will allow us to defeat them\" kind of way. It's definitely unique in the way that it tells it's story though, it kind of baffles me that nobody has thought of titans before as an enemy in anime. It's a very weird, yet terrifying enemy, they are kind of like over sized zombies, which is something that would scare the shit out of anyone. Anyway, humanity has built 3 gigantic walls that shield them from the titans, these walls are practically un-breachable and have kept the titans at bay for many years, until one day a gigantic titan that can peer over the walls appears and takes out the gate which lets in all of the other titans to flood into the city and start destroying it. The story revolves around three main characters, Mikasa, Eren, and Armin all of which were great friends as children and even better friends at later ages. These 3 kids have been through a tremendous amount their entire lifes, so much torture and pain, and yet they can have such a positive outlook on life still, it's no doubt a powerful anime that will really speak to you and definitely keep you interested the entire way through. It has one of the strongest opening episodes out of any anime I've ever watched, I would even dare to put it on par with elfen lied's opening episode, which I thought I would never say about any anime. It almost had me on the verge of tears in one episode, they're definitely onto something here, you can tell how much work was put into Attack On Titan. Does that mean that it's perfect? Of course not, but it can be a masterpiece because of it's flaws right? Sure, but it's not. The story does have some problems. The first half or so of the anime has a pretty good pace and really ramps up, but it kind of slacks off some in the middle to end, on top of that there are alot of story elements missing that are fairly important. Alot of stuff is kind of left in the dark and makes the anime has this sort of \"gap\" in it. The very end of the anime is extremely climatic, this anime does some really fucking amazing fight scenes, the titan fights are especially jaw dropping. On top of that it does some of it's other scenes equally as well. It's a very well made anime with an excellent story, but it was definitely drawn out in some parts and kind of stretched out so that they would be able to make another season. With everything left as it was I would hope the second season won't be so \"drawn out\". it should be fairly meaty in the second season and that's what i'm looking forward to the most. The first season was amazing though, definitely one of the biggest surprises this season and this year hands down. Even with all of it's flaws the story is still a rock solid 9/10.\
Art- The art style is different in this than in most anime, it has a more \"drawn\" kind of style that actually fits the anime really well. It also has some very berserk-esq scenes in it that are amazing. The 3d maneuver gear and the titan concepts are unique to this anime and are pretty badass in my opinion. One of the few animes to come out recently that has some unique art styles of it's own, which is nice to see. The animation quality is extremely good in this anime as well. It's very fluid and some of the scenes in particular are quite amazing to watch, some of which were so good that they will be forever engraved in my memory. \
Sound- The sound assests I feel where nothing special in the anime, it doesn't stick out in the same way that the animation or story does, it doesn't really have any defining moment where it really makes the scene that much better, it does it's job, but doesn't do anything more than that. It has solid sound assets and solid op/ed, but nothing too memorable imo, doesn't mean that they're bad, far from it, but they aren't on the same level as the story or art.\
Character- The characters are another very strong point for this anime. You have 3 main characters, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. All of which have something unique about them that breaks the certain stereotypes that they fit into. By this point in anime pretty much every character fits into a certain \"stereotype\", but they can still do stuff to differentiate themselves from being just that stereotype. For example, Eren fits the \"badass\" role pretty well, but he's not as badass as he might seem at times, he has his own tendencies that make him unique from just being a \"badass\" character, which is awesome. Same with Mikasa, she is also very \"unique\" in her own ways, as for Armin though, he feels like more of a side character than a main character. I like the whole idea behind Armin and who he is, but he isn't as fleshed out as Mikasa and Eren. He feels more like an important side character, which is sad because I really like Armin. Hopefully he gets more fleshed out in the second season if there is one. That's actually quite the problem, because all of the side characters in Attack on Titan aren't that well fleshed out at all, they're all really just kind of there, they're not as \"important\" as say some of the side characters in Claymore. The main characters Mikasa and Eren pick up most of the slack though, they're very interesting characters so you don't really notice most of the other characters to begin with.\
Enjoyment- Attack on Titan was highly enjoyable, despite some key flaws that it had, there was never a dull moment. Anybody that decides to sit down and watch this will enjoy it, no doubt about that. Whether you are crying, being terrified, or getting super hyped you will be enjoying it, and not many anime does that. \
Overall- Overall Attack on Titan lives up to the hype and at the same time falls a little bit short of the hype. It's kind of the same deal with sword art online, it was so good, but there was a design choice that they made that kind of held it back from being as good as it could have been. Anybody that watches this will enjoy it and will probably call it a masterpiece, it could have been a masterpiece, and it may even become one with a second season, but as for now it's a really solid anime that should be watched by everyone, even if it falls a bit short of it's hype in some areas.\

    Let me just preface my review by saying that I really do love this anime; I feel it's one of the most solidly unique worlds built in many seasons.\
That being said, it's not actually all that well-done.\
Story (6):\
The plot seemed to drudge on far too slow for a series with this rich a history; 13 episodes in, I still have very little information on the world, and they don't ever explain how they went from being able to build a giant wall to being unable to repair a small break in the wall.  Did all your masons just jump off the wall when they\
          \
        finished?\
Art (4):\
The art is horribly sub-par.  The entire show is a 30-minute clip show.  They pan across stills like it's some documentary on historically important toilets, but I really don't think anyone is fooled by it.  The character art is a tad awkward, with the outlines being far too bold.  The titans look like giant neckbeards (I swear it's like looking at a group of my friends naked), and could probably use some work on the texturing; the mouths are intentionally part of the effect of the titans, so I can't really blame them for leaving that in, as weird as it looks.  The background art is beautiful but with content like this, I'm not surprised it looks beautiful.  The intro has a terrible portion where they seem to have accidentally lowered the contrast and brightness; every time it shows, I think my backlight's gone wonky.\
Sound (8):\
The opening sequence is is arguably the best this season, and really gets me pumped to watch the show; a large part of why I'm still watching the series is because of it.  The soundtrack as a whole is pretty good, but it has to be, since the animation is so bad.  The voice acting is okay, but sometimes I feel they're just screaming into their mics when they should be putting actual emotion (besides yelling) into it.  It's disappointing, really.\
Characters (6):\
They've barely added given any backstory to the characters thus far.  Mikasa is a badass, we get that, thank you; move along, please.  The side characters are essentially left with vague wishy-washy backstories like \"yeah she likes potatoes and came from the north\" with absolutely no idea what makes \"the north\" important or unique.  And Eren is a huge deus ex machina with odd timeline-breaking flashbacks that make absolutely no sense.\
Enjoyment (9):\
I love this anime to death.  I ignore all the bad qualities, and continue watching it anyways, because above all else, they built up this amazing world with great history and awesome scenery.  There's depth to this series, more than I can even imagine right now.\
Overall (10):\
Honestly, disastrously bad; if an anime can be ruined by flimsy characters, poor art, or screamy voice acting, this show is not for you.  If you can ignore these aspects, you're in for one hell of a world.  I haven't loved a flimsy anime this much since Sword Art Online.\

    There is a lot of hype surrounding this anime at the moment. So I tried to be cautious with this one because hype generally is not nescessarily the best thing for an anime *hhrm* Sword Art Online *hhrm*. But after watching the first 7 episodes I gotta say: This anime comes quite close to its hype. There many positive aspects about the execution of AoT, but it's not perfect.\
Story:\
Attack on Titan's plot tells you the events of Eren Jaeger, the protagonist and his  buddies. I'll try to explain it in the simplest way possible: It's a Zombie Apocalypse with huge, naked, nearly unbeatable, human-eating\
          \
        zombies in a medieval setting. The survivors are ... uhm .... a bunch of so and not so badasses who swing around with grappling hooks and fight with swords. There are quite a many dramatic and even some mind-blowing WHAT DA F... moments. Overall the plot is an above average Shounen story with many nailbiting-goosebumps-edge of your seat scenes. \
Art & Sound:\
The art is pretty good. The characters all look quite nice in my opinion and the titans looks pretty cool as well. The Animation shows its strongest side during the awesome action scenes and two words .... Opening ... Ending. I know, that this is just a small part of an anime, but this is one of the only anime which got both the OP and the ED right. The music is epic during the OP, ED, the action scenes, the dramatic scenes ..... so its nearly perfect in my view.\
Characters: \
There are many characters that show some relevance and others that don't *hhrm* get killed *hhrm*. First I had some Problems with Eren Jaeger, because he looked like the *OMG REVENGE SCREAM AROUND SUPER WILL POWER* Shounen protagonist. But after giving it some thought his attitude is quite understandable due to an important event during the earlier episodes.\
His friend, Mikasa Ackerman, is a very important part of the story and you see her development quite clearly during one part of AoT. There also are some other characters, but they don't show as much relevance as Eren and Mikasa. So I won't go too deep into them. There's Armin, Eren and Mikasa's friends, who has to face the fact, that he is the weakest of his friends and some other soldiers. \
Enjoyment:\
This anime has, as said,  some of the most intense moments that I've seen in a while. I enjoyed it quite a bit ( It is awesome ) and there's a lot to be found for Shounen fans. I still wait for the next episode and it is quite painful :D\
Overall:\
If you like awesome action, good characters, dramatic scenes, a story with many twists and great astethics, this anime is for YOU. It's a worthy contender for DA BEST ANIMEZZZZZ OF 2013.\

    At first, I was hesitant to watch Shingeki no Kyojin because too many people hyped it up. And, usually, when that happens, I normally end up watching only to find that it doesn't deserve any praise. However, I am so glad I gave SnK a chance!! From the very first episode, I was hooked! I knew there would be no way to escape. It's definitely not something wholly original, but the author obviously put a lot of time and thought to craft what I predict will be one of the best manga/anime ever. Sure, it's not perfect, but hey, it's not like I can write\
          \
        something like that. \
Story: 9. Your classic monsters vs. humans. But with a twist!\
Shiganshina: 845. Humans are living in a walled city. The city is shaped like a circle and has three walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina. The nobility lives in the innermost gate, Wall Sina. However, on a fateful day, Wall Maria is breached by Titans, leading to 20 percent of the population's death. Thus begins crunch time for the people in Shiganshina. I can't go any further, but basically the creatures called Titans want nothing more than to destroy humanity by eating/killing them. The reason, we're not so sure. You'll have to find out! ;) The Survey Corps are responsible for defeating the Titans, hoping to ultimately find a way to obliterate them. The main characters--Eren, Mikasa, and Armin--thus begin their long trial to find the truth in hopes of saving humanity.\
Art: 9\
Gritty and gory. The sometimes grainy effect contributes to the darkness of the story. The Titans look awesome. And I love the characters! They look so good. The scenery is wonderful. \
Sound: 10\
The soundtrack is so epic. Love the theme songs with the German mixed into them. The sounds when killing the Titans are spot on. \
Characters: 7\
Though the characters are the ones who pull the story together, I can't help but be annoyed by some traits they possess. And no, this is not about a love triangle. Even yells too much, Mikasa can get overprotective over Eren, and while Armin is smart, he can sometimes be annoyingly weak and whiny to the point that I just want to pull him out of the screen and shoot him. Levi seems to be a static character, but for me, his composure is commendable. Hanji is hilarious... what's not to love? The rest of the characters have distinctions among them, which makes them likable. But beware! Do not get too attached to anyone because you'll never know who's going to die next.  \
Enjoyment: 9\
Just pure badass fun. Some dull moments. But way too much going on for me to care. Watch it. You will not be disappointed.\

    In a horrifying alternate universe, humanity is on the brink of extinction due to unexplained gigantic “titans”—huge, mindless, zombie-like humanoids whose only goal appears to be eating humans. Humanity has managed to hang on by building a series of high concentric circular walls to keep the giants out and by training a special military force that uses gas canisters and aerial techniques to get high enough to try to kill the giants before they are eaten. There are still huge amounts of casualties in each battle.\

    Ah, Shingeki no Kyojin, an anime which is honestly all over the place. It is the embodiment of 'epicness' yet it also manages to piss you off from time to time.\
The story itself sounded very odd to me, and I was originally not very interested in watching it at all, but after being pressed by both my friends and the internet, I took my time to watch it. And after the experience, I can't say I regret it. It was one of the more enjoyable anime out there. The story progresses with decent pacing, but felt somewhat rushed towards the end, making it very annoying\
          \
        to end on a cliffhanger. Although I never really mind an anime getting a second season, I do get genuinely pissed off when there is just no ending. There isn't any episode which somewhat resembles anything close to an ending. It's just a train of plot that keeps on going, and then suddenly throws you off at the end, rather than making you wait at the station.\
The animation and soundtrack in this anime are absolutely superb, and it's one of the main reasons why it is so enjoyable to watch. Every action scene is pulse-pounding, intense and manages to capture your attention for the entire duration of the fight. The soundtrack compliments this very well, having amazing openings, and a superb track overall, making everything feel more meaningful and powerful, something which not every soundtrack can do.\
Where the anime takes a hit for me, is on the characters. Apart from the happy few, most characters are rather annoying, and especially the main character is your typical stubborn, 'I'll sacrifice myself if I must!', hot-blooded young teen. This makes most of his decisions feel off and rushed, and it hurts the story in some way. I also thought most of the supporting cast wasn't particularly interesting, nor likeable, but maybe that's just me.\
Overall this anime is still amazingly fun, and if you do like action, you cannot miss this. If you're looking for a more advanced plot and mature characters, you might want to look elsewhere. But I'd say that this is an experience you do not want to miss. It might not be one of the best, but damn, it's good fun.\

    Attack on Titan Review (also my first review on this site)\
While this review might be a couple years late considering when Shingeki no Kyojin (often referred to as Attack on Titan), I think with the delays of season 2’s production and such, this isn’t a bad time to look at the first season. \
Summary (or way too long, don’t want to read that wall of text): \
             The biggest anime of its season, while having excellent technical (sound and animation) execution and overall world building, falls flat in characterization and making you care\
          \
        for the humans being killed. It needed more character depth so that when a character dies, you really felt the emotional weight rather than saying: “Wait, who was that again? Oh yeah, that person. Alright then…” It also slightly suffers from a premise that isn’t entirely original and doesn’t prove to be much more interesting than your average high school harem anime. While some may think it’s a good place to start watching anime from, I’d argue that other anime like FMA (either one) or Code Geass are better starting points, personally. Overall Score: 6/10 (Passable).\
Background:\
Even if you weren’t an otaku or avid anime fan, chances are that you heard about Attack on Titan when it first aired. The internet was enamored with this festival of blood, guts and giant naked monsters ripping apart humanity limb from limb. It was inescapable and filled discussion boards with fans and people who hated it, though the general otaku consensus (even the consensus of casual anime fans) was that this was a good anime. \
Plot/Story:\
So by the premise, this seems rather original and refreshing break from animes being strictly in high school or such. In some ways, it is. The world building demonstrated in AoT is one of the strong points in the series, setting up the often grim atmosphere and explaining the mechanics of how equipment works in this world. It also sets up a disheartening tone and some of the twists can lead to interesting developments. However, the plot is far from perfect. The biggest problems I had with the story it’s often glacial pacing, premise that starts out promising but ends up leaving a sour taste in my mouth after all is said and done. I won’t delve into spoilers, but they could have done a lot more with the story that was there. Score: 7/10.\
Characters:\
\9Oh boy… am I not going to make friends in this section. Up to now, it may seem like things have been rather positive. However, this is my biggest problem with Attack on Titan. Simply put: 90% of the characters in this anime are boring, one-note, and worse case: just titan chow. Before you send me all your hate and scorn filled PM’s or replies, this is simply a subjective opinion and I am sorry in advance if I seem rude or overly harsh. These are just my feelings on the characters of AoT.\
        With that out of the way… yeah. The side characters are largely forgettable. Jean is too stiff and uninteresting, Sasha is often just identified as potato girl, Levi is easily the biggest bore in the entire anime in my opinion, and the leads sadly don’t nullify these problems. Eren is also rather one note, with an understandably massive prejudice against the titans. The prejudice itself wasn’t the issue but more: “Yes, we know. You hate titans. Isn’t there anything else to your character?” Mikasa suffers even more, despite having a backstory that wasn’t too bad. Her biggest problem is that her strong and silent persona only goes so far, leaving the other half to being a Shinigami Beyblade of destruction along with Levi. Armin is the slight saving grace as a character, being a smart, yet nervous and emotional teenager. While some may see him as one note, I thought that he had more dimension to him and was one of the very few characters I was rooting for to make it out alive. The reason I am critiquing the anime so heavily here is because this is a show where we should feel that every life matters. Every person dying has a deep impact on not only the characters, but on the audience as well. Sadly, it only did the former slightly and at least for me, left no impression of sadness after seeing characters dying left and right.  Score: 4/10\
Sound:\
\9On an audio level, this anime has to be appreciated and celebrated. The score, done by noted composer Hiroyuki Sawano, was great. I may not be a big fan of electronic elements in anime scores but this soundtrack has everything form the somber, emotional tracks to the hard hitting and dramatic ones that emphasize what was on screen. One slight negative is that the score often had the potato chip problem. What’s the potato chip problem? In an anime called Death Note, it had a scene where the main character Light Yagami said: “I’ll take a potato chip… and eat it!” being played amongst overly dramatic music for that scene. Even with context, that score was a bit much and overly dramatic. This anime also has a similar problem. While most of it was deserved, some (like moving a boulder for what seemed like an eternity) got a little ridiculous and highlighted the fact that what was happening didn’t need the epic flourish it got. Score: 7/10\
Animation: \
\9In terms of animation, this anime also deserves high praise in that aspect. The relatively new production studio Wit (along with I.G) did a fantastic job, creating an artistically grim and dark theme, while knowing when to bring light in to contrast the fighting and the bloodshed. You could easily feel the movements the characters were pulling off (most of the time) and the budget must have been hefty. It also has a distinct art style, adding in dark, thicker lines around the characters to make them stand out against the background. Any complaints about the designs of the titans themselves is more or less a problem of the source material, so I won’t bring that up as an issue here. Overall, the animation was excellent and always was a marvel to see. Score: 8.5/10\
Overall: \
So… yeah. I will admit that I didn’t rewatch the show from when I first did a couple years ago, but this is how I remembered AoT. I can imagine I’ll get blasted from making mistakes on who did what or such, but my point still stands. \
           Attack on Titan is excellent from a TECHNICAL standpoint. The music and score are great overall and despite a few hiccups, performs admirably well. The problem is that it also highlights the lack of character depth and story. I understand that no anime is perfect, but for one as hyped and beloved as this, I think there are much better starting points for watching anime other than this show. While I see where people are coming from with this anime, I think it’s overhyped and disappointing, despite impressing me in a lot in small doses. My score is 6/10. ",

    Attack on Titan is good and deserves its praise, but being an obvious season 1 story has its drawbacks. It is one of those rare anime titles that rarely relies on the usual anime gags and tropes that one is used to seeing, making Attack on Titan far more universal in its appeal. This is the kind of anime that will most likely endear you to its supporting cast far more effectively than the protagonist, which is a strong point for a show's long-lasting appeal. Imagine Star Wars if Luke was the only interesting character - you get the idea.\
What ultimately holds the show back\
          \
        is that I spent a grueling 625 minutes of anime-watching over the course of several weeks just to find out the show doesn't reward my emotional investment. The whole point of the second half of the season is for the characters to formulate a plan to find answers to several key questions and mysterious surrounding the titans - then give the audience the middle finger. While admittedly several anime titles waste their entire first season on setup for a second season, I could not think of a worse anime to follow that cliche than Attack on Titan. This is a show that desperately needed a satisfying conclusion, but instead it gives you nothing in return other than the implied promise of a second season. Thankfully, there are recap movies by which you can get your setup for season 2 in less time and with less disappointment. \
Having said that, knowing it won't answer anything at all may brace you for said non-impact and thereby make the show more enjoyable to watch. Either way, as much as I just ripped into this show, I still gave it an 8. That should speak volumes.\

    Attack on Titans is one of those animes that you hear everybody talking about. \"Oh, the wings of freedom!\" \"Attack on Titans wooh-oo!\" And so recently I decided to give it a shot.\
And boy am I glad I did.\
Story(10): Attack on Titans took me away from the real world to the point I had to debate whether to go to the bathroom or not. The plot was phenomenal! I've heard in the Bible there were giants roaming the world thousands of years ago, and this anime gave me a large aspect of what it could've been like.\
Characters(9): Each and every one of the characters were\
          \
        to die for... (I personally think Mikasa should go die though), especially Levi. They each managed to capture your heart, despite their idiotic first impressions. Some have humor while others are bitter and serious, but somewhere in you're heart you'll manage to find a place for all of them.\
Art(9): Despite silently cringing from the facial expressions every now and then, I know that they are all to realistic. The faces of horror from seeing one of your comrades being ripped apart, or the fact that you notice you've finally taken down one of the 'abnormal' are the true faces of those who have experienced it.\
Sound (9): I alternated between watching the dub and sub, but yet in both of them they both had the perfect screams, yells, gun noises and everything else to the point. The dub seemed to have the perfect screams and yells of agony and accomplishment, where the sub had the perfect gun noises and other background noises.\
Enjoyment(10): For me AoT was raw entertainment, something that I rarely come across.\
Overall: 10. I cannot believe I'd never watched the magnificent show earlier!\

    A lot of people talk about AoT like its the next \"big\" anime, so I gave it a watch. The story is very straight forward, people have to protect themselves from giants. There is a good sense of dread and hopelessness in the first few episodes that make the struggle for the characters to fight all the more compelling. The action is brisk and fast paced. However that all changes in the show's second half when the pace of the show slows down considerably. The story is not over yet, as the manga is ongoing, so I don't know how fast or how slow the\

        rest of the story is. The plot twists are not too surprising; the second opening even spoils a major one! The first opening theme is memorable and gets you in the right mood for some hot blooded over the top action sequences. The show was never really  character driven. The main cast is not very well developed and borrows too much from standard anime tropes. There are way too many minor characters to keep track off and they enter and exit the show at a whim. Overall a good show with over the top action and good music, but the uneven pacing and the lackluster characters hurt the show. I can sorta recommend this one. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin, or Attack on Titan (which is the name I'll be using for this review), is one of the most popular anime of all time. However, popular doesn't always equal good. But sometimes it does. Where does Attack on Titan fall on this spectrum? I'd say somewhere in the middle. The story of Attack on Titan is pretty easy to understand. There are the huge humanoid titans which eat people, forcing humanity to build walls around themselves to keep the titans out. In concept, this is a pretty interesting story. There are a lot of mysteries about the titans and their origin that\
          \
        go unanswered in this season, but that just adds to the threat of the titans (unless they are the derpy abnormal titans). The story in this isn't anything too spectacular but still pretty good. Titans destroy the outer wall which makes everyone in that wall retreat into the second wall (which the anime loves to remind you about in the opening scenes of every single episode in the first arc), and the entire season is the group trying to slowly progress their way back to the outer wall and reclaim it.  The story is filled with some pretty predictable twists, but the show does present these twists in a very good way. Overall, story gets a 7/10.\
The art of these series is pretty great. The titans look menacing (when they are not running around stupidly), the characters have, while not the most unique designs, designs that do at least look different enough from others that they still seem real, and I can tell them all apart. I don't really have much else to say other than I really love the looks of the Colossal, Armored, and the other unique titans. 8/10\
The music in this series is so god damn good. The first opening itself is fantastic and iconic to the series, but I prefer the second opening, which has a more hopeful feel given what happened in the episode prior to it being first used. Other than that, the music that plays in each scene is just so amazing. Especially during the Trost arc. The music fits each scene perfectly, and matches the intensity of scene. 10/10 on this one.'\
Well, we couldn't keep of this streak of fantastic things for long, now could we? That's not to say that all of Attack on Titan's characters are awful, but most of them are. Our main character Eren, I did like, at certain points. But most of his time is just yelling about trust and fighting the titans, that it just gets boring. I especially did not like his naïve thinking that he could kill every titan and take back Wall Maria. Not only that, but he was just an asshole most of the time. He frequently calls people who don't want to fight the titans (which Eren also acknowledges how dangerous the titans are and that most people would die when they fought one) cowards, and people who want to join the MPD cowards. So, clearly, Eren thinks the Scouts are the only justified path. However, when Armin and Mikasa say they want to join the Scouts, Eren discourages this. He also gets very angry with Mikasa for trying to make sure that he is okay after fighting with titans. I get that this is just Eren's character traits, but he's our main character, so I would like to see something about his personality that makes me want to root for him to win. Luckily, Eren does become much more bearable in the second half of the series. Continuing on is Mikasa, our main female protagonist. Basically, she is great at everything, and the only thing on her mind is \"Is Eren okay?\". Yeah, I did not like her at all. Armin was a pretty good strategist for the group (in the first arc at least before he was shoved to the sidelines for a new strategist), but his constant whining did not make me like him all that much. Moving on to the only other two characters I want to talk about, is Jean and Levi. Jean is probably my favorite character in the series, because he is actually a good leader and is the only one to call out Eren about his guilt tripping and naïve determination. Levi is basically just the badass who always is never there when the group needs him. Anyway, moving on from specific characters into Attack on Titan's biggest problem. It tries to make you care about characters without giving them proper development. Some of these I can let slide like (SPOILERS) Eren's mom. Some of these though, are not excusable. I honestly don't even remember the character's names but at the beginning of the Battle of Trost, a whole ton of characters die, and the show makes is seem like this is incredibly sad moment. Sure, it may be sad for Armin and Eren, knowing these people for three years, but for the audience, we knew them for 3 episodes. I can't get attached to a character if you are going to kill them that quickly. Then there is another character who's name I do know, and who's death is towards the end of the Battle of Trost. The problem is, I only knew this character's name because people say it like 20 times after they died. Once again, Attack on Titan fails to give a character sufficient time for the audience to care about them before they kill them off. These same problem continue on into the second arc, but I think I'll cut it off there. 5/10.\
I honestly did enjoy Attack on Titan. The action scenes were brilliantly directed, the music was phenomenal and there were many moments that I could look past all of the bad characters and really just enjoy watching this anime. Despite all of its character problems, this anime is definitely worth checking out if you somehow haven't already. Overall, I would give Shingeki no Kyojin a 7/10.\

    The overall rating that I gave is based on my personal opinion.\
Story (10/10):\
I gave the story a 10 cuz it took a much complex story and made it so that younger audience can even enjoy it and understand what really is going on. The setting of the world scared of the titans and also the after apocalyptic atmosphere is just too good. The story is immersive from the very beginning of the anime and also very well executed. \
Art (10/10):\
The art suits the anime very well and also the TITANS they are just too much to say. The weird smile the look on their face\
          \
        is scary as well as too creepy. All the scenes were well done and there was no moment in the whole anime where the quality dropped.\
Sound (10/10):\
The sound-track of the first OP was just awesome and also very much suited for the post apocalyptic situation. Ending song was also good based on the intensity all the episodes ended.\
Character (9/10):\
The characters are all very awesome and also very much motivated to kill titans and each of the human character have their own agenda to why they want to kill the titans. In the first 3 episodes the young eren is just annoying as fuck and also armin is just a cry baby in the whole series. I was gonna rate the character low but one character stood out so much that I had to ignore armin and young eren. LEVI is just cool, he is like the life of this show not even battle scenes between titans and humans will fire you up as much as when you just see LEVI's entry.\
Enjoyment(10/10):\
Personally speaking this anime is for all the people out there. It has great story and also great setting. Epic battle scenes. Emotional charge. It has around everything in it. People who rate it below 8 are just pissed off because they are taking around 4 years to just release the second season and the first season ended on a cliffhanger. \
Overall(10/10):\
Just go and watch this series it is really worth and also 2nd season is about to come this fall. So this is probably the best time to watch it.\

    Let's be honest here. Attack on Titan is a really good anime. It's a clever idea and it's handled very well. I have not finished the series yet, but I am very close. So, here are my thoughts so far.\
Story: It's an amazing idea and it is a good story. Up to episode 13, it was one of my favorite shows, but then came the second half. After that, everything just became dark. There is a lot of blood and gore, so it shouldn't be watched by anyone under the age of 13. This anime is filled with twists and turns and it leads up\
          \
        to each one so well. The story is well thought out and I really recommend it. \
Art: Really mature art. The graphics are amazing and it gives off a vibe every time. It isn't realistic of course, but I really loved everything this anime threw at me. Even the blood.\
Sound: Yuki Kaji is one of, if not my favorite voice actor of all time. I love everyone's voice except Armin's. Armin sounds like a woman trying too hard to sound like a man. (Which it really is) The melodies work really well and the openings are amazing. Linked Horizon did an amazing job.\
Character: I love Eren, Mikasa, Levi, Christa, and pretty much everyone else. The women aren't sexualized which I liked. Each character has amazing character development and I was attached to each and every one of them. I was sad when Marco died too. \
Enjoyment: I love fighting animes. This is definitely one of them, but there is one thing this anime lacks. Humor. I want a good laugh out of a series, but AoT is too dark of a series to laugh about. Sure, Sasha is hilarious and there are funny bits here and there, but this anime was too dark for my taste, but intense enough to get above average.\
Overall, this anime is recommended. Everything is good as long as you overlook how dark and violent this series is. I love it and you should watch it as well.\

    I used to love this anime, I really did. But when waiting for season 2 I re-watched it and I had no enjoyment of it anymore.\
My enjoyment already went down, because I first thought the anime would be about a squad not just Eren, Mikasa and Erwin + Occasionally Levi and I enjoyed the dynamic between the people, but after a while it became the normal anime group 3 to 4 people working together, with a few clashes in the group (see D.Gray-man Kanda, Levi, Allen, Lenalee or Fairy tail Natsu, Gray, Elza and Lucy (and comedic useless character lucky)) and that dampened my love\
          \
        for the anime even when I was a great fan.\
Though I have to admit that the characters, fights, art and sound are good, nice detail and original.\
I think that you should see this anime ONCE or else you will not enjoy it that much anymore.\
First time rating: 8 (must watch)\
Second time rating: 5 (meh)\
Though it could be thanks to over exposure. It was everywhere just like the Minions and now I hate the Minions.\

    Attack On Titan has:\
- An AMAZING OST\
- A thrilling and unique story\
- A good mix of genres\
- VERY Smart Plot Twists\
Attack on Titan may not seem thrilling to some people at first, but as the show progresses, you will cry, feel your spine tingle and just be amazed at how awesome it is. There's not much to explain but make sure to watch with earphones. If you find that you don't enjoy the anime after approximately 10 episodes then drop it because it probably isn't your cup of tea. Overall it's has the best OST to date in anime. It is quite fast paced which\
          \
        will engross the viewer. One of the best anime's ever made. Period.\

My ratings for it are 9/10\
I really liked this anime not only because of the charactertics of the\
characters but also the story, somehow i wanted to see the backstory of\
Levi and Hanji as well but didn't happen.\
Every  episode was legit amazing specially with some cliffhangers, but\
what dissapointed me was the ending, SOOO MUCH MYSTERIES not yet\

a Masterpiece Rate of 10 but i just really feel like something else is missing through this\
          \
        anime.\
All in all, this anime was great and suitable for almost everyone's taste on anime but im afraid the rest of the internet had corrupted and spoiled this anime, for i just watched this right at this momeny after going through all different fanfictions (mostly from shipping anime chracters)\
i got real spoiled by this before watching it. *Rip in peace*\

Well, look no further, read on and you will find yourself with two choices, either watch the anime, or try to forget about it, only to watch it a couple of days later. My Reviews are always honest, and are not critiqued due to an anime's popularity.\
Ok so before i go into a slightly more detailed breakdown, go to your internet browsing search bar, and type in Mikasa Ackerman, (She's the chick from Attack on Titan). If that doesn't convince you, then, Good luck, in your future endeavours.\

        when you've got Mikasa, you can make up your own story with her\

Sound= Mikasa doesn't talk very much, love to hear a bit more umm sound, if you know what i mean\
Character= There's only one character either of us will give two CRABS about\
Enjoyment= Ummm, well how do i phrase this, Mikasa and what rhymes to \"Mass Creation\"\
Overall= Just go watch it already, If Mikasa doesn't appeal to you then Sasha will\
BTW, Levi is just fine for all the female audiences out there\

    This is my first anime review guys, so give me your opinions on what you think.\
SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN (spoiler free)\
Story (9/10) : For me, it was really captivating. I started watching and didn't want to stop, and that's what happened , honestly. I liked specially that it had few downtime from the main plotline, so I could keep the adrenaline that the previous episode gave to me and carry it until the end of the story. Although I haven't read the manga, people say the it's pretty on spot so I'll believe it.\
Art (9/10) : I did really like the screens and the animation was\
          \
        really great. Those spiderman webs were nice to watch, and the RPG moves we see were amazing as well.\
Characters (7/10) : This is for me where the anime falls the most. No character really captivated me that much since the beggining. I did feel like the main character was mostly annoying although the development made me believe the opposite sometimes. While that would've been a good time, the development of other characters did the complete opposite, specially on the main side characters.\
Overall, I think the anime is really decent. Perhaps watching it some time after it was released made me think a little less of it because of the fanbase of this anime. I feel like , even though it was a great anime, it was still totally overhyped. Can't wait to watch second season though!\

    Now, I haven't watched watched a lot of anime or read a lot of manga, but I must say, Attack on Titan really is one of the greatest shows I've seen, if not the greatest. I am not exaggerating when I say that the anime is beyond amazing. Of course, this is my own personal opinion, so my review may be the complete opposite of someone else's.\
To me, Attack on Titan is not only a story of survival, but of hope, ambition, and most importantly, love. It has all of the elements of a killer story:  an outstanding plot, relatable and lovable characters (mostly),\
          \
        and not to mention, out of the universe animation, which is more important than you'd think.\
Story (10/10): It is a story unlike any other that I know of. It honestly is quite complex, and has a lot more depth than you would think. There are way too many questions that need to be answered, and that just makes it a lot more interesting. The plot is thick, and keeps thickening as you go along. It's quite emotional and dramatic, but can also be hilarious at times. It's a brilliant story that revolves around the very popular topic of species-threatening enemies and human extinction. However, the topic or idea is taken to a whole new level with this anime. The titans are fucking horrifying. Seriously. The anime captures how terrifying these creatures can be. Also, the pace is quite fast, but you get used to it, and it honestly makes sense considering the events of the story. The titans don't give a fuck, y'all. What I do like most about this anime is how it sticks to the topic. I really dislike fillers, so I love how this anime has little to no fillers. \
Art & Sound (10/10): Okay... I'm seriously not kidding when I say that the animation is SO GOOD. Honestly, every aspect of the animation is brilliant. I can't stand watching anything that is not of good quality, so the art made everything so much better. I can say without a doubt that the animation of this show is THE BEST out of all the anime that I've had the privilege to watch. \
Characters (10/10): I love the characters more than I should, really. The characters all have very distinct personalities. We have the main characters, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin: one is super ambitious, one is a TOTAL BADASS, and one is hella smart. They have a wonderful relationship, and you can't help but grow to love them all. The supporting characters are great as well.. well, for the most part, at least. \
Enjoyment (10/10): You can obviously tell that I love this anime. I enjoyed it to an amount that cannot be comprehended. It was an emotional rollercoaster: I cried, I laughed, and I shit my pants a couple of times, too, and I absolutely loved it. The characters inspire me, and the story does too. I haven't watched an anime like it, and I doubt I will any time soon. It's just too good to be true. \
I recommend this anime to ANYONE and EVERYONE. You will undoubtedly enjoy it, regardless of who you are. Prepare yourself for a crazy rollercoaster. Don't worry, you'll love it. \

    It may have a simplistic premise, but Attack on Titan is one of the most compelling and addictive action anime I have ever seen. The story of the last bastion of human life fighting for survival may lack nuance, but it is one that will strike a chord with most viewers . It is like a form of extreme patriotism, except on the scale of the whole of humanity rather than a nation. The threat of the titans feels very overwhelming to the humans, creating a constantly tense atmosphere, as if a giant tornado were approaching but no one knew quite when it would strike.\
The\
          \
        tone then shifts and we see a more equal playing field. Humans are no longer running for their lives, but fighting for them. The second OP definitely reflects this less chaotic and more motivated aspect of humanity and the fight. Another plot point that keeps up the intrigue is the identity of the \"female titan\", which is revealed later on (although it is kind of obvious and could be seen coming). Discovering the contents of the basement is a great goal for the characters beyond simply surviving, and serves as further intrigue for the audience, but not really a mystery as of yet we have not really been given clues in the anime as to what it is, other than it could turn the tide of battle against the titans.\
The fight scenes in this anime are very well choreographed and fluid. The 2D animation of the characters actually works with some of the 3D backgrounds in some of the more ambitious shots, which I usually find distracting. The viewers' understanding of the titans' weakness makes the battles feel coherent and easy to follow, and we are aware that characters can be killed off, increasing tension (although the main three do feel safe).\
SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH- The titan transformation really added another dimension to both the plot and action of the show. The final fight between titan form Eren and Annie is a true spectacle to behold. It also opens up the possibility of the titan invasion being a man made thing, making it a whole lot more sinister than them just being another force of nature like a volcano.\
One way the anime falls down a bit is the characters. Eren can come off as a but annoying and overdramatic in that anime way. He ranges from quiet contemplation to YELLING THINGS TO LET YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY INTENSE OK? with no inbetween. Mikasa is a bit bland and the generic 'quietly the best at everything' stereotype- although her unwavering devotion to Eren and her tragic backstory do elevate her beyond being an awful character. Armin is my favorite of the three, a nerd stereotype but with a drive to also become physically tougher that makes him an admirable character. Hopefully season 2 gives us some more character development to make these characters a bit deeper.\
Overall, this is a great anime. It is compelling, action packed, beautiful to look at and has elements of a mystery that will be touched upon more in season 2. I would recommend the Japanese dub of this show, as I think the American/ English language dub is a bit too melodramatic and I personally hate American Eren. The titan roar is also spine chilling in the Jap dub, and annoyingly high pitched in the American dub.\
9/10- Has flaws and is simplistic but I enjoyed this anime more than I can remember enjoying any anime in a long while. \

    To be honest, I wasn't totally eager to watch Attack on Titan, and I put it off for quite awhile until like 2 weeks ago and just finished a few minutes ago. I thought it was overrated and still think it is overrated;however, that doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, it's a nice unique anime compared to a lot of the repetitive junk that is being pumped out today. When going into this anime, I probably would have given this a 6 but after watching I'll bump that up to an 8. There are still some issues though that really hold this anime back\
          \
        from being a 9 or 10 though.\
Here's a quick pros/cons list, then I'll get into more breakdown\
Pros:Good artwork/colors\
Realistic bodies/images(humans)vs exaggerated looks on Titans\
Good enough animation for the fights\
Passable voice actors and no obvious fails\
Decent enough storyline to make you want to find out more\
Music is fitting\
Some badass characters!\
\
Cons: WAY too much dialogue/explanations-especially in unfitting moments\
Overusage of stillshots/panning \
Too much idiocy of certain characters\
A little too slow to develop the storyline at times/feel like it's not progressing enough\
Wasted time on providing a summary of the last episode, when really not needed....\
Some characters are kinda flat/not developed well enough\
\
Okay, the story itself is pretty much based off ideas of the past where the greeks and the idea of titans, as well as titans were also mentioned in other pantheons. The most basic sense of humans being eaten by Titans is actually a really old idea. Therefore, this isn't a totally original work, but at least it is refreshing how they build around the simplistic idea of humans vs titans. Although, it is a little questionable still on how the walls were build so quickly and how high they got the walls. That itself still is a minor issue that bugs me. It logically doesn't really make sense how that was done. Another annoying plot point is what's in his father's basement-the WHOLE season they kept hinting it but never get to it. At this rate, it won't be to like one of the last episodes until we really find out what's in there. The anime often does this by mentioning certain things, but then later on it puts the breaks on or just drops that idea for quite awhile. And the ideas it really wants to develop it takes several episodes to really finish its development, and it gets hampered by unnecessary scenes/thought pauses/slow motions/long dialogue.\
But back to the main story, you have your main characters Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Then you have a bunch of supporting characters and for a little bit it will be tough for the watcher to learn and remember all these different characters. It took me a few episodes to learn their names haha. One could argue there are too many characters, I don't think that there were. Especially for this anime, it is necessary to have lots of characters or it would get kinda boring with just Eren. Eren himself just acts and shouts and rages pretty much through the whole series. Not really gonna spoil what happens to him other than he transforms, and that he wants to kill all titans, that's all the character development we get from our main man Eren. A little weak. The same is kinda said for Mikasa. Although Mikasa herself is a badass fighter, she suffers like the rest of the female characters as getting put into a specific character stereotype/genre and that's it. Mikasa gets little to no character development other than \"I MUST PROTECT/SAVE ERIN\".... She just acts off that thought... and it's pretty bland after awhile. Further point on the female cast, some say there is a strong female cast of characters... I kinda disagree with this statement. Mikasa is just a one track mind although is fun to watch, Annie for the most part is just a cold girl who shuts herself off to most people but also fights well, the creepy scientist chick who came out of some hentai/fetish novel, and Sasha the potato chick who is also crazy, and some other female characters that don't get that much time on the screen. Point is, they act a bit standoffish or are just weird. To me, a strong female character needs to invoke a certain emotion and I really should care about them, I just didn't get that bond with any of them. Just making one fight like a badass isn't enough. Back to our 3 main dude, Armin. Armin gets some nice development in his character, the weak physical boy but is a rather smart tactical genius who learns not to constantly doubt himself and carry through his actions. Armin isn't my favorite character, but he really did step up and blossom. Eren and Mikasa didn't really change from the beginning and got stagnant. \
For supporting characters, one of the best characters that got really good character development is Jean. Jean at first was a total arrogant douchebag, now he's  a stronger person who doesn't act only for himself, but still is a bit of an arrogant douchebag. Strangely, but at times you feel like he should have been the main character as you just see him change and step up as a person. Other good characters are of course Erwin and Levi. These two bring the necessary leardership that is needed to take down the titans and I love these 2. Badass characters, but ones who never reveal all their cards at any moment. That's how you make characters intrigue a watcher! The rest of the characters aren't really worth talking about. \
Focusing on artwork, you know what it's a great refresher from all the stupid harem/cutesy school days crap. REALISTIC human figures is nice for a change! It's almost like the artwork was a purge to all the crap that is flooding anime right now. However, there were a few  minor flaws with the artwork. For some reason, there were WAY too many stillshots and were overused to the point to make one wonder if the animators were lazy/trying to save money. way overdone. Also, the camera pans out at times to random assss shit that also wonders if they were just being lazy. The animations for the fights were pretty good for the most part, especially the Titan fights! That's a strong suit of the anime, but surprisingly, that doesn't make up much of the anime at all. More talking than walking is what i would say :P\
Another minor annoyance is that they provided a summary from the last episode in the current episode which eats up time.... We honestly don't need that. Most AOT fans are diehards. \
Finally, the sound/voice acting is not bad for the subbed. There were no characters that I was like \"that was horrible voice acting\", all their voices I think fit their characters relatively well. There are no captivating performances though.\
tl;dr\
No captivating performances pretty much sums up this whole anime. The best way to sum it up is that everyone of your friends says this diner is really good, you go to try it out, and while it looks pretty good, when you dig in you're not disappointed, but you're wondering why your friends think it's so great. You didn't waste your time, but you expect more than what was given.\
That's basically AOT. \

    Attack On Titan was what got me into anime in the first place. I never gave anime a chance until I was 24 years old and randomly passed by the screen and my boyfriend was watching the scene with the female titan and I got interested. Now I love anime!!! And that is thanks to Attack On Titan.\
This series is very popular and for a good reason. The story gets better as it continues and the manga is also amazing so far. Most of the characters are well developed and the animation is beautiful. The 3dmg scenes are one of my favorite things about this\
          \
        anime. \
Everyone that I have introduced to the series have enjoyed it and most are not anime fans at all. I cannot wait for Season 2 because it's going to be amazing! \

    Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin on this site, and in a lot of places) is huge. HUGE. And I'm not just talking about the size of the Titans (although most of them are pretty huge too), I'm talking about the fact that everyone and their mother knows about this series, even if they haven't seen it. Also the fact that this introduced a lot of people (myself included) to anime, and seeing how this is the first anime I ever watched, I figured I should take a look at it. Let's go. \
Story: Yes, I have read the manga, and I do have\
          \
        a couple of problems with the story arcs that haven't made it to the anime yet, but since talking about them would give a ton of stuff away, I'm not going to talk about that here. So, the story here is that the last of humanity have been pushed into living within three giant walls by monsters called Titans, who prey on humans. In the first episode, the outermost wall falls to the Titans, who have become a threat again after a century of relative inactivity. In the midst of this threat, Eren, a boy who lost his family to the titans, sets out to KILL THEM ALL! \
The story is surprisingly complex despite having a fairly basic premise, and they do bring up quite a bit of what is wrong with this world. While there is a lot left hanging and storylines that haven't gone anywhere yet, those problems are mostly negated by the fact that it isn't over yet. I also like that it actually deconstructs a lot of typical shonen cliches, something it does well. Basically, the story, while it has its problems and leaves a lot of loose strings and holes, is pretty good, and it isn't bogged down by filler either (always a good thing). \
Art: I love the animation and imagery in this. It pretty much gets everything right in this aspect. The backgrounds are all beautiful, especially the forest scenes, the walls, and the various towns. The characters are fairly distinct from each other, and none of the designs look off-model or weird. The Titans, especially the Titan Shifters, all look appropriately creepy and grotesque. The fight scenes and anytime someone uses the maneuver gear are awesome. Basically, the animation and the imagery are amazing, and I would watch the anime over and over again just to look at it. \
Sound: Another A+ for the soundtrack. It's awesome, it's beautiful, and it ranges from quiet and calm to loud and booming very well. The two opening themes are great, and when I was watching the show, I got excited about starting a new episode just to hear them. \
As for the voice acting, I personally prefer the Japanese version, which is excellent. The English version is fine, but this is a big show, both in terms of visuals and in terms of emotion, and I just felt like the Japanese voice actors did the big, sometimes over-the-top emotions of the characters better than the English ones. \
Characters: This is where the show falters the most. I know a lot of people don't like Eren, but I think he's fine. Other than screaming a lot and yelling about how he's going to kill all the titans, he doesn't have that many horribly annoying character traits, and he does grow up a bit throughout the anime and especially the manga, so I'm pretty okay with him. The other two main characters, Mikasa and Armin, are far more likeable (at least for me). I know a lot of people don't like how devoted to Eren Mikasa is, but to be fair, it's presented as a flaw and she has good reason for it, adding some depth to a character I would probably find kind of boringly invincible otherwise. She is awesome, though, one of the show's more bada## characters. Armin is also quite interesting in that he isn't really that good at fighting, but he's incredibly smart, and he puts those skills to use throughout both the anime and manga, making him surprisingly fun to watch after a couple of episodes watching him scream and cry a lot. The characters also compliment each other quite well, making their interactions pretty good. \
The problems come with the supporting characters. With a couple exceptions, most of them aren't really developed beyond a couple of traits, and anyone who isn't in Eren's immediate group of friends only gets enough development so you feel bad when they die. A lot of them get some further development in the manga, so I can't complain too much, but the lack of character or development beyond a couple of traits really hurts the show as a whole. When the characters do get development (Jean), or an interesting backstory and memorable traits (Hange), it's done well, so maybe the anime will give the other supporting characters time to grow as the series goes on. Right now, they're kind of lacking, though. \
Enjoyment: For the most part, I enjoyed the show. While there were a couple of parts where the plot dragged or there wasn't enough going on, it's a lot of fun to watch and I always finished one episode looking forward to the next. Again, it had some pacing problems, but it was never bad. \
Overall, I don't really think that Attack on Titan is the best anime ever, but it's certainly not bad either, and I can definitely call it good. The story is interesting (if a bit confusing), the animation and soundtrack are great, and while not all of the characters are all that interesting, they do the job for a show like this. I'd definitely recommend it, and I do think it's good. ",

    So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that you've at least heard of this anime, so I'm gonna just give you warnings to go into, not really a review.\
1. Don't get attached to characters: You die, I die, the dog, and that sweet old lady who brought you dinner. Everyone is capable of dying, so don't bother getting attached.\
2. It lags: The story will lag in some places. Mostly to build up a certain tone for the story. If you don't like that, then I suggest you skip this series. \
3. Gore: A ton of it. Blood, guts, people getting munched then\
          \
        vomited. The only thing that would make it worse is if they were eating babies...Wait.\
4. Over Voice Acting: From both the Japanese and English voice actors. I love Yuki Kaji, but tone it down bro. \
5: Confusing Plot: This is a very twisted and mysterious story. It seems straight forward at first, trying to kill the titans, but it quickly becomes a 'WTF Fest'.\

All they way a humorless anime but without any other real depth.\
What bugged me the most and hindered my enjoyment, endless scenes of dialogue discussing the same thing over and over again. Mainly that people were afraid of dying.

        might have been great scenes, but when the setting is giants are going to eat us one way or the other, these scenes didn't make any sense and only served to make angry and bored. \
There aren't any noteworthy characters to speak of. Even the main characters are blunt and forgettable. I would forget the main man's name, Eren, if it wasn't repeated every five minutes.\
For my the most interesting character was the horse that came when her master  whistled and had a taste for human hair.\
I watched all of it but i was bored most of the time. I wouldn't watch a new season.\
i cannot understand how a humorless anime with such poorly drawn characters is so popular, but then again i don't really get people\

    In my opinion attack on titan was a great anime to watch mainly because of the amazing art and characters. My favourite character was obviously Levi mainly because he was just so cool!\
But one thing I find annoying about this series is the huge wait between series 1 and 2, I mean they're trying to catch up to the manga but what's the point when they leave the series on a huge cliffhanger and leaving the fans in a massive feeling of suspense. Also they are making a live action adaptation of this BUT WITHOUT LEVI, how the hell can they make it a good\
          \
        film without the coolest character in the series!!!! Overall, I think anybody who wants to watch should just wait till 2016 because if they watch it now when they watch the 2nd season they'd have already forgot the entire story already. But it is pretty cool.\

    The biggest problem here is the execution.\
The idea is pretty neat all and all but lacks that technique, that experience, that will keep the machine running.\
Story - It started really good as a blend of Gantz with Full Metal Alchemist and level until episode 10 it felt interesting, but after that it goes downhill.  It gets lost on over dramatization, enormous flashbacks that don't matter because all the characters are completely one dimensional, and the fights become Dragonball Z-ish (in a bad way). But still, as any fast food, it will keep you addicted, mainly for the mysteries. \
Art - They copied the art\
          \
        style from the manga, which is pretty bad, added some amazing lights and effects and that's it. It worked, but there's nothing incredible.\
Sound - The soundtrack is superb, the first opening is already enormously iconic because it's brilliant. Adding to that all the other themes are awesome and adds a lot to the scenes.\
Character - Flat. One dimensional. Boring. Mikasa may be the most bland and boring character I've ever seen.\
Enjoyment - It has some pretty good ideas that will keep you going, but overall, not that good. I mostly enjoyed it from re-imagining how to make the combat feel more intense.\

    I thought I should give this anime a try, after seeing so much hype and recommendations from my friends, but I have to admit, I am slightly disappointed.\
Story - 7/10\
A good, original story, with a huge sense of tragedy and survival, and the major recurring theme of human choice. However, I felt that after the first 7 episodes, it kept on re-using the same 'fight or flight' scenario and the episodes really are not distinctive. Also, I felt cheated at the length of every episode - it says its approx. 24 minutes, however 4 mins is used for back-tracking the previous episode and opening credits\
          \
        and the last 4 mins go towards the end credits. Therefore each episode lasted approx. 18-17 mins and I caught up very quickly in just 3 days (13 eps).\
Art - 7/10\
Great artwork, really enjoy the chase scenes and the aerial fight moves are done with great precision and awesomeness that it keeps you pulled into the series. The titans are positively gruesome and harrowing, and the graphic scenes really paint a scene of terror and fear. Character designs are good, however after a while, the same palette scheme of brown and grey is getting boring, and sometimes re-uses shots to explain flashbacks and memories, thus adding towards the repetitive nature of the series.\
Sound - 8/10\
The background music in the action sequences is brilliant and really absorbs the viewer into how significant the scene is. The series uses a good blend of fast-paced and solemn rhythm, and perfectly mirrors the situation at hand. The voice acting is fairly good, except for when some characters start shouting/exclaiming and then you can't take them seriously (I'm looking at you, Armin -_-) Sound effects are good, however I'm not a fan of the opening and end credits.\
Character - 5/10\
Oh dear. This is where I was crushed.The main characters are very unlikable! Lets start with Eren.\
Eren is by far very irritating and unsympathetic after the first 2 episodes. I understand that his childhood was very traumatic, and has influenced his current personality, and I have to admit, his strong ambition is admirable, but I just hate the way he has to preach to everyone -and I mean EVERYONE- about his views on the war against titans, and about cowardice, etc. He is violent and angry to those who disagree with him, he pushes away those who are willing to help him (like Mikasa) and his constant pep talks about why he joined the military is just so repetitive and boring that you might as well skip a few scenes. I don't understand why so many see him as very skillful in the army, as after 13 episodes, he shows no outstanding fighting skills, no brilliant intelligence, and only ability is to transform and often initiate reckless behaviour. \
Mikasa is extremely bland. Fair enough she provides good action scenes between her and the titans, and her backstory is different to what I predicted, but her current personality is boring and uninteresting. I find that she is only there just to provide a cliched, mysterious soldier character to the plot, but unfortunately doesn't work.\
And oh god, the worst is Armin. I can sort of see what the writers are trying to do in portraying a helpless, weaker character and his reaction to death and responsibility and duty in war, however his constant  constant CONSTANT wimping out starts to grate on me, and I feel that the storyline has slowed considerably due to his pathetic and wimpy monologues about how weak he is, should he stay or should he go, etc. Also, I don't understand why he is seen as exceptionally intelligent with battle theory with the titans, as so far, the ideas that he has contributed are that of common sense and could be spewed from other characters.\
The only characters that I like watching and want to continue seeing in the future episodes are Annie and Sasha, as I feel that they give room for development and don't just have one stock personality. I know that many say that Sasha is not needed as comic relief, but I feel that her character breaks up the constant bland screen time of the three protagonists, and as the series progresses, we actually see her change, from providing comedy to sadness, as we share her reactions from being on the frontline.\
Enjoyment - 6/10\
The series provides exactly what you are looking for - action, tragedy, horror and survival. Though some scenes are quite predictable, I still cannot get over the constant sudden death and horror of it all, and it continues to paint a story of ongoing terror and sudden turns of fate. These elements really do grip you though, so I think many will enjoy the random effects and thoughts the scenarios give you.\
Overall - 6/10\
Apart from the disappointing characters, I will still continue to watch as I find the minor characters interesting and hopefully the story should pick up and fill in some plot holes. I do find the strong emphasis on the themes to be effective.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazing anime; no wonder why it has gotten so popular.\
     First of all, the story is outstanding~ There is always a plot twist so sometimes it is hard to figure out what's going to happen next.\
     Secondly, the art is also outstanding~ The drawings are really detailed, especially the maneuver gear which is a good thing because the 3DMG is an important part of the story and it allows the audience to view how it is like to be on it.. I haven't seen a drawing mistake yet(Maybe except Levi's height though,\
          \
        he gotten taller.) \
     In addition, the sound and character are great~ I like how the voices reflect the character's personality REALLY well and how there are awesome sound affects for things like when the titans appear. However, out of all these wonderful scores, I would have to give enjoyment a 7 and the reasoning behind that is: IT'S TOO SAD! So many people died. Overall, I rate this anime a 9 and I highly recommend it. Well, this is the wonderful Shingeki no Kyojin for you.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin was an anime recommended to me by my older sister. For days, she had been pestering me to watch it and now, after watching the entire series I understand her infatuation.\
Shingeki no Kyojin has a typical shounen plot, a group of warriors fighting against a certain unbeatable foe. Due to this, many characters die in battle even before you can connect with that character. However, 2 aspects of SnK's plot greatly intrigue me. The first aspect is how the story reminds me of our world today. At some point in our lives, we feel confined within the gates of our homes or\
          \
        our lives. We always yearn for freedom amidst its grave consequences. The second aspect is how Shingeki no Kyojin sparks inquisitiveness not only about its fictional dystopian world but also about our world today. Each time a new secret of how the SnK world was created, I stop and think to myself, \"How was our world created?\". In retrospect, the relatability of Shinegki no Kyojin's plot covered up its flaws.\
Amidst the plot, the art of this anime is something to love. The artists make us of bold lines around the focus of each character which helps you truly experience the emotions of the characters. The tragedies are tragic, the fighting is gruesome and the laughter is full of elation.\
Like everything and everyone, Shingeki no Kyojin is not perfect. Its protagonists, Eren, Mikasa and Armin aren't the most likable or unique characters. Eren is an ordinary protagonist with revenge as his motive. Mikasa is too perfect or unrealistic. Armin is not well developed. \
\
All in all, Shingeki no Kyojin is an enjoyable anime. It will make you laugh, cry and got through deep cogitation about its symbolic aspects. I highly recommend you to watch it.\

Shingeki no Kyojin.....easily the most popular anime of 2012-2013 and as much as people like to hate on it just for it's hype,  I truly believe it deserves the attention. \
Story 10/10\
First off the plot is extremely interesting. How often do you get an anime with medieval spidermen fighting naked man-eating giants? enough said.\
Some people might think the pacing of the story is slow but i don't notice it. Each episode passes by extremely fast and I enjoy every second of it.\
Art 10/10\
Some of the most beautiful action scenes ever. They never cease to amuse/amaze me.  Scenery is preeee nice aswell.\
Sound 10/10\
OSTs are\
          \
        spot on. Chances are that SnK will have one of the best set of soundtracks you have ever laid your ears upon.\
Opening and Ending themes are very likeable. Personally I like the second Op and Ed better, but the 1st one will always be the most memorable.\
Character 9/10\
I thoroughly liked many of the characters in SnK. Whether you like characters based on their looks, their personality, or their growth I believe that there is a character for everyone to latch on to:P  Personal favourites are Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Petra, and Levi!!!!!\
Enjoymnet 10/10\
SnK is an abosolute a thrill to watch both visually and mentally. This anime intelligently follows the struggles, losses, and sacrifices of both the brave and the weak. \
The icing on the cake of the SnK experience was definitely the 2-3min recaps at the beginning of each episode. I never got tired of re-watching my favorite moments from the previous episode. \

    Shingeki No Kyojin carries the strong theme of humanity vs the enemy, in its case, humanity vs the titans. The theme of extinction of humanity has been a theme that many people have aspired and been inspired by. In this anime, it can be said that this theme is carried out very well through the anime. There is little to no fault in the anime making it perfectly enjoyable for many viewers. Though it is not recommended for young viewers, it can be an eye opener for them to see that the world may not be as kind and honest as they believe it to\
          \
        be. \
The graphics and music used in this anime in my personal opinion have blown my mind away! it makes you feel as through you are a part of the story and the events. The music which strongly supports the scenes make the intensity reach the sky! it definitely has exceeded my expectations. \
Overall this anime was very enjoyable and outstanding for me to watch as it carried exactly the type of stories and theme i appreciate. The gruesomeness and fight in this anime truly has taught me lessons that i will carry on with me. \

-an aveage human (aka idiot) but brave.\
-a beautiful woman, intelligent, depressive but strong. \
2-ScreenPlay : I'll try not to spoil... humans are getting endangered by titans, these creatures are strong but with an IQ of a trisomic. Category : Survival... many die and you don't know who's next.\
3-Suspense : At the end of each episode, you can't wait to see the next.\

    Compared to all the recent crap I've seen, Attack on Titan is truly a breath of fresh air. Nowadays, the quality of anime is really degrading, what with all the kawaii school girls and fan service and pointless nonsense people are all mulling over. But Attack on Titan is different. It doesn't feature big round chests and lolicon. It's a story of survival and hope. \
Story: 7/10 The story is pretty simple: Mankind ceases to exist thanks to Giants, and they are forced into living like cattle out of fear and oppression. It's not entirely original, yet the idea isn't overused either. There are a\
          \
        lot of interesting factors and subplots that make the entire anime a thrilling roller coaster ride. There are plenty of unexpected twists that send you on the edge of your seat, and there's also a sense of dread as you repeat the words ''nobody is safe.'' As the anime progresses, we learn a bit more about the Titans and the characters as well. And something tells me this is an anime that will never be out of date. \
Art: 9/10 Well, what can I say? The character design is simple but realistic, not like the tons of weird hair angles and enormous breasts you see in most anime today. The landscapes are also somewhat believable, and the animation is just...wow. I've never seen better. It's all so crisp and detailed and it just blows your mind. At least, it did for me.\
Sound: 9/10 The opening themes fit so well with this anime. You have the war chants and lyrics that urge you to fight, yet it doesn't sound weird at all. The music just sent my head in a cloud. The background themes are also outstanding. They come in at the most perfect moments, with a balanced intensity and harmony with the current scenes. \
Character: 7/10 The characters aren't exactly special. They're all just regular people trying to fight for their lives and the sake of humanity (with the exception of a few). Our protagonist is a hardheaded, stubborn little twit who's obsessed with exterminating the Titans. But hey, at least he's realistic. With the shit he's seen, it's really not surprising that he'd vow revenge against those bitchheads Giants. Then we have the overly protective foster sister who, to me, just seems more on the Mary Sue side (in case you don't know, a Mary Sue is a perfect female character). I mean, she's pretty, she's strong, and I'm betting my eyeballs she also smart. She's also very reliable and not exactly the selfish whore you might expect. There's also that tragic life story that makes you cry. Most of the male viewers probably want to marry her or something. Seriously, how'd she end up this way? We also have the annoying best friend who's weak both physically and emotionally. He's a whining bastard who can't even defend himself and is always relying on his friends to save him. Although he's  a fucking genius who has saved his friends' asses due to his clever plans, he still thinks he's done nothing at all. The other characters are simple human beings just like us, and they're all believable. Each character has his or her own unique personality, strength, and flaws.\
But one thing a lot of people complain about is that many characters just get eaten by the Titans, and while we feel a little sorry for them, we immediately forget their names afterwards. All I really have to say is this: if we were put in the same situation as the characters in this story, wouldn't we have felt the same thing? I mean, in the real world, we always feel some sympathy for the unfortunate, but 5 seconds later we can't even remember who they are. Say, a couple kids got shot. We'd probably cry a little, but after some time we'd have no idea what their names were, and that is how it is in Attack on Titan. It reflects the brutality and cruelty of this world.\
Enjoyment: 9/10 I'm out of words. This anime is impossible not to enjoy, what with all its twists and turns, realistic events and characters, heart-thumping scenes. \
Overall: 8/10 I recommend this anime to anyone who likes action and thrill. It's  rich and exciting, and just out of this world. While it may not completely live up to all the hype it receives, it's still gonna make your head explode (in a good way).\

    I'm going to compare this to another popular anime, so people who don't click expand will get a good overview of how I see Shingeki.  I'm sure some of you will hate me for this, but this feels like a better version of Sword Art Online (the first half, we do not speak of the second half).  Hear me out, It has got two semi overpowered, romantic leads fighting these Titans (Bosses) to save the humans trapped there from death.  And if they win, everyone can go back out into the world.  Yay!  I have much higher hopes for Shingeki\
          \
        though, but who knows perhaps the writers are all out to troll us.\
The overall plot is great.  I'm a sucker for anything medieval / related generic-ish western fantasy.  They do a good job of keeping the anime suspenseful throughout.\
I have a few problems with parts of the story though.  Don't expect this anime's story to surprise you, the story is pretty transparent at some points.  This becomes a problem because one of this anime's main driving forces is suspense (this goes hand in hand with apocalypse type things btw).  So sometimes this transparency ruins the suspense.  Think failed Gandalfs and shit.  A certain battle towards the middle also felt really stretched out to me.\
Art is good imho, too be honest I don't really give a fuck about the art as long as its not terribad/super inconsistant/i can tell characters apart.  Sometimes it kinda bugs be that the characters are drawn so differently from the backgrounds, but that's just their style I guess, and like I said idc.\
Sound is good, nothing super awesome, nothing to complain about.  It fits well with the anime.  It never crossed my mind to downlaod the soundtrack though, which I will do for my favorites.  I definitely won't be singing any praises.\
Overall I enjoyed this anime a lot.  It comes together well, and it's refreshing, enjoyable, and it has feels.  Sometimes you just gotta have those feels.  My only worry is that they'll do something stoopid when they try to explain the titans, but alas, I digress.  Hopefully you have a better idea of this anime, and have decided to watch it.  Trust me it's good.\

    Where do I start with Shingeki no Kyojin? It's incredible.\
I heard that it was the best anime ever from some people and others said it was highly over-rated so they didn't like it. Personally, I think it wasn't the best anime ever but it's definitely one of my favourites.\
I really liked the art for some characters, but I wasn't a fan of the way some characters were drawn. The titans looked amazing and their facial expressions were done really well. I liked how Levi, Mikasa, Petra, Eren, Christa and Sasha were drawn and there are more, but I'm going to stick with those six. \
The\
          \
        titans were my favourite thing regarding the art, they just looked badass, especially the Colossal Titan. They just looked really cool.\
I really liked the characters in Shingeki no Kyojin, there was one maybe two that annoyed me but I really liked the rest. I really liked Levi, Mikasa and Sasha. I think each character has their own unique trait and that it makes them better. \
The story was amazing, I really liked the intro to what happened when the titans first appeared. The story was really interesting and I became kind of obsessed with Shingeki no Kyojin.. The story was captivating and really enjoyable. And I love the 3D Maneuver Gear, it looks like so much fun.\
Overall I love Shingeki no Kyojin, I don't think it's the best anime ever but it's not far off it in my opinion. I recommend you give Shingeki no Kyojin a try and decide for yourself if it's over-rated or if it is the best anime ever or if it's just really amazing\

    \"I want to see and understand the world outside. I don't want to die inside these walls without knowing what's out there!\"\
 When I first started watching Attack on Titan, I was instantly bitch slapped with an extremely high level of feels. In 1 episode, it got the entire audience feeling depressed, yet at the same time totally pumped to continue watching. I know what you're thinking, \"This anime isn't even half over, and yet you're writing a review about it giving it a perfect 10, what the hell are you thinking? NOT HELPFUL!\". Now, before you do that, continue reading, there is a reason\
          \
        I'm rating this 10, and I will update this again once the show continues on, most likely when it ends. To this date, I haven't been this pumped to watch an anime the day it airs since Fairy Tail. Now, let's start talking about reasons why...\
 First of all, when it comes to anime, I can usually let a show's uniqueness in storylines slide. I can't tell you how many visual-novel-based animes I've seen with the same exact plot. But I also know that most people would drop the anime if they have the same concept before. Luckily, Attack on Titan has a completely unique storyline to it, and I was definitely not disappointed. It takes place in what I would call a parallel world, due to the fact that despite the year being 845-850, they have advanced technology, yet still live like they were in the medieval times. There is one problem though: they're living inside an extremely large wall to keep creatures known as Titans out. Titans are these human-like giants that feast on normal sized humans. They cannot reproduce, but they never get hungry, so they feast on humans because they enjoy it. Sick. A group of people known as the Recon Corps try to discover new facts about Titans so that they might be able to defeat them and live happily once again. But one day, a Colossus of a Titan knocks down the first wall, letting a large amount of Titans get in, and then it just disappears. The story is mainly focused on Humanity's survival against the Titans. Very intriguing if you ask me, and it's full of action and suspense, and a crap ton of cliff hangers.\
 Attack on Titan was animated by Wit Studio, who has been known for very few animes, one in which was Robotic;Notes, the other being a movie called Hal. Now, despite Wit Studios being one of the lesser known companies, they did an EXCELLENT job with the art style. The characters are expertly drawn, the Titans give off a threatening but realistic vibe to their art style, and the setting of Attack on Titan is one of the most detailed I've ever seen.\
 As for the voice actors, we have Yuki Kaji (Lyon from Fairy Tail, Issei from High School DxD) voicing the main protagonist, Eren. Next we have Yui Ishikawa (Dhianeila from Heroic Age) voicing Mikasa. Last we have Marina Inoue (Yoko from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) voicing Armin. I must say, they have done an excellent job giving their characters emotion and realism when it comes to their personalities and overall sounds. I have enjoyed the cast's performance so far, and I can't wait to see who'll come in next.\
 There are few animes I've watched that have no characters that I hate. Attack on Titan has a few characters that I don't really hate per se, I just don't particularly care if they get eaten later on. However, none of the main protagonists I have a problem with actually, in fact one of them is one of my favorite characters period. To start off, Eren. His main goal is to join the Recon Corps so he can go explore the world since he's been trapped inside the walls for his entire life due to the dangers that lie outside. He has some anger issues, but for good reasons mostly, however that might come as a problem later on, in fact it kind of has already, but his spirit is what is keeping him alive. Next is Mikasa, and she was the favorite I was talking about before. She's calm, cool, strong, and kind of cute if you ask me. She isn't technically related to Eren in any way, but she started living with him and his family after an incident a few years back (again, not spoiling anything). Her strength and skill is what makes her such a good character, and she does have a caring personality overall. Last is Armin. At first glance, he's weak, he cries a lot, but he is a good leader and very brave. He's able to make logical decisions and plans, and that helps out later on. He isn't particularly strong, he has not fought a lot so far, but he has enough will power to continue on.\
 I'm enjoying the HELL out of this anime, no joke. I've been keeping up with every episode, I've even gotten some of my friends to watch it, and they're enjoying it as well. So do I recommend that fans of the action/thriller genre watch this? Yes. This is highly acclaimed, and it's even made it to #8 somehow on MAL when it's only 12 episodes in. Not all of you may enjoy this, some might think it's overrated, which is exactly how Sword Art Online got mixed feelings about and had half of the audience loving it with the other half hating it, but I really suggest you watch this until it ends for you to make a decision whether you like it or hate it. You now have my permission to rate \"Not Helpful\" if I have not made my point clear enough. ",

    I'm completely serious with my 5 10's. I hope you'll understand why, after reading this review.\
Normally I'm a really sensitive person when it comes to blood and gore. Which is why I wanted to stop watching Shingeki no Kyojin after the first episode, as it made me feel sick... but also very interested, strangely enough. Huge, ugly beasts known as Titans suddenly appearing outside the peaceful walls Maria, Rose and Shina, causing panic and devastation among the people living inside the walls.\
The story is very well thought out. While it isn't an unknown concept, it feels new and it doesn't feel worn out. The animation\
          \
        is flawless, and (don't hate me for this) so much better looking than the manga. They managed to make the scenery breathtakingly beautiful; the characters aren't lacking in the animation department, either.\
Speaking of characters - what a colourful bunch of people. There are so many major and minor character but somehow you get to know a little about them all as each episode goes on. Some are really complex and it takes time to understand their mindset (don't get me started on what I've thought of Levi throughout these 25 episodes... all I can say is I love him _now_), but some are people you quickly learn to love and understand.\
I laughed, cringed, wanted to scream and rip my hair off and cried about twenty times during this series. If wanting to make you feel thousands of things several times per episode was one of the things they aimed for - they succeeded, at least with me.\
All in all - Hajime Isayama has done a great job in creating this series and it has quickly risen to the top of my all-time favourites. Here's hoping for a second season!\

    I finally gave into this anime. I have not read the manga (as of yet), so I have no background information at all. \
Let me just say, I’m mad at myself for not watching it earlier, and I’m mad at myself for watching it too early before it finished… because I just can’t wait an entire week to know what happens next. The cliffhanger endings make me want to watch it even more. It doesn’t waste time with irrelevant information. This show is very intense, and if you cannot tolerate the slightest bit of blood or violence, it might not be for you.\
\
[Abridge storyline:\
          \
        The human race is about to be destroyed by these gigantic indestructible creatures called the Titans. Most of the people are living in fear, but there are some who are willing to destroy the Titans for a better world. The question is: how will they do it?] Pretty boring, right?\
I started this show with the expectation of it being an average anime.\
Summaries and explanation of this show doesn’t really do it justice, as most of them make it sound boring and unoriginal. As I watched the first few episodes, the characters didn’t help change this view either. I wasn’t really hooked until episode 5 or 6.\
The artwork is absolutely fantastic. It gives off this bright and yet depressing life of the people. It really does set the story. May I add, I’m having a blast watching the action sequences! \
As for the main characters, they are not inimitable. They are your typical shonen heroes. HOWEVER, although I don’t feel empathy for the characters (I wish I could), I was able to sympathize with them.  ALSO, although it has yet to pass the Bechdel test, I’m very happy that there are awesome women that can fight in this anime. Tropes (e.g damsel in distress) may have been used, but honestly speaking, the women are admirable! Female empowerment for the win! :P\
Asides my bias, character development is really subtle. There is so much focus on the main storyline, that there are only a few moments where certain characters are left for development. This is a problem because the majority of the audience is then left to only appreciate the characters with the natural cool-vibe aura (Ahem: Mikasa, and Levi). And just like most anime, some side characters have more well written and proper progressive mental development than the main one (Jean, and possibly Levi- if there is more than 25 episodes).\
Since there is only going to be approximately 25 episodes, I am letting that slide, but Erin’s open sleeve emotion (such an angry character!), and Mikasa’s hidden-but-obvious/obsessive feelings are something that I hate; as much as people loves these two characters, I still cannot fully appreciate them.  \
Pros so far:\
-Time is not wasted! I even have to pause the show to read the information that comes between every transition!!\
-Has an attention grabber.\
-Variety of characters+ character development. (it's done well because full episodes are not simply dedicated to developing the supporting characters; you just see it happen naturally as the story unfolds. Brilliant!)\
-Females can fight.\
-Art work: the outline also gives it a comic book style (can be a con for some lol).\
- Makes an unoriginal storyline interesting.\
-The action scenes are aesthetically appealing. Even though I have yet to read the manga, I know that the anime did a better job in that field. \
- Story unfolds nicely: proper execution. A+ for that! This is the best part of the anime because it feels like the writers took thought into what they were creating (*Cough* unlike the anime SOA: forgive me if you actually like that anime).\
Cons so far:\
-Typical main Shonen characters: \"dark/cool\" girl (usually boys in most shows), smarty-pants, and I-want-to-save-the-world-complex boy. Eren kinda annoys me a LOT (anger issues, I swear), but many might like him. The \"odd does seem to be forever in his favor\", considering that he appeared to not be strong in the very beginning. I think more could have been done with character personalities.\
- Suspenseful events are predictable.\
- Storyline has been played with many times+ some minor plots should have been discarded because it just wastes time (e.g. Eren has this moment where he clings to his \"dream world\" while there is chaos in the real world).\
-Main heroine \"clings\" to the hero. “Omg my life is soooo over without him.” “ I have no life of my own except to follow him.” \
- There is no emotional connection with characters. This was a problem for me because it can change my rating from a B to an A. However, this is a serious show with absolutely minimum slapstick comedy. Many people are tossed aside here and there, and there is no way for characters to get emotional in every episode without hindering the main storyline.\
\
Character rating: C-\
Action/art: A+\
Storyline: A (because it has it's own \"flavor\" added to it)\
Personal rating: B+\
Overall rating: B+ (They executed it nicely. And this is assuming that there will be another season to come, and 25 episodes will not limit the progress of the story.)\
\
Again, with any popular/ notorious shows, it is important as the viewers to not expect it to be a masterpiece, or plain trash. These expectations will eventually make you dislike or absolutely love a show that you probably wouldn't have in the very first place. If you decide to give this show a chance, be very open-minded so you can find out your true thoughts and feelings on it. As with any popular anime, if you have any bit of curiosity in you, you should watch it! Regardless of how many reviews there are that approves or disapproves of an anime, it's up to you to discover how you feel about it.",

    Attack on Titan, a great section of a potentially wonderful anime.\
Attack on Titan is an anime that tries to go about itself differently than most other anime. It holds up a serious, grim tone and holds it up proudly. It tries to get past all of those stereotypical anime tropes of other shows, ending up with a very unique feeling to the anime. The show does contain some cliches of an action adventure, but it ends up handling them differently than what we've seen in the past.\
Story:\
Attack on Titan doesn't have much of a story where it's at, as it focuses more on a war\
          \
        between monsters and humans. The show has several mysterious elements that keep you interested in the show more than simply from its glorious action scenes and dialogue. The characters are also very diverse and all are given a decent amount of screen-time, some of the characters developing quite well. The story of this anime is simple in that it tells of the characters experiences in a world where mankind isn't in-charge. Although the show doesn't have much of a story in its own right, it never ends up answering a lot of questions you might have from the mysterious elements it puts forth. A second season seems like it would clear everything up, but this factor must be put out there.\
Attack on Titan is incomplete where it stands. It has Great entertainment value, but not very deep story-telling. This show is very much an action adventure~\
Art:\
Not much needs to be said on this front, as the art is Amazing. The equipment the humans use to fight these man-eating Titans is known as the 3D Maneuver Gear, and when these babies get screen-time, you'll be Very satisfied with what you witnessed. They work similar to spiderman's web-swinging powers, with the character swinging around buildings heading for the Titan's weak-spot.\
I do have some negatives to point out from this, however, that has personally stopped me from rewarding it a 10. The show works in two arcs, one arc being presented within a city. The city has many buildings and much room for 3D Maneuver Gear action. This potential action is wasted, however, as much of the city arc is filled with \"motivational\" filler. There will be long gaps of talking, which I usually wouldn't be bothered with, except this talking is meant to make a delusional character come back to reality and do their damn job. Every Time, these \"motivational\" sequences just don't feel right.\
Sound:\
The soundtrack is Badass and has plenty of themes you might want to listen to after the shows finished. One small gripe, for some people, might be the inclusion of Japanese/Engrish vocaled rock songs which can take you out of the show for a moment. Personally, this only affected me the first time it happened, and I enjoyed it after that.\
In my opinion, the soundtrack is great and really gets those feels going when it wants to~\
Characters:\
Firstly, I have to give this author kudos for not including some character cliches, from numerous other animes, with having all of these characters within it. The characters of this anime act reasonable, yet still stand out from one-another. These characters feel mortal. Every character in this show has the potential of dying, and it keeps the thrills going from that fact. There are plenty of characters, possibly too much for the shows own good, but each is given a reasonable amount of screen-time. Not every character is given enough character-development, however, leaving some characters forgetful. There is character-development in there though, and several characters do change (ones that you wouldn't expect).\
Now, I have a personal gripe about how the story played out and the choice the author made. At one point in the story, a new plot point is introduced that affects everything, and makes the show more exciting and mysterious in many ways. This does come with flaws, if you ask me, as how the show started out should have been held that way for longer. The main premise of the show doesn't need the inclusion of this element, and I would be happy to witness a Lot more 3D Maneuver Gear action during the show's first half.\
There was some failed chances at getting some major character developments as-well. At one point in the show, when the inclusion of this plot-element is put into place, the show throws away a chance at having an Amazing character development in the main character that would, literally, flip a cliche on itself. If the show took advantage of this, I would've been mind-blown, and the show would cease to have any cliches at all to make things even better.\
(It's hard to explain this point without spoilers, so that’s the best I can do~)\
Enjoyment:\
The show is extremely enjoyable if you're not searching for some deep plot. The show has many unanswered questions, and is stopped in a way that feels unfinished and unsatisfying. The show, however, Does satisfy on the way through. The action, the shock and awe~ This show had me drop my mouth one or twice.\
This is an exciting, and brutal, anime with plenty of death and gore. The fact these characters feel more able to die, no matter their place in the show, makes the excitement bar raise even higher.\
One flaw with the enjoyment is the reliance on episodes that end with something happening. The episode will push the event to happen and, right when it hits the wall, you have to wait for the next episode (not anymore since the shows out). This wouldn't be much of anything as it's exciting sometimes, but the show over-uses this to the point where you'll sigh when it happens for the fourth time. That is a lesser gripe, but still needs to be noted.\
Overall:\
I'd say watch it. Certainly watch it, in-fact. If your someone who requires their anime to be complete, that would be the only time I'd recommend waiting. This isn't an anime that should be skipped. There was a good amount of work poured into this anime, and they did a wonderful job. They also chose an interesting manga series to take into motion. This show is exciting, somewhat predictable, and very unique, not in its premise, but in the way it handles its premise.\
Who wouldn't like to watch spidermen take on a giant zombie?\

    Attack on Titan is a epic anime which follows the story of a boy named Eren Yeager who tries to kill giant zombies called titans in order to get revenge for the death of his mother and the human race. This anime was not as awesome as people see it and the story was pretty good but the flashy animation, used characters, and whole fighting scenes make it a very very typical and silly shonen anime. Eren Yeager the main character is a very Terrible character and lives in his own self righteous world which is black and white. He wants to kill all the\
          \
        titans for his past tragedy (which is understandable) but that's simple slaughter and the titans may eat humans but it does not make them evil only predators and Eren's goal sounds a lot more evil and dark because he is making himself worse than the titans. As we'll with the bad characters, there are untold mysteries to be solved and it gets carried away with too much bullshit action. This anime was fun to watch but like any other anime it's not perfect and I see this one as a another overrated series that indoctrinated fans worldwide for its dullness and non gripping thriller. That's my review of this halfwit downer anime.\

    I normally don't spend the time to write reviews. I'm not a great reviewer but as popular as this show is i felt like i should voice my opinion, and in short it is this:\
Attack on Titan isn't the best thing since sliced bread.\
It is pretty good though. The story is good, but slow. Each episode seems to drag on a bit longer than it should, then leave you hanging, wondering whats going to happen next. Now I'm all for cliffhangers, but when each episode does it almost every week it gets kind of annoying. So far the plot is just too simple for my\
          \
        tastes. For a show that takes itself so seriously, I hope for something a bit more complex and interesting. Some cool things have happened with the characters (like Eren's power) and some interesting tidbits have been learned about the titans (and an especially cool titan has appeared within the last couple episodes, but I'm still left in wonder with questions, hoping for some great development in the plot to happen. Now I'm sure at the point in the series I'm at somethings bound to happen soon, the pacing is just slow and it takes a while for things to get there sometimes. Waiting a week between episodes doesn't help either. \
Character wise, i really enjoy them. I feel like I don't have much to say here. I can't really think of much i have wrong with the character development - each are an interesting personality and welcome addition to the cast. \
The art direction and animation is pretty great. I love the bold line used on the characters. The designs of the characters and world is awesome, and the environments in particular look great and very detailed. The Titans themselves are pretty boring with the exception of a few, but that's just a minor gripe. Everything is animated well most of the time and the action sequences are really well done with the characters swooping and flying around the titans followed by some sweet camera movement. I love it. They really know how to make a fight with giant naked person a spectacle to behold.\
Sound - The OP(s) and ED(s) aren't good, but I not my favorite or anything. The first ones I liked more. The voice acting is pretty good all around, and the effects themselves are fitting. This is something i don't really pay as much attention to in the anime i watch. It works.\
As it stands now, AoT is pretty solid. The pacing of the story is a little slow at times, but other than that its a good show. Far from my favorite, but who knows? When the show ends it may just be.\

    To be completely honest, I enjoyed the action and the scenes of the anime like everyone else. They were great, full of suspense, and with the epic soundtrack, it couldn't have been any better. The action scenes, I mean.\
Story: 6\
Setting wise the story was great, the plot, was shit. The concept was a great idea of man-eating titans devouring every last human soul. The plot as i said was shit. Completely disoriented, the Female Titan arc dragged too long. Put too much emphasis on Eren and still didn't make a big impact on myself. \
Art: 4\
The art was copied off the manga, so it really\
          \
        didn't look that great, so personally I would rate it a low score.\
Sound:9\
The soundtracks were fantastic, they weren't the very very best, but they were pretty good.\
Character:2\
One word: Shit. They characters are bland, the main character is a damsel in distress that can't do anything and Mikasa seems way too dull and her character seemed way too forced. Armin...yeah. Only character that ever seemed badass was Levi.\
Enjoyment:7\
I did actually enjoy the anime despite the criticism I've given. I could see how an anime like this \"could\" be popular, but not in my perspective. I personally dont favor the dark humor, but this anime was great in action, they might of needed to work on the plot a bit. A tbh, i dont really enjoy Naked Titan Gundam fighting action, so yeah.\
Overall: 7\
Was pretty interesting concept overall, about how humans built the wall the protect themselves from what it seemed like fat naked humans with schizophrenia. ",

    The spring of 2013 can pretty much be summarized in one word: hype! Mostly centered around one single show, a show called Attack on Titan. Another shounen introduced to the likes of the Naruto and One Piece fans. But is this Anime worth the hype? Or is it again just another shounen that gets far too much credit for what it actually is?\
Story: The setting of Shingeki no Kyojin is set in the far future, where mankind has faced an enemy that has been unknown to them for a long time and get's driven back into a single gigantic town, surrounded by three walls, higher\
          \
        than every titan seen so far, that shall defend them from any incoming threads. This obviously also means that almost no human being has enough courage to leave the walls. This being, the human race slowly starts to lose their technology and seemingly go back to medieval time.\
Eren Jaeger, the son of a known doctor though, doesn't simply want to stay within the walls that keep the titans from coming into the huge area, but wants to leave the town and explore the outside world together with his friend Armin Arlert. One day, the walls of the gate of the little district he  lives breaks, due to an incredibly tall titan and the titans enter it. From here on the catastrophe starts and everything goes down hill.\
The Story of Shingeki no Kyojin is an extremely interesting take on something that has been done a lot. The zombie apocalypse really is not a lot different to this, considering that we have mindless human like things walking around, that only want to eat humans. The thing that SnK does a lot better than most Anime is presenting it's world and showing the crisis.\
The main selling point of the plot though is the pacing, being one of the fastest paced shows that I have seen so far and literally feeding us with plot twists within the first seven to eight episodes. The pacing though, while being the best point, at the same time can also be the weakest. Since the first episodes were paced that fast, when the show slows down to normal speed, it feels as if things would have completely stopped to happen. The pacing in the second half of this first part seems really off and in comparison to the first half let's down a lot, even though it can't even be considered really slow. It just feels this way. All in all SnK has a really intriguing plot, carried by an incredibly fast pacing that can be both blessing and curse due to it slowing down to normal pace.\
8.4/10\
Characters: The cast of Shingeki no Kyojin's first half is quite big, featuring many of the trainees that want to become soldiers for different matters, which leads to only few of them really getting depth added and most of them not being given too much attention to, due to that they didn't have enough time for this. But I can't really judge that much for the supporting cast, since we are only half way through the series and there is still a lot of time for development. That being said, the ones that actually do get depth are really swell written.\
The main cast consists of three characters and is pretty well balanced, the most important one being Eren Jaeger. He is the son of a known doctor living in Shiganshina, the small district which the titans invaded first. Before they came, he already planned on joining the Recon Corps, that are the only ones that are able to leave the wall, searching for Titans to investigate and get to know more about them. After a titan eats his mother he swears to revenge her and kill every single Titan on this earth, making him seem at first sight like a generic character, but later adding enough depth to it to really make him an amazing character and develop him as the tragedy goes on.\
The next character in the main cast is Mikasa Ackermann. She is Eren's stepsister, for reasons that would go into spoilers and that I am not going to explain. She pretty much serves as the voice of reason for Eren and stops him from doing stupid things more than once. Later on though, as Eren becomes more and more independent, she is seems to be more of a love interest than what she was before, which still doesn't take away the awesome ass kicking scenes in which she really gets to shine and all in all she really makes a great character.\
The last of the three main characters is Armin Arlet, at first being postmarked as the pussy of the show, he later on really gets to shine and show his true abilities of making plans and being the mastermind for operations that seem to only be able to fail and make them possible. Armin is a childhood friend of Eren, that first got the idea of leaving the town due to his parents doing the same. They never reappear though, leaving him and his grandfather alone.\
The main cast is, just as the supporting characters that the show focuses on, really well done and the they add a lot of depth to them, leaving a really good impression of them and making them incredibly likeable.\
8.9/10\
Animation: The Animation of Shingeki no Kyojin has been handled by WIT Studio, a side studio of the famous studio Production IG. The studio itself though didn't have any work before this, making this the only thing that they have created so far, aka their debut and that really is something that people are able to realize, due to production delays and unfinished animation in some episodes.\
Those issues aside though, the Animation quality itself while battle scenes is amazing! The fighting scenes and actually generally the scenes when they use the 3-D Movement gear (a gear that makes them seem like \"Medieval Spiderman\" (random gigguk quote)) is incredibly fluent and just something really good to see. At this point a lot of credit to Araki Tetsurou, who was directing this and made the gear as awesome as it is!\
On the other hand though, while not fighting or doing anything that requires fast movements, the quality drops a lot, to a point where still screens become more normal than actual animation. This of course is due to the budget being almost completely used on the action scenes, leaving nothing but a little amount for everything else. While I do approve of the amazing battles against the titans, I do think personally that they should have kept a little more budget for the slow paced parts and even though the action scenes wouldn't be as good, the scenes that don't need as much movement, wouldn't throw me off as much.\
7.5/10\
Sound: The OST of Shingeki no Kyojin has been composed by  Sawano Hiroyuki, who also did the soundtrack to Animes such as Guilty Crown and Gundam: Unicorn and this Soundtrack really doesn't let down! This is probably what gets you heart racing the most in the entire show and makes this show a lot more enjoyable, even with those flaws that it has quite a few of. The OST is really good at getting you excited for the battle to come or make you emotional for what just happened. A thing that really helps the show. The songs are mostly just as fast paced as the show itself and even get you singing whatever you understand without even watching the show. The slower songs are pretty emotional as well and give a good feeling of how dark this Anime can actually be.\
The Soundtrack almost always fits perfectly and as I said multiple this really gets your heart racing during every fight scene and just scream out the words that they are singing (as far as you understand them that is...)\
I don't think I really need to talk about the first Opening \"Guren no Yumiya\", but for those who actually seem to live behind the moon, this Opening must be one of the best to come out in the last few years. Not only does it get stuck in your head really easy, it also just doesn't get boring and while watching the show always makes you want to see SnK now. The ending \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" on the other side of the show, does not let either and features quite good animation together with a beautiful song sung by Hikasa Yoko.\
As far as I can tell the Voice Acting cast has been really good. While again, my Japanese is not good enough to understand everything, I really like how they do get over the emotions and huge congratulations to Ishikawa Yui, who had one of her first appearances in an Anime ever here in this show as Mikasa and really is an incredibly good newcomer. I hope we will see her again!\
9.4\
In total: Is Shingeki no Kyojin overrated? Yes! Does that mean it is bad? No! Not at all! While this show has quite some flaws, the overall impression of this Anime still is really good. I do enjoy this a lot, even though it has it's faults and even though it got a lot slower in the end there was still a lot more going for it than against it and the enjoyment factor is really high. I just don't think it is that good, that it deserves a spot in the top 10 of Anime after only 7 episodes.\
After calculating all the scores that I have given this Anime (Story, Characters, Animation, Sound and my Personal Enjoyment), I came to an amazing score of 8.58/10\

    There's nothing I can say that haven't been said already but I'm just gonna add that there's probably no other story, no matter the medium, where the existential anguish of a human race on the brink of extinction is represented as masterfully it was on this show. It's one of the more human shows I have watched particularly because we don't get the usual idealistic (and caricaturistic) representation of the soldier that we are accustomed to. The soldiers on Attack on Titan are human, they are very brave yes but they are also afraid for their lives and that of their comrades. They are aware\
          \
        that no one is a protagonist in the real world and life can be taken away from us at any moment. This is where the show is strongest but also where I found its major weakness because it reminds us, rather emphatically, that it has an actual protagonist that can escape death and almost any kind harm that would be fatal if it befell any other character. I'm not rating this show a 10 because of this and I felt very disappointed when this development happened. I thought it was a betrayal of what the show could've become. To me it seemed like the author wasn't sure if that was the way that he wanted to go and it seemed he hesitated for a while but in the end he took the easy road. Still it is very much worth a watch since it is still very good but I'm pretty certain that it is just going to go downhill from here in the following seasons. This coupled with the fact that Isayama already said that he is changing the ending he originally had in mind because of the fans and, well, the seeds have already been planted.\

    I've been through two episodes, a lot of clips and reviews on YouTube, and I can tell you now that this anime isn't of that decency.\
Most of my friends tell me that they watched it because of the incredible fighting style and artwork, and the storyline isn't THAT bad, either.\
Its the fact that this story requires a real 'specific' kind of audience. An audience that liked gore, sad tales & action to top it off.\
It just wasn't my kind of anime.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is a good choice for you if you really enjoy series with good action sequences where the fights aren't decided effortlessly and take actual struggle for the protagonist faction to even bear.\
But outside of the action the show doesn't excel in much. At the start of the story, you will often wonder, how does everything here even work? Like, what's up with the wall, when did they ever have time to even build it? Why in 100 years have figured no way to combat the titans, no technological advancement? I mean if stuck in the same place for 100 years, you might\
          \
        figure some way to combat them. More efficient ways. I mean, there is a story about the wall which will be written in the midpause for advertisment that you should read so you will understand a bit more about it and I suppose all the details about their developments throughout those pauses are also nice and you can see how they did figure out ways to deal with them, but I find it so hard to believe that they barely have any ideas on how to deal with them after so many years. They really feel majorly underdeveloped, which I understand is something you want to keep the theme alive, but even with it set in the 8th century and all, I doubt humanity would be this stupid. However, if you ask yourself these questions long enough some possible speculations might pop to mind. You might be able to fill some gaps yourself based on some events and the fact that humanity barely has enough knowledge of anything. The fact they barely know anything is not a complete blowout since they are actually trying to gather intelligence on their enemies constantly throughout the show and it does keep it moving along and in a way the action of the show uses this as a challenge to develop.\
The story itself deals with war, loss and tragedy, but it's usually swing and a miss. While it does nail some moments and I do mean really nails them, most of them are either ridiculous or you don't care much for. The reasoning for it is more often than not it's done through redshirts with no development put into them or how shounen-ish the mindset of most characters (in an aspiring war drama...) are and how similar to each other their thinking really is. Dramatically the show does have its good moments, but they're about as slim as the survival rate of the characters seen in the show. So don't get your hopes up. Those redshirts I mentioned are there to setup the action more often than not so I do see the point for bringing them along. Just keep in mind that more often that sometimes the show will be really desperate to keep the despair in its world up.\
What really saves the show for me is the action itself, it's got good animation and I'd say better than average sound choices, the design is bleak but it does help with what the show is intending to do and the action bits are really well done so I'd say the design of the show is good. The action bits of the show are really hype and seeing humans fighting titans and how they develop their strategies to combat them is often really enjoyable. The fights and how their set up will feel good, the logistics of them didn't feel questionable, everything else does, but in its action the show it does excel. The show's got some really enjoyable action, better than most action shows, so this is this show's saving grace. The parts I enjoyed were almost never the characters or what happened to them but rather the various ways the humans have developed to deal with the titans, formations, strategies, planning, making the best out of the worst situation. That's what's executed well within the show.\
The characters are of two types. Those that get their fill of interesting moments. And those that die so they can get those. More often than not you can distinguish whether or not a character is gonna have any relevance later on if they have gotten any discerning trait of their own. If they're too similar with any other character, they are cannon fodder. Which is a problem in this show because most characters are really unmemorable and alike. The characters that do have said traits you can like and sympathize a bit with them,  but the high number of them mostly get hardly enough effort put into them. I mean, I get it, you try to create a war setting, but you could at least try to create losses you, the viewer, care about, rather than the characters in the show, since they're almost always a means to an end. The characters that die almost never stand up on their own, which is a problem. In some cases it's the point, but in most I really don't think it is its intention. How do you plan to succesfully convey the desperation of war and frequent loss when you can't give the characters enough anything to get the viewers to feel concerned for the safety of their favorite characters?\
What I do have to conclude through all of this, all of my complaints and concerns don't impact the way the action moments pass too much, but they could've enhanced it to be so many times better. \
Overall, I'd recommend this show to people who really enjoy the action side of anime and weigh it of the same value or above that of the story elements themselves. If you value the action that way, I really don't doubt you will enjoy this show. But if you don't my expectations are that you will find the show at best mediocre. It does have ups in the story and the ups are often good to really good, but they're pretty infrequent. The show is good. It really is good despite all its flaws. But if you can't enjoy the action, I have no doubt you will find this bad. Case in which you should definitely avoid this and watch anything else.\

SnK first half. 10/10. Honorably-stellar works.\
Eren goes full titan. Just as this happens the writer(s) go full children's shonen and never go back.\
SnK second half. 5.5/10. Shamelessly follows shonen and generic anime baseline scripts. Attempts to use a little kids' surf board to ride the beautiful wave left over from it's predecessor episodes.\
Story--\
The world building was a secluded partition physically, yet it was borderline-flawless.\
The main characters' backstories were captivatingly weaved together to make something powerfully emotional and did the kick off for a strong story.\
The themes. The gruesomeness. The realism. The motivation. The fear. The necessity. The loss.\
          \
        All of these things gave SnK a strong 10/10 story. \
(Aside from gore,) None of these things remain effective when the focus of the show can-be-and-is-no-longer-humans fighting and attempting to Survive together against titans. The characters don't even die when they are killed after that point. Now the titans can be seen as just a soon-to-be-tool, and which using tools is human specialty. Say GoodByebye to the mountain of unique adventure. Hello giant robo cheering ons.\
Art & Sound -- 10/10. Strong, show-raising factor.\
Character -- 5/10. Was strong early on, but character development past very initial occurrences were imposingly non-existent. The characters also progress to not at all interact in ANY non-simple ways(like normal/realistic peoples would), as good writing would have. This is more exceedingly true after episode 16~.\
Enjoyment -- 9/10. First 12~ episodes were some of the best I've seen.\
Overall --\
Even if I loved the 12 episodes of story, the fact of how it drove it'self into fodder for half of the series forces me to pick the middle score of the two sides. I give this a \"From greatness to poop out of Potential\" or in other words. 7 outta 10. I would actually think a fanfiction that picks up right when Eren dies and does actually die is likely to be much better than the animated and voice acted second half.\

    Its been two years since I watched the nineteenth episode of Attack on Titan and I've kept on saying that I WILL complete the series. I try not to drop anything I've let myself get really invested in and I'm so close to finishing, but I just can't bring myself to finish it.\
Why can't I bring myself to continue watching an anime that is lauded, praised and virtually worshipped by a mass of anime watchers? Well, its because I just found so utterly unoriginal, contrived and boring.\
Attack on Titan is essentially an anime about zombies who mindlessly want to rip people to shreds and eat\
          \
        them for no reason whatsoever. (For those of you who try to tell me AoT is not about zombies: shut up. It came out during the era where zombies were a thing, and due to perfect timing it blew up and turned into a \"worldwide phenomenon\". )\
Humanity lives in terror of these bizarre humanoid creatures until a bunch of generic teenagers - led by a rage driven Gary Stu who is really fucking annoying - come along with their anachronistic weapons in what looks like Renaissance era Germany. Still, nobody knows WHY these creatures exist! Which is probably why AoT is just SO thrilling. \
(Oh, come off it, it's so obvious that they're a result of some Weapon X programme gone wrong. There is absolutely no subtlety to the show whatsoever. If you haven't figured out the basement is really a chamber for an evil scientist, right now, your intelligence must be lacking.)\
I won't even talk about the characters because Eren is just insufferable and everyone else is like a piece of cardboard. Especially that Mikasa - all she does is look depressing into the distance whilst fighting Titans with the most nonchalant expression on her face. Ever.\
The complete lack of originality that comes with AoT could be forgiven if it was at least executed in an enjoyable manner. But when Eren and his gang aren't slicing Titans to bits, they're spending needles screen time doing typical shounen exposition. They talk for what feels like hours in monotonous tones which is set to boring ass music that really just drills the brain in. The pacing of show also moves at the speed of a slug crawling up the Empire State Building, which suggests that AoT will run on for another 300 episodes before it finally gets somewhere. I mean why the fuck would you dedicate an episode to cleaning? All it does is waste time and bore me to fucking tears.\
I just couldn't do it any more: the story was predictable, the characters lacking in flavour, and the pacing so freaking slow it almost cured my insomnia. \
How this show has a such a high ranking is beyond me, but, hey, if you want to buy into this dumb-ass show who am I to stop you?\

    Attack on Titan was an extremely hyped anime that aired in 2013. If you were involved in the anime community, there was no chance you had not heard of attack on titan. The hype for it was so great, but did the anime live up to it?\
Just to put this out there, I am reviewing this from the standpoint that this season is standalone, not considering any 2nd season at this point. \
STORY - 6\
The original idea for the story is really good, and unique. Set in a world where humans are the ones caged in, in fear of man-eating titans which range from house\
          \
        tall to 50m tall. Despite the premises having promise, the development of the plot was so slow, it felt like the both the opening theme songs had more action than the actual episode most of the time. In almost every episode there was this flashback or interior monologue that makes it feel like they’re trying to stretch the source material so that it will last a full 25 episodes. This pacing issue is something a lot of people have picked up, and when you compare the pacing to anime like kill la kill, it seems very slow. In the places where the story does get going, it is developed pretty well but these instances are rare. In my opinion they should have just delayed the release so they would have more source material, or just made it a 12 episode anime instead, considering they will end up releasing more seasons in the future. Even an abridged series, by Team Four Star, squeezed the events all the way to around the midpoint of the Battle of Trost within 20 minutes.\
The first 2 episodes of the attack of the titans were not awful, they properly introduced the setting with some dramatic scenes. However it was the training camp 2 episodes that I have a problem with. The main purpose of the training camp seemed to be just to introduce all the support characters, many of which get barely any important or impactful screen time for the rest of the show. So essentially it served no real purpose, only making audiences wait 2 more weeks for their humans vs titans battle, which leads to…\
The 5 episode long Battle of Trost. It is actually not as bad as it seems, because there is quite a lot of stuff that goes on. But it honestly could have been done in 3 or 4 episodes, and a very important plot point (trying not to give spoilers) seems a bit randomly placed. On that note, the plot holes concerning this plot point were not even covered within the 25 episodes, though it is hinted that his dad had been involved. \
The rest of the anime follow suite, with relatively large amounts of screen time going to drawn out flashbacks and interior monologues, that are pretty unnecessary.\
CHARACTER - 5.5\
There are 3 main characters in the series, Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. At the outset, 2/3 have distinct personalities, being Eren and Armin. Eren is solely focused on killing the titans, only caring about that and nothing else. He does not care for his friends, as long as he gets to kill titans he doesn’t mind anything else. Mikasa is a little more bland. She is defined with an obsession with Eren and wanting to keep her safe, all due to what happened to her as a child. She doesn’t go much deeper than that, and stays that way for the rest of the show pretty much. Armin is your resident scaredy-cat-but-is-a-genious character. He is scared of everything, but joins the army anyway, which seems is for plot convenience as he has no business being there other than coincidentally being the best tactician they have. \
The biggest problem in terms of character, is the fact that the main characters don’t get much development at all. As stated earlier Mikasa goes under no character development whatsoever, while Eren is mostly filled with rage and desire for revenge for the whole first half. In the later stages of the series, he becomes a bit more concerned for others, and is not so one dimensional. But for 25 episodes this is not much development, and when you thought he would change, the people he trusted were killed. As a result he still probably does not have much faith in anyone, which means we’re back to square one. \
Armin’s development is solely based upon him trying to overcome his fears, which he occasionally does and becomes less of a scaredy-cat by the end of the show. Out of the 3 main characters he definitely receives the best and most development, which is not really hard to do considering the other 2. \
The supporting cast is…interesting to say the least. A lot of characters introduced in the training camp don’t really do much in the show as I said earlier. One support character worth mentioning is Jean. He probably has as much development as Armin, and much more than Eren and Mikasa. He starts off as arrogant and wanting to live an easy life, but then realises that if he is one of the better titan killers, he should actually put his skills to good use. \
MUSIC - 9.5\
The music, to put in 1 word, is epic. It sounds amazing, and are full of adrenaline. There is not much more to say than that. The music fits the scenes really well, and really adds to what’s happening on screen. The reason I did not give it a 10, is that although the whole soundtrack is fantastic, there is no one track that completely blows me away or anything like that. Especially when I consider Kill la Kill’s music a 10, and although many people disagree, I find Kill la Kill’s music better than Attack on Titan’s. Kill la Kill’s music has its own character basically, which is something Attack on Titan’s music lacks. Attack on Titan’s music may be amazing, but a lot of the time I did not take notice of it, it was just there…accompanying the visuals. Simply put it does not stand out as much as music for other anime. It is for this reason I have not given it a 10/10\
ANIMATION - 9\
The show is animated really well throughout. The actions scenes (in the rare instances that these take place) flow really well, and the animation is very consistent. My only complaint is that the titans often looked either badly drawn or just really messed up. Another thing is during that female titan arc when they were in the forest, the 3d gear ‘grappling hooks’ seemed infinitely long, as entire conversations were held without them ever reaching the end of their ‘hooks’. Lastly, the animation wasn’t nearly as good as something like Fate/Zero, which aired 2 years prior, so its animation cannot be considered ‘perfect’.\
ENJOYMENT - 8.5\
I personally really enjoyed the show, with the actions scenes really pumping me up. I also could not stop watching, as the moment one episode finished I had to watch the next. However this is not just a good thing, as one of the reasons I had to watch the next was that some episodes had literally nothing happen or there was another cliffhanger. What I did not enjoy was the cringeworthy pacing, which I talked about much earlier.\
OVERALL - 7\
Since this site only allows whole number ratings, I have given Attack on Titan a 7/10. Essentially it is a very hyped anime that in some ways fails to live up to it. It’s story and character are subpar, especially when you take into account the duration of the show. It would be a much better show if the 25 episodes were squeezed into 13, making the character development more plausible given the time frame and clearing the pacing issues. The animation and sound are amazing, and are definitely the highlights of the show. \
In the end, Attack on Titan is a show for people who love action, and who have the patience to wait through some of the slower parts. Fans of mystery and dark fantasy will also enjoy it. However if you expect something very exciting to happen every episode, you will be sorely disappointed. I was due to having very high expectations because of the hype",

    I honestly just can't really get behind this show. Now I need to clear this up, I don't automatically hate anime just because it's popular. Bebop is my favourite show ever for god's sake. But I really wasn't interested all that much. The thing that drives me to stick with a story is the connection I have to the presented characters.

Uma história que consegue te chocar logo no primeiro episódio, shingeki no kyojin não é uma história previsível, não consigo contar o número de vezes em que me surpreendi com a história, cada episódio te faz ficar com \"um gostinho de quero mais\", nenhum episódio é entediante, mesmo episódios em que tem mais diálogo conseguem te manter interessado na história\

Eren -  é bem descontrolado muitas vezes, isso acaba ficando irritante pois ele está assim praticamente o anime todo, mas se pensar na história do personagem da pra entender a maneira do porque ele age dessa forma, já que o personagem perde muitas pessoas importantes para ele diversas vezes no anime\
Mikasa - só tem ao Eren como família, ela coloca a segurança dele a frente de tudo, então sempre que algo acontece ao Eren ela perde o controle de si mesma e acaba cometendo muitos erros, como pouco tempo do anime é focado em mostrar os personagens quando não estão lutando pra sobreviver a Mikasa acaba parecendo que só se importa com Eren\
Armin -  desde criança sentiu que é um inútil comparado a Mikasa e ao Eren, mas ao longo do anime ele vai ganhando bastante desenvolvimento, mesmo não tendo melhorado sua habilidade com o DMT, sua confiança em si mesmo aumenta bastante e muitas vezes seus planos e estratégias acabam salvando a vida de muitos personagens\

Não é um anime perfeito, pois muitos eps tem pelo menos 4-5 minutos de recap, mas isso não estraga o anime, é um anime único, não só pelo equipamento, personagens não são clichês, e se refletir um pouco da pra entender a motivação de quase todos os personagens para as suas ações, em Snk não tem poder da amizade ou poder do amor, é um anime bem realístico e bem inovador \

    I felt like I was in a fireworks show while watching Attack on Titan, except only one firework went off. At first I was captivated, and soon I wanted to see more and better things, but I never got that. Now all I have left from the experience is disappointment. \
I gotta say, they did a fabulous job with the first few episodes, because the chaotic nature of everything really made you feel the dreariness of Attack on Titan's world. The titans were creepy and had a powerful presence, while every human seemed weak. It had me on the edge of my seat, wanting to\
          \
        know how humanity would survive. And then it went on. And on. AND ON. I'll get to that in a bit, though.\
Is the plot continually suspenseful? Somewhat, though it often accomplishes this in the most cheap way possible. Almost every episode leaves on a cliffhanger, which works sometimes, but eventually becomes numbing due to how frequently it occurs. It's not like episodes usually \"deserve\" cliffhangers considering how hollow and unfulfilling they feel, with barely anything resolved at the end. Speaking of resolution, Attack on Titan does indeed resolve some major plot elements... after way too many episodes. Does around 5-7 episodes of the main character trying to move a rock sound appealing to you? No? Well how about if all those episodes just have meaningless fluff by regurgitating details you already know and give screen time to worthless characters? Still no? How about if we spend an entire episode about someone trying to wake the main character up? Oh, I lost your interest? Well that's exactly what the show did to me. I am not exaggerating when I say that Attack on Titan literally has the worst pacing I have ever seen in a television series, rivaling Sword Art Online's Aincrad and Gun Gale arcs. This is not how you expand a story arc. \
Of course, even a well-paced narrative would be soured by this show's \"characters\". The cast is almost entirely made of one-dimensional (or even zero-dimensional) cast members. The secondary characters had names, but since they barely displayed any well-rounded traits, I ended up identifying them as \"potato girl\", \"implied lesbian\", \"generic tough blonde chick\", and \"tough guy who likes to clean\". They rarely stray out of one character quirk, and when they do, it's usually to freak out. Jean actually had potential with his relatability, but he really needed more time to shine. \
There's also \"the guy who's always mad\" (the protagonist), Eren. He is incredibly annoying with his long-winded speeches you can easily predict, and his only mood seems to be \"get angry\", or \"get REALLY angry.\" I realize he has reason to be angry, but almost all the time? A guy who's always pissed off makes for a lousy and unrelatable character to watch.  Speaking of him, how about those main characters, eh? Armin was alright and had solid development into a more capable character, but I wish he had more time to shine. Mikasa was awesome, on the other hand; probably the only decent character in the entire show. Attack on Titan gives her many defining characteristics such as her brutality, sensitivity, and even a somewhat obsessive nature. I thought she should have been the main character, but unfortunately got sidelined for Eren, and right after those couple episodes dedicated specifically to her growth. Very disappointing. The zero dimensional cast members are just there to say a few lines, pretend to be an important part of the group, and then die. Due to the frequency of these worthless death scenes, you will stop caring about the Titans eating people, which is not good. \
It's also hard to fear the titans when they have progressively dumber designs as the episodes slog by. They go from having creepy expressions of malice to expressions of them just looking dazed and stupid. The running animation on the aberrant titans combined with their dumb face legitimately made me laugh out loud. Another unintentionally hilarious aspect of the show were the human faces. I realize they should look serious, but when you have a bunch of close-ups to a face with out-of-place shading and ridiculously beady eyes, the effect becomes comedic. The show tries to look so serious it actually ends up looking hilarious. When it doesn't look hilarious, it looks hideous. The shades of brown splattered everywhere do not enhance the bleak nature of the show at all, it just makes everything look boring at best, and literally like shit at worst. Its prevalence eventually becomes tiring to look at. The animation is good.... sometimes. Fight scenes are well-choreographed with immersive angles, and you can clearly see what's going on all the time. But during conversations is another story. They just stand around and flap their lips with completely unimaginative camera angles. Considering this happens for most of the show, and you will usually also be looking at the millionth shade of brown while they talk, you have a really bland looking show with limited creative direction. \
Let's also not forget the soundtrack. It really enhances the mood at times, especially in the beginning where it perfectly ratchets the tension with the bells and chanting. However, it also often sounds like what I can only describe as electronic fart noises when the characters fight the titans, or look around, which destroys a ton of tension. I do not think such a heavy emphasis on electronic music was a good idea either, considering they do not adequately capture the scale the show's trying to achieve. \
\
Attack on Titan is pretty bad in some areas and good in others, but most aspects are just mediocre. Do not waste your time with this show. Sure it's not \"bad\" overall, but it's so disappointingly average that it hurts just as much. Is it better to see one firework and feel empty, or never see it at all and not deal with disappointment? You be the judge of that, but I regret my experience.\

    Attack on Titan, the anime that blew up anime fans minds. This anime is a survival anime about a large military trying to save humanity from Titans and put them back on the top of the food chain. Titans are large human like creatures who run around outside of the walls killing only humans, not caring about any other animal. They regenerate limbs, don't need to eat, run around naked, looks either kawaii, creepy, hilarious or unexplainable, and anything else you wanna add.

        are rather interesting and it has some pretty memorable moments. Please, tell me you haven't heard Armin's scream in either dub or sub, I don't care. The dub isn't that good, but isn't bad at the same time. It's a dub that I can live with, but I would rather subtitles. Comedy is rarely thrown in, but can be seen here and there (Sasha, Zoe, Levi). It has a serious tone to it and I'm pretty sure the world of memes looking at this anime have been extremely mind blowing. When I saw some I couldn't bring 'half' or myself to.....you know what. I can't make puns. And that may be classified as a punny spoiler. But it wasn't HALF bad was it. Admit it. At least 'half' of that joke was PUNNY!!! I'll shut up. \

    Huge titan's that eat people? Yes please! Shingeki no Jyojin (Attack on Titan) is a wonderful anime! This anime brang tears to my eyes and also made me very excited. Your friends may have asked you to go and watch this anime and your not quite sure. Well, that is why I am here! To change your mind!\
Story: 7\
I would give the story line a good 7! Why you may ask. Its because this is the first ever anime that I have watched that have titans. It's not just that though. It's how the story is so well put together. I would have never guessed\
          \
        that this is what Shingeki no Kyojin would be about. Well, of course titans but other than that, I would be completely clueless. You've got the adventures that some of the characters have. I just think this story was absolutely fabulous!\
Art: 7\
To be very honest, I'm very bad at telling which art is bad or not. This art was like any other anime (in my opinion). So, the art was very good!\
Sound: 9\
The openings were just amazing! The first opening got your pumped up for the series. It was so catchy that I wouldn't skip the opening. The second opening was also very catchy! Both of them just got you pumped. To this day, I still listen to them! \
Characters: 7\
Now, these characters were just amazing. The characters made the anime so good. You would go on adventures with them. Experience some of the characters past. Each character has a different personality that you would just fall in love with!\
Enjoyment: 9\
I enjoyed this anime so much! It made me want to keep on watching the next episode. I loved it so much that I watched it in a day.\
Overall: 9\
This anime is worth watching! Hopefully I have changed your mind! If not, then I am very sorry but you should go watch Attack on Titan! Don't let people get to you when they say this sucks! That is their opinion! You go try it  out and see for yourself!\

    I personally really enjoyed Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) not only was the story fantastic but the soundtrack, the way it was executed was very good. The sad parts were sad and the intense parts were intense. The only reason I disliked it was how the use of CGI was, it was just a little too much. But other than that I loved it. Most people dislike it cause of it's popularity and don't watch it fully through, but I definitely think it's worth a watch. But if you don't like gore, well this is simply not for you. It's horrifically gory and gruesome.\
          \
        but other than that I think it's great for anyone. (as long is you don't mind a few curse words) \

    (Spoiler-ish review... no important plot points revealed) I can't say this is a great anime.  Enjoyable... to a degree.  But not great.  If you're set on blood/gore/explosions to determine your anime choice. This is DEFINITELY the right show for you.  If you get annoyed at plot holes/continuity errors/inconsistency... not the anime for you.\
There was far too much inconsistency in the titans.  I don't know if I should fault this to the art department or the story.  One scene you'll see a titan who is clearly 200 or more feet tall (as it is towering over the 50 meter... roughly\
          \
        150 feet) and then the next scene that same exact titan is about twice the size of a two-story building (so maybe 40-50 feet tall).  \
Then there's the ease with which the titans breached the initial two walls of the series.  Titans of all sizes seem to be perfectly capable of crumbling the walls like it was plywood.  If these walls were so easy to destroy why would it take them 100 years to get around to doing so?  If the titans are so powerful AND hungry for humans... why did they not kill them all off LONG before the walls were finished?  And on that note... HOW did they even finish those huge walls in what the show simply refers to as a \"little time\"  since the walls had been up for 100 years and the titans only appeared a little over 100 years ago.  That outer wall itself is a feat that would take centuries to complete, not to mention the inner wall or the central citadel.\
There are many other issues as well, however, in short if you don't think too hard about what you're watching and just want some action... watch and enjoy.  Unfortunately, if you find yourself annoyed at questionable \"hollywood\" physics in things like transformers... you too will probably find yourself questioning HOW all of these things happen too much to enjoy the show.\
This is STRICTLY a review of the anime.  I don't know if the manga is better... and honestly this show didn't leave me caring enough about it to check.\

    Now this show is fucking badass! It's review also includes Season 2 as well! While it's not the first anime Ive ever watched it IS however the anime that got me to want to watch anime. and even now, I think Attack On Titan is great! Okay it's certaintly not perfect It has some issues but it's definately worth the watch if you ask me and from my enjoyment, it's definately one of my favorite anime.\
Story:\
Titans break through the walls to devour the rest of humanity that live inside the walls. This show has such phenominal world building. Even if the pacing can get slow\
          \
        at times and can raise some questions, when it get resolved it feels so satisfying and can keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next. Unfortunately as the story goes on, the titans become less and less of a threat but... oh well.\
Art:\
Fucking amazing! The visuals and art style is pretty unique and the atmosphere and cinematography is stunning to say the least. throughout the beginning, you really feel like the characters are helpless against the titans. But... again, the titans become less of a threat later on but it still looks great.\
Sound:\
Do I even need to say anything? The music is fucking amazing both the openings and the in-show music. There's a reason why openings 1 and 3 are incredibly popular. The voice acting is great in the sub but the dub could've been a bit better.\
Characters:\
Admittedly the weakest part of the show. The characters are likeable and there are a few standouts like Sasha, Levi and Pixis but most of the characters reach the bare mimum to make you care about them. The show also likes to kill off a lot of characters to.\
Overall: Overall, This show is great! It may have some flaws (some of which might turn off some people) but honestly, this is an amazing show that I highly recommend watching.\

    *MINOR SPOILERS*\
\
So this anime is one of those anime that is VERY controversial. Where you have the haters, hating it for being so damn popular. And then have the Fangirls/boys loving it.  \
I personally love this anime as much as TG/SAO, and this review is going to be epic.\
Story - So where do i start..simply put, it's outstanding. The story here as a young boy named eren is living in a peaceful town inside of the walls. When a titan emerges and obliterates the wall, in the process he loses his mother. From that you have a very strong story to tell as he\
          \
        wants his revenge. And they definitely put that in there. Showing eren's true rage as he fights as a titan and has faithful friends by his side the entire ride.\
Art - The art is just great! I love the animations that they give the titans and the overall attention to detail in this anime is great. I can't say much more...but this anime is just very beautiful to look at. All the characters are so unique in their own ways.\
Sound - Again the sound here is GREAT! My favorite sound in the entire anime is eren's roar as a titan, it gives me chills to hear the revenge coming from him as he rips apart the other titans. The OP is OK for me, maybe it's just not my style of music, but i'm not too fond of the OP. Overall the sounds here are good and again plenty of attention to detail in the sounds! Also if i may add, the voice acting for the english dub is very good too!\
\
Character - The Characters are near perfect! Only thing i would like is if eren wasn't such a dick to mikasa as she obviously likes him alot and cares for him. I feel like he is just too hostile towards her. As for the rest..you get a perfect balance as the anime shows and explains all the characters in this world perfectly. All the characters have a roll here, even potato girl does XD. I would like to note how more people seem to enjoy levi more as the main character than eren. That's just a personal thing. But alas, the characters are all very memorable and special.\
The enjoyment and overall for this anime is just beautiful. The anime may be one of the more perfect anime i have seen, showing and explaining everything, while keeping us in the dark about things too. ",

    ---=== Setting ===---\
Attack on Titan takes place during a fantasy medieval era where titans (giants) roam the world thirsty for only human blood or in other words they seek/hunt humans. They lack intelligence, communication and emotion.\
However, one day a huge titan larger than ever seen before strikes the human's city breaking their outer wall allowing not only this huge titan in but the others too. This lead to huge death as the titans were able to enter slaughtering hundreds. But there were three walls, allowing the survivors to fall back to the next wall.\
The military were intended to stop the attack as they're trained to\
          \
        kill titans with their special equipment allowing them to take on these large beings. However, they've not had an attack on the wall for an hundred years, this lead to the majority (excluding scouts) of the military to see the titans as not a problem making the current attack on the wall a complete utter devastating loss.\
---=== My Thoughts & Would I recommend? ===---\
From the beginning I knew this was gonna be a good anime, the characters had depth to them and I really developed care for the main characters. I was constantly surprised and I was unable to predict nearly everything making the story unique in a sense. Keep phrase as this genre is played out being the semi-apocalyptic, action story however, even if this area is played out or too common I still felt very hooked as they story is very well written.\
Now would I recommend? Yes, especially to people who are new to anime or haven't seen any anime. I could see this being a great entry anime to all due to it's action and overall ability to make the user addicted to the franchise. For example, I finished the 25 episodes within two and an half days; that's ten episodes per day.\
To expand off why I think this is a great anime is how well they've made it, the action is very entertaining despite being repetitive which shows how they consistently work and improve make every action scene feel like a new fight. Also, there is practically a fighting scene every episode. Kind of crazy but, a lot of viewers enjoy that sort of stuff.\
Lastly, this anime is great to watch simultaneously with a friend due to it's popularity and major cliff hangers after the majority of each episode. In addition, there is a second season which is suppose to come out Spring 2017 which again allows you to really become apart of the franchise.\
Overall, great anime for whats it's genre is and again great for watching with or along with friends.\

    The plot for this show is great. I mean great. The first episode simply forced me to watch the rest of the series (then I had to wait 4 years). The story was unique in my opinion and no wonder it became really popular within only about 25 episodes. The art for this show is realistically detailed and what words are there for the action? \
The anime doesn't lose focus on each character and overall...You just need to see this.\
I really liked this anime because of all of the above and more, the series takes a while to make but I can see why considering\
          \
        the plot and art and action in this. \
If you like anime with a good story line then this is definitely for you.\

    Attack on Titan is a show I wished I like more than I do right now. It has the formula of a good premise, superb action and Captain Motherf’in Levi! However, after finishing AoT, I found it did not scratch the surface of wanting to love this show.\
Weaknesses\
AoT’s most glaring weakness is the cast of characters. Most of the characters in AoT can be summed up to pretty much with one sentence. Erin wants revenge on the titans, Mikasa is a badass who has obsession issues and Armin is, well, Armin. Though, credit to him for having the most development out of all the characters.\
          \
        Then, there’s the rest of the cast: Annie, Connie the bald, Potato Girl and Jean. Honestly, that’s all the characters I could think of off the top of my head as I am writing this review. And it’s a shame because the main trio are not outstanding themselves. In fact, the only characters I was invested in and felt emotions for is Levi and his comrades, before the bad thing happened…\
Another weakness, albeit a minor one, is the pacing. When I was watching AoT, I marathon the show months after the initial hype died down. And wow, almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger. I couldn’t imagine waiting week after week for story arcs to end. The pacing is more of a nitpick than a weakness. \
When are they ever going to get to that basement?\
Strengths\
Captain Motherf’in Levi the Hedgehog!! ‘Nuff said.\
That ridiculously addictive opening!! I wanted this to be opening for the entire show, and I was disappointed when it changed to the second opening, which is good as well, but didn’t have the charm of the original opening.\
Hiroyuki Sawano kills it again as the composer. \
The art style did take a while to get use too, but it fits the show. \
Good premise of an army of Davids vs. Goliath. The superb action scenes!! It’s Berserk Spidermen vs post-manscaping King Kongs!\
The episode with the debut of the spindash!!\
Overall\
The first season of AoT feels like an opening to a story that has the potential to reach great heights akin to the first 13 episodes of FMA: Brotherhood. Even though the show is weak in the character department, it more than makes up for it with its premise and action scenes. And Levi. On a personal level, I wish I was more invested with the characters outside of their one sentence description. It’s kind of a shame that I like the portrayal of the characters more in Attack on Junior High than in AoT. Hopefully, the characterization is expanded in the second season. \
Or Levi becomes the MC. That works too.",

    Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the many anime, which has much more in it, than what is seen on the surface. Of course, it is more understandable, if you read the manga, because it slowly turns into a really complex, mind-blowing plot, but if you stick to the first season, it is already something great.\
It is brutal. With beautiful, outstanding animation, not totally anime-style, takes a little from western cartoons, it draws you in in the first moment. Look at the view of the city, the river, the clouds in the sky... even the forest in the rain. If the events that take place\
          \
        in these scenes weren't so brutal and bloody, it could be purely beautiful. The character animation is not that outstanding, but for example, the eyes are amazingly detailed. And the animators absolutely know, how good they are in creating eyes, because we get many close-ups on them, when they want to show a characters dreams, or emotional turmoil, or pain... So, the animation is purely amazing, while the story of the first episode is already shockingly brutal.\
Absolutely in medias res, we just enter to this post-apocaliptic steampunkish world, and get to know the three main characters, and we can't even finish getting to know them, when the war feeling, the fighting and the horror starts. During the first two episodes, we get a picture of humanity as we don't want to know it. There are no heroes, we see how people react, really react, when faced with death, even those, who are capable of self-sacrifice, and could have beautiful moments, end up dying afraid. And after this beginning, you end up standing there with the need to watch it, because you are just shocked. And after this, brutality stays, there is a lot of fighting, blood, and death in the story, and still, it slowly changes. There is humor, the kind of soldier humor, that gets it's meaning from the fact, that the army is the main society we see during the story. There are strict rules, hierarchy, but also the friendship and trust between the young soldiers, and that's the base of the jokes, and loveable moments. And we are basically there at the duality of the series: it speaks so much about friendship, trust, respect, need for each other, and it is still shocking, scary and brutal. In the army, between the known characters there are beautiful relationships, but once you see the big picture, the political leaders, and see their corruption, there's the duality again. And this makes the atmosphere of Attack on Titan so unique.\
The characters are mostly great. From the main trio, my personal favourite is Armin, who is basically the one, who has the best reflection on the events, but in my opinion the adult generation of the Survey Corps is full of amazing figures. I would take out Levi, but not because he is popular or badass (he is badass, but it's not the point), but because he's character is a total emotional wreck. If you see, how he reacts, how he thinks, what is he doing, you just realise, that this guy has chronical unipolar depression. He has a plotline, character development, and meanwhile, he perfectly portrays a big psychological problem. And he is not the only one. There are many characters, with unique personalities, realistic reactions, and understandable problems. My only problem is with the main character, who is quite annoying, and seems a little plain, mostly, because the others are so interesting.\
And I have to speak about the soundtrack. There aren't so many japanese soundtracks in this anime, the songs are mostly german or english, but they are breathtaking nonetheless. I love listening to the soundtracks of this series, because they are masterpieces themselves. Also they help maintain the \"german feel\" of the story, which - now I read the manga - I understand, why is important.\
And there are the names, the little clues for the future, and I will never end this review, if I keep on writing. I recommend Shingeki no Kyojin to everyone. There are people, who hate it, and I guess, there are only extremes in the case of this story: you either hate it, or love it. There is no in between, because it will have an impact on you somehow. Try to look beyond the surface, let the dark atmosphere and the happier moments trap you for a while, and you will most likely end up appreciating this story.\

    If you asked anyone outside the anime community before 2013 \"What is Anime\" 9 times out of 10 they would tell you that they either had no idea what it was or they'd tell you it's child stuff and would be only be able to give you examples such as Sailor Moon and Pokemon. However this stereotype changed with Shingeki no Kyojin becoming \"Mainstream\"\
When Shingeki no Kyojin was released for whatever reason it had a huge impact on both people in the anime community and people who weren't, it quickly became one of the most popular and beloved anime's and for good reason too, the\
          \
        show clearly wasn't aimed for children and included some of the most kick-ass fight scene's I have ever seen. Not to mention it had one of the most lovable openings in anime history Guren no Yumiya, when this opening starts playing whether you have seen the show or not more than likely you'll try to sing along and miserably fail...\
Honestly this anime is pretty good it certainly isn't my personal favorite anime but it's a really strong Shonen anime and if you don't mind a little bit of gore than this anime is perfect but in all honesty the #1 reason I like this anime is it was original. Remember when I said most people out of the anime community before 2013 only knew Sailor Moon, Pokemon and other children targeted shows? Well this was one of the first shows to become extremely mainstream that showed people that the anime community wasn't only family friendly content. I feel like I talk about this too much but any anime that is willing to go against the generic moe trash that producers love to put out, automatically gets some respect from me. Well there's nothing wrong with moe anime and believe me when I say I enjoy the genre as well but seeing everyone doing it over and over with little changes really hindered the anime community in my opinion.\
I'm really glad that this show of all the shows out there got extremely popular as it showed the world that anime isn't just stuff for children and can contain more adult oriented features. The biggest difference it has compared to other Shonen anime's is it's amount of gore, you can definitely tell they're not afraid to include some more gruesome scenes. Them being fine with having some more rather gruesome scenes lead to some really cool fights scenes that don't just end in a bland (instert blank character dying a boring death) and truly gives you the feel that their world is truly terrifying... In a lot of Shonen anime's you typically find yourself saying that you wouldn't mind living in their world and that it looks pretty fun, not many character's die in allot of other Shonen's so you so typically think you'd have a good chance at surviving and even if you don't the deaths wouldn't be that bad and maybe a little badass... Attack on Titan isn't one of those anime's, they make the world look and feel so terrifyingly scary that you wouldn't ever want to live in it. There is little chance of survival in this world and even if you do the horrors you witness wouldn't be worth it... That's what makes it so interesting though, you can't help but feel bad for these characters that have to endure such a terrifying world, it makes them more likable and you actually feel bad for the characters that go through such terrifying things instead of being envious of them.\
I definitely recommend this anime if you're all right with a little gore as the fight scenes, story and amazing characters and world are all extremely good, there isn't much that's bad about this anime maybe the plot can feel a little bit more dragged out and lack luster but it's not \"bad\" in anyway.\

    Honestly - Attack on Titan deserves its hype! Those who say it's overrated (I used to think so, too, but then I actually watched it...) either need to watch past the first episode or just don't have the same taste. Despite images you may have seen, this story is not only about violence and gore; it is about sacrificing yourself, fighting for your dreams, and finding the sometimes blurred line between man and monster.\
In every area of the show you can see there is pure passion and deep thought put into it. You will easily get sucked into it's amazing, beautiful, and horrifying world with\
          \
        its stunning visuals, lifelike characters, and intense soundtrack. Not to mention the dub is superb. The only reason I gave only a 9 for story rather than a 10 is because we need season 2.\

    So with the exception of Dragon Ball Z and Pokemon growing up - Shingeki no Kyojin was the first anime I was introduced to by two of my friends and me being a stubborn idiot deliberately avoided it because I knew how much they wanted me to watch it... what a mistake.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is simply incredible.\
The story is just brilliant... Humanity trapped within walls and man-eating titans outside. That is all i will say.\
The audio is beautiful - each and every song and piece of music suits the scene and gets the blood pumping!\

        them but I would say Mikasa is my favourite\

    I first reviewed Shingeki no Kyojin after eight episodes to give my impressions of the time. After having seen all 25 episodes of the series, I felt my old review didn't quite capture the overall picture and have thus decided to heavily rewrite it. \
Starting out, I didn't really have any intention to watch Shingeki no Kyojin; the premise didn't appeal to me and while the previews and art I saw of it looked pretty, nothing I saw really compelled me to it. As the season progressed, however, the series' name became rather ubiquitous. All of a sudden I was hearing from numerous others that\
          \
        the show was the show of the season and that I shouldn't dare miss it. This is dangerous talk for me, as I can be prone to hype backlash, but nevertheless I came to the decision to give it a watch and do my best to keep an open mind as I did so. In the end, this was a good call. Shingeki no Kyojin is a very good anime.\
Shingeki no Kyojin looks amazing throughout. Between this and other recent offerings from them, it's pretty clear that Production I.G. are really ahead of a lot of studios in just how gorgeous they can make their anime look. The fight sequences are completely visceral; the lumbering titans appear so heavy and powerful while the humans zipping around to combat them move swiftly and fluidly. I like the way the art looks too; the characters are distinctive and generally have strong designs. \
Sound is also first rate. Music is utilized well to build tension. The sound effects are especially impressive, making the titans feel ever the more momentous with each resonating footstep. The voice actors are about what would be expected. Most of them do a pretty good job, I guess. There is a lot of shouting in some scenes which can get to be a little much. Both opening themes very grandiose, and in slightly different ways though they both suit the series. The ending themes aren't as memorable for my tastes.\
I couldn't really ask for the presentation on a whole to be much better, but what of the story it aims to tell? It's ultimately quite compelling. It's paced generally pretty well; revelations come at the right moments and it succeeds in feeling epic. It can be at times a little overly grim and dour for my tastes at times. You onslaught the viewer with too many sorrowful and solemn bits and you run the risk of approaching melodrama after all. The setting is dark and I know that it wants me to absorb that fact as much as possible with each successive scene of a giant eating a person, but nevertheless it can get to be a bit much, though its best,most glorious moments make up for a lot of it and make for an overall satisfying watch.\
The story itself is intriguing. The setup is quite unique and even at the end I get the distinction that the series has a lot of revelations to throw at us still. It doesn't attempt any real conclusion, so additional seasons are almost invariably on the minds of the studio. Given this, on its own, it naturally feels incomplete, but I'm not going to count that against it. As the first leg in what should hopefully be a longer story, it gets the job done.\
So if the production is so solid and I have mostly nice things to say about the story, why is my score for this only an eight? Well, the big thing letting Shingeki no Kyojin down is the characters, or more correctly one in particular. Unfortunately for the series, that character is the main protagonist, Eren.. He just comes across so much as the typical mopey and angst-ridden shounen protagonist, only much angrier and I just don't really respond to that well. Sure reasons are given for him to lash out and whine... but certain flashback scenes show him as having detached and violent tendencies well before the titans attack. It all just makes him kind of hard to identify with and he doesn't really get much better. Even at the end of the series, I'm not entirely sure how much he's grown really. More often than not, he's just annoying to me and he is the one thing that ends up holding the show back the most.\
Which is a shame since I like most of the other characters. Female lead Mikasa, has a great design, is cool and strong, yet vulnerable enough to still be interesting. She's a little overly dependent, but otherwise she's a pretty awesome character. Eren's friend Armin meanwhile didn't impress me at first, but becomes a better character in time. The supporting players are also really good, tending to be actually developed pretty well, some standing out because in this at times oppressively solemn series they're the only characters who are actually fun. I wish some of the more interesting and colorful cadets got a little more screen time actually as the show really seems to excel when it focuses on them. \
A less than enjoyable main character won't wreck a show for me, but it will hold me back from embracing it. Eren coupled with the occasionally too grim tone is enough to hamper my enjoyment of an otherwise exceptionally produced, clever, interesting and entertaining show to where I feel an eight is a proper score. All the same, it's definitely a show worth following and I would give it a solid recommendation to anyone looking for an exciting piece of dark fantasy action anime and I myself will most definitely look forward to what the future holds for it.",

    Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan\
\"TITANic spot\"\
If your constantly fed up by highschool girls with their bouncing busts as they are lifting up their skirts and showing you a slip of their panties, then look no further 'cause here comes the Survey Corps to bring us liberty. Welcome to the world of titans!\
Story: 9/10\
The bread and butter in this gourmet dish, Attack on Titan brings the best of both world worlds in terms of story telling and presentation. Attack on Titan centers around Eren Jaegar and his group of friends struggling to defend humanity from the threat of extinction against the titans. Here, when we talk\
          \
        about the titans, they don't present them as monstrosities whose appearances and characteristics greatly differ from us, it's actually the opposite. Here titans are human-like giants who have no intelligence at all and only act on instinct by devouring humans. It's just ironic how mindless monsters were able to push humanity to its last stand. But at the same time, believable for no apparent reason. Every aspect of the story is greatly detailed, from the equipment to the world lived and seen by the walled humans. Yet leaving a great mystery on the origins of titan. Here the story tells us, \"The lesser we know the better\", because as of this point, we are greatly admiring the premise of this anime despite the holes in the story. The overall story at this point has great development as it progresses and plot-twists were really shocking yet not knowing why leaves a room for improvement here. The whole story can also be better though, adding a few sub-plots that could ease readers from waiting a month for a chapter of the storyline that supports the entire premise albeit in a different perspective - more likely a \"past in a history\".\
Visual and Audio quality: 10/10\
Production I.G. really have made art in both sound and visual. The visual quality never looses appetite as it is stunningly beautiful that it brings a tear to the eye. Their art style really sets the bar high and animations run very smoothly in anime standards. The atmosphere is also greatly presented in this dystopian timeline.\
Audio is all platinum as well. Seiyuus really made me selfish into letting the others hear their voice as they act out their roles. Soundtrack really gets the blood flowing as it reflects the situation our characters are experiencing in the story. Sound effects are also quite believable. I salute you producers and staff and musicians of the show!\
Characters: 8/10\
If there's one thing that slightly alters the show's course to perfection is there set of characters. As they don't appear too stellar in putting other anime characters to shame. Here we get Armin, the smart-ass tactician but feeble fighter, Mikasa, a prodigy who is rather overprotective towards Eren, the protagonist. There's also the rival, comic relief, crazy genius, cold bastard and much much more. But I gotta say the characters have their own set of personalities and characteristic that help them really stand out without overshadowing the others. How they express fear and shock in the face of the titans are also believable and very realistic, mimicking the human emotion. Characters greatly develop as the plot goes on thus affecting their views of one character to another, greatly adding the thrill to the story. It also let's you feel remorse whenever these characters die because of their experiences in the past which is also greatly emphasized here.\
Overall: 9/10\
I vote Attack on Titan as the anime of the year and is hoping for a sequel to seal the hole it left to the hearts of many devoted fans. You can never get satisfied by just watching the while story once as it drags you to start again from the beginning. \
If you're looking for an anime with a great story, great visual and audio quality and powerful characters, then Attack on Titan is the complete package for you.\

    Shingeki no Kyoujin or \"Attack on Titan\" was one of the most anticipated shows of the season if not possibly the year. Done by Studio Wit, which if i'm correct was a group which spawned from Productions IG, with assistance from IG and music by Hiroyuki Sawano. Put IG and Sawano together and surely you've got the recipe for a breath taking series.\
The art was pretty unique using thick and heavy lines that punched out the characters on the screen, while at the same time using more subdued colors to blend them into the scene. The background art was beautiful and often they'll use wide\
          \
        shots which allow you to feel for the space the characters are in. The animation is good and swings to amazing during battle scenes often using a moving camera or long angles to show the characters zipping between buildings. Now i would have given the art a 9 rating, but here i'm stuck giving them a 7. Where they lost 2 points was that in some key moments they used a lot of CGI. At times the 3D is well blended into the scene or framed in such a way that it isn't noticeable but there are also many examples where it's front and center. There are even times where the 3D animation is terribly stiff. Another reason for the lowered score is the fact that certain titans seem to be designed in such a way that they almost seem comical, one having already earned it's own meme and as i like to call it, \"The Kawaii Titan.\"\
The sound track is definitely one of the strong points of this series. Whatever the scene calls for Hiroyuki Sawano swings your emotions around like a toy. If you've read any of my other reviews involving his work, there isn't much else that needs to be said, his work is amazing.\
The story starts of strong and really works on your emotions and fears. The director does a great job transfering those emotions onto the viewer. When he wants you to tremble in fear and feel helpless, you will feel as such. The best example being at the end of episode one where you and eren watch as someone is eaten alive, kicking and screaming. The direction coupled with Sawano's music truly delivers a scene of despair. The biggest problem comes however with the pacing. There are times when they rush a story arc such as the military training which you didnt even get to see, while at times later on it is fairly evident that they are trying to drag out an event over a longer period of time. It goes back and forth between these two states while occasionally having perfectly timed moments such as the beginning where Zigansha falls, and slightly later during the battle which takes place immediately after they graduate from training.\
The characters are all pretty strong with the exception of Eren, our main character who ends up being somewhat two dimensional and stagnant as he takes on the \"kill them all\" mindset and doesn't change much after that. which has to be said is quite a step up from how he begins the series as sort of whiny brat. However a certain scene which comes up about mid way into the series begs the question, \"why was eren such a weak whiny little runt at the start?\" Some would argue that Mikasa is also completely two dimensional and takes on the persona of the overly attached, completely devoted and caring childhood friend. However in my eyes that seems to be explained fairly well and perhaps slightly too subtly for everyone to have caught on. though there is a scene where she practically tells us why. All of the other characters develop really well and all the characters are introduced and delved into evenly enough that you cant tell if they might die next.\
Overall the show deserves a watch if you're into heavy action and a bit of shock with a bit of mystery in the background. If you can get over the sometimes bad pacing, you wont find this show too bad at all. If a second season comes i'm confident that Wit will have found their footing and they will surely make it a cut above the rest.\

    Quick Personal Note:\
This is my first review ever, so bear with me. I would first like to mention that I usually watch a show when it has finished airing so I can watch it at my own pace. I would also like to mention that I do not read manga at all, so this is all coming from me watching the anime. I will try to make this as spoiler free as possible.\
Story (10/10):\
Very different. Quite a bit (not all) of anime recently has had pretty much the same basic story, boy/girl is in high school and something happens to them that changes their lives.\
          \
        Whether it be magical or just meeting new people, that is how most of them pan out. Now imagine this: Humans are no longer the dominant form of life on the planet. There is something bigger and it just so happens to have a taste for human flesh, they are called Titans. Humanity is on the brink of extinction, and are now hiding behind a series of walls to protect themselves. With this in mind, and after watching the show I can say that the story was done quite well. There were a couple of parts that I could see coming, but most of it I was either too engrossed in watching to try to guess what would happen, or it did a 180 and blew my idea out of the water. Nothing quite says that like flying through the air with your Maneuver Gear and all of a sudden a Titan comes flying out of nowhere catching you in its mouth. This story was definitely full of cliffhangers and moments when I was about to fall out of my seat.\
Art(10/10):\
The art in this show was definitely something I enjoyed. Everything was drawn so crisp and had nice thick lines to show detail. Another thing I really liked was the fact that when a Titan killed/ate someone it started raining blood, they were not afraid to show gory/dark scenes that most other anime would steer straight clear of. The animation was quite excellent as well, when scenes are moving as fast as they were in this show (when using Maneuver Gear mainly) it was still quite clear as to what was going on, where, and who was doing what.\
Sound(9/10): \
The sound was done quite excellently as well. I believe one of the more popular aspects of this show would be the opening soundtrack, as it garnered much attention. That attention is justly deserved as I believe it does sound pretty good. The voices were well done, the background noises, and the sound effects all seemed to fit in at the proper places and sound great. One thing I did not care for was the opening theme for the later half of the series, while it did sound good I didn't care for it as much as I did \"Guren no Yumiya\".\
Character(8/10):\
The characters, while good also suffered some. Out of all the great things about this show I would say that the characters where probably the weakest part. I just felt like some of the characters were just generic stand in characters, or if you will: \"Titan Food.\" Which in this case happened to be true. The main thing for me though, were the Titans themselves, who are indeed characters in this show. I feel as they were not explained or at least \"designed\" very well. I also know that the people in the show itself know little to nothing besides the Titan's weak point. I just could not buy the nonsense of a living being, running around for 100 years with no food and be completely fine. I won't go too far into this because spoilers, but I feel that it could have been better described or elaborated on.\
Enjoyment(10/10):\
Amazing. When I usually watch an anime, I like to watch three episodes in a row at a single time, and multiples of them (6, 9 ,12, etc.). Every time after I finished watching that third episode I just wanted to keep watching it more and more, I literally had to force myself to go to sleep otherwise I would I have marathoned the entire show in a single day. There were so many moments when I was yelling at my monitor in excitement because something crazy cool happened or something crazy spooky (yes I said spooky) happened.\
Overall(9.5/10):\
I had heard and read about all the hype for this show. I have learned that most things that get hyped up so much usually can't live up to the hype so people get disappointed. I also know that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and other people's tastes are different, but I have to say... I really enjoyed this show. Minus a couple of things I believe this was a truly outstanding anime, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys watching anime. It is also a show I could see myself re-watching again just for the entertainment value.\

    Lately, it seems like just about everyone is talking about Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) and after finishing the show, I definitely understand why. If you're looking for an anime to watch, don't approach this with hesitation because of all the hype it's been getting, wondering if you're going to start it with high expectations only to find out it was overrated. Granted, there are always people who don't like things, but seriously. Go watch it. Now. (But read my review first. And then go watch it. Now). \
Story - 9\
I'm sure that some people out there are thinking that this seems like a\
          \
        generic plot line where the headstrong hero avenges the death of someone close to him set to an apocalyptic backdrop. This is certainly true, but why I rated it so high is because of how it was presented. This show has a few key elements that other animes are missing, and that is what makes it stand out. One of these elements is how hard this show hits with the deaths scattered throughout. These deaths - brutal and unexpected - add a level of realism to the anime. Every time a Titan is in perimeter in the show, you as a viewer are on edge, because early on you learn that no one, absolutely no one, is safe from them. This adds an element of suspense that is sometimes hard to find. And with this level of suspense, you also want to keep on watching because you want to know who survives, who dies, who succeeds and who doesn't. Another neat part was the setting. As I previously said, it takes place in an apocalyptic setting, but it is both futuristic and medieval. With some quite outstanding technology (the Maneuver Gear) and yet with such primitive living (horses and carriages instead of cars) it makes it very interesting and different to watch. Also, watching these people struggle to live and then seeing them killed off so horribly, really hits you that this is the remainder of humanity. There are so few of them, and they're getting killed off in horrific manners by these giant monsters. They're running short on food and they can't leave the giant walls that protect them from the Titans. I'll leave it up to your imagination what their solution is to that. This was very real and human and heightened the anime a great deal. Now, no anime is perfect, so I'll tell you the most blatant flaw in the story.  My biggest frustration with the story was the ending. I was into story and the episodes, with everything perfectly paced and big surprises and twists popping up all over the place. And then suddenly, the last couple of episodes suddenly felt rushed and not quite as epic as the rest of the show . Luckily there should be another season upcoming eventually to hopefully recapture the feeling of the first season and resolve the remaining questions. \
Character - 7\
I haven't given the characters a high rating simply because they definitely aren't the most original characters around. Eren is your stereotypical headstrong hero who yells at the world and swears revenge and plows through the episodes with a single-minded determination that shines as his best attribute. Mikasa is the beautiful, brilliant fighter who follows Eren, her foster brother and only remaining family, without any question and protects him with everything she has, refusing to listen to him when he tells her that he's grown up and can take care of himself. Armin is the quiet, meek best friend who wobbles and wavers in the background but secretly has a genius tactical streak that's hidden (for a time). For these three characters, we explore some of their backstories and learn a bit about who they were and who they are now, but we didn't find out as much as I would've liked. I felt like the side characters were all really great characters, who unfortunately either didn't survive long enough to really get to know, or simply did not have enough revealed about them to really become an in-depth character (though you still feel sad every time one of them gets smooshed or eaten). The greatest character development for me was Jean, who went from a boy wanting safety and security to a man who still wanted that but was willing to take the risks needed. \
Art - 9\
I'm not the foremost expert on art at all, but I really liked the animation in this. It didn't happen often, but I liked the still shots of the lines of soldiers with the music and dialogue continuing over it. This reminded me of those old movie openings where the camera would sway over the columns of medieval soldiers trooping through a field. It was a great effect. When the characters were using their Maneuver Gear, I thought the animation was great as we would oftentimes follow them closely through and over the buildings which was a fantastic added element to the storyline, especially with the couple of times where something would pop up and surprise the characters and it would surprise us also because we're right there with them. The Titans were also absolutely creepy and scary in their design. The typical Titan wandering the streets looking for a human to snack on had misshapen bodies with huge creepy eyes. Usually misshapen lumps resembling a human body really grate on me in animes, but for these creepy man-eating monsters it was a perfect combination of creepiness and their lack of humanity (despite the fact that they kind of sort of look human).  Then there was the sharply defined muscled bodies of the select few Titans who held a different job than the others, a sharp contrast to the colorless lumps of the normal Titans. I definitely thought the animation was spot-on for this anime!\
Music - 10\
I'm a musician and I love music, so the soundtrack of any show or anime is pretty important to me. I thought the music was fantastic. It fit perfectly for the anime with the intense, loud musical lines that matched the equally intense battle scenes where people would be falling one after the other. The opening themes were both perfect as well. I remember starting the first episode of this anime, listening to the first five seconds of the opening, pausing, and going off to download the opening song and putting it on my iPod before continuing the show. The first opening was Guren no Yumiya by Linked Horizon and had a darker feel throughout it, while the second opening, Jiyuu no Tsubasa, also by Linked Horizon, was more triumphant. I felt as though the music was a huge part of what made this anime so great. \
Enjoyment - 10\
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It's definitely a bit gorier than your average anime so be cautious if you're squeamish. I personally felt like this also added to the anime and made it darker and more realistic, which is unusual for me to say about an anime. The music was fantastic, the art was great, and the characters likable. This is the first anime in a few months that I've really intensely enjoyed and recommended to friends. So this is my recommendation to you and I hope you enjoy it! \

    Attack on Titan is one of those animes that everyone tells you to watch and when you do....you start telling other people you have to watch it. This anime has a great premise that keeps you into the story. There are two gripes I had with Attack on Titan, however. The first one would have to be that there wasn't any life in most of the character, but it kind of understandable because they are all so focused on fighting the titans. The last one is that there are some slow parts. When this anime is on it's fast paced, death and blood everywhere, creepy\

    Well where do we start .. i think that this anime has some great points .. although it has as well bad ones wich makes the anime a lot worst. \
\
Starting with the good points. \
The art is really good, We see even the houses with a nice detail, and the titans are so well designed that it make them look real :O.  \
The plot is cool. I love the idea of a humankind closed inside of walls like birds inside of a cage. I think in the first episodes we love the idea of titans, but once we get used to it, no\
          \
        longer is interesting.. but they fix this by creating a mistery behind the main character, Eren and behind the identity of the titans and how did they appeared. So we start watching this show no longer because of the titans, but to figure this out, so find out the answer. \
Now .. about the best aspect in this show, the sound. Personally, it is the best soundtrack i've ever seen. All of it it's good. I did not found any bad sound, they all fit properly in the action.. On this show, the sound is everything. Normal fights wich are not that great, became EPIC due to the soundtrack .. i think if it wasn´t for the sound, this show would suck for real.. \
Both the openings are outstanding .. fits perfectly into the plot. Especially the first opening, it make us want to fight against the titans .. there is just one word to describe both the openings .. EPIC   \
\
The bad points.. \
First, we have the main character being nothing more then a cliché. It seems that they took this character from a shonen, changed his design and it's done. We have Eren.  The only thing that i found interesting on this character, is definitely his wish for revenge. Anything else is not original nor creative.. \
The rest of the characters are normal .. besides Mikasa, Armin, Rivaille and the titans all the others are just there to die lol .. thet are not explored, they don´t do anything during the fights .. honestly i don´t know why they are there.  \
We do see some drama, but it's really week due to the lack of development, so it makes us say \"Ok, i want see titans instead\". The romance between Mikasa and Eren is weird but at the same time, it's nice to watch their relationship. \
\
So, i gave this anime a 8/10. I recommend this show, if you think you are sensitive, you may get shocked at the first episodes.. but as i said, you get used to the idea and no longer scares you xD. If you are like me, you will shake just by hearing the soundtrack :D \

    Team work? Love? Friendship? Bravery? Pain? Loyalty? All of those words don't even come close to describing Attack On Titan. I was expecting the show to be about stupid teenagers fighting muscular giants who happened to eat people as well as probably getting themselves killed because of something stupid they did , but I was completely wrong. Not only were the characters not stupid but they also, 1.were all unique and had they're own personalities, and 2. loved and charished eachother even if they didn't show it right away. Now I think the loving and charishing part is really important in this series because not\
          \
        only we're most of the characters from different places inside the wall but there were so many times when a teammate or teammates got into trouble and it would have been safer to leave them but they were helped regardless of it being duty or not.\
\
Now since I've got the characters down I'd like to talk about the art. I'm a sucker for good art and perfect gore and I must say this covered it. The art wasn't anything special but the gore was awesome!  The graphics for blooding squirting and flesh tearing really made the show more surreal .\
I've seen alot of shows including anime and I have to say this show tops it.\

    What can I say about SNK? I initially met the manga, and fell in love at first sight, and when I saw the anime my love only grew. But what is it that makes the series so well regarded and attended by virtually the entire world?\
Probably because, even though there are creatures \"that do not exist in the real world\" the characters are very real. They can pass any kind of feeling they feel for the person who's reading / watching. They behave in a way that any human being would behave in this situation.  So I say, what wins the audience, are the\
          \
        characters. What good have a perfect and unique history, without even developing the characters? Then a point to Hajime Isayama for creating incredible characters.\
And well, that magnificent history. A whole new world, scary and unlike anything we were accustomed. This was a blow to me! But at the same time, very good. For a long time I did not watch anything that really let me weeks, months thinking about what might happen. From the first chapter / episode SNK this being one amazing experience for me. Thank you for creating this perfect work Hajime Isayama. Well, here it is basically a summary rather small compared to my opnion complete, but that's okay, because if not it will be very big here XD",

Story (5):\
Were introduced to a world that takes place centuries back. It is here where giant humanoid monsters dominate humanity. The survivors of the human race enclosed themselves within walls to ensure their safety and survival. But that all changed when the colossal titan attacked. The rest of the story focuses on three main characters, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin as they make a pledge to explore the outside world.\
The main complication with the plot is the incredibly slow pacing. Even after watching the finale, I felt like there were no\
          \
        problems that were solved. Instead were given a cliffhanger that brings out even more questions. The Attack on Titan episodes goes as follows, a recap, a buildup of suspense, and the moment things get good, a cliffhanger. This process continued right to the very end. In addition, the series consists of long, tedious, dialogue, so brace yourselves. Over the span of twenty five episodes, there were only two scenes that I recall worthy to be considered ”epic”. But in spite of all that, Attack on Titan is one of the those few anime that is capable of keeping you on your toes for episodes on end. \
Art (8):\
- Proper colours used for the set mood\
- Fluidity in some scenes weren't smooth\
- Fantastic character designs\
Sound (10):\
If there is one thing the creators of Attack on Titan delivered perfectly, it's the use of their phenomenal OST. Each track is unique in setting the mood in creating extra depth to its action scenes, as well as developing a strong eerie atmosphere around characters that are engaged in conversation and discussion. The influence these tracks have on the show as a whole is a contributing factor to what makes this anime so memorable. Courage, fear, despair, casuality, are some of the many emotions that can trigger in you, and its success in doing so well to emphasize that these are the same feeling the characters go through assist in bringing us straight into the shoes of those who have pitted themselves against the face of danger. To think that such a simple concept of music can bring such a strong connection between the viewer and what is being viewed is something many anime fail to achieve; what makes Attack on Titan's OST stand out compared to those of other shows is that it accomplishes this goal consistently, and essentially any scene flawlessly. \
The actual soundscape itself is also very well done, from swift sounds of blades digging into flesh to the ferocious stomp that shake the very ground. From what I can tell, the show definitely rolled up its sleeves in taking on the challenge to prove what the meaning of large scale destruction was. The dynamic sounds produced to give us a vivid idea of a building falling apart with its bricks smashing to the grounds, or even what the massive weight of a titan sounds and feels like crushing down a structure/human being is nothing short of amazing. All around I was very impressed in the performance of Production I.G. in delivering what I believe was the greatest soundtrack of the year.\
Character (2):\
- Poor character development (not a single tear shed to the ones who died)\
- Eren's is just a screaming little baby throughout the anime\
- Mikasa is just the typical OP character that you can't beat\
- Armin is just that annoying sidekick that has to be saved every five seconds\

They are probably the most talented voice actors in any anime sub I've ever seen!\

      -The characters in this show are the only thing I sometimes disliked. For Example(2nd spoiler alert), Although Mikasa can be quite a strong female character, at times she seems to submit to Eren, even when he is acting like an arrogant jerk, which personally annoys me.

    Wow. That is my reaction after watching attack on tittan. This is an amazing anime, that is sure to influence many anime to come. The story in this anime is a little cliche being about revenge, but its the setting that is the main point of this show. You can feel the pain and distress the characters experience making you grow attacted to them before they get swallowed by a naked giant. The soundtrack is fantastic, it really helps draw out emotions and set the tone altogether leaving you breathless. The pacing is really well done, it really amplifies the drama. The animation is top\

    Shingeki no Kyojin , probably the most hyped up series of 2013 and I will have to agree that it's worth the hype. For those whom managed to avoid spoilers and have not watch it yet , oh what are the chances.. Watch it. Yes, trust me, it's worth it. I will try not to include too many spoilers but it's sort of hard to do so when reviewing one of the greatest anime series of all times ( at least in my books it is).\
Disclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means.\
Story :\
          \
        7/10\
The story is basic and follows a linear storyline of.. Wait , I guess the series title pretty much said it all. Yes , it's that simple. I will just do a TLDR in order not to spoil. The main protagonist - Eren Jaeger vows to destroy all the titans after a fateful incident that happened when he was young which changed his life completely and because of that , he enlisted in the military in order to fight these supernatural beings known as the Titans in which humanity had lost against for the past ??? years. The story pretty much revolve around that with some twists here and there.\
\
Art : 9/10\
The art style is comparable to One Piece's , not in terms of simplicity but rather, it's uniqueness. Each character are outlined beautifully to make them stand out from the beautifully drawn landscape and all the minor details were beautifully drawn out , combined with excellent animation. It also refrained from censoring too much which is unconventional compared to other series who likes to tone down the violence and gore (with the exception of Berserk I guess ?)\
The characters' expressions are very well-depicted in the art style and you could really feel what they're feeling at times which had me bawling at episode 22. (again , no spoilers) For those whom had seen this series , you probably know what I'm referring to.\
The animation itself is praise-worthy , however. I only have one tiny bit of irritation which is why the heck does these terrifying man-eating titans have to look like.. retards. This is the reason that refrained me from giving it full marks. And PS : the 3D maneuver gear looks bad ass as hell.\
Sound :\
Oh yes , this is definitely the key highlight to this show. For people like me who is simply an orchestra-music-junkie , THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU. YES , NOTE THE EMPHASIS. I have to really bow down to the composer for composing such great soundtracks for a great series. Shingeki no Kyojin would never be the same without these soundtracks and because of the soundtracks , I like the anime much more than the manga which is really rare.\
Most of the soundtracks are mediocre or above average but a few really stands out from the rest as excellent soundtracks. Maybe it's just me because I really like orchestra music but trust me , it really do sound awesome and makes the scene so much more dramatic and epic. Honourable mentions are Vogel im Kafig (duh).\
What makes it even more amazing is the way the soundtracks sync with the scene as though they created the scene before composing the perfect music to go with it instead of the other way around. Shingeki no Kyojin definitely has the BEST soundtracks I have ever heard , and yes it's even better than B13A from bleach.\
The openings and endings.. Well.. The first opening had me hooked right in the FIRST episode. Yes , it's that catchy and the CGI is awesome. I'm not a big fan of the second opening though which is the main problem with most animes that they have to switch out the awesome opening with a normal-mehhish one. The endings are above average.\
As for voice acting..\
The honourable mention : Eren Jaeger. Bam! No surprises here.\
For those who keep tracks of which seiyuu is doing which character in which animes, you would have known that Eren's seiyuu , Yuki Kaji, almost voices other characters but the difference is that, those characters are barely as serious as Eren and are most of the time, goofy.\
Yes , compare Eren with Hyoudou Issei from Highschool DxD. You would already know and Yuki Kaji still did an excellent job voicing Eren. You will know why when you hear his voice acting especially when he needed to depict anger and rage.\
Character : 8/10\
Shingeki no Kyojin have a huge cast of characters which sadly , most of them either being transparent in the anime series (which they would play a part in the upcoming season 2) or wind up DEAD. Yes , dead. All I can say without spoiling is that , DO NOT LIKE ANY CHARACTER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. The series is notorious for killing off it's characters for character development or plot progression which is the reason I highly advise you not to play favouritism and like any characters , for they might end up dying in the next episode.\
The character development is there and you can see as the series progress. One honourable mention would be Armin whom started off as a wimp that could do nothing but cry and after the timeskip , he's still the same old crybaby. He then matures into the squad's essential tactician.\
Enjoyment : 9/10\
I have enjoyed this series very much , with much credits to the soundtracks and beautiful animations but I have to say. Like most animes , the pacing is a problem as some episodes' pacing is really.. You would probably want to knock your head on a wall because it's slow compared to other episodes. However , most of the episodes are pretty well-paced save for a few.\
This series definitely deserves it's hype.\
Overall : 9/10\
Taking into account that this series is only season one and there are many things still left unanswered , I would have to give this series a 9/10. I'm just that much of a sucker for it's soundtrack. \
For each review that I do , I would usually compare the series to it's manga/anime counterpart and for Shingeki no Kyojin , no doubt that the anime far surpasses the manga. I would advise people to wait for the season 2 instead of continuing from the manga. Not because the manga is bad or anything but I definitely think that this anime's season 2 deserves the wait.\

    Hands down the best anime series I've watched in a while. Whilst the art isn't my cup of tea, the storyline and the character development is top notch, enough to give is a 10/10.

However, I will give a fair warning to those sensitive beings out there, this anime might break your heart a few times a long the way, but this is what makes it as good as it is.

The music is so perfect the way it fits for the best moments. Then the openning, nothing can not described how pumped you get when you hear it for season 1. \
You would think the plot is pretty much kill Titans and trying to survive, but then there is just more to it. It's about strategies, commitment, and friendship. The characters are understandable and if you could be in their shoes you would connect with them. Also the plot isn't rushed.\
The art is a bit different but in a nice way, the characters and scenery are drawn nicely.\
          \
        The animations are just wish. All in all the art gets a 9 from me.\
Enjoyment is guaranteed for this anime, it will get you hooked and just amped. That's a 10 for enjoyment because you get so anxious for next week. I know I was. I would recommend this to anyone. \

    In my opionin this is one of the best anime I have ever seen. Because not only it has an amazing story, the art/graphics are amazing not your usual round eyes. Also, it's very specific on the details and all the gore it's amazing. Not wanting to talk about the anime and what happens but there was an episode where something happened and I thought the anime wouldn't be has good after that so I stopped watching, after all, the anime only got better and what I thought it happened on that episode it wasn't that at all.\
Also, it's not magic, it's not something crazy\
          \
        that you almost think it's impossible, ok maybe the titans that doesn't exist (but it could). But the weapons, the armory, etc it all cames with an explanation of how they use it. Which is amazing.\

    If you're reading reviews on this anime, you've probably heard all the hype and are trying to find out if this anime is as good as people say. So, is this anime good? Yes. Does it live up to the hype? Not entirely. \
Before you stone me, hear me out. Maybe it was just me, but I went into this anime expecting a anime masterpiece like FMA: Brotherhood, Code Geass,  or Ghost in the Shell...I mean something really good...and Attack on Titan just didn't meet this level for me.\
Don't get me wrong it was a good anime. I liked a lot of things about\
          \
        it. The character development was fantastic. This isn't just any old action anime where the characters hack and slash their way to the end of the series ushered along by paper thin rational and moxie. By the end of the series you will know most of the characters and their reasons for acting as they do. Attack on Titan also does a good job of portraying characters as real people. They are effected by fear and sadness in a way that a lot of animes seem to skim over, or don't consider. \
Another thing I found really admirable about this anime was the main character. A lot of main characters in action anime's are the strongest and the best, and if they aren't they train until they are. Not the case with Attack on Titan. Eren is not weak, but he does not go above and beyond his peers or enemies either.\
I can't find a solid flaw in this anime that leads me to say its good and not great. It just lacks some sort of magical quality that make the animes I mentioned above go above and beyond. \
My tip to anyone thinking of watching this anime is that they forget all the hype and just go into it like they were getting ready to watch any old anime. I didn't and I think it my have damaged my view of it slightly. It may be a bit slow, but if you stick in there it really is worth the watch. \

    I'm only 14 episodes in, but I figured I'd share my thoughts. This anime can be fun to watch but it definitely has its shortcomings.\
Story\
Humans are no longer the head of the food chain. Giants that have enslaved them a century ago return and put an end to their enclosed life. Humanity must take up arms, muster their courage and fight against these returning giants. The main characters realize their ultimate goals and the story really gets to its roots. \
Spoiler-- maybe? One of the Titans in particular rams down the wall very early in the series, springing the story into action. One factor to\
          \
        consider is the fact that the pacing then jumps forward a few years. This is due to the fact that the main characters are simply too young for the military. This really begs the question: just where did that bulldozing Titan go? Is he just enjoying the scenery somewhere else? It seems unrealistic.\
Then we start getting to the fighting. The real battle encompasses a total of nine episodes. The pacing throughout this is fine yet utterly slow at the same time. Does that make sense? Almost as if it's moving like real time. There's so much freaking out and \"this person must convince that person if they must continue.\" It got to the point where I began reading some of the many dialogue scenes half-heartedly. \
Art\
The art style is unique. I personally like it, though they kind of do that black-shadow... dramatic facial expression thing a lot. Another thing to consider is that the colors become very... er, bland. The show comes off as trying to be so depressing that the usual color fades to browns and grays. Even the sky remains a dull orange.\
The fighting scenes run very smoothly (the manuver gear is awesome.) And the irises of their eyes are the best I've really seen so far.\
Character\
I guess you could say the characters are kind of typical, but enjoyable nonetheless. Eren is your usual headstrong and angry protagonist. Armin is cowardly yet possesses great intelligence. And Mikasa is all brawn and strength. My opinion of Mikasa is kind of low. I feel as if she appears too perfect and lives solely for Eren. She even pisses him off from time to time.\
 Lots of side characters are also initially introduced. You could come to care for characters such as Jean, Connie, and certain upper military ranks-- but the rest of them aren't actually shown enough to feel for them. At all.\
Conclusion\
Though it has a few shortcomings, all in all it's a decent anime to watch.\

    This anime gets a lot of well deserved hype especially since there have not been a great deal of good anime this year but don't let the hype ruin your own viewing experience of this anime because it would be a great injustice. Attack on titan has a good mix of action, story and character development early in the show which would make anyone gain immediate interest in the series. The art is outstanding showing that a lot of money and faith has went into creating attack on titan. My only nitpick so far is the voice acting especially for Eren the main character l\

     It's doesn't matter how the sound is, or the quality is in an anime. What matters is how the anime impacted on the viewers. How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\
 I remember hearing my friend telling me I should watch this anime, and you know what? I couldn't care less. Just because I've got a lot of other things I had to do. Just after a month or so, I remember something about titans. So I looked it up and remembered this was the anime he was talking about. So I\
          \
        thought. Why not? I watched the first episode AND MANNNNN WAS IT AWESOME. I watched episode 1 to 10 in one night. I was suppose to study for my midterm, and end up watching it in ONE NIGHT. I was tempted to read the comments because it had spoilers. But I suggest you don't do that. Because it will ruin it for you guys. So I will hope to pique your interest by writing down my reviews, and reaction so far. No spoilers of course.\
 Basically Shingeki no Kyojin follows the story of Eren Jaeger, His adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their Friend Armin Arlart. The Titans have forced humanity to retreat into their system of concrete walls. Maintaining 100 years of peace. One day a gigantic 60 meter titan attacked the walls. Forcing mankind to abandon their land. Leading them closer to the center.\
 Eren Jaegar, witness his mothers death on that day and vows revenge against the Titans and later enlists in the military, followed by his 2 friends. His thoughts always comes out of his mouth, and sometimes that leads to trouble. \
 Mikasa Ackerman, his adopted sister that thinks of Eren Jaegar as someone she would protect, and die for. Even Eren's parents see him as reckless person. So Mikasa always looks out for him.\
 Armin Alart, really smart kid and also a coward. He is always protected and saved by Eren, and Mikasa. Always thinking of himself as someone who is weak and being a burden to his two friends. He enlist in the military because of that reason, and when push comes to shove. He can do more than what you would think.\
 So far this anime is amazing, and I'm about to read the manga. I would suggest watching it first because it gets you pumped. Well... It got me pumped. So therefore I will have to read it since I can't wait. I'm even tempted to cosplay. You won't regret watching this guys. It's amazing.\

    Recommended – Yes, at least a couple of episodes or 1st season, since it’s a classic.\
Read the Manga - No.\
Best Characters – Jean.\
Worst Characters – Mikasa, Eren.\
PLOT ❻/❿\
Pacing is good; things are continuously moving, 2nd season hits the ground running. Apocalypse idea not very new, but titans are very cool visually, very much like Tokyo Ghoul. AoT world is extremely complex and explained in detail, so watchers are able to immerse themselves in it easily.\
CHARACTERS ❷/❿\
Characters are the anime's weakest link. Characters visually pretty bland, personality wise one dimensional; you can describe most characters with just one word. Best characters are Jean and Armin. Mikasa\
          \
        is overrated; physically strong but emotionally weak as she exists only for the sake of Eren. Eren is so righteous it gets annoying and it turns you off.\
ART STYLE ❺/❿\
Solid, gritty style with heavy lines matches the apocalypse tone, but nothing particularly outstanding.\
OVERALL ❺/❿\
Unlike the majority of anime fans, AoT is not my cup of tea at all. It's overrated to me. I commend AoT on trying to do something different; the titan concept is great, its fictional world is constructed with much detail. AoT is a big player in the adventure/apocalypse/shounen genre. However, my biggest gripe with it is that unlike with Tokyo Ghoul, I don't care about the characters and with the odds stacked so much against them, rather than cheering for the humans, I find myself cheering for the Titans to eradicate humanity so this anime can just quickly come to an end.\

    My opinion after finished 25 chapters of this Anime, this can be considered as a clearly image of satirise to society about castes and classes of people. That this Anime reflects this point through three circle rows of the walls...It seems that people who live in outer wall (or live in Wall Maria) have the highest risk for dangerous to face Titan that sometimes they've directly faced with Titan and have seen people get eaten by Titan right in front of their eyes. This situation is different with people who live in middle wall (Wall Rose) and the inner wall (Wall Sheena), that these people\
          \
        always have a luxurious and joyous life by not even care others except their groups...\
Besides of the clearly social reflects as mentioned, the story line also has excitement and attract to follow up itself that probably made audiences shocked since the end of first chapter. This Anime also has various unique characters who have different characteristics. Likewise, those characters have a development of their thinking and their action, which were made and looks real. Because in human's life always surrounding by several types of people which include people who can sacrifice themselves for others, people who don't care anyone except their beloved, or people who don't care about any life and care only external assets.\
Readers who interested in, or prefer to try Anime which reflects heavy social issues, along with action and fun, author recommend 'Shingeki no Kyojin' for you. Readers also has a possibility to follow up and cheer up the characters that how can they survive from those Titans, how many Titans which they can eliminate, and how about this society at last.\

    Unlike the general public, I honestly didn’t like Attack On Titan. Sure I loved the idea around it, but in the end I felt like it didn’t really go anywhere. I love how Eren was able to turn into a titan and the way mostly all the other characters were basically against him from that point on. It was a great character struggle. However, the writers do something that I absolutely hate. They abused/flaunted it’s rating. I have nothing wrong with rated M anime, and I have nothing wrong with the fact it’s obviously going to be gory. However I don’t like it when a\
          \
        show kills off characters just because they can. A majority of the characters deaths lead to no greater meaning and don’t progress the plot in the slightest. It basically seems like, “we didn’t know what to do next so we killed off a bunch of random characters you knew and loved for the feels… even though it really doesn’t matter and they’ll most likely be forgotten in the next episode.” The show spent most of it’s time focusing on Eren, which in the end worked against it because they just kept constantly showing off how great he was rather than focusing on character development or plot. I feel like the cast mainly stay the same and usually revert back to their normal self after terrible things happen. Eren is always angry and crazy about destroying all the titans, Armin is usually shy and too afraid to stand up for himself, and Mikasa is just a calm killing bad-ass with nothing more to her character… oh and she’s obsessed with Eren and keeping him safe, which I find rather aggravating since she just adds to the show trying to build Eren up to be this great character, even though he is a rather basic character that rarely ever changes.\
In conclusion, the show had some great ideas and would have been great if it had more direction, rather than people dying being whatever they fell back on when it seemed there was no where else to go with the plot. Well, that and killing Eren off just to make him of course survive and come back just to show how amazing he is. Really though, instead of trying to build Eren up so much they should have tried to make him a more interesting complex character, instead of just an ordinary hero with a tragic past with a few altercations. In the end, the show would have been great if they tried to flesh out their characters more rather than solely focusing on the action part of the anime. For me, the awesome fighting scenes weren’t enough to pull it through when the characters were very under developed and dull. \

        distinguishable from each other and cinematography and interactions are sublime. The story is driven off emotion, animators have thought through facial expressions well enough to understand complex human emotions such as despair and trust. \
Sound, keep this a secret but I ended up torrenting this as a 1080p English dub (like any rookie would). The file had two tracks, one spoken in Japanese and the other English. Voice acting for characters like Eren are well done and comes across as immersive. Sound effects like sword blades and stock effects such as earth crumbles or even the sound of bells are supper immersive and keeps viewers engaged.\
Some characters are better than others of course but I'm here to establish the amount of effort put into making these characters and honestly I am torn between a yes and a no. Main characters such as Armin, Mikasa and Eren are very well rounded characters with desires and conflicts. Others such as Annie seem forced. Maybe because we did not see much of her due to a 20 minuet episode length or maybe it is done like that to add enigma to her backstory either way I believe some characters could have been thought out more.\
Enjoyment, well it goes without a saying it is literally a walking dead clone! Jokes aside the story appeals to us western normies because of the Story line and conflicts from start to finish. If you have seen (or played) walking dead, it is all about survival of the fittest, which really appeals to western consumers because we see ourselves (some way or another) in the characters on screen.\
Overall I will give a 9/10 (which doesn't mean shit because its subjective as hell). It would be the only shonen anime I have seen with this unbelievable standard of visual appeal and story telling. \
And to keep it real laddies and gents, Season 3 is confirmed for 2018 \

    \"Merciless But Beautiful World\" ~ Mikasa \
Attack on titan was one the first animes I watched, in fact this was the anime that got me into anime. After watching your lie in april I really went into my corner and cried and for a long time I just forgot about anime and lost memory of the medium itself. But my friends brought me back and what did you know, I was kind of weirded out by the titan porn in episode 24-25 and I looked at them with weird faces when they showed it to me but I sighed and said I'll watch it. \
In\
          \
        short, I binged watch the anime and thought of it as the singular best thing of all time and I loved it so much that I got posters changed my usernames and become a complete fanboy. I read the manga (season 2 was coming out the week I finished the anime) even though knowing season 2 WAS COMING OUT IN 3 DAYS!! \
But as I started watching other anime I came to the conclusion, Attack on Titan isn't really that good. \
Story: \
The story is one the most intriguing parts of the entire series. I thoroughly enjoyed the series story with the subtle details placed and larger plots holds which are to be explored. The titans were a very interesting aspect of the story and even more was (SPOILER) Eren being able to transform into a titan. The arcs although being a bit slow paced especially the first half of the female titan arc still maintained a respectful and understandable storyline. I enjoyed the mystery and tension in the fall in the Fall of Shiganshina arc and also enjoyed the the battle of trost arc with amazing scenes and also throwing me off course (I didn't SPOILER, think eren died or I couldn't believe it when he was eaten kind of shocking but I was later not surprised when I saw the titan fighting the other titans) The female titan arc was amazing and the mysteries that come afterward surrounding titan shifters left me very siked for what was to come! \
9/10 \
Art: \
Nothing to say here amazing loved every bit of the animation, a bit odd but amazing! \
10/10\
Sound  \
The sound was also really good I'm not the expert in this area but it wasn't really noticeable; I watched it a second time to get a feel for the details and only than was I able to really perceive the sound track. In short it was good. \
7/10 \
Character: \
Here is the downfall of the series the worst aspect of the series, the characters. They were absolutely no depth the characters forgettable characters like Marco and denying screen time more interesting characters like jean. Eren personality wasn't very interesting at all; \"i want to kill the titans, I want to kill the titans! I WANT TO BLOW THE TITANS\" it was very boring and I couldn't stand him at all. The characters backgrounds were what made them interesting but what good is a character that screams 24/7 about the same thing over and over again.  I get it when a character is trying to make a point that he/she repeats a common goal but all Eren ever says is \"I WANT TO KILL ME THE TITAN HEYE OHO\" \
6/10 the characters could have been much better \
Enjoyment: \
9/10\
Only because the first time I watched it was like a god apple was sent to me and it was really good\

The thing is with Attack on Titan, I feel that it tries a bit too hard. Its base story of the titans is a cool idea, and the whole isolated town protected by walls thing is pretty cool too. But what I don't understand is why the town is basically built to be invaded. The design of it is crap. The characters I also feel aren't overly captivating. At first they were interesting, but after a while nothing really developed and I got so bored that I decided to just drop this series. Nothing really developed and nothing really came out of me watching\
          \
        it apart from pure boredom.\

    As someone who's only grown even slightly comfortable with large amounts of blood and gore in the last few years, plus past experiences having reinforced for me the idea of trying as hard as possible to take hype with a grain of salt, for a while I didn't think this was a series for me. For one thing, just seeing the Colossal Titan, a creepy and massive giant without any skin, was pretty unnerving. But eventually, a bunch of my friends convinced me to give it a chance, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.\
From a psychological and sociological perspective, just the idea of\
          \
        a show where humanity is unquestionably no longer top of the food chain definitely grabbed my interest. How would seeing mankind's last bastion regularly endangered after a long period of relative peace and quiet affect our human society? Attack on Titan addresses that without pulling any punches, and I definitely respect it for that. As for the characters, the main trio of Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are distinct, likable, and complement each other well with their respective strengths as well as flaws. The supporting cast is a rather...interesting case in that those we get to know do wind up being rather interesting to watch develop and learn about. Beyond that, though, I can't say much else for fear of spoilers.\
The art style, especially for the action sequences, is consistently strong throughout each episode from what I could tell, and the music...oh my goodness gracious, it is FANTASTIC! Both openings and closings are incredibly epic and memorable in their own ways, and I cannot do them justice by describing them here. If I had to think of some gripes, I can come up with two. One, however, is such a personal nitpick regarding a certain detail of how certain characters are drawn that stating it would result in a long, LONG tangent. The remaining issue relates to audio and writing. I've watched both the English subbed version on Crunchyroll and the English dubbed version on Toonami, and while the voice acting in both is phenomenal, the WRITING for the English dub is...strange and unnecessarily different. Had there been elements of Attack on Titan that would not really translate well from a cultural perspective, I could understand. But with how West-inspired the series itself feels to me, I think that many of the alterations in dialogue for the English dub are just plain odd. Maybe that's just me, though.\
Attack on Titan is a fun series that is also pretty thought-provoking at times, which is really all one can ask for. But even if you're like me and hype and gore can be pretty big turn-offs, I still recommend giving this series a chance. Who knows? Maybe you'll be surprised like I was.\

    Warning possible Spoilers\
So Attack on Titan an anime that has become very popular over the years because of it's premise, characters, action and a lot of other things, although some people think it's overrated am I one of those people oh hell no.\
The story is set centuries ago with mankind on the brink of extinction thanks to the terror of the Titans and after 100 years of an uneasy peace behind the giant walls a new Titan called the Colossal Titan brings it all crumbling down, after escaping near death a young boy named Eren Yeager vows to kill every last Titan that exists and\
          \
        bring freedom to humanity.\
Now you could compare this story to pretty much any Zombie film or TV series just a lot bigger however the situation is so much more and complex than you think, it was exhilarating seeing what's left of humanity trying desperately to survive against an almost impossible threat and yet even when they are knocked down and having lost countless friends they still fight no matter what because most of the characters in this show know that Humanity can somehow win if they just keep fighting and with the new revelations they find out about the Titans give's them new strength to believe in victory.\
The show also goes into detail about the Titan's themselves well sort of because we have no idea what these things are or where they came from other than that they look like giant humans that eat normal humans so their existence is a mystery itself and finding out that normal humans can somehow harness the power of a Titan changes everything and wanting to find out the secrets of the Titan's origins is incredibly interesting sadly though the first season is very scarce with the details of the Titans and is obviously holding it back for later seasons.\
This story is very dark too since there is death, destruction and fear everywhere because Titans aren't something to laugh they are generally brutal enemies and come in different sizes and forms ranging from normal titans to abnormal titans that react in ways the humans can't predict and people die or there is certainly a lot of death in this show, but when it comes to main characters it doesn't take it that far with them, sure it puts them in near death like situations, but apart from a few not many of the main characters bite the bucket.\
One thing that this show did that annoyed me was trying to hide some of it's plot twists like the identity of the female Titan now I don't know if it was planned or not, but it was pretty damn obvious who is was considering there was only two options who it could've been.\
The characters are mostly great there are a few that I didn't like, but the majority of characters that we were introduced to were pretty damn good.\
Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlelt are the 3 main bunch of characters in the show.\
Eren is the primary male character and he has a severe hatred for Titans after seeing his mother eaten by one and is driven by pure revenge to kill them all, however Eren is a very short tempered person often raging at people around him till someone like Mikasa or Levi shuts him up, but he does care for the people around and strongly protects them along with his pure determination to make sure that humanity gains the freedom it deserves, he also acquires Titan powers early on in the show and seeing him trying to get control of these abilities was definitely a bumpy ride.\
Mikasa is the primary female character, she is Eren's adopted sister after her parents were killed by slavers and is fiercely loyal to Eren even to the point where she'll sacrifice her own life to make sure him and Armin are safe, despite being a soft spoken and detached person she is a pure badass and an amazing Titan killer often using her skills to take on many Titans that could've killed normal soldiers, Mikasa is an amazing character and definitely one of my favourites.\
Armin is Eren and Mikasa's best friend and despite being shown as a weaker person compared to those two he makes up for it in brains because Armin is an amazing strategist often coming up with plans that have saved everyone's lives on multiple occasions, he is also a very hopeful person as his dream is to go past the walls and see what the world lies beyond them.\
Levi is pretty much right next to Mikasa as the most badass soldier in the Survey corps and proves to be a deadly adversary to the Titans, he is a very blunt and unapproachable person mainly because of his experience against the Titans, but he is a strong clean freak often having to grab a brush whenever he enters a dirty room however he strongly cares for his team and never undervalues human life.\
Levi also has a squad who consist of Petra Rall, Eld Gin, Oluo Bozado and Gunther Schultz. Each of these characters have their own quirks and personalities like Oluo's tongue accidents when riding a horse, they work incredibly well together and are the strongest soldiers in the Survey Corps however their complete trust us push on Eren kinda annoyed me and when they all died the only one I gave a damn about was Petra since Eld and Gunther just felt average and Oluo just annoyed me with his posh persona.\
Erwin Smith is the commander of the Survey Corps, he has the same determination to free humanity from the Titans terror much like Eren has, but he is a genius when it comes to making plans or specific decisions that will have major outcomes for humanity which can also include gambling their lives that could lead to extinction.\
Hange Zoe is the commander of the Scientific Research Division, she is a very eccentric and crazy person especially when it comes to experimenting on Titans which is due to her great goal to learn about the Titans origins, however she isn't someone to be taken lightly and can go from hyperactive to damn near terrifying if you get on her bad side.\
There is also the 104th cadet corps which is where most of our characters are located until they join the Survey Corps later on.\
Jean Kirstein is pretty much an asshole and is Eren rival in some cases, his dream was to live an easy life as a Military Policemen and his selfishness really pissed me off luckily he got a well deserved nickname known as Horse face, but after the halfway point he does become slightly better as his experience against Titans gives him a new goal which becomes a lot like Eren's.\
Sasha Blouse is known as the potato girl because she was caught eating a potato on her first day in the Cadet's and she is from the country unlike most of the characters, she is a very lovable character her always wanting to eat attitude along with her non-serious nature makes her extremely funny which is something you'd want in a world like this.\
Annie Leonhart is a much darker person mainly because of her true identity, she is a very cold and detached person not really getting along with the others however she is extremely tough and can certainly take anyone on in a fight especially if their being cocky about her skills, it's eventually revealed she is the Female Titan, but this reveal was so obvious that it was clearly shouting right into our faces.\
Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover are the two guys who were able to help Eren conquer his 3D ODM Gear situation, they are also skilled fighters against the Titans and you never really see them separated from each other, Reiner is more of a joker and tries to light the mood whenever he can while Bertholdt is much more quiet and stays in the background.\
Krista Lenz and Ymir are another inseparable duo though this time because of a more closer relationship however they are completely opposite people, Krista is more cute and innocent along with her kind nature at wanting people to be safe while Ymir is more of a Tomboy and always gives her honest opinion even if it is a bad one.\
Connie Springer is pretty much Sasha's closet friend and partner in crime since he is also a very comedic person and always sees the good side in a bad situation as long as someone has a plan that is worth following.\
Marco Bott is another cadet that joined up so he could show his faithfulness to the King, however he is a very idealistic person and was a valued member of the group thanks to his good leadership skills even though he thinks Jean is better at that, sadly he dies mysteriously during the battle of Trost and his death sparks the change in Jeans goal in life.\
The artstyle was very well done, I really liked the uniforms that the characters wore making it a recognised symbol of the show along with the weapons and the 3D ODM Gear that they use to fight the Titans felt unique in some way and looked pretty damn cool to use, the different districts that Humanity had to live in also had some differences because it showed the importance of each class like for example the outer wall of maria had the poor people while at wall Sina the people there were more sophisticated and well lived and this showed the split in Humanities class system, not only that the Titans had differences too as some were bigger or smaller and the Titan shifters themselves looked really detailed as they took the look of the person who has the power like Eren and Annie's Titans.\
The Soundtrack was also very well done with an excellent first Intro that would get your blood excited for more to come while the second intro wasn't bad it just didn't have the same impact and the soundtrack during the scenes was also really good to listen as it always fit the moment that was going on like when the Colossal Titan appeared or when the Survey Corps goes into battle against the Titans.\
The action was also really entertaining as you never really could tell whether a human or a titan was going to die, well technically a human had more chances of dying, but it was amazing seeing small humans fighting as best they can against monsters that would be horrifying to encounter, the battles were messy too as lots of people died and the scenery after the battle was over really felt like there wasn't anything to gain from it.\
Overall this is a very entertaining and thrilling show that despite holds a lot of mysteries back and doesn't really do very well at some plot twists it was still pretty damn amazing to watch. \

    So Attack on Titan, the most popular anime of 2013. Best thing since sliced bread according to the fanboys, most overrated piece of shit to the haters.\
STORY- 7/10\
The premise of this story is great: Titans have taken over the earth and humanity has been besieged with only three massive walls as protection. Suddenly one of the is breached and humanity is forced to retreat under constant threat of the other two being destroyed as well. Loved it. Did have some pacing issues (as in a lot), but that doesn't really bother me a lot. After the Battle of Trost, stuff does slow down for a\
          \
        while, which I didn't like, but you can't make everyone happy can you.\
ART- 9/10\
While at times I did feel that the art seemed kinda old (mostly when Mikasa and Armin were talking in Trost), the 3DMG scenes easily made up for it, with beautiful POV's of the user grappling from building to building, taking no fall damage at all as they skidded across the floor (even though in the OVA Armin broke both of his legs while walking up stairs). One of the best points of the show, only to be overtaken by the next category.\
SOUND- 10/10\
Hiroyuki Sawano is a master of creating soundtracks that make you feel hopeless one moment, to ready to kill Titans and absolutely annihilate the crap out of those goddamn Titans. No OST that I've ever listened to has even come close to the masterpiece that is Attack on Titan's soundtrack. Honorable mentions to the tracks Vogel Im Kafig, the Reluctant Heroes, and XL-TT as three of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And of course, the openings are unforgettable. Guren no Yumiya is the first opening I've heard that I never skipped once hearing it, and is currently the second most popular anime opening on Youtube (after Tokyo Ghoul's Unravel, another masterpiece). Jiyuu no Tsubasa wasn't as good as Guren no Yumiya, but still did it's job and far outclassed the latter in its full version. The voice acting was also excellent, although if you don't like Eren's screaming, then you might not agree with me. \
CHARACTER- 5/10\
Definitely the lowest part of the show. While the manga definitely develops the characters more, the fact remains that while the anime could have easily done so, it simply did not due to its source material saving the character development for later on in the series, which, unfortunately, did not make it in time to be part of the anime. So many minor characters that get developed in the manga but not the anime that we hardly care about; the only sides that we really care about are probably Levi, Jean, and Petra, and for good reason. \
ENJOYMENT- 10/10\
While this show has its flaws, remember that this is my opinion on the show and what I thought of it. At heart, I guess I'm not that much different from the fanboys, but I thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of this show, even with its flaws. Amazing action scenes, soundtrack, memorable characters (the ones that got developed), I absolutely loved it.\
OVERALL- 8/10\
Unfortunately (for me at least), the show was not near perfection to everyone, and the fact remains that the pacing and characters could have been much better. While the anime is not finished, a lot more could've been done to make everything BETTER. Given that it is an adaption of a manga series and that it can't really do that, I guess Wit Studio tried its best to reduce the pacing issues as much as possible (honorable mention to Episode 22, which is partially filler, but still excellent, and I even thought it was from the manga due to how realistic it was). Recommend to all anime fans (except maybe those who get attached to red-shirts).\

    At an unspecified (pre WW-I) point in history in a (presumably) alternate universe, mankind gets overrun by suddenly appearing giant man-eating zombies called titans. Slightly over a 100 years later, humanity is on the brink of extinction, hiding behind huge walls. \
Like most movies with zombies or giant monsters, this is the kind of story that works best when you don't think about it all too much. Alas, the viewer is given a lot of time for that.\

    One of my first anime, it's a simply aweasome action anime.\
The plot is quite simple, humans live behind huge 50 meters high walls to protect themselves from giant creatures called titans. I didn't want to watch it first, because I thought it was really too dark and I thought titans were terrifying, but I'm so glad I watched this.\
My favorite thing about this anime is the characters. This anime has a powerful cast of characters and great character development. My favorite character is Armin, because at first he was a wimpy guy who thought he couldn't do anything useful, instead he became probably the smartest\
          \
        character who solved most of the mysteries in the series. \
The funny thing tho, is that the story gets extremely dark very quickly from the first episodes. I mean another reason why I didn't want to continue this anime is because of the first episode.\
This anime is also very violent and tragic. It has a lot of moments that will leave you feelig sad annd empty. Every episode with a cliffhanger will make you wanting to see more. This anime will make you want to just go slice some titan ass everywhere.\
Overall, this anime is great for action lovers and people who are new to anime.\

    I would recommend this anime to anyone, even people haven't watched much anime if any at all. The plot itself isn't that hard to follow, so even someone unexperienced with anime can enjoy this. \
The story has a couple loose ends and that is be due to how the original manga is still running meaning the story isn't over yet. So it would be no surprise that a lot of the plot threads are left unresolved in the adaptation. However the anime does a great job telling the story from it's source material, despite some content from the manga being cut out. The grim tone\
          \
        and atmosphere are handled very well, and the story will leave you with more and more question as it progresses. But speaking of the story progressing, the story's pacing slows down as the series goes on. This is mainly the fault of the source material and not the anime. I personally didn't have a problem with this. But I can see people having problems with the pacing and complaining the story is going to slow. But overall, the story has a good narrative and will most likely leave you wanting more.\
The art and animation overall are very good. This especially is the case during the action scenes. Whether there's humans flying around with their 3D maneuver gear to fight the titans, or a titan fighting against other titans; the art and animation really pull through the exhilarate the viewer.\
As a music lover I can say for certain that this anime's soundtrack is just great. The music tracks do a good job of setting the tone of the scenes they are featured in. Many are going to want to search up or/and download the soundtrack after listening to it in the show.\
The characters in the show are it's weakness. There are a lot of characters, and a lot of those characters (spoiler warning) end of dead. However, most are not going to care for the majority of those characters that die because the characters overall aren't fleshed out that much. We only have a few scenes for those characters and then they die. The characters that get the most development out of everyone are Eren, Armin, and Jean. With the rest not getting much development. So unless you're like me and get easily attached the people real or fictional; you won't really care for the characters overall.\
With all of this in mind I give Shingeki No Kyojin/Attack on Titan an 8 out 10 and would recommend it to anyone \

    Shingeki no Kyojin(Better known as Attack On Titan) is an outstanding shounen/horror anime about a boy named Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa, and his best friend Armin. So, anyway, the main plot of AoT goes: Humanity is trapped behind three walls, Maria, Rose and Sina. Each wall is approximately 50 metres tall, and has protected them from the Titans(Humanoid giants who eat people and can be up to 15m tall) for 100 years. Then a 60 metre-tall Titan appears outside the walls....\

    Attack on Titan,or Shingeki no Kyojin, really hit the Anime world by storm in 2013 when it was first airing,and became immensely popular among the Anime community. However,with a rising popularity came difficult expectations and criticism that withheld absolutely nothing,whether they were constructive or pure hatred.\
Shingeki no Kyojin is actually a great show,if you can appreciate that it isn't exactly a masterpiece. The story of Shingeki no Kyojin follows a boy named Eren Jaeger,his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman,and his best friend Armin Arlert,and how their lives are changed after a catastrophic event. At first,we learn of how Eren and Armin have this dream of seeing\
          \
        the world,instead of being locked behind gigantic walls. The walls are in place because the world outside is riddled with titans,abnormally massive beings with a general humanoid look to them. One day,while thinking about that dream,humanity's tranquility is disturbed and left in shock at the sight of a giant titan peeking over their 50 metre wall. The titan proceeded to break a part of the wall,causing an influx of titans to enter the city and begin to devour upon their prey,and leads to a traumatic event for Eren,which begins chaos in his life. Without spoiling anything,the story afterwards becomes a view into Eren,Mikasa and Armin's training in the military to retaliate against these titans,and it gets more compex from there. For those worried about whether it has a proper ending,note that there is going to be a second season.\
The characters in Attack on Titan are all unique,albeit I think some of them needed more fleshing out. There are some truly wonderful characters in this show though,I can give you that much. The soundtrack for Attack on Titan,openings included,was absolutely stunning. I cannot recommend the soundtrack for this series enough. Guren no Yumiya and Jiyuu no Tsubasa as openings stand high in their own respective rights. The music playing in the background was also something to marvel at. The art in Attack on Titan was well done,and the animation could be superb at times. There are moments in Guren no Yumiya that captivate my eyes with such pristine animation. The series,undeniably,is very enjoyable. Looking at it as just another viewer,the series is really good.\
Either the hype for Attack on Titan brought you towards the series,or took you away from it. If there was any doubt that you should watch this,then let that doubt be washed away. Even if you end up not enjoying it,the series is one that needs to be given a try. It might not be perfect in every aspect,but it is extremely enjoyable,regardless of its flaws. Attack on Titan,whether you think that it is a masterpiece or not,is highly enjoyable,and that is one of the most important factors to be regarded as phenomenal in any medium.\

    There is a lot to unpack with this series.  It does so many things right, but makes some very fundamental mistakes that, ultimately, make the show fall flat.\
Let's unpack.  First, we can discuss the amazing potential.  The premise of Attack on Titan is spectacular.  Humanity on the brink of extinction and holed up in a massive walled country with giant monsters threatening the continued existence of the human race.  This alone makes the show worth a look.\
Next, we come to the action.  The 3d maneuver gear makes for some very intense action sequences.  Combine this with very tightly\
          \
        choreographed fights makes for some of the best action scenes in recent history.\
Now, we run into the problems of the show.  The characters are interesting, but as the show progresses, they don't really grow.  We learn more about them, but they, themselves, do not develop or change.  It is a missed opportunity, given the mental trauma inherent in the world.\
Then we run into the violence.  Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with violence if done for a purpose.  The gratuitous violence of Attack on Titan serves a purpose.  It demonstrates just how vicious and mindless the titans are and show how bloody wars really are.  My issue is that the violence is either missing or over the top.  There is very little middle ground.  You become desensitized after a while.  At the same time, the main cast seems to be immune from horrific death and dismemberment.  It's hard to get a sense of danger when I know the main people will escape unharmed.\
Then we have the plot.  It starts out strong, but slowly becomes a mess of unanswered questions and loose ends.  I understand we need fodder for next season, but it helps to answer a few questions as we go.  This is probably due to the manga writer.  In an interview, he admitted that, after dropping so many hints about an important secret was in the basement, he forgot about it and put the secret somewhere else.  This is not a promising development.\
Ultimately, this show can be a guilty pleasure, but it does not live up to the hype and won't be a becoming a classic anytime soon.\
Edit:  I forgot to add that many of these issues stem from the manga.  The author Hajime Isayama is still a relatively new face, as Attack on Titan is his first published work.  Given all the amazing elements the manga brings, elements easily translated into the anime, I have hope that Isayama will grow and put out some truely great work.\

    This is going to be a very short review. More of a story than a proper review...\
I watched Attack on Titan back in 2013 when it was airing. Waiting for the next episode when watching a show like this is not easy. I got so hooked that I started reading the manga but soon caught up with the story. I decided to hold off and let the manga advance a bit but somehow moved on and never got back into it. Fast forward to 2017, Attack on Titan season 2 starts airing. Of course, I wanted to start watching it but after a long break\
          \
        I wanted to refresh my memory on what happened in season 1. So I decided to re-watch season 1 again while letting a few more season 2 episodes come out.\
I wasn't sure I will enjoy it, after all, I remember the main storyline. I planned to take it slow and easy. So I turn on episode 1... And I am literally blown away. I have no idea what happened to me. I sort of knew what was going on but at the same time I was desperately trying to find out what would happen next. I wasn't marathoning for the sake of it, it was by no means a simple chore to remind myself of the story - I was enjoying every second of every episode. I ended up watching 8 episodes straight that day. During the next couple of days, I would come back from work and dive straight back in. I only managed to hold out for 3 days... I wasn't bored for a second. Watching this show for the second time was just as enjoyable as watching it back in 2013. Naturally, the plan to get season 2 episodes accumulate miserably failed...\
For me this is a definite masterpiece and a standard for any dark fantasy action anime. My advice to you: don't even bother watching this late at night if you have work in the morning. You won't be able to stop. You have been warned!\

Shingeki no Kyojin ... where have you been all my life? I wish you'd been there longer to keep me company on those boring Sunday afternoons, when I was lost on the internet looking for something to do!\
You arrested me right in the first episode and did not leave me, with this captivating and not boring story, (although it could have some adjustments). But this your art, these traits and effects... Beautiful! The action parts, the camera plans, the long takes, the perspectives, I feel like I was part of that, as I was a character in your story.\
Each\
          \
        one of your episode begins in a grandiose way, the best opening song my ears could wish for! You can frame each sound with the best moments. Let me tell you, your soundtrack is the best!!\
But like everything nothing is perfect, the character... I think you could improve, it's not bad but compared to other points... We have our hero who is a character, well ... complicated. I do not want to say much about it, I do not want to give any kind of spoiler. so, in general, your characters are even good, follow some stereotypes. Something that marks well, are the 'walk-on'. I got it, in every moment,  feel what they felt, the pain, the fear, the ambition,...\
Overall, what can I say? You're already in my heart, you're here with me, and I'm anxious your second season.\

    Shingeki No Kyojin is one of the few shows that live up to the hype. Its interesting plot and ideas make you want to keep watching for more. Its action scenes are unique and innovative and the music is incredible. Its main characters are one of weaker aspects of the series, particularly Eren and Mikasa. Eren is always angry and hot headed not only at titans but at people in general. He is constantly screaming at characters and is never calm and is an extremely annoying character that I can't root for. Mikasa is one of those female characters whose personality and actions revolve solely\
          \
        around their crush and have no personality or reason to exist otherwise. Armin is alright, although his character development is exactly what you'd expect from a character like him and does little to stand out. The supporting cast however, is far more interesting. A common misconception is that there is no plot armor and anyone can die at anytime. Only minor disposable characters only ever die and it starts to lose its impact when you realize this. Despite its characters, it's still an interesting and engaging story nonetheless.\

    \"in the end no one ever knew what the outcome would be.\"\
By the Gods that reign over anime, this is true ambrosia and nectar, Apple of the Hesperides, oh sacred song of power and might... Like damn, this was good, even with a second viewing.\
No anime can be perfect in the truest sense of the word, namely, to have no flaws in the various factors that make an anime good -- animation, soundtrack, plot, characters, writing, pacing. But then again, nothing in this world created by Man can be perfect, since we ourselves are not perfect. Anything created can never outdo its maker in design.\
But\
          \
        there are some, only a handful, of anime out there that can be called true works of art. Masterpiece, paragon, nonpareil, chef d'oeuvre... Whatever words that can be used to describe such anime, use them, for aren't words created for a reason? I am talking about such anime as Steins;Gate. Cowboy Bebop. And, among others, the subject of this review, SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN, or Attack on Titan.\
I've seen enough anime to be able to judge critically. A good way to measure an anime is to watch it a second time (significant time elapsing between viewings). My first anime was not Sword Art Online, but Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Heck, any reasonably entertaining anime would've been amazing to me as a newbie, but I just had to begin with one of the so-called best. Watching it a second time almost a year later, it's still really good, but I wouldn't call it the best of all time. When you watch an anime for the second time, you've already seen the plot unfold, so the otherwise incidental eagerness to watch and complete absorption into the story isn't there (assuming you remember what happened). As such, you can spend more time watching the story unravel with a more critical eye, paying attention to the animation details, character development, how the plot threads connect, and so on.\
Watching Attack on Titan the second time was almost as enthralling as the first time, and a year hadn't even passed. Even with my more objective perspective, I still found the soundtrack magnificent, the sudden plot twists brilliant, the character depictions realistic, the maturity gripping and tragic. Strangely enough, such things shone even more brightly my second viewing -- kind of like when I re-read Lord of the Rings. Standing further back, I realized just how -- just how EPIC Attack on Titan was. It can't even compare to 99+% of other anime -- the few exceptions including the two I named earlier. Few, if any, anime are as mature; characters you can resonate with die so suddenly in Attack on Titan. I think I teared up even more this second viewing. But such tragedy is only natural. Typically in the realm of creating a story, you give your main characters \"plot armor\" -- that is, an enormous amount of luck that somehow ensures their survival and continued entertainment for the fans. A resounding example is Monkey D. Luffy of One Piece.\
Attack on Titan shreds, discards, eradicates such plot armor. The characters, even the main ones, are hurt. Hurt badly. Everything that occurs in Attack on Titan is the realistic outcome given the circumstances. They're mere humans armed with three-dimensional maneuver gear, fighting against humanoid Titans of gigantic proportions and strength. Anyone sane would be scared stiff his or her first time encountering such monsters. \
The protagonist, Eren Jaeger, vows to exterminate all of the Titans. Although typically shounen in that respect, the anime tends to focus more broadly on its extensive cast as a whole, having quite a bit of interior monologue (thoughts) of the various persons as they all try to save mankind in this seemingly hopeless battle.\
What Attack on Titan does particularly well in terms of its plot is in the technique of gradual revelation. Like One Piece and Naruto: Shippuuden, Attack on Titan has some deep mysteries to be solved, and thus reveals hints here and there about the true nature of the Titans. The implications, which I'm afraid you'll have to see for yourself, are massive.\
THE SOUNDTRACK. You've probably heard the ringing first opening, Guren no Yumiya by Linked Horizon. Without a single thought of doubt one of the best anime openings I've ever seen, with its panoply of visual effects, almost phantasmagorical display of disturbing images, telling lyrics, and resonant music. The score, composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (who also did the music for Guilty Crown, Nanatsu no Taizai, among many others), is just majestic. It reaches all shades of the spectrum, from sorrowful piano to exhilarating vocals to sweeping strings to eerily ominous to operatic. It fits the intense atmosphere very, very well. So many characters die, often for nothing, in this anime. One of the many strong themes running throughout is that of whether or not your death was meaningless. If those soldiers who just died contributed to mankind's struggle for survival through their deaths. The need to take risks involving people's lives for the good of mankind.\
THE ANIMATION. ufotable, get out. Wit Studio achieved divine status with this one. The interplay of shadows and light on characters' faces; the grotesque and terrifying Titans; how the Titans eat people (yes, this happens a lot); the bird's eye camera shots of mankind's last remaining civilization; smoke, explosions, sunlight; the almost photographic and surreal quality to, like, everything; and most notably, the use of three-dimensional maneuver gear to attack Titans. Whether they're flying through the streets (kind of like Spider-Man) or doing acrobatic whirls down to the nape, it's nothing short of the empyrean. Attack on Titan's animation is so good that even if you don't like anything else, which is extremely unlikely, it's enough to keep you watching.\
Did I mention plot twists? With Attack on Titan, you really never know what will happen next. All could be somewhat jolly one moment, tragic the next. The episodes are constructed in such a way that you'll constantly want to see the next. No wonder this took the anime community by storm. Sword Art Online, compared to this, is like a pigeon flying in the hawk's wake -- flying, yes, but far behind. Very far behind.\

    **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\
Shingeki no Kyojin is an action fantasy drama that takes place in a fictional world where mankind has been forced to live behind walls in fear of giant man eating creatures know as titans.\
Positives\
Intense action\
Great OST\
Great representation of how fear can affect someone\
Some creepy and unsettling moments here and there\
Sets up an interesting mystery \
Does a good job at world building\
Decent cast of characters\
Titans come off as very threatening, especially in the first couple of episodes\
Negatives\
Lots of isolated problems that start adding up as the show goes on, and end up really hurting it\
Some extremely over the top moments that quickly become silly\
Unnecessary\
          \
        recaps \
Awful humor, thankfully it's short lived\
2 characters come of as extremely strong to the point of being ridiculous \
Just wanted to elaborate more on the first negative point. What I mean by isolated problems are those problems that would come of as nitpicking but there's so many of them that it hurt the overall experience. I could list a bunch of these moments but this review would be unnecessarily long and I would have to go into spoilers.\

    (Very minor spoilers ahead)\
Put bluntly: this anime is terribly overrated. It's not a bad show, but the hype just kind of kills it. I will admit, it was my first anime, and when I watched it, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Now that I've expanded my horizons and re-watched it, I can see that Shingeki no Kyojin just isn't all that.\
First off: The story is alright. It's nothing special. It's the tried-and-true \"humans saving themselves from some otherworldly threat that is now among them). Also, it's not finished yet. The ending is garbage and accomplishes nothing. It actually ends on\
          \
        a cliffhanger. The same one it's been on for about 3 years now. I haven't seen anything about season 2, and I'm not holding my breath.\
Art and Sound are really where this show excels (unless you're watching the dub which is pretty awful considering how many times they've aired it on Toonami). The voice acting is pretty good (unless you're watching the dub. It's not good. Especially Eren's \"titan scream\"). The music is fantastic, and the art is beautiful at best, and alright at its worst, so no problems there. There is one episode I would like to mention here, and that is episode 4, I believe. When it tells Mikasa's backstory, there is a shot when she is getting ready to stab someone (can't say who because I don't wish to spoil too much)  that I absolutely adore just because it is so cool.\
The character is really where this show struggles. They aren't interesting. You want to learn about Mikasa's past, and you learn it pretty early on, then you just stop caring. They're all bland tropes. If you want character, watch its spin-off Attack on Titan Junior High. It's honestly a better show than this.\
It was enjoyable. If you like action, you'll probably enjoy this. If you think the \"monsters living among us\" type story sounds good, I would recommend Monster, Parasyte: the Maxim, and (though not an anime) John Carpenter's The Thing. If you like the action parts, I would recommend Trigun, Akame ga Kill (its ending is still pretty bad), Blue Exorcist, Code Geass, and Hellsing.\

            Attack on Titan is the greatest anime of all time. With a gripping story, interesting characters with an outstanding amount of depth, and an aesthetic that only further emphasizes the shear brilliance you are witnessing. The only thing that could hinder your enjoyment is being conscious while watching. \"Bu- But Captain; Do you mean to tell me that a shows quality isn't contingent upon my enjoyment of it?!\" Yes, I certainly intend to.\
        Attack on Titan:  a show that found itself in MAL's top ten before the first season\
          \
        was even halfway through. A series that was many people's introduction to the medium. A series that opened the West up to anime that way no other has.\
        With an explosive first episode showcasing cardboard cutout shonen archetypes, a post apocalyptic setting, and the death of a character with no development and no impact, it's not surprising that everyone loved it. The second episode came out and it was crystal clear that the shows plot would be progressing at a blistering pace. Fours years pass in the first few episodes in the form of several training montages showing the characters learning to fight the titans at some sort of a military training facility that's location is never revealed, (which is quite important) and the introduction of an absolutely absurd amount of forgettable side characters. There is then a few episodes in which the characters go out on their first official mission to combat titans and one of the shows first major plot points is revealed and questions start to arise left and right. By the end of the episode there are at least 7 immediately pertinent questions; we'll come back to this later. After this the main plot of the first season begins and just to be consistent the plot slows down to an   a b s o l u t e      f u c k i n g    s n a i l s      p   a   c   e. The rest of the series progresses at the pace, detailing a span of only a few hours through the course of TWELVE FUCKING EPISODES. Astounding. Overall the shows pacing is completely jarring. Along with that pacing issues it also has many issues with asking way too many questions and providing absolutely no answers all the way up until the credits roll.\
          Attack on Titans characters aren't much better. Our core three are Erin, Mikasa, and Armin. Erin is your typical shonen male lead: determined, presumptuous, often self-harming, passionate, caring of his friends--- nothing too special. Mikasa exists solely to be the leader of Erin's fan club and being KEWL. Rounding off our trio is Armin the only half interesting character: intelligent, self-deprecating, only character who's backstory isn't clear. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Erin's backstory is fucking stupid.\
          Contrary to the plot and character departments the aesthetic is extremely strong. The soundtrack is fitting of the show including two good endings and openings. My only complaint is that it is a bit brief. Visually all you really need to know is that Attack on Titan in brown. Kidding. The animation is fluid, natural, and makes great use of gradients and thick outlines. In addition the angles and movement are very nice. \
           Overall, Attack on Titan is the perfect starter show for anyone wanting to get into anime. For Real. It's exciting, and takes itself seriously enough to suit the needs of any western viewer, while avoiding as many weird anime behaviors as possible. It's not so anime that your average kid in the US would immediately hate it. Beyond recommending it as a gateway series I can't really recommend it to any seasoned fan of the medium. Overall: Six/Ten\
\
Anecdote: Please do not message me with blind hate, though I am interested in and open minded to, any sound arguments that you may have.\
Have a nice day,\

    Now where to begin with this show.  On the surface, it appears good but when you really sit and watch to dissect the show, it's not really something that a viewer looking for shows that have intense character development, you will care for the characters, but then you know, nothing really develops.  \
Eren= ADHD Spaz\
Mikasa= basically Yandere over Eren\
Armin = Intelligent, but tendency to be bitchy.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is pretty much a great anime. If you are a person who loves action, suspense, characters to love, and great art this anime should be for you. The reason for me why it got down was I found myself getting a little board between the beginning and  the female titan arc. I was expecting some thrills and action but all I got was talking and more talking. If they at least had some action in those parts I would see it becoming my favorite anime. But I was tired of them talking about the same thing over and over again. But!\
          \
        this doesn't mean I didn't like it. The start of the show is one of the best I've seen from any anime. Since it had a great start your expectations for the show would be very high. And those expectations stayed with me for a long time. The art it great since it is a new anime and the characters are very lovable. If someone asked me to recommend an anime to someone who is new to anime I would tell them to watch this show. So if you are planning to watch I don't know why the hell your still reading this. GO WATCH IT! \

    \"A dream is a dream, but my dream is not your dream\"\
Upon every new yearly anime season, an anime comes out to be the best of that season, Attack on Titan was dubbed 2013's best Anime of this season thus far, many people across the world are screaming from\
the abyss saying that this Anime is the best of the best, without giving sufficient proof that it's that good, when something becomes the best, it must be able to lift you in some way whether it be you feeling happy, sad or angry. Thus people many people just go on hype and whatever another person\
says, without\
          \
        truly reviewing the entire potential of the Anime.\
Attack on Titan, was a decent anime, the overall story that we know of, sets the pace of future content to be even better, but by no means was it perfect throughout this season. The basics of the story would be two factions, one being human and the other being titans, these titans are attacking humans and eating them, and humans are striving to win against these titans. The protagonist Eren witnesses the first invasion of titans in over 100 years, from which he see's his mother being brutally murdered by a titan, which he swears he'll kill every last titan on the planet.\
That would be the basics of Erens view, then it opens up to further bigger factions within the human faction, being the Survey Corps, Garrison and Military Police of the Humans country. Eren joins the Survey Corps along with friends, from there he becomes a Human Titan, he's able to transform into one, and thus then humanity wants to find out more about these beings\
thus they allow Eren to go and find the answer, which his father left with him.\
Above was some points about the show which greatly describe it, would doesn't show everything about it, of course the show branches of with other people and new paths open, but overall honestly nothing much happens after that in this season, the manga progression from the anime is not quite far apart, thus further expansion into the plot was not in existence. From which\
further expansion into the series of another season will take quite some time, possibly another year at the earliest.\
Most characters are hard to read in the anime, as being honest a lot of people die in the series. At the very beginning you might like a character or two, then upon the first battle you'll be quite surprised that half of them die. The country is divided into three sections, which can easily be shows as, Rich, Average, Poor. The wealthy and high people in society which includes\
the Royal Family are at the centre of the country, and each section is walled off with each wall having a name. Each wall has four cities at N,W,E,S locations, so Titans will only go to those sections, which is kinda smart, until you watch the anime and see what happens.\
Overall the anime summerises of sixty percent being quite prolonged of pointless battles, with the remainder being actual story driven content which is utmost helpful for you. The story has potential for the future, but the current story that was used is only a taste of what it could be, I was very saddened after watching this anime, that it's progression wasn't quite as big as it could've been and the hype that people portrayed of it wasn't worth it as much as people made it out to be.\
For people who rate anime's like these the best, most of them have yet to step out into the real anime world, many people stick to the big budgeted or the most popular ones, they never watch low budgeted ones or ones which have less popularity as big ones. Thus their judgement is flawed for new Animes. They must take their seats out of their comfort zones and indulge themselves on quite better anime that doesn't meet the eye. I do take requests if you wish to know some good anime's then message me, or comment, or if your too lazy to then just look at my Anime List.\
I don't watch much anime week in, week out like many people, thus that majority of people often forget everything that happens from an episode seven days prior. As for me, I got the opportunity of waiting 25 weeks to watch all of them together and review the entire show together. I enjoyed it quite a lot as I did spend hours non-stop watching it, watched twenty episodes in one sitting. I enjoyed it quite a lot but the story was just lacking I do hope for the next season to be better, but I'll be waiting more then 25 weeks this time.\
Many people have brought to my attention that this is copied of other Animes like Muv Luv, when I watched it, it did feel similar to some anime's like Gurren Lagann, it's like it but without the mecha, but mecha's being living things and the cities being above ground and in one country, it looks similar, but in the future it may not. I do not care about originality that much, the basis of watching it primarily leads down to whether I enjoyed it or not. That's\
all that matters in the end, and from there I enjoyed Attack on Titan, even though I gave it quite a low score compared to others.\
It's all a mystery, it's only my thoughts and opinions, but feel free to comment away and ask questions whether it be messaging or commenting. Having read the review fully I hope you understand what the quote at the top means, if not just ask me.\
Thanks for reading this review.\

    Throughout the history of mankind people have asked themselves:\"If humanity would perish who would be its nemesis?\" Some people have taken this question further and transposed this question within literature.\
The concept itself is not unique but the common enemy of humanity and the way they presented it are. Titans, gargantuan humans seemingly devoid of intelligence,rule the earth except for one area, the one beyond the walls which humans have erected in order to protect their society.\
Constant defeats and fear have driven humans to discover a way to fight the titans and as a result the maneuver gear was invented and dispatched to every enforcer of\
          \
        the authorities in human world. The story seemed pretty predictable at first, however it takes some unexpected twists.\
Artwork is very vivid and detail enhanced that provide a thrilling experience. Take for example the backgrounds behind the walls, simply breathtaking as well as details on military or police force and their gear. Animations are very well made and enhance the quality of the action as the story evolves.\
Aside from the normal characters that include soldiers and people in command that behave normally the unmentioned category is lets say a bit exaggerated which is not a design flaw but a common concept shared by all animators that create such characters. However they have done well in their personalities as I have noticed strong wills animated by wishes.\
When I decided to watch Shingeki no Kyojin I was looking forward to revel in a good story.\
I was more than delighted to receive even more than that so all I can say is good job animation team.\

    I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to anime. In fact, until about a month ago, I hadn't come across any anime that I was actually a fan of. But then my brother told me to check out Attack On Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin). Well, since I'm an anime skeptic, he actually told me a few times before I decided to watch it. So I started on the first episode, and within a day I had watched the whole season. I'm very much convinced that this is the greatest anime there is. The story and action is the best I've ever seen. The emotion\
          \
        is second only to Puella Magi Madoka Magica (a solid anime, but lacking in action). Attack On Titan really doesn't have any perverted scenes. Out of the entire cast of characters, there's only one that acts too strange for my liking. There's only a couple chibi moments in the whole thing. And as far as filler episodes go, I guess this would be its biggest downfall. Part 2 of the season has quite a bit of downtime from the action. Although a lot of it goes into character building, they probably could have cut back a couple episodes worth of material to get the same outcome. However, that's far greater than most animes can achieve. Not to mention that the action that does take place in Part 2 is super intense.\
At the moment, Attack On Titan and Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) are the only animes that I actually like, and Future Diary can't hold a candle to Attack On Titan. Attack On Titan isn't perfect, but I feel it rises far above any other anime thus far.\

    Shingeki no kyojin  is in many ways a masterpiece. It has a very unique and interesting storyline that was extremely engaging with plot twists and action. The one thing I didn't like about it was all the gore. It really added to the tone of the show and created it into something new, but I found myself gaging and having to look away at some parts. The character development was very good and all in all it was an amazing show, but don't watch unless you can handle the violence.\

    So I'll start my first review off with a finger-beam to the sky by reviewing the most popular anime in the present 2013, Attack on Titan. I've re-watched the series just to get a good grip on the plot, which seems very confusing due to its complicated nature, but otherwise the anime was worth watching. \
Jumping straight to the plot, I do agree the whole \"humanity will be driven out by a far more superior race\" part of the plot was really cliched, but the creation of the soldiers' equipment and developed weapons said otherwise. I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic stories, and in most\
          \
        scenarios humans haven't found any way to develop enough technology to defend themselves because they simply give up; however AoT has used human nature as a good plot device and it gave a sense of \"desperate times call for desperate measures\" very well. Also, this show doesn't shy away from gory art at all. The producers were definitely not afraid to show you broken, brutally amputated, maggot-ridden bodies and their beloved friends witnessing the brutal death of each soldier. It shows the hard, sad reality that even the best of people go unnoticed as they decay into dust, and the best of people die first while their killers survive and run off scot-free. (S/N: I want to mention the series' ending, but I can't do it without spoiling the anime. Basically, the anime ended while the manga stretched even farther. It was extremely disappointing.) \
Next up, art: it was amazing. Outstanding. The mix of both dull and vivid colors gave a really nice atmosphere of \"we're all done for, but somehow there's still hope.\" I especially loved how detailed the military uniforms, 3DMG, and character expressions were, using the depressing and interesting color scheme. However there were some flaws with the animation, such as cutting to Annie's nose in the middle of a fight scene, or still screens that hold for a few seconds and kill the suspense. Or, at the most unexpected times, there are the most random freakout moments with speedlines everywhere. Otherwise, it was extremely fluent. This can be seen in many fight scenes where the soldiers are flying around in their Maneuvering Gear, a very excellent tactic to build up the suspense as humanity wonders whether or not their comrades will return in one piece. The sound effects were really fitting as well; it was wonderfully synced with character motions, and that zipper-effect when a character goes sailing through the sky on his Gear is very well done. I really enjoyed listening to the soundtrack as well. It brought out the true nature of AoT associated with the many emotions connected to the anime using a mix of both medieval and modern rock music. It may not seem like a good mix at all, but when used with a plot as deep and complex as AoT it's damn good.\
I'll start this next paragraph here by introducing the characters. Eren is your typical shounen-style protagonist; a hotheaded brat with a short temper and always ready to fight. Mikasa is the overly-obsessed-with-the-main-character background chick, and Armin is the brainy nerd who always pussies out of a fight and gets bullied by the neighborhood kids. This doesn't change in the story (by that time they introduce Jean the Jackass and Marco the Overly Optimistic Guy) until many soldiers die during a mission (for the sake of spoilers I won't say who or what) and they all finally realize the true horror beyond the walls just waiting to unleash all hell on them. For only twenty-five episodes this was an amazing character development, especially as a soldier finds his friend(s) dead and abandoned, one by one, just rotting on the side of the road. These are definitely the most depressing scenes; many will tell you to not get attached to a character, but it's just too much to handle not to feel saddened by a soldier's death. \
Combining the good, the bad, the best, and the worst of Attack on Titan, I give the series a 9 overall. The way the anime had been discontinued was very disappointing and frustrating, but the manga lives on. The character development was well done, art vivid and impressive, animation thrilling and suspenseful, story a bit cliched but otherwise with a VERY good \"we're all doomed\" atmosphere. I would definitely not recommend this anime for the lighthearted, seeing how dark and violent it is (yet the fandom is obnoxious and bubbly), but for the shounen/post-apocalyptic fans who could deal with darker themes, this show would definitely be your knight in shining armor. The plot is a bit confusing and complex, but the anime in itself is unique and captivating. Some may have to rewatch a few times or so just to understand the plot and the meaning of the series itself, but it will definitely be worth your time. I hope my half-dead half-alive review helped (I seriously doubt it), and I hope all the shounen freaks enjoy this anime.\

It does keep you in the dark a lot and that can get irritating, but that's part of what keeps you hooked. To some it is predictable, but I don't find that to be an issue, what's great about the series is they do it in a new way.\

Character: 9\
This anime is more plot driven than character, but the characters are there enough where I don't feel like I should give it a lower score. I still care about the characters even though some people don't.\
Enjoyment: 10\
The way the other elements are put together push this score to a 10, which is where a lot of the hype is stemming from.\
Overall: 10\
If you go into this show with certain expectations you might be disappointed, but I don't think that makes the show deserve a low rating. SnK is shonen done right.\

    Attack on Titan is an anime that came out around a year ago and is becoming very popular.  There are a few thing that turn me off of the show and in this review i'm going to go over this Anime to the best of my ability without using my own opinion.  \
MUSIC AND SOUND: The sound in anime is very important in anything because it adds to the mood and in general makes everything better in short.  The music in this show is perfect for what its going for it plays the right song at just the right moment and its\
          \
        hard to find anime that has a great soundtrack even the theme songs just make you want to get up and jam out.\
CHARACTER CREATION: I found that the characters in this anime weren't anything special i mean they were strong in there own ways of course but they were just average.  For instance Eren Jeager our main character, his mom died in the first episode from the monsters which drove him to want to kill them all, his dad left i think after the death of his mom? correct me if I'm wrong but anyway he injects something into his body making him be able to turn into a titan. Let me break that down for everyone.  \
Cliche number one: his mom died which gave birth to his hatred.\
Cloche Number two: his dad left and gave him the power to turn into the thing he hated most.  \
these are some of the biggest cliches in anime and i just think they were a bad thing to do because Eren let alone any of the characters out of the 25 episodes have a lot of build up.\
i don't want to make this thing super long since its my first review so i'm going to rap this up with a final overall view.  For all that Attack on Titan is worth i thought it was a well put written story with good action, the art was great and really brought to life this anime.  Even though this anime had its bumps i thought it was a great idea and a very cool anime.  By the way this is my first review so if i'm not that good at it thats why.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is what many people say is the best anime of all time. Well I will disagree. Shingeki no Kyojin also commonly known as Attack on Titans starts out as a potentially strong anime which quickly left an impression. After continuing to watch the series what I released was:\
Story: The Story itself was good but it lacked tons of originality. It really had me thinking why is everything too predictable. Then after some researching I found out Shingeki no Kyojin was inspired by Muv Luv. The story itself changed into a more shounen version of Muv Luv but it did have a little\
          \
        originality and overall the story wasn't bad just not original overall 7/10 for story.\
Art: I didn't really like the art starting out but I can't see any other art style fitting the series better so I would give it an 8/10 as far as art is concerned.\
Sound: Overall the OST and VA's were pretty good not much to really get into 8/10.\
Characters:  The character development in Shingeki no Kyojin is Eren episode 1-5 character development. Every episode after that focused on side characters having great character development though. But the main cast besides Armin seemed to digress overall. 6/10 for characters.\
Overall I really enjoyed the series and would like to see a second season.    My overall rating for this anime would be 8/10. I would recommend to anyone into action and supernatural anime. It was a good ride while it lasted.",

    Sometimes it's difficult to know before going into a series if you will enjoy it or not. Sometimes it's a mistake, and sometimes it doesn't matter. I waited until this series/season was complete before I gave it a look, and really I am glad I waited. I started watching this at 10pm on a Saturday night. I figured I would watch a couple of episodes then call it a night, but 14 episodes later the series finally took enough of a break for me to go to sleep. It was surprisingly addictive, unexpected and wonderful. It is based on an ongoing Manga (which I read\
          \
        immediately after finishing the anime) and it was/is a great series. If you enjoy mild thought provoking and action filled anime then this is a great watch. \
Anybody who has read any of my other reviews knows that I do not like to break things apart too much. There are plenty of others that will dissect these for you, but I do like to slightly touch on the categories this site offers when writing a review. Across the board this is a solid 9 for me. It has a great story, though it is somewhat predictable at times, there are plenty of small surprises along the way. Great art, music, voice acting, blah blah blah. It has everything that I look for in a great series. The characters are all special and unique, and you never know which one will die. Yes, many characters die in this story. It is not a happy skipping along the yellow brick road sort of adventure. No, this is a dark and brutal journey that leaves you wondering what will happen next. The only complaint I can muster is the ending, but the Manga is still on going and this is really close to the Manga series. \
What is it about? Well, this is one of those synopsis that are really quite far off. Titans vary in height, and most are mindless human eating machines. The people are protected behind giant walls, but one day that all changes with a breach that leads to a crushing defeat for mankind. The main characters witness a very brutal and terrifying event in there hometown which leads them to joining the military in hopes to fight and defeat these monstrous beasts. Their method of fighting involves swinging/flying through the air on cables that allow them to swing behind the beasts and hit their weak spots with thin blades. It has a unique feel to the combat in the story, and witnessing them training to fight these creatures in itself is very entertaining. Once trained they witness another breach, and the story takes a few more dark turns that lead to a greater and more sinister plot than originally presented. It is brutal, it is violent, but it holds back just enough to not be too gory.\
One thing I found relieving is that the main character isn't the best but he works hard to become among the best. His greatest strength is his will which makes him an exceptional leader and a great inspiration to those around him. His closest friends have their own unique strengths which makes all of them useful and important to the overall picture. It has a good feel from start to finish.\
I feel this is a much watch for action anime fans. Be warned it is brutal, it is dark, and these 25 episodes end just as the major plot gets started in the manga, but it is close to the original material and it is a great piece of work. Definitely add this to your short list.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin in my opinion is a breath of fresh air from all of the anime cliches, to begin with the main character doesn't quite fit into the general anime archetypes of anime male characters, he isn't useless, and he isn't a wimp. I do have some beef with its story in relation to the characters which is, its game of thrones style no character is safe. However, this shows the brutality of the situation at hand, so it doesn't make it unwatchable. Despite the brutality, characters have moments that are incredibly moving that still give me chills, where they show their inner strength.\
          \
        The story is incredible and well thought out, the fight scenes and the animation for the fight scenes is incredible and badass. And the sound is good. \
Pros\
+Not your average punk main character\
+Brutal in a fitting way \
+Breath of fresh air\
+Moving Moments\
Cons\
-Brutal Game of Thrones no character is safe\
-Not for faint of heart\
Final Thoughts\
It's a good anime and the cons don't stop it from being enjoyable, incredibly moving moments, definitely worth checking out. Can't wait for season 2!!\

    Anime - Shingeki no Kyojin / Attack on Titan\
Person rating - 9/10\
Story - \
Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants.\
Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific\
          \
        as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears out of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.\
I personally wish this was a longer anime maybe 50-75 episode's would of been nice. But I heard season two is coming and there are 3 OAD's!\
Characters are enjoyable and understandable, They show emotions like we would, Anger, Fear, Sickness, Depression.\
The story is just amazing, no other words for it.\
Pros: Hm... 99.9% of it.\
Cons: Should of been longer! \
Please give this anime a try! You won't regret it!\

The Story is definitely not your run in the mill! It is both extremely bad-ass and brutal! so....don't get close to characters, just saying :D\
I'm reading the manga of this as well, and both manga and anime come to control your mind; you begin to think you know what's going on, trying to guess whats ahead and then it throws you on your feet! xD\
I listen to the soundtrack while studying as it motivates me, that's how complimenting it is to the series! and the characters are not only delicious! (Levi\
          \
        ;) ) but you truly see them struggle demons from their past and current situations that form and shape them and enable them to grow along with the anime (it's hard not to fall in love with these characters and feel empathy for their flight!)\
All in all, I thoroughly am enjoying this anime and the manga is a definite if you're adoring this! :D\

story - exciting, gripping action-packed, it has every appeal. no filler scenes, just thrill after thrill that will have all your senses on edge throughout from start to finish. its not a deep and meaningful plot but it does have its depth and the arousal through anticipation WELL makes up for it!\
art - the animation is probably one of the best ive seen, perfectly smooth and consistant which leave you fapping over perfectly smooth action scenes with no blur or inconsistency. sharp and intricate detail but not in a way that makes it look fuzzy and messy like\
          \
        in some anime and manga. character design and general visuals are just beautiful.\
sound - crystal clear, although the 1st 4 seconds fo the intro could defen a headphone user, the sound is otherwise consistant and doesnot jump or suddenly become unaudiable.\
characters - fantastic character devlopment throughout the story. you get to know all of the characters, some are predictable and others unfold some shocking traits and relevence in the story but from start to finish, you continuously begin to feel a connection to each and every one\
enjoyment - their is a reason this is so popular. since its ended for now, i feel like i have a little void haha, gripping story and scceenes, heartfelt moments, thrilling fight scenes and massive twists every now and then through out, you could fap to it\
overall - i cant really say anymore, everything about this anime is just gorgeous, after the first couple of episodes, you find yourself bouncing up and down watching each episodes with anticipation for the next twist or big fight or shock and after watching the final episode, you will want to scream until your lungs collaps cause no orgasm can compare to how good the conclusion is. althoguh the series does not leave you with a cruel teasing cliff hanger, you are already bouncing with excitement again searching for news of series 2 because you know what will eventually come but you dont know how.\
rewatchability - YES! you will want to watch it again and again because it just doesnt ge old (apart from last series i have now watched this through 3 times)\

Story 10/10\
Well let's say I'm not a patient viewer. If nothing interesting happens, I tend to fastforward to next parts. Well it's not the case with Attack on Titan. I watched everything, didn't skip any details and it seemed that I couldn't take my eyes off this anime.\

There is no other worlds for this T_T Look at all those battles! Those weapons. Whoever think up these would be a genius! Every small detail of every battle is taken care of so beautifully, so realistically\
          \
        that I believe we might be able to create the same devices in real life.\
Sound 10/10\
Well it's embarassed to say but what drew me first to Attack on Titan was its OP. It was so good and the OP looks sooo cool that I decided to watch. I dig all the soundtracks, everything serves its purpose to enhance the meaning of the scenes.\
Character 10/10\
It's nice that they try their best to give everyone an unique character and try to bring out their background story. The characters have dimensions and I appreciate that. It is really hard to hate anyone in this anime :(\
Enjoyment 10/10\
I should have given this a 9 ... because SO MANY PEOPLE DIED it was like even the most lovable ones died it makes me so sad. Well, if no-one died then the anime would lose all the meaning ... who am I to complain T_T It kept me on the edge of my seat all the time so obviously my enjoyment should be 10/10 :D\

By the end of the first episode I was like, damn...not bad, not bad...main character seems a little extra with his anger...but what a WICKED score! \
By the end of the second episode...DAMN. DAMN. DAAAMN. \
By the - you see where this is going? For me personally, it hits all the buttons of what I'm looking for in an amazing anime and more importantly, an incredible and captivating story. The only other show to really keep my heart pounding and keep me captivated -for almost 10 years now- was and is Avatar: The Last Airbender...Shingeki no Kyojin is making\
          \
        me feel a lot of those \"feels\" again. \
Yes, there are little things that irk me in the anime. For instance, there is way too much dialogue during dire situations. The pacing is sometimes uneven between the dialogue and following action. However, somehow at the end of each episode, it makes up for it quite well. It allows me to trust the story and to allow me to have a little faith in where its going. I've been \"betrayed\" by animes before where romance has completely dominated the plot and ruined a potentially amazing tale...but so far there is little to zero romance in the anime and I can just focus on the story and have the choice to make up a romance in my head if I so wish to. \
Let me just put this out there, in high-action shounen animes where death is on the line with humanity...ROMANCE KILLS. Seriously. It's a massive turn-off. \
Ultimately, an amazing show that I have yet to feel bored from watching and reading. Captivating, captivating, fast-paced action, an emotional lead (non-stereotypical shounen male), realistic and bad-ass female characters, fantastic background art and a mind-blowing soundtrack and the list goes on...It goes up there in the top and most unique animes out there.\

    Fist of all i would just like to say how completely awesome this anime is. \
 The world that was created in this anime is outstanding which is then complemented by a great story line that leaves you on the edge of your seat after every single episode.\
 On top of a great story line there is the breathtaking animation quality and the personalities of each and every character introduced is totally different. They range from the rage driven Eren to the wussy but strategically smart Armin and so on. \
This anime keeps you guessing the whole time and knows just when to introduce new\
          \
        information that leads you one step closer to unlocking the secret of the overall plot or even just one step close to understanding a characters past. \
Most of the time the anime is based around action and gore but it seems to work in the comedy at the perfect times such as for instance  Sasha and her craving for food or even the giant naked titans and their creepy faces while running bring a little laughter into the anime, even though they are the bad guys.. \
Overall i really enjoyed this anime as is has a mixture of everything that a good anime should have. Although the ending was disappointing so hopefully a 2nd season will be introduced, i highly recommend watching this and its only 25 episodes long at the moment and is easy to smash out over one weekend.   \

    Attack On Titan real review\
Though I hate to admit it… no matter what kind of ending they came up with… no matter how good it is or will be… no matter how many questions they answer… I really doubt I could be happy with it being over. It's just so good. I've never even seen an anime that came close to this one. I love it so much. The characters, the plot, the weapons, the design, the very Idea is so amazing. I don't know if there will ever be an anime this good. It has me saying this with only twenty-five episodes. To be\
          \
        honest I was sad when I heard that Misashi Kishimoto would end Naruto, because of how much I liked that show. Ile be honest though… at this point I don't mind Naruto ending, because now I have this to look forward to. At the same time I know that this is the only anime that got me this hooked, this hungry for more, and I doubt Ile be this satisfied with an anime for a very long time. This show was so amazing. To be honest I'm guessing they could make more episodes with this than they did with Naruto, and I would still want more. No Naruto wasn't close to the best anime I've watched even before I started this series but, it was my first anime. This is the first time I've been so excited to watch an anime since then, since I first watched anime when I was little. I can't say anything though if it is over if I'm this satisfied with a show now can I? My favourite things about this anime are that first off there Is so much charecter development. I say this because you get so much depth into each charecter. Though admittedly as I write this review I do know they didn't explain a few characters that I'd really like to no about. But I'm hoping for that later. Also I love there attention to detail on the weapons and landscape. Not just physically but, also with there design, advantages, and disadvantages. And my third favourite thing about this series is the soundtrack. Though I notice they use a certain song alot. Mainly in various forms of instrumental though. No matter how this song is played I love it though and it go's with so many events in the series. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan is one of those animes that is depressing and hard to watch but you keep watching it because its just so good. A good analog would be the Neon Genesis Evangelion series and like Evangelion, Attack on Titan will need more than one season to wrap itself up properly (though hopefully not with just a movie like Evangelion did).\
First things first, the Story attached to Attack on Titan is very original and pretty unique as far as animes go. Unique doesn't necessarily mean it is great though. The plot honestly reminds me of Starship Troopers of all things...at\
          \
        least for the first few episodes of the series. A group of young men and women are thinking about their future when a disaster pushes them to join the military to fight back against the force that shattered their relatively peaceful world. I honestly think I would have enjoyed Attack on Titan more if it had continued in this way and didn't suddenly start throwing up needless plot twists. To be fair the unpredictability of the series is probably one of the reasons it is so popular but after a while the plot seems to lose its direction and then leaves us with a rather unsatisfying ending that basically demands a season 2 (and it will probably get one but its not ok for Peter Jackson to leave us with cliffhanger endings then Attack on Titan doesn't need to anyway). Yes I know I can just read the manga but I am not reviewing the manga. An anime season should be able to stand on its own and at least come to some conclusion even if it leaves room for another season. In this at least Attack on Titan fails despite its interesting and unique plot.\
Now the area where Attack on Titan really shines is its art. Everything visual about the show is spectacular from the stunning wild vistas to the harsh stone walls of the city. The character design is also done very well and allows individuals to be identified fairly easily which is good because there is a very large cast of characters to keep up with. The titans themselves are massive and intimidating not just physically but visually. The anime also does a great job with fast paced animation sequences, particularly with combat. A few times I caught myself rewinding saying, \"Wait did I just really see that...yes I did!\" Especially near the end of the season the combat and death sequences start to get really fast and creative. Speaking of death, there is a LOT of it in Attack on Titan and much of it is very messy (another thing the show has in common with Neon Genesis Evangelion).\
While Attack on Titan looks great it just sounds good. Really there is nothing at all wrong with the music, sound effects, or voice acting in the show which I suppose is the best compliment you can give it. The only really memorable thing in regards to the sound was the opening theme in the first part of the series. For most animes I skip opening themes after seeing them once but for the \"You are the prey and I am the hunter\" openings I played them each time because it really got you pumped up for the show. I have no idea why this opening is abandoned part way through the show as it suits the tone of the anime perfectly.\
As I said earlier, Attack on Titan features a huge cast of characters but fortunately the character design allows you to distinguish between individuals fairly easily...though you will forget a lot of names because many characters do not feature prominently in most episodes. Early on you get the feeling that we will get a core of about 6-8 characters who will be friends cause they went through training together. For most of the show though the focus is almost exclusively on Mikasa, Armin, and Eren so I will be focusing much of this section of the review on them. Fortunately this trio is compelling enough to hold attention as each seems to struggle with their inner demons and feelings of self-doubt. Each is given at least some back story and each is likable and sympathetic in their own ways. Even Mikasa, the shows resident silent badass reveals just enough humanity to keep her interesting. Armin's conflict between his own intellect and his self doubt is a very interesting storyline that endures throughout the show. Eren manages to do what Naruto could not; be motivated by your own force of will and NOT be annoying all the time as a result. I can't really say more about Eren without revealing a rather early but major spoiler so I will just say the he does work out as a protagonist. As for the supporting cast, most of them fade into the background, only popping up occasionally on screen but otherwise are ineffectual with a few exceptions. A few like Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse could have done with more screen time as they are interesting (and in her case funny as hell) characters in their own right that could have livened up the show and made is slightly less depressing.\
Which brings me to the enjoyment part of the review. Once again much like Evangelion, Attack on Titan is for the most part a depressing as hell show that I really would not enjoy watching again. You can make a show gritty and harsh and still make it fun to watch, Jigoku Shoujo and Death Note did this in their own ways. Attack on Titan has no rewatch value that I can see other than to try and see it again to check and make sure the plot twists make sense in retrospect. Other than being depressing though what really kills the enjoyment of this show is the way it ends. Now obviously I can't tell you any spoilers but let me just say that the show doesn't pay off the way it seems to promise it will. As far as I can tell only one major plot point is wrapped up and at the end of the show the audience is left with more questions than answers. This itself is not necessarily a bad thing except the show poses most of the questions early one and hints that they may be answered but after stringing the viewer along fails to provide an answer. Again yes I know there is a manga that answers the questions and I am sure this show will get a second season (and it deserves one) but in my opinion too little was resolved in this season for the show to have a satisfying and enjoyable ending and thus I mark it down.\
I wrestled with giving this show an 8 or 9 (10 was out of the question as I've only ever given a 10 to three things, one is Evangelion and the other two were by Hayao Miyazaki and Attack on Titan is not in the same league as those though it badly wants to be Evangelion). I originally gave it a 9 which was the same score I gave to Death Note and Code Geass. After further thought though I bumped it down to an 8 because unlike Death Note and Code Geass there is no resolution at the end. Now to be fair both of those shows produced more than one season and if Attack on Titan manages to resolve itself I may consider bumping its score up to a 9 but as it stands Attack on Titan is currently a Very Good Anime that has potential to be a Great Anime if it can sort out its convoluted plot and actually resolve a few of the questions it poses.\

    Story 8\
The Story is a very original setting and I honestly cannot think of a single cliche in the setting. The only thing that kept the story from being a nine or ten is simply the over used six episode long battles that are often a part of shoenen anime. I definitly liked how it made clear right away that the idea of humanity was a very huge concept for the people in this anime.\
Art: 7\
It was good and constistant but theres simply nothing new or special about it.\
Sound: 8\
The voice acting was sound and fitting of every character. There wasn't anything unique about the\
          \
        music however the sound effects used were really effective at heloing aid the emotions of the moments.\
Characters: 7\
 The characters were all solid, well built characters but they just weren't overly impressive. I didn't like how cliche Eren was. He had the normal very determined/protect my friends character that has been repeated in many anime (Bleach, Naruto, ect.) I was impressed by Mikasa I really liked her character because she wasn't the typical bimboish heroine who can't do anything on her own, in fact she was just the oposite because she often showed Eren up. Overall I thought the characters were pretty good.\
Enjoyment: 7\
This anime was easy to watch and enjoyable it just wasn't one of those shows that I couldn't wait a few days before watching another episode.\
Overall: 7\
It's a good solid anime but I feel like the hype has given people to high of expectations\

    There are many good anime, but this one is excellent. Although it only has 25 episodes right now (I hope to see many more), it's story and characters, combined with the epic soundtracks completely mesmerized me. From the very beginning it was great and by the time I had watched the first couple of episodes, I had found myself a favorite. It can only be rated at excellent, the drama and power of the actions really reach the viewer. I can only recommend this to everyone that likes anime, it's the very embodiment of awesomeness. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin was a good series. It had gained a lot of popularity during it's run.  The way the series was animated was great. I had no problem with the animation. So let's say you didn't like the series the least you could say is that it was good to look at.\
\
      The voice acting was amazing there were scenes where the voice actors really put a lot of emotion into their acting. Which is one of the reasons why I prefer subs over dubs. There were times in the series where I thought I could predict what\
          \
        would happen but my predictions never came true. it seemed as though this series was full of surprises. One right after another. Which made the story stay interesting. \
  The characters were okay. I saw a lot of character development among the main cast as well as a few side characters. The best part of them main cast's character development is that they developed for humanity sake. \
Overall what made this anime great was the surprises and how the characters overcame there fears and did what they thought or had to do for humanity. ",

    Having recently finishing this anime, I now understand the hype.\
Firstly, the story is very compelling, with its unique setting/background that essentially drives this story to its fullest. As I am bias towards survival theme, the storyline up to a certain point was one of the best. Aside from the plot drifting here and there like any other anime (ie delaying the plot with individual character's drama), I would rate the story 10.\
Secondly, art is similar to many other action anime, with the exception of the titan's unique features.\
Sound is one of its bright aspects, as the opening(first) is very engaging at fitting, and many scenes\
          \
        had perfect music to describe its mood/tensity.\
Overall, this anime is definitely living up to its hype, and would consider re watching in the future.\

    If you're looking for a decent review in this place, I want to tell you that I'll try my best to do so. I'll review each aspect of the anime.\
Story: The ambient is perfect. All relative to the giants vs humans is a very good ambientation, but the story just ruins it all. There are no surprises, all is very predictable, from beginning to end. The only thing you need is an IQ above 1 to predict the whole series. That's why I give it a 3. \
Art: It's really good. Every animation is perfect, and above standard. That's why I give it a 10.\
Sound:\
          \
        Along with the art, the sound is perfect. Along with the art, I can't really say how it's good, but I just think it's good. I give it a 9.\
Character: The characters have nothing special. Eren (main one) is the leader who is always angry. Mikasa is basically Eren's balls*cker, and there was a blonde guy who is supposed to be the \"nerd\" of the group who is always bullied, the typical stereotype. All the other characters aren't important, and also can be readed by their first act. I give it a 5.\
Enjoyment: I didn't enjoy the anime. I only liked about 2 or 3 episodes because it had no feelings and the story was too predictable. I give it a 7.\
Overall: This anime has good superficial elements (art, sound), but the anime itself is horrible in my opinion. I give it a 6\

    First off I'll say that if you're expecting some kind of sappy, easily predictable story then this isnt the anime for you. Right off the bat i was instantly captured by the outstanding art work done not only for the characters, but also for the landscape as well. The story isnt bad at all either, i constantly found myself being surprised and then saddened by the events, its just like actual warfare, you never know what is going to happen next. I also liked the character development, and some of the character's reasoning for why they did what they did. It wasn't like most battle\
          \
        style anime where the main character is overly happy, this anime has heartbreak, pain, fear and so much more wrapped up into one. But its not all gore and guts, there were many scenes where i found myself laughing or smiling, which is a much needed break after certain scenes.\
I liked the anime because its such a break away from what many people are used to, even the opening songs aren't some overly happy thing either, its raw, its real, its perfection. I also enjoyed the fact that the characters actually looked like normal people, instead of having those overly used multi colored hair designs. Finally i have to say the way the characters interacted together not only with each other but the world around them was wonderful, i'd definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a good watch\

    This is an excellent show. It commands your attention and then rips your heart out. The plot is original and very very unique. Any one who loves to experience a full spectrum of emotions will become obsessed with Shingeki no Kyojin. It manages to fill you with joy or laughter the soon after rip your hear out and smash it to a pulp. Characters reflect a wide range of personalities and archetypes, some you will love and others you will hate. However, this is a good thing because it makes for more interesting dynamics between characters. (Also nothing is more enjoyable than seeing a character\
          \
        you hate get eaten by a giant)\
The only part of the show is slightly less that great is the art for the titans, they are awkward and stupid looking. HOWEVER YOU NEED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS. The titans are depicted this way because it reflects the titans as a species. This show never has a lull period or filler episodes. Everything grows more and more intense and tragic. Before you finish the show you will have your heart broken multiple times and your wildest expectations out-dashed. Just go watch the damn show already.\

    Right after i finished my exam,I watched Attack on Titan because of the hype and the amazing trailer...\
Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan(officially) is an anime where it got most of the aspects and elements of an amazing anime.The summary in MAL is already enough to describe what it is and what happened.So let's get to the stuff,why this anime is soo good,when i say it is good...IT IS AMAZING!\
HYPE:The trailers show how good the art and the animation.It also tell us what is the 'titan' that they will be facing,which is good to wonder how humans can fight those big titans.Friends and families who watch\
          \
        anime will probably told you to watch and forces you,just believe in them and do it!No excuse\
Story:What i like about the story is that they started in episode one when the main characters(Eren,Armin and Mikasa) are still children,this will give the more complete feeling for the audience.They also tell how the 'nations'(in the 'cage') have improved since many years ago in both techonology and economy.The story is simple and no nonsense twist,it followed the main characters through their lives and how they grow up and of course about defeating titans.In Summary,The plot is simple and marvelous.\
Animation:Like most of the review said....It is tantalizing.You will hardly blink when you watch how the characters 'fly' across buildings and streets.The animation is top notch,there is hardly a flaw in the animation segment.\
Sound:The OP is AMAZING,even though you are a hater or shitty person,you must agree with me that the OP is good and goes well with the action filled anime.It is just that good!Did i say it is good?It is GOOD!The sound in the background also support for the audience to immerse to the anime.\
Character:Right after the 2nd episode you will find ton of new characters.Let's talk about the main characters.\
Eren:Ambitious and strong willed.He is 'different'.He thinks differently than the rest of the civillians which make him stood out,which make the anime more interesting.This is also why he is choosen to become the main character.\
Mikasa:Badass,she is the kind of character who speak less but has skills.Her devotion and love to Eren is also what keep the story going.Her ability to be adapt to the situation and how firm she is,make her one of my favourite character.\
Armin:How to describe this guy.....HE IS JUST WEAK.I hate how weak this character is.Sure,he is good academically but his mental and will is just weak.Well,she has some 'awesome' strategy and tactic but his ability in combat is just disappointing when titans just appeared out of thin air.\
There are bunch of characters but it will make the review longer and become boring :v\
Enjoyment:Do u enjoy watching good stuff,yes you do!I watch this anime from 7PM to 1 AM from the 1st to the 8th episode and the experience is just priceless.If you don't watch it,you will regret it in your life.The feeling of greatness will always flow when you watch this anime.\
Conclusion:The anime is amazing in every aspect(except Armin).Give it a try,there is no excuse,next day you fill find your wife/husband/daughter/son force you watch this anime!\

                          \
    Synopsis:\
Considered by many the anime of 2013, Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack On Titan) is the story of a world that lives in fear of gigantic human-like creatures appropriately named titans. In the anime's year 845 after a hundred years of relative peace, thanks to gigantic 50 meter walls surrounding the human cities, a colossal titan capable of even looking over the wall appeared. He and an armored titan destroyed the gates of the walls, letting the \"smaller\" titans enter, effectively ending the 100 years of peace. After 5 years, the protagonists, who lived the horrors of the attack, now a soldier and with his promise\
          \
        of destroying all titans is ready to fight.\
Now I'll rate each category, I'll be as general as possible to avoid spoilers:\
Story (9/10): The anime's story seems pretty simple at first; the titans are bad and the humans fight them. But there is much more mystery than that. The story presents you with a lot of questions early on. These many questions and the sometimes slow pacing are the only major problems of an otherwise well written story, which is very grounded and grim. If you are looking for a story of heroes, honorable deeds and happy endings, this is NOT what you are looking for. The story is very direct with this. You will see hopeless scenes of people, women, men, soldiers, eaten, dismembered, chewed and vomited by titans. Even kids getting squashed by falling debris. If a characters gets cocky and is suddenly yanked by a titan and eaten, no matter if he is a secondary character or a generic soldier, he is DEAD. He is not coming back. Thankfully there are exceptions, but these are very, very, very (very) few.Overall the story is very impacting and intriguing. There are high pressure  inducing cliffhangers, screaming inducing action moments, pain inducing deaths, and disgust inducing deviant titans. All in all you'll may get the itch of reading the manga when it is over XD.\
Art(10/10): If you see the manga it is very rough and sometimes difficult to grasp (especially in the action scenes). But the anime took this and transformed it into one of the most stylish, well drawn, and beautiful looking anime I've ever seen. The characters look amazing, the structures are very detailed, and the sky... awe inspiring. And dat animation! Sometimes I just saw the scenes with a dumb expression admiring the the fluidity of the action scenes. In summary one of the best looking anime of all time (no BS).\
Sound(10/10): I've downloaded many opening and ending songs from different animes. I've never really being interested in the whole OST (Original Soundtrack)... until Shingeki No Kyoujin. The main themes were in charge of REVO from Linked Horizon, and he delivered in both openings. The anime is very...ah  patriotic? Its just that this atmosphere of war and the protagonist's fierce will and dedication to the Legion gives the anime this unique military feel. And REVO captured this brilliantly with the opening themes. Both make want to stand up and make the military salute from the anime XD. The ending themes are pretty good too, but are not thematic like the openings. And then there is the main OST, the whole songs used throughout the anime... these are truly fantastic. The music is by Hiroyuki Sawano (also responsible for the Guilty Crown OST). This music amplifies the power of the action scenes (which do NOT need any amplifying) making for one hell of a ride. The voice actors are also a highlight, they fit their respective characters  and deliver a very emotionally strong acting. All in all you won't have a single problem with this anime when it comes to sound.\
Character(8/10): This is probably the weakest link of the chain. The characters of Shingeki No Kyojin are not masterpieces. More than one character fall into the annoying, or the I don't give a f*** you even exist category. But not all is bad. The most important characters don't fall in these categories and others that at first fell in them evolve for the better. So about the characters... some you have to give time, others are just downright likeable and awesome, and others... well... you'll wish they get eaten by titan (and some will) :D. \
Enjoyment(10/10): The anime starts with breakneck momentum, you will instantly be trapped by the interesting premise and visuals, although it will  lose some half the way, it will come back, and when it does, oh, it gets good. The anime's weakest parts are in the middle but the rest of the episodes will blow those moments away. Many episodes are worth rewatching, just to admire the amazing animation and actions scenes, all in all, you will be entertained.\
Overall(9.4/10): This is a must see for everyone that enjoys Japanese animation. The quality of this series is unmatched, especially in the production aspects.\
P.S: Once upon a time in the anime watching society, some \"cool\" guys who claim and are auto proclaimed otakus cherishing the word like some kind of trophy (I personally don't care about being called and otaku nor do I claim or boast to be one, I don't care, all I know is that I really enjoy watching anime), they decided that it will be cool to belittle animes that have hyped the anime community and have even reached outside it and attracted viewers that don't necessarily watch or know anime. Anime's like Sword Art Online have fallen in their claws and were stepped on by them, they who love to step on what they refer to as \"mainstream\" anime, as if the word was a cancer. I don't know if they suffer from hipsterism or something but they need to contain their disgusting urges to step on the products they claim to love just because more than just them love it. If you see an anime because you have seen the hype behind, don't come to it with you overly high criticism just because it is mainstream. I say this because I've seen Shingeki No Kyojin has received this treatment. Anyone who sincerely does not like the anime (because I know one anime won't be loved by everyone) has  a right to say so, and I won't and can't hate on his/her opinion, after all it's his/hers. But don't hate on anime for the ridiculous reason I described above.\

\"Shingeki shingeki shingeki\"… I've heard dat name wherever I look for an anime so I decided to give it a try . First of all, I wanted to let you guys know this is my first review and  I haven't read the manga whatsoever  so I might miss  a few important points that could matter to you people. Having said that, let's start this shit:\
Story : Shingeki No Kyojin takes place in a typical apocalyptic environment in  which mankind is facing their last days fighting against some beings called  \"Titans\". Now despite the funny-looking titans, you gotta\
          \
        admit the story is pretty original, not to mention the idea of the 3d gear maneuver!, implemented in order to face those titans  and the close-view how a war tends to change  people's lives. It's not the\" best story ever\" but really genuine (9/10)\
Animation : This is the probably the biggest feature about this anime. The fighting scenes , the art-style and the whole animation in general is insanely good. It's like the producers decided to spend all their salary bonuses just in the fuckin' animation. I can't complain at all on that.(10+/10)\
Music/Soundtrack: another feature Shingeki is strong on. It provides  an splendid Opening track [ Both tracks] and great ED songs as well.  As for the soundtrack, the timing was perfect for those epic moments whether was a fight or a nostalgic scenario. Therefore, the music was great , I can't say shit about it as well. (10/10)\
Characters : well fellas ,character development is something Shingeki wasn't focus on. At first they introduce a few characters in which a good background story is mentioned for each .However, a few episodes later they decided to introduce many but  many characters  which seem to be important as a whole and they lack introduction info .I hate remember many faces  and names and I think there wasn't the need to do that [at least for now]. At the same time, I cannot argue the reason why they did  it since this whole series is filled with mystery and cliffhangers and that's what draws attention. Justification was delivered . (9/10)\
Final Thoughts:\
To finish up this, I see \"Shingeki No Kyojin\"  as a well-developed series with great animation, appealing music with the further need to know about the characters and what's ahead.\
So  BITCH PLEASE!, stop talking shit about this amazing series since the anime is heading to nice direction so far.    \
Overall: (9.5/10)",

    Shingeki no Kyojin(Attack on Titan) was a decent anime that I greatly enjoyed watching. Its one of those Animes that get you emotionally worked up, which increases your enjoyment. One of things that I hope Funimation works on in the second season is character development. A wasted opportunity they had was with Annie. We barely saw anything of her but just a quick meaningless fight with Eren in the beginning of the series . There was no reason behind her attacking and her backstory was extremely vague. Annie could've been an amazing character, and we should've seen a lot more of her. More episodes could've\
          \
        incorporated more character development. A recommended amount of episodes would be 30-40, so we can totally understand all of the characters. \
Sorry if I spoiled :3\

    Okay so Shingeki no Kyojinl, where do I even start. I've always been one of those Romance, Slice of life anime guys so when I was looking at Shingeki at first I was hesitant. This isn’t the first mainstream anime I have watched, in fact I have seen all of Naruto and Shippuden. Well turns out I have a new favorite genre now simply due to the action-packed story that always keeps the viewer hooked. Seriously this anime is unbelievably hard going and unforgiving. You think your just about it attached one of the characters, bam their dead. Shingeki is a true monster of an\
          \
        anime and anyone who is fanatic for blood and gore this is the right place for you. Relentless death, hardships and upset won’t get in the way for Eren, Mikasa and Armin as they fight their way to regain their territory from the dreaded Titans.\
Mayhem, Merciless Destruction and gore all in the same place = Masterpiece. This is legitimately one of the best story's ever written. Every episode is action packed, no one minute goes to waste on unrelated side filler and everything has its meaning. The suspense build up is absolutely insane and it never lets it go. Not only does it include lots of bloody fight scenes but also deep dialogue scenes which contributes to the stories progression nicely.\
Story:\
3 friends go back to when they were just mere kids surviving within the 3 MASSIVE walls built by their ancestors which had protected them for the past 100 years. Wall Maria the most outward wall, Rose the inner wall and finally Wall Sina. Despite mankind’s efforts to protect humanity, life takes a turn for the worse when they witness the tortures events of their home town being destroyed along with every one living there by the likes of human's greatest enemy the titans. Eager to fight back, Eren makes a vow to exterminate every last titan. Eren, Mikasa and Armin join the Elite fighting group known as the recon corps where they will learn how to become heroic soldiers to fight back to for what is right whilst learning the hardship of overcoming lost ones. However, we later find out that Eren might have the power to literally make his promise come true however at the risk of Humanity’s survival. \
Art:\
The art in this anime is definitely something that sets it apart from the rest. Every scene is lively popping with color and the towns and valleys look so realistic. Even the goriest of scenes they still manage to pull it off with rich blood splats and detailed titan's. I can appreciate the time that went into this and furthermore, the animation of the character’s faces is something that is outstanding, from the dirt left on their faces, scars and blood stains it all adds to effect that this is war. The use of colour for the blood and fight scene animations are not rushed. They all have lively action throughout the story and keep the viewer's eyes always hooked into the scene. The detail to attention when drawing the bird's eye view of the town is something to be remarked as well. Each house having its own detail down to the cracks in the chimney. Even the swords and equipment used by the humans was uniquely definded which just made the 3-D maneuver gear AMAZING to watch as your favorite character would literally fly through the sky which their swords drawn slicing the enemy titan's heads off! It all gave off an AWESOME vibe that just kept your eyes locked onto the screen. I believe the concept of the whole 3-D maneuver gear was outstanding and was implemented really well to the point where I would call it AWESOME as shit!\
Sound:\
Going from something like SOL to action/Thriller the sound can change drastically between the two genres. It takes a minute to get used to more bass heavy and fast paced music however, Hiroyuki Sawano has composed amazing music which I believe it brings the fight scenes to life, normally I skip the intros because I find them repetitive or boring however this was not the case with attack on titan since the intro music was just so damn good. Music sets the scene in any video animation and attack on titan is no different, whether it’s a fight scene or a sad tragedy scene the music manages to keep the story alive. It certainly added a lot of suspense to the anime which is what made me coming back for more.\
Characters:\
This was another area that Shingeki shone. There are a broad variety of characters fighting for humanity in this story and each of them seems to have such a unique aspect to them. Relationships between the characters is strongly present with friendship, trust, betrayals and pain. A lot of time is spent developing the bonds between characters such as Eren’s and Mikasa’s childhood where Mikasa was brought in to Erens family as a sister where they would play together and work for their family by carrying stacks of wood for the fire. Eren Yaeger the main protagonist in story is an interesting character to follow due to his strong hearted will to survive which keeps the story going. There are characters that everyone can relate to. For example, Armin Arlert who is an exceedingly good tactician who tries to protect his friends however lacks the capability to fight due to his fear. Fear is present throughout the story and is something that everyone is plagued by hindering their ability to fight. Only the strong overcome it and survive whilst the rest will purge due to hesitation. Mikasa Ackerman who quickly becomes one of the strongest soldiers amongst the human race due to her fast learning nature and willingness to overcome her fear from her past scars. Annie Leonhardt who fights for two factions struggles to balance them and eventually can become unstable. Past scars have told her to do one thing however consciously wants to do another. There were too many characters to develop fully due to the length of the anime however the main characters were developed to their fullest.\
Anyway, this anime contains some of the greatest themes to create a true masterpiece. The way that humans are no longer at the top of the food chain is a frightening thought to all of us and in Shingeki that thought becomes a reality. Restricted into a small world of your own town you could only imagine how much you’re missing out. I strongly recommend you to at least give this anime a try even if this is outside of your usual style. \

    My problem with Shingeki No Kyojin is that it doesn't work as an anime, and I'm going to explain this quite briefly. \
First of all, I would like to tell what I really like about this anime, and I think that we should agree about one thing: the combats are amazing. Differently from the cinema, we see movement in quite every moment; we don't have the feeling of the character moving while attacking, but we directly see it. This is quite a hard job, since in the cinema, our first and closest reference, we only get a perception and a lot of cuts in the\
          \
        screen don't allow to see every single second. \
Next, I would like to talk about the Female Titan. I think that the two blocks in the story that concern this character are very well made, the first one being in the forest, with this scene where the characters are the Key to throw, and then when it comes into the city (not because of the plotwist, because I don't really care about who this character really is, but about how it is taken into a little screen, TV). \
And last but not least, the quality of the drawing of Attack On Titan is really amazing. \
But as an anime, I don't think it does really work and I'm going to explain why, and this last good point on the anime allows me to introduce the first bad: as the drawing is that well made, it is impossible to have the rest of the series well animated. If we do not look the combats, the rest of AOT is really mediocre. In the most part of episodes, we have an scenario that tries to open slowly and not certainly, but we do not see life in it. The characters talk and nothing around moves. The serie is basically limited to an horizontal or vertical movement of camera with a drawing that does not move, and this is not animation. \
There is also a thing that enervates me about AOT, and it is the flat resources it uses. The characters only move their eyes to show feelings (fear, sadness, whatever). I know this is a technique used in most of the shonen, but here, they go too far. If we take off this flat ressource, there would be 5 episodes less. \
And finally, I have to talk about how superficial AOT is. It tries to talk about serious subjects, but it does it in the clumsiest possible way. We see gore, we see children crying and whatever, but it only stays in the background and it never deepens about it. I have to add that almost no character is well developped. We have for example Eren Jager: he sees how his mother dies and seeks revenge against the Titans. The only thing he does is to cry and scream (this is what characters do all the time: they scream a lot and they move their eyes). He joins a group to face the Titans and that's all. It is true that he becomes a Titan himself, that it adds a couch of interest to his charecter, but everything he does is because of the anime script's needs, and not because he is well developped as a character. In the other side, we have Mikasa who talks a lot less and who seems mystic. She works a lot better than Eren as a character because all she does is physic, but she has no development as in the first episode she is exactly the same that in the last. We have Armin, and he is the only one to be a bit developped as he is a boy who suffered from bullying, he sees a lot of things that make him go crazy and this is moderately well done, not incredibly because the anime is as it is and we can't ask much of it. When I watched Serial Experiments Lain, Paranoia Agent, Madoka Magica, Death Note... Well, a lot of animes that I like much more than this one, I remembered the names of the characters becaue they were interesting. In this case, I don't care if a Titan takes Eren and rips his head off (this does not happen, hm). \
So in the end, is Attack On Titan a bad anime? Not a bad one, but a mediocre work. I'm not criticizing its adaptation as I have not read the manga (and I don't care about it). What I am talking about is the anime, so anything against this last argument won't be taken as true. \
Nothing less to add.\

    I don't think Attack on Titan is the best of all time.\
I do not think Attack on Titan is absolute trash either.\
I mean, honestly, I can see why someone who has only seen a handful of anime would think Attack on Titan is the best. It's actually good. Here’s why.\
The first selling point that anyone will notice while watching the show, the hook that drags people into the world of Attack on Titan, is the high-octane action. Even when we're not being treated to a visceral, fast-paced and expertly animated human vs. titan battle, we are still given the impression of suspense and intensity.\
Part of\
          \
        this can be attributed to the setting itself. It shares the atmosphere of a war-torn country where a bomb could drop any second. Our oversized antagonists, the titans, could appear and cause mass devastation at any given time. There is a quiet, subtle hysteria among the people inside the walls, and the viewers can feel this. It keeps us watching, sitting on the edge of our seats and wondering what might happen next.\
The stunning animation from Wit Studio keeps eyes glued to the screen, and with our lord and savior Hiroyuki Sawano composing the music, we become fully submerged in a world that feels very apocalyptic.\
The entire story is actually pretty unique, and if you're not a huge action fan you can still appreciate the mysteries and plot twists introduced later in the story, although some “twists” are actually insultingly predictable. However, the anime is incomplete, (we're still waiting for a second season), and so by the end of the anime, we are left with a plethora of questions and, honestly, not really any answers. There is a certain character, (my personal favorite of the entire cast) whose motives I really want to know, but which aren't explained by the end, and that's all I can say without treading into major spoiler territory.\
The more important characters in the anime actually experience a lot of development as the anime progresses. There are times where we are given an in depth explanation of their attitudes, motives, and emotions, and it's refreshing to see these teenaged characters actually grow up a bit. You know, like real people do.\
A perfect example of this is with our main character, Eren. At the beginning of the anime, he harbors the somewhat naive belief that he can save everyone within the walls and becoming the ultimate titan-killing machine. Through his dedication and hard work, he begins to experience the true nature of battling these grotesque creatures, and starts to understand just how impossible his goals are.\
Another example of how the show kept it clever with it's characters was with Mikasa. What could have been a one-dimensional female character who has little interest in anything outside of keeping Eren safe, became something more. Her nearly obsessive relationship with Eren is a gateway into her psyche and her outlook on life, instead of constituting her personality, making it interesting to watch her grow over time.\
This keeps Attack on Titan more grounded than it could have been, and causes the viewers to become more connected to the tragedy and despair that surrounds the characters.\
That being said, it still falls into many of the issues that shonen anime often run into. Badass action sequences are interrupted for monologues that hold no importance whatsoever, making scenes drag on for much longer than necessary. The pacing was inconsistent, and as soon as you got used to watching something quick-paced and action-packed, the show would suddenly slam on the brakes, giving us viewers whiplash in the process. I would find myself yelling at the TV to get on with the fucking story already.\
Overall, Attack on Titan is a pretty decent anime. It wasn't the holy pinnacle of entertainment that some claim it to be, but I don't think it's fair to dismiss it just because it's “mainstream” or has a somewhat annoying fanbase. (Although the fanbase has calmed down after a few years).\

    The lead character Eren, really sticks out as a character. There are a number of protagonist cliches which are designed to humanize the protagonist, and make him or her more sympathetic or It's hard to pin down one point, or one thing about Attack on Titan that grabbed my attention. Eren really stick out as a character. There are a number of protagonist cliches which are designed to humanize the protagonist, and make him or her more sympathetic or relatable. One of them is the idea that the protagonist is scarred to he just hides/channels/suppress, or has overcome his fear, or is still frozen by\
          \
        it at times. Another is that the protagonist also hates fighting or violence, and just does it because he has to.\
             Eren doesn't seem to know what fear is, I don't think he has ever experienced it, and I don't think he even really understands it. He seems to have a utter disdain for those who let fear guide their actions, because he can't relate to their fears. For him violence is the only solution to humanities problem. He has never even spent a second considering a alternative. Scratch that he has given countless inspirational speeches on why the alternatives are horseshit. He is the boy who cried inspirational speech.\
             And he is not the least bit apologetic about his views. For him the loss of his Mother is a source of Anger, and motivation far more than sadness. And when his father abandoned him, he didn't seem to care. For him the struggle against the Titans, and his childhood dream of exploring the outside world are all that matters. His life, and the lives of others are secondary to that goal, and all else is not even secondary, it doesn't even enter the equation. I don't think he has had a romantic, or sexual feeling in his life.\
          The action is beautifully animated, and above all memorable. Even if you only watch so much as one of the action packed trailers, or the opening credits, you will have a hard time forgetting some of the visuals. \
       The story is simple enough (at least at first), but the simplistic turns into a strength. The clear good vs Evil narrative allows for a focus on the war aspect, and incredible fight scenes. \
         The show is vary enjoyable. The story isn't deep, but many of the characters are. The fight scenes, and visuals are incredible, and the characters are unique. I strongly recommend it.\

     It has an interesting story, of people must fight the titans while trying not to be eaten by them. Also trying to find out more about the titans. The characters are very well written.but there is little to no character development  for anyone except Eren, Mikasa, Armin and Levi. For Eren, is when he made up his mind up of killing all of the titans. Also finding out that he can become one as well. Then there is when his mind set on the scouts when he comes back from his first mission. For Mikasa the main moment is when she takes a\
          \
        huge stand to get everyone to act. Levi, is when he went up against Annie. Showing how far he will go even if he gets hurt. Armin is when he fights back against the higher ups to change their minds. Most of the others I could care less about them besides Annie because you meet them and they seem interesting enough to make you want more from them. But no they all die without making me feel anything for them. There are some unexplained things. How is Eren a titan. What is in the basement. Also who are the other special titans and the one in the wall.   Overall great story but the character development is ratter on the low end for a good amount of people. so far it’s Great. Also can't wait for season 2.    What do you think about attack on titan?",

    I had to watch this several times, as the audio is in Japanese, with English subtitles. SO after multiple viewings, I was able to better appreciate the artwork as I wasn't quite so busy reading what the characters were actually saying.\
Wow! One word really does say it all. But you might need more convincing, so I'll try harder.\
The story: fantastic, and fantastical. Either our Earth in the future, or a parallel timeline Earth, or a \"Lost Colony\" of humans on a distant Earth-like world, I don't know, but the \"Giants,\" called Titans appeared several centuries ago and began eating humans. Societies collapsed, refugees fled, until\
          \
        the last of humanity is holed up in a giant city-state protected by a concentric series of 50-meter tall walls.\
Technology has either stagnated or collapsed to late 18th century levels; muzzle-loading firearms and cannons are the most advanced recognizable weaponry, with the singular exception of the VME: the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment. Part slingshot, part bungee cord, this allows humanity to fly about from any handy vertical surface and fight back against the Titans, though it's utility is greatly diminished in \"open field\" terrain.\
The story follows three main protagonists, with a close supporting cast. The three main characters are young friends, children really, at the beginning of Season 1; by the end, they've graduated Basic Training and joined the elite Survey Corps, one of three \"Regiments\" holding the line against the Titans on humanity's behalf, and the only Regiment that fights the Titans outside the city's walls.\
The \"supporting cast\" is as rich and diverse as the main characters, with several \"breakout\" characters, such as Captain Levi Ackerman, Zoe Hange, and Commander Erwin Smith. \
The artwork and soundtrack are similarly amazing; one of my earlier complaints was having to focus too much on the subtitles to watch the \"bigger picture\" and truly appreciate the often stunning beauty that went into making this series. But I didn't mind re-watching it several times until I knew the overall story well enough to appreciate the artwork and soundtrack all on their own.\
Season 1 ended on a bit of a cliffhanger (naturally!), and I can't wait for Season 2, due out sometime early in 2017.\
Watch this. Watch it several times, as it is plot and visual dense material; I'm still finding little bits of hidden gems I missed the first, second, and even third go-around in this outstanding series.\

    My first impression of this anime was....wow.... giant, naked, man-eating, people....i don't want to watch that, its horrifying. IT IS HORRIFYING, but thats what makes this anime so hard to stop watching once you've started watching. EVERY SINGLE EPISODE ENDS ON A CLIFF HANGER! Every episode twisted my stomach into knots, as I held on to the hope that maybe my favorite characters wouldn't die this episode. Honestly I don't count this anime as one of my favorites based on a personal bias, there is a pretty considerable amount of gore and profanity. This isn't to say the producers threw this in just to make\

        the rating for an older audience, they're just being realistic based on the anime's scenario. That being said, the overall idea of the anime is brilliant, those... sling... shot... belt... things (lol srry i can't remember what they're called), ideology, unique art style, and the gradual plot twists are really great. In spite of my opinions about the level of gore, note that I HATED High School of the Dead which has similar elements, but this anime had something that HSOTD didn't. So in conclusion this Anime was FLAWLESS, there are absolutely no faults on the producers part, its only a matter of personal preference.\

    This anime has blown my mind. I remember how excited I was when I watched the first two episodes on Crunchyroll, and then rushed to another site to watch the 3rd one. The storyline is just amazing, they didn't fail to present the great idea like they did with SAO, i mean seriously, 3rd episode and they're already 2 years into the game! They could have at least dragged it out for another dozen episodes or so. Anyway, back to SnK, The art is just amazing aswell. The eyes are probably the most detailed out of any anime i've watched, and the titans each possess\

        their own special looks.\

    I honestly do not know where to start. But, I cannot emphasize how highly I recommend otakus to watch this anime. If you want an anime with excitement, plot twists, and the never-gets-old cliff hangers, watch this anime. This anime will leave you on the edge of your seat, and in tears at the same time. The plot consists of humorous and tragic events. So far, I believe this anime  is perfect in mixing humor, mystery, tragedy, romance, adventure, and suspense. There really is not much of romance, but it is fitted somewhere within the series. \

    The sound was incredibly harmonious, magnificent, and in-sync with the whole episode. Even the opening got me all pumped up and excited to watch the episode. The song choice was absolutely brilliant and I have no doubt about it.\
    The characters all symbolize something important that ties the whole story together. In order to realize their characteristics, you must understand the moral decisions the characters had to make in order to maintain their trait. You will see obvious traits in the main characters such as perseverance, faith, determination, integrity, and fear [in death]. Some traits will come to a shock to most people, especially me. Other characters will make you pull your hair out and scream why, why they did what they did. The main characters endure a plethora of catharsis, which might make you go through the same feelings the character has. The characters were created fairly well, according to what I have analyzed. \
    Words cannot describe how much I have enjoyed this anime. So far, this anime has made me think about moral decisions and think about what I would've done if I were in the main character(s) position. I've begun to think about the reality of possible things that could occur in this world, but of course, we all know that humongous man-eating giants will not attack out planet (or will they...?) \
   Overall, like I said before, I cannot emphasize how I highly recommend this. The series has already ended, so this gives you the advantage to slide your way through the whole series, but I warn you: you will cry, wishing there was a lot more. The story continues on the manga and believe me, you will be yanking your hair out of your head, hanging on the edge of a cliff with just your finger, holding on as much as you possibly can because the story is just that amazing, Watch the anime, read the manga, or do the other way around. either way, it is a fantastic story that ties together everything an anime should be about. If you like suspense, adventure, cliff-hangers, mystery, and romance, watch this anime. It's great for the mind and heart because there are events and scenes that touch your heart and make you want to become a more stronger person. \

    The anime broke out onto the scene last year and quickly rose to become one of the most popular animes, with the mangas selling like hot cakes as a result. \
Story- Well giants preying on mankind is the basic idea behind attack on titan. Its a simple idea but the execution is what makes the difference. The story is ripe with action, suspense and plot twists which begin as early as episode 5. The 1st major character death occurs in the 1st episode itself ( I wont spoil who) and from then on its a straight road into hell with our protagonists learning the ropes\
          \
        of the 3D equipment gear as well as grappling with their own insecurities and fears. The 1st half of the series is good. However the show tends to drag at the episode 10-13 mark. Fear not, by the 2nd arc which begins around episode 14 the show picks up and plows forward at a breakneck pace. \
Characters -\
I suppose there is something about the titans that make them so much more imposing than other antagonists of a series. True, giant villains have been done in other anime such as the Hollows in Bleach or the Shukaku in Naruto. But I have never experienced the sense of scale or danger that I do with Attack on Titan. Mainly because we know the main protagonists of those 2 series will come out on top no matter what. \
Titan is a different ball game. People die. Alot.\
Call it the Game of thrones of anime, but no one is safe on this show.Characters  whom you get to know and love die like insects before you know it. \
The show has 3 main protagonists:\
Eren- Main character. Angry, whiny but determined. Truth be told he whines too much. But he is key in the fight against the titans for reasons which i will not spoil here.\
Mikasa- Erens childhood friend and skilled fighter.\
Armin- A character who starts off with low confidence but begins to form ideas of his own and ultimately starts showing leadership qualities as the series progresses.\
That's the beauty of this series: characters actually grow and develop. You feel like these are actual people and not cardboard cut outs. Even the most unlikeable characters mature and you grow to like them.\
Art-\
Here is where attack on titan shines. The titan battles are beautifully animated as our heroes grapple and swing through cities and forests, flying over, under and around the walking behemoths trying to cut them down. Its all very jaw dropping stuff and somewhat spiderman inspired. Character art is quite well done as well with darker lines being used for character outlines making them stand out against the backdrop. There is plenty of blood and gore so this show is also not for the faint of heart.\
Sound-\
I have the 1st opening song on repeat. Its that good. The actual soundtrack itself is amazing and I would say on par with many hollywood films. The music plays a big role in enhancing the scale of the titan battles.\
Enjoyment-\
It has been a very long time since I have found an anime which i can sit down and watch for hours. This is such an anime, and I would say it deserves a spot among the 'New Big 3' in japan.\
Overall- 8/10 \
Hope they animate the rest of the manga.\

    So I thought I'd better give a review of this because, well I can! Just a quick side note, I'm surprised by such low ratings for this anime and how many people hate it, I've read through more than handful of them and I get the feeling they're just looking for something to hate but hey, I could be completely wrong, people have many different tastes. Anyway onto the review, this is my first time writing one so there might be spoilers and grammatical errors. \
Story:\
So brief run down, Eren Jaeger, a young teen, swears revenge on all Titans (man eating giants) following a tragic\
          \
        event of his mother getting eaten alive before his eyes. The plot is very interesting and while formulaic in parts and shounen 'like' it also holds its own uniqueness and is very compelling. Each episode basically ends in a cliffhanger that while some I did see coming (first episode for example), some I did not, like episode 5 for one. It's action packed and doesn't give you time to grieve for character deaths, because trust me, your favourite characters will die. The only downside is that it's a bit slow paced in some parts, the episodes dragged on and what could of taken one and a half episodes probably could of been down to just 1 episode, although I didn't really mind as you can't always have a fast paced anime, it would end too quickly (or catch up to the manga). Again great story and lots of plot twists! \
Art:\
At first I had a little bit of trouble dealing with the art style, it wasn't something I was use to, but I got over it by the end of episode 1. The bold and chunky art is solely unique to this anime (that I know of) and it somewhat resembles the art from the manga (and let me tell you, the manga art is quite hard to get into, the anatomy T_T!!!) While lots of people dislike the style, I like it a lot, it's SNK's trademark, like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece and FMA all have their own unique art style. Also the colours while are very neutral, suit the era and theme of the anime, it's depressing and set in a medieval period so it's not going to have flashy colours and such. The animation is quite stunning, the action scenes, the speeds and angles of the 3D maneuver gear are captured very well and are fluid and fast paced, it's exciting to watch. A lot of the animation focuses on intense facial expressions (especially the eyes) of the characters in despair or anger, showing raw emotion and of course, just like any airing anime, some of the art does get sloppy due to rushed production and such, but it's not very noticeable.\
Sound:\
Yes, the soundtrack is amazing. I downloaded it the minute it was released. The OP & ED are very lovely, the opening is very catchy and probably one of my favourites, it gets the blood boiling. The background music suits the eery and doomsday theme of the anime, and in some parts, the music is damn freaking awesome. I get goosebumps listening to it. The second OP is very good as well, not as good as the first opening but it holds its own and is quite catchy and cool too. The second ending I preferred more than the first.\
Character:\
I found that I love each and every character, they show good character development and have realistic reactions following different scenarios. Eren Jager is intense and fiery, he's a bit loud (but aren't most shounen protagonists?) but he has strong goals and morals, I find him quite likeable although a bit annoying in his pre-teen stages. Mikasa Ackerman is cool, she's a badass girl. In her backstory she was a very happy and shy sort of girl but following her parents death, she changed into a strong and independent girl, who's always looking after Eren. The only downside to her is that she's a bit overprotective of him, more than I'd like, and sometimes I find it a bit smothering and annoying. Armin Arlet, he is quiet and shy but incredibly intelligent. While a lot of people dislike him because of the useless factor, I don't find him useless at all, later on in the episodes, he risks his life for Eren and is very brave. He needs a haircut though :3. All the other characters are quirky, unique and are impressionable. I don't have a favourite, I like them all. \
Enjoyment:\
Probably ONE of the most enjoyable animes I've watched in a long time. It kept me hooked and excited, I look forward to every new episode and cry and laugh in each episode. While it has dark/depressing themes, it does add comic relief in some parts that is refreshing from it's usual pace. I get so excited watching this anime that the adrenaline in my body makes me shake and I end up needing to run around to get rid of the excess adrenaline, that's how much I enjoy Shingeki no Kyojin. From here on out, it will only get better I reckon and it definitely won't be a disappoint like some other notable anime that have come out in the last couple of years. (Cough well HOPEFULLY anyway)\
Overall:\
Well if you can't tell from my review, it's amazing and one of my favourites. Good plot, unique art, fantastic animation, great soundtrack and characters. Very enjoyable.\

    Attack on titan\
The sense of journey and progression in this show is very prevalent, the characters are not the things progressing mostly , but the story is.\
It sometimes has jarring changes of pace , but I was not annoyed by it as much as other people.\
I liked the gritty and original art style, the amazing music and the voice acting a lot.\
The general production quality of this show is really great and it’s almost worth watching the show because of that fact alone\
It seems like a very complex shonen at first , but the amount of drama and character focus quickly shouts ‘’seinen!’’\
The show ends\
          \
        with little questions answered and a second season is on the way , this is a good thing since I often see directors trying to cram their story in a single 12,  or even 20 episode package and it failing because of lack of time.\
The amount of flack the characters get from reviewers and people is apparently because the characters are ‘’all over the place’’, this is in my opinion only true for the main character.\
The characters’ behavior can also be explained by their tragic history and the tragedies that they face during the show.\
In my opinion it makes all the more sense for some of them to make actions that seem rash or illogical.\
Both of the openings are also stellar and reflect the ‘’fight for survival’’ theme of the show well.\
I guess the reason this show is really special to me it its originality , it does not pander to tits , it does not copy existing formulae.\
It simply comes up with an interesting premise and delivers on it.\
The 3d 2d combo fight scenes with a whole friggin orchestra playing , very impressive\
In the end , it’s something completely different from the standard shonen routine.",

    Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) was definitely an anime I had been waiting to watch. Not only is it on par with the manga, the music and effects just show the true colors of the story. In a mere hope for human survival, groups of people, who are willing to risk their lives, fight against their \"so-called\" enemies, Titans, whose primary goal seems to be eradicating the existence of humans. Whether you are willing to see through how humans will survive is your call, but if the verge of human existence does not captivate your attention, I don't know what will...\
Story (10) - So\
          \
        the anime is set in a city, or rather, the only city that is present, that is surrounded by 3 ginormous walls that are meant to protect the humans from invading Titans. Out of the city lays Titan territory, so playing \"outside\" isn't necessarily a good option. Apparently, 100 years ago, the humans were attacked by the Titans, and since then, it had been peaceful, until 100 years later, which is present time in the anime, when the Titans invaded the city again and are trying to push through the inner city to kill all the humans. Obviously if you were there at the time of invasion, you would crap your pants until all your organs come out. The way they created the worst-case scenario was definitely good, but seeming as we would want the humans to live, it is a most terrifying situation. And through the episodes the humans train to fight against the Titans and prevent human extinction. I'll be candid; the opening episodes were great, but it trails off later because they center the story around Eren who becomes part of the fighting corps and fights his way through many obstacles. HOWEVER, the plot becomes increasingly better, and the anti-climatic moments really bring about the colors of this anime. Keep in mind though, that many humans sacrifice their lives for the greater good, so it is not an anime that you should be taking lightly.\
Art (10) - SnK, or AoT, has very unique artwork, which mostly has to do with their uniforms and the ever popular 3D maneuver gear. The producers make this anime very interesting in that they use such a unique assortment of weapons that humans use to fight the Titans. Logically, you would think that they have no chance against the Titans because of their capabilities, but seeming that certain humans are very skilled, they can easily take down lower class Titans  which enough power and might. As you watch, you will first see all this gear and be very vexed, which happened in my case as well, but as you continue to watch, you will understand a bit of the mechanics, as well as how effectively the humans fight and cooperate together to eliminate their enemies. \
Sound (10) - You know a song is good if you continuously listen to it everyday, or x9000 times...SnK has a unique, and rather epic OST that really captivates the epic moments that spur in the course of events. So if you are ever running late to your class, just pop on your headphones, play the OST, and you'll be on your merry way. The first opening seemed a bit weird to me at first, mostly because I was not accustomed to such a different style of music, but as I kept playing over and over, I fell in love with it. The opening is epic in its own way, and it never ceases to amaze me. The second opening didn't seem to gain as much popularity as the first, but considering how well the song was put together, to address similar elements from the first, I was just as surprised, if not even more impressed by Linked Horizon. Definitely give it a shot, and you might just be as impressed as I was. Unfortunately, the endings are not as \"epic\" and candidly speaking, I never listened to both endings fully. However, I'm sure they're great songs, since they do have a nice melody, so definitely check them out as well. SnK might not have the greatest OST or openings/endings, but for the type of music style it offers, I cannot help but give kudos to the music department.\
Character (9) - and who would've thought that a potato would have such a big impact on a character. I'm sure that you'll hear from your friends that there is a character who loves potatoes, and got all famous from it. While that may be true, a potato is a potato. That is not a hugely significant item that changes the story, only to the character herself. But, all the characters are greatly impressive and have unique qualities that show their true colors. There are many favorable characters to get accustomed to in the anime, so everyone is entitled to their own opinions. \
Enjoyment (9) - everything is so good when you watch humans in action. The 3D gear is so impressive in how it functions, and seeing how humans slice the Titans is amazing. What really made me love the anime was how they fought, and the communication that spread throughout the groups. Of course, humans aren't the only fighters. Titans eat humans right? Humans are not the most overpowered beings in the world, and seem rather inferior to Titans. It is a bit disgusting to see how Titans capture and feast off of the humans, which brings a sense of fear and emotional distress to the humans, but that shows how much humans struggle for their survival. In my opinion, each episode is great in some way, and it just gets better and better. One does not simply watch SnK and stop (...well, that is your choice). \
Attack on Titan brings out a lot of different and unique elements. It certainly scores very high because of its creativity, originality, and purpose. I am not being biased because of its popularity, but I am being candid because this anime is legitimately great. This probably one of the first anime really defines the meaning of \"YOLO\". Eat or be eaten, the survival of the fittest, both of these \"themes\" are heavily expressed in this anime. What would you do to save humanity? Be passive, and hope for the best, or stay calm, and ATTACK ON TITAN?\

    For majority of the summer 2013 and part of fall 2013 many people have been talking about the famous Shingeki no Kyojin. Its only right to say that this anime has everything in it. The intense story line, the crazy development of characters, the twist and turns in the plot, the EPIC fight scenes, the detailed art work. This anime seriously had everyone in a roar!! You get really connected with the characters as the story progresses. You feel for Eren and his revenge to kill all the titans. As the story progresses u just want to know whats going to happen next. The fight\
          \
        scenes in my opinion were the best enjoyment, they were very detailed, and intense!! It left the watchers on edge when watching the fight scenes against the Titans because seriously anything could happen when fighting a HUGE GIANT!! lol Each episode left you at a cliff hanger making the watcher want to watch more. I recommend this anime for everyone its seriously one of those unforgettable animes, that leaves an impression on the watcher after watching the anime. \

    My first reaction to hearing about Attack on Titan was \"A show about giants attacking people behind walls, ill probably get bored what can giants do.\" Now im screaming at people \"WATCH ATTACK ON TITAN\"\
This is not the first show i have watched episodically but never have a been so eager for the next episode to come around. AOT delivered a thrilling, somewhat excruciating experience as most episodes end in a major cliffhanger. While this is not a flaw, at times it did seem to disturb the progression of the plot. \
The plot of AOT is great, and although the pace is at times ruined\
          \
        by the constant cliffhangers it really does come together well and will leave you longing to know more. \
The real gem of this show are its designs, music and characters, because together they work to create an Amazing experience. The action in this anime is smooth and well designed and to me was the highlight of this anime. It could be absolutely jaw droppingly brutal at times. \
There are a multitude of characters which really help to drive the plot each serving their own purpose, even if that purpose was dying. there was always the presiding fear that characters i liked would die, to make it worse death was almost an arbitrary thing. The plot would refused to slow down because people were dying. \
The opening songs were a surprising stand out, really helping to influence the high energy the show has. This is an anime defineantly worth watching as the one thing AOT does best is be incredibly engaging.\

    This is my first review so it may not be the best, but even if I have only convinced one person to watch this amazing anime then I have done my job.\
This anime was completely different than what I thought it would be. Reading about the anime and reading different peoples reviews about how some people loved it and some people thought it was overrated, I was wasnt sure if id like it. Boy was I wrong. Not only will this be forever in my top 5 anime of all time, I think this is the fastest ive ever gone through an anime.\
Story: 10\
Attack on\
          \
        Titan is set in a world where 100 years ago civilization was attacked out of nowhere by these huge beasts called titans, nearly wiping out all of civilization. What remains of the people that survive live inside of three walls that protect them from the titans. For 100 years they lived in peace from the titans, untill one a giant titan breaks through the walls and nobodies life is the same (including mine!!). One of the main reasons I kept wanting to watch this anime was to see what would happen next in the story. With every finished just left one more mystery that I had to figure out. Each episode ends on a cliff hanger than keeps you glued to your seat, bed, couch, whatever you choose to watch your anime on. This story is so unlike any anime ive ever watched and I loved it.\
\
Art: 9\
The art in this, personally, has its ups and downs. Some of the coloring of the facial expressions and the way they are shadowd is a little unrefined in this anime but at the same time that unrefinedness helps nail the stress and anxiety in each characters face.\
Sound: 8\
The music that was played with this anime went right along with every change of mood and scene. I don't usually pay attention to much to the sound but the sound effects and the music that played when something bad would happend was chilling and went great with the scenes.\
Character: 9\
The characters and the story are what make this anime stand out. From the very begining when you meet the first character you feel for their situation that they are put in and you instantly become attached to them. Not only the main characters but I found myself rooting even for the not so main characters. I also like how alot of the characters even though they are not main characters get alot of screen time and that gives you a chance to really start to become attached to these characters. One of the struggles that characters face in this anime is over coming their fears to do what is right  One more big thing which ive always really liked is that not every character is invincible. When you watch shows like naruto or bleach or even one piece it seems like no one can loose and everyone is invincible, but with Attack on Titan that is not so. To keep from spoiling I will leave it at that.\
Enjoyment: 10\
This show doesn't have to have huge jutsus or an amaizing sword and bankai to keep you interested. What this anime lacks in huge mind blowing powers it makes up for in its suprisingly simple action scenes that you keep you captivated.\
Overall:\
This is one of my favorite anime of all time and will continue to be for a long time. This is the first anime I have watched that has made me scream, shout for joy, and laugh out loud in the same series. I highly recomend this series.\

    I love nearly everything about this show. This show has one of the strongest starts of all anime I have ever seen! The art and soundtrack are both amazing, and the story takes a simple idea of `what if humans were at the top of the food chain?` and build an entire world based off it. Although Eren may come off as a bit cliche, the ending to episode 1 had more of an emotional impact on me than some anime throughout the entire show! So long as it continues in the path of the manga it will be a completely worthwhile anime for anyone!\

    So, many people are claiming that Attack on Titan is \"overrated\", well I think AoT deserves the praise it gets, Excluding the fact that I wasn't too fond of the characters.\
AoT is a story full of twists and turns, it leaves you with a hunger for more and more episodes untill you realise the serie only has 25 episodes. What got me the most excited was the incredible art, animation and sound, there were some of the best scenes I had ever seen especially the action in which they moved around in high speed with there 3D maneuver gear.\
I didn't really like the characters because\

    Attack On Titan is awesome! I was losing interest in fantasy adventure anime until I watched Attack On Titan. It deliver what it says and does it well, although I am a tad disappointed by the direction it went during episode 9. I am not going to spoiled it for those who hasn't watched but let's just say if you are expecting a David Vs Goliath kind of  show, it didn't went there.\
 Mankind is push to the brink of extinction because of giant humanoid creatures that eats people and is invincible to any attacks. Their only weakness the nape of their necks which\
          \
        lead to an invention of 3D  Maneuver machine, Basically it enable you to become Spider Man. This is the part where I didn't like . The 3D Maneuver machine hardly comes to use since the only people who can kill titans with it is the guy with the hair cut and the last Asian alive. So, interesting machine premise but thrown out of the window for other things. \
The animation is done by Production I.G. That is enough said.\
As for characters, well this is kind of the weakest point of the show for me. Eren is a pyschopath. Mikasa is an Asian and Armin is a little bitch. That sums it up.  Oh, and Levi is the typical badass character you see in thousands other shows. \
 The sound's especially great, man I still can't get the first opening out of my head. \
 Overall it's good.\

    I love this anime so much so far! I've always loved humanity being on the brink of extinction plots, and the fact that they're surrounded by a wall makes it even better.\
I really enjoy the animation, too. I don't recall watching any other anime that has the thick outlining they use on characters. It's a very nice style, and fits the anime very well. Backgrounds are gorgeous, too! Since it takes place so far back, it's a really wonderful mix of European and Italian architecture, and accurate to the time period too!\

An amazing soundtrack by far.Maybe the best I have heard. Who am I kidding it is the best. The story was absolutely captivating and is full of awesome Cliff hanger, awesome fight scene and interesting dialogue and story. The art was so good in the anime.

It would be more effective for when people die but in an anime like this it is difficult to do so. For enjoyment sake I loved this anime as I said and it is now at this point my favourite anime. This anime has to be easy the best anime of 2013. Nothing could ever touch it. Well that is my first ever review on this site. If you like it don't be afraid to add me as a friend. I would love to talk about and see other people's favourite anime. Have a good day. ( Hope this wasn't too long.) \

    Plot: \
Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Elen and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that\
          \
        appears out of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Elen vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.\
\
Attack on Titan (shingeki no kyojin) has become one of the most popular anime in the industry.. With it's unique setting and story line it can be matched up with big series like Naruto in just it's first 25 episodes.. The characters and art are also outstanding! This is definitely a must watch Anime!\

    When I first watched it, I did it because my friends told me to. I watched it at night and, to be honest, I dropped it for a while (it scared me). But anyways, I gave it another try a week later. I am proud to say that I am glad I gave it another try. \
My favorite thing about the anime is the music, especially the first opening. I think I got used to it after a while, but since I hadn't seen anything like this before, I didn't really know what to think, at first.\
I like how it can get really emotional at\
          \
        times, I cried a couple times. This was one of the few shows that made me cry and I usually don't cry, but that is a good thing because sometimes you just have to let it out. I find myself being there right with the characters. \
I didn't like the artwork that much. I don't know, I just thought it was a little strange to me. Like how the peoples faces look outlined and the facial expressions are a little ridiculous. \
I really enjoyed this anime though, because you never really know what to expect. I like it for that fact, because, then, you don't really have to wait for the punch line.\
Overall, this anime is pretty amazing, I love to see horror in its best. I love how I can really relate to some of the characters and react like them to crises. The music is enticing and makes it more worth the while for me. I hope that season two will be just as good, I can't wait!\

    1) Story: I think the story is pretty nice but only scenes i liked was fighting scenes.A lot of new things come in some episodes like character backgrounds and, umm... lets say 'new things'.Some episodes felt like fillers actually,sometimes it concentrates on one event and does it for 4 episodes which i dont like.\

    Decent anime, but I feel it was a little overrated. This anime has been pointed out to be pretty violent & dark, but in reality it's not that bad. There's some scenes, but it's not as gruesome as its made out to be. If you want some really dark and twisted stuff I recommend Elfen Lied or Berserk. The two main reasons I gave this anime a 6/10 is because 1.) the characters were kind of boring (not all of them, characters like Armin who seemed super whiny and pathetic). Because of this I really didn't grow an attachment to any of the characters so\
          \
        i wasn't sad when anyone throughout the show died  2.) I guess the theme wasn't exactly my cup of tea either. It was like they were killing brain damaged giants which is kind of a weird enemy. \
I can see where people like this anime at the same time I think it became way more popular and is made out to be way better than it actually is. It seems to happen that way a lot with anime that comes to America. It's always over exaggerated...likely because a lot of the REALLY morbid anime doesn't make it here since the FCC is so strict. Anyway, I should end here before I go off into an irrelevant rant sorry. \

    Bon je n'ai rien contre SnK mais quand on a une aussi bonne série avec un aussi bon manga comment vous avez fait pour tout détruire avec vos spin-off putain de commercial, c'était pourtant pas compliqué de le garder aussi bien qu'il est.\
A part ça, l'histoire est très bien, des moments assez jouissif, des personnages bon voilà c'est pas folichon mais ça fait son boulot.\
Au final c'est juste un anime qui fait son taf pas ouf mais qui à été le symbole d'une année et qui a fait découvrir le monde de l'animation a de nombreuses personnes et c'est bien là sa plus grande réussite.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin is probably one of the most pobular Anime series out there due to the fact that it's so easy for people new to Anime to watch. It has a simple plot and the art and the characters itself were okay, but the show had some severe issues with the story pace.\
The 25 episodes which made up the first season were supposed to take 5 years but only two major events occurred which each only took a day each of those 5 years. The worst part is that those two summed up days took almost 60% of the episodes to cover. The rest\
          \
        covered episodes that were supposed to explain the plot better for the sake of the Anime itself.\

    Some anime get alot of hype throughout the year, and it really sets expectations for you when getting ready for when you watch said show because, well, you wanna feel this level of amazing everyone is talking about. But sometimes you get disappointed. Sometimes you don't also. Lets see if Shingeki no Kyojin lives up to it's very high hype and respect.\
The story, if everyone and their mother hasn't ruined it for you by now, is about a time period where humanity has been forced to live behind gigantic walls, because these gigantic humanoid looking creatures called \"titans\" are eating any person they come in\
          \
        contact with. I would love to further but i feel watching the first episode is by far one of the best first episodes of anime i have ever seen in any anime I have ever seen. That aside however, we get to the pros and cons of this show. The show pros are easily the execution of how they truly capture the importance of death, and how it really will affect you, and the horror of it, which is amazing. However, it also is one of the weaker points. See barely any of the cast will live, and NO one is safe other than your main three, except maybe Armin, cause no one likes Armin. This gives you no time to like any characters, and it really is a shame  because I would have loved to know more about some of them, or at least had some more character development. Another thing i didn't like is that the show leaves on a major cliffhanger, and we get our second season THIS YEAR, 3 years later, some BS you ask me. I know there's reasons but like really, why would they do that to us. But overall, the story is pretty good, the faults can be forgiven if you're not me.\
The animation for this show is off the hook, definitely something to be praised. The show looks amazing and the action scenes looks amazing, i wanna say the best, but, i have seen better, not that it matters, just saying. There really isn't much to go over here. Every scene the show does looks amazing and is well detailed, and there really isn't a reason not to like it. So yeah, that wraps that up. \
As for the sound department, everything sounds great, it like the animation, compliments the show very well, and honestly i feel the show wouldn't have been as good if it didn't have the epic sound that it does. As for the opening, well if you've seen any top ten opening list on YouTube, you probably already know the first opening is a god damn masterpiece. And the second one is okay, not bad but, barely worth mentioning compared with the first one, like usual. On the subject of sub vs dub, i would go sub on this one. The dub isn't bad, but me personally knowing that the same guy who did Kirito from SAO was doing Erhen Jaeger in this.... Just couldn't get passed that, but that will end with your personal preference anyway.\
The characters are hard to talk about because like i said earlier the show kills people off like ten per episode, and that's when it's being nice. The main three are worth talking about, i won't talk to much about them in detail because in the case anyone knows nothing about this show, to go into heavy detail about them would spoil quite a bit. But your main three are Erhen, your main hot blooded character, who ranges from awesome to repetitive, Armin, a Shinji with a pair of balls, but is a very well developed character by the end of the season, and Mikasa, the badass with no flaws. The main three all get very well developed by the end of the season and it really makes you like them. So yeah.\
Overall Attack on Titan is a very entertaining series to watch, but i wouldn't call it perfect. The show looks amazing, sounds amazing, but has it's flaws when it comes to characters, and has it's flaws when it comes to some of the story telling. Is it worth the hype? Yes, as even though it has flaws, they can be overlooked. Is it perfection? No, not by any means. So in other words, go watch it, and you will not be disappointed, just beware the over hype.\

While the story is somewhat original, I feel it could be a lot better as there where lot's of details that made no sense such as people constantly ignoring their superiors orders or soldiers running away from the fight and all that while we see thems getting hardcore training in the first few episodes.The pacing was kinda slow at the point were you could notice the bad plot. Also deus ex machina what more can I say? This anime finds  the most stupid ways to abuse this trope. To close out the finale was just cliffhanger\
Art: 9\
While I am not a huge fan\
          \
        of this art style I have to say it is well made and fits this anime perfectly. The character designs were unique and the scenery was beautiful, I just didn't like how the trees were made\
Sound: 9\
You could say the character's rage/desperation/fear just by listening to the voices and well the opening song was simply amazing. I think the titans could be a little better made\
Character: 5\
Yeah the characters are not the most interesting thing in the anime. First of all, the \"good guys\" are simply overpowered from being super smart to super strong or both? There was pretty much no character development which personally made me get bored of them. There is some backstory given for some characters which makes things a little interesting. As for the antagonists well they were just there. The supporting characters were flat with just one trait that affected all their decisions throughout the anime (such as food)\
Enjoyment: 6\
While this is not a super bad anime, I wouldn't recommend it if you are more of a story focused person. I personally would never rewatch these series as you will probably spot more flaws than before\
Overall: 6\
Bad story and character development, great art and sound. If you like action without looking a lot into the plot this is a great anime for you\

    Shit. Anyone who thinks otherwise can't tell what a good work actually is. The story and characters are as flat as a loli's chest. The fantastic music and animation pulls you in and the idea of it keeps the simple minded and/or new anime fans watching and leads them into thinking it's most outstanding thing they have ever laid eyes upon. AOT/SNK is too edgy(superficially cool and dramatic) to be taken seriously. Edginess shows a lack in the creators ability to write actually well written darkness and mature characters. The mangaka for AOT is great at coming up with ideas, but terrible at putting them\
          \
        to action.\
The characters in AOT are extremely basic, cliche, unrealistic, and edgy. All save Jean that is. He is realistically just trying to survive in the jacked up world everyone lives in by wanting to join the safe military police, and dislikes Eren because he's an abusive shitbag who can't go an episode without being an ass to Mikasa. He also goes through the best written character development. Of course most of this strange fandom hates him for this.\
The most annoying thing about this show aside from the popularity it does not deserve is that the fandom somehow thinks(I have no idea where in Hades house they got this from) that main characters die. That actually important characters die. All the time. This just proves how hypnotized these people are. The people who die are not even secondary characters. Every character with more than 7 mins of actual screen time(relevant to the scene, not in the background) is still alive.\
The only positive stuff I have to say is, the soundtrack is outstanding I recommend listening to it even if you don't watch it, and that the animation and 3d maneuver gear scenes are spectacular.\

    Listen, I know this is often praised as the best anime ever... but I wasn't totally into it. Don't get me wrong, the story was great and it was done very well overall, it just wasn't my thing. \
I had a difficult time focusing on it while I was watching, for example, because it was so heavy and dramatic. That isn't a bad thing at all, but it was a commitment for me to sit down and watch it. I even dropped it for a while because I stopping making myself watch it.\
Once I was into it, though, it was brilliant. The art style is\
          \
        to die for, the grit of it is amazing, the characters are addictive. I think I just wasn't in the right mindset to watch it at the time. I'd still tell anybody that asked to watch it because it's worth it. It's extremely well thought out as far as worldbuilding goes. I'd say everybody should give it a shot.\

    I've never written a review for an anime before, but I found this anime problematic.\
We see early on the smaller humans were the dominant group. They had grown wealthy by stealing all the resources of Earth to expand their empire. At some point, larger men called \"titans\" or \"eoten\" show up and are quite angry at what has been happening to their resources. Instead of apologizing and correcting their ways, the smaller humans resist changing for the better and adapting to titan culture. Indeed, smaller humans try to kill titans and refuse cooperation with them entirely. Naturally, this gives birth to titan extremist groups who\
          \
        maraud, but this is not representative of all titans.\
The response of the smaller humans is ultimately to build a walled kingdom and become extremely xenophobic to these outsider titans. This is the ideal recruiting tool for titan extremists and only serves to increase the numbers attacking the wealthy smaller humans who refuse to share in their bounty and accept titans as equals. A few of the characters appear to become sympathetic to the titans and even convert to Titanism, but these characters are immediately rejected by their own friends and family as humanity traitors!\
Somehow, we're supposed to believe the smaller humans are the good guys or doing what is best for humanity. This is absurd and I think the author needs to reflect on his insensitivity.\

    Story : Titans took over the world, killing millions of humans, now the rest of humanity is stuck behind walls trying to fight their way back into the world against those same titans. Until a bigger titan than usual appears, destroying a wall and causing humanity to now fight to take the wall back. Following that incident, the 3 main cast of Eren, Mikasa and Armin join military training to help the fight.\
So that's the story set up and everything which happens after that is great. Seriously the story is amazing, it has so much potential depth that is actually getting used, it is really\
          \
        amazing. \
So why the 7 ? While the story is great, the story pacing is quite an annoyance, and I think this is mostly due to the 23min format anime has. You waste 4min for the opening and ending, another 3min to show scenes of the previous episode you probably still remember and that leaves you with 16min of actual new story telling. You just can't accomplish much in that time. Yes, you always want to see more, but you never feel like you made progress after watching an episode and it never feels like it's a good moment to stop watching (unless you reached the end of a complete 6 episode chapter) which makes the watching experience at bit frustrating at times.\
Time itself within the story is weird, it feels way too often like people stand around doing nothing when they really should be doing something (as in they have a plan to execute together, group A does the action they should and group B should join but for whatever reason we watch group A fight alone for 10 minutes while group B waits and talks it over?????). It is infuriating because given the nature of the anime that means most of the time someone dies and that death could have been avoided if  people didn't seem to be suffering from real life ping spikes.\
Art&Sound : Again sound is as usual good, I don't know how an anime could mess up sound at this point anyway. Now the art is a bit of a weird thing. It looks alright, not as \"anime\" as average I'd say, trying to be a bit more realistic but the black outline seems to be quite irregular, sometimes thick as a wall and sometimes really thin, and it is just inconsistent, I couldn't figure out why they would use a bigger outline in X situation but a thin one in Y situation. Not a huge issue by itself but the artstyle overall just doesn't appeal to me. Not gonna lie, I like my things to be pretty and cute and that anime just isn't about pretty and cute things, it is grim and dark and the style serves that purpose in a quite good way.\
Characters : I did not enjoy most of the cast, out of the 30 or so characters you should be able to recognize by the middle of the first season, only 6 I am able to find likable in some way, that core 6 saves the entire show because otherwise I just wouldn't be able to watch it as great as the story is (although the story would be worse without those 6 anyway). It is a very personal opinion in the end but seeing people do stupid stuff because they are purposefully written to be stupid annoys me, same goes for needless whining and people having mental breakdowns after 1 little bump on the road. Don't get me wrong, the show is very dark ; there are plenty of characters who get stupid because of fear, characters who cry for a valid reason and people who's only logical choice would be to breakdown, but a lot of the time it feels forced given the context and just comes out as an annoyance.\
Enjoyment&Overall : It is a good show, a show that will make you want to watch more, granted it is partially because every single damn episode ends on a stupid cliff hanger but also because the show's story is just that good. In the middle of an episode you might end up pulling your hair out because of what characters do or say though.\

    **Spoilers below***\
\
Although no masterpiece, AoT is a show I can recommend to absolutely anyone. With enough good characters and an exciting albeit simple plot, Hajime Isayama fully deserves all the credit he has received for this show.\
Plot - 7/10\
As exciting as the events in the story are, every main complication or plot twist in the story is relatively simple and predictable; the identities of the black haired titan and female titan are painfully obvious to the viewer for the following reasons:\
1. The viewer knows that Eren being the main character must survive somehow, and the titan having the same hair colour as Eren gives the\
          \
        titans identity away.\
2. There are literally 3 female characters in the show with blonde hair; Christa,Annie and Armin (jokes). Christa is seen on the expedition outside the walls where the female titan appeared, and the fact that Annie fought Eren early on in the show made it an even bigger give away. This predictability hurts the female titan arc significantly, since so much of the plot is motivated by uncovering the titans identity.\
With regards to major complications faced by our heroes, the first major battle boiled down to fighting a bunch of mindless monsters and then plugging up a hole in wall rose with a rock. Again, while enjoyable, the plot cannot be praised for being full of creativity. There are however several moments in the show which I felt were clever:\
- Eren's court trial scene was completely unorthodox; I would have never guessed that the best way to save Eren is to have Levi beat the hell out of him in order\
to prove to the military police that Eren is of no threat to humanity if placed under Levi's control.\
- Erwins plan to lure the traitor. Assuming the traitor is a titan-shifter, it is preferable to face the enemy outside of the walls to avoid damage and protect\
civilians lives. Erwin baits the traitor by using Eren and by bluffing that the expedition outside the walls has the goal of reaching the basement which has \
all the answers to the titans. Furthermore additional precautions like lying about Eren's position in the horse formation\
and setting up traps made the plan even better. Although the plan fails miserably, the ideas behind it were interesting and there was a good chance it was going to work.\
- Armin saving Jean by bluffing Eren's death; he says something like \"Avenge the suicidal maniac\". Armin gambles on the female titan being a member of the 104th survey corps, \
and it payed off.\
AoT's main premise is good and the plot overall is satisfying.\
Characters - 8/10\
I get frustrated seing people say that the weakest part of AoT are its characters. I honestly only think that Eren, Mikasa and Annie are disappointing; the rest of cast is great:\
Eren- The character defined by unbreakable will and a short temper. Unforunately his motivations boil down to simple vengeance. I think the show needed to take a psychological\
approach to Eren's character, wherein his motivations and reasons to not give up are well-thought out. \
Mikasa- Just because she's pretty and insanely competent doesn't make her a good character (I'm looking at you WatchMojo). She's a complete angel towards Eren meaning not only is there no interesting conflict between the two, but their relationship is analogous to that of a mother and a helpless child (the helpless child being Eren). Furthermore she has no flaws, leaving no good room for interesting character development.   \
Armin - Easily the best of the main trio, Armin is initially portrayed as the weak character who feels insecure due to having to rely on Eren and Mikasa to protect him. He develops confidence once Mikasa makes him aware of the fact that he in fact saved Eren and Mikasa in the first episode; Armin then goes on to give the best speech in all of season 1. Now a much more confident character, even Jean gives Armin credit by saying something to the effect of \"I was wrong for thinking it was pathetic that you always hung around Eren\".\
Annie - For being the shows main antagonist, she doesn't make for an interesting villain. Her motivations are unfortunately going to be revealed in later seasons. All we are left with is a cynical character who for some unknown reason wants humanity to be destroyed. I wish they had given her more screen time in order to give more depth to her character.\
Now for what I believe are the 3 best characters in season 1:\
Jean- Introduced as the obnoxious, arrogant and jealous character who is only concerned for his own safety; Jean shows the best character development in the entire cast for season 1 of AoT.\
After the death of Marco, his only friend who believed in him, and after taking into consideration Eren's criticism regarding Jean's complete doubt in humans struggle against the titans; he rises up and throws away his pathetic desires to be safe and obtain the beautiful girl (Mikasa), and instead decides that he wont be a disappointment to the ashes of his once best friend. What makes this even more noble is that Jean is the character in the show who realizes the likelihood \
of death more than any other character, and even so he joins the survey core. Courage isn't not feeling fear like Mikasa or Levi. It's feeling fear and doing it anyway. Jean in my view is the most heroic character of season 1, and one of my favourite characters in all of anime.\
Levi- No surprises here. He fits his role in the story perfecty as the captain of the survey core. His obsession with cleaning works well with his character since it is associated with the idea of being disciplined, and it adds to Levi's surprisingly humorous nature. In spite of his rough exterior, he probably cares more for soldiers lives than any other character on the show; this along with his implicit respect for Erwin makes you realize that Levi is far more kind and respectable than you may initially think. His fight against the female titan is the best action sequence in season 1; he lives up to his reputation of being \"Humanities strongest soldier\".\
Hange - The best comedic relief character the show has, although Sasha is very funny as well. Hanges obsession with titans along with her over the top melodramatic reactions make her incredibly funny.  \
Soundtrack. 10/10. People who dislike AoT and label it as overrated, these people still cannot deny how good this score is. Personal favourites include:\
Reluctant Heroes, Counter-attack Mankind, Eren's Berserk theme, AoT main theme, Call your name, eye water.\
Those are my main thoughts, please check out AoT if you have not yet; just don't expect a masterpiece.",

    So, popular as hell shonen anime! How much of this stuff is there around? To be honest, I'm not really a fan. After watching the abysmal Sword Art Online (2012, A1), I decided to not watch shonen anime for a while because well, I just didn't really like overly-epic shows with extremely boring characters. Then I kept hearing about this new \"amazing\" show called Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin for all you Weeaboo's out there who think that that nation of Japan is some kind of God-endorsed heaven). i kept hearing amazing things about the plot, the action and Episode 21. Was it\
          \
        all worth the hype?\
The Plot:\
Humanity has been pushed back to the very brink by beings known as Titans, humanoid creatures who posses no intelligence, are much taller than regular humans, and seem to want nothing but the extinction of the human race. Humanity, in their darkest hour, built three impossibly high walls; Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, in an effort to keep the Titans away from them. For a peaceful period of a hundred years, humanity never found themselves encountering the Titans, minus the members of the Survey Corps., mankind's elite recon group who are trying to find out as much info on the Titans as they can. However, in the year 845, mankind received a grim reminder: We Lived in Fear, of the Titans. Eren-plot-armour-Jaeger, an angsty little twat, witnesses a horrible event on this day, along with his two best friends: Mikasa-I'm-OP-as-fuck- Ackerman and Armin-Typically-Smart-but-Physically-Weak-Arlert. From this day forth, Eren makes it his mission to rid the entire world of the Titans to avenge the tragic events of That Day.\
Personally, I found the plot to be enjoyable for the majority of the show's 25 episodes. We see the hardships humanity faces and the grim reality of the world they live in, being oppressed by a higher being and what-not. It makes for a very \"Walking Dead\" esque situation, where the characters will do whatever they must to survive against their oppressors. We see how depressing life inside these walls, or cages rather, is for their inhabitants. It's a gritty and surreal plot, if not a tad too over-dramatic for it's own good. I just find that some scenes were really drawn out at times, especially the explanation scenes at the start of most of the \"Battle of Trost\" episodes.\
The Characters:\
The characters for the most part are serviceable, but a few of them are tethered down by typical anime clichés. First of all, we have our main protagonist, Eren Jaeger (or if you're a manga weeaboo, Yeager) Eren is an angsty boy who's quite the hothead and has a massive erection for revenge against the Titans. He's an alright character, having his emotional moments and his really awesome bad ass ones too, but then he's literally surrounded by plot armour the moment the fifth episode hits. He's impervious practically. If show's like Clannad (2006, Key) taught me anything, it's that a major characters suddenly leaving isn't a bad thing, but here he just comes back a couple episodes later like it's nothing. Secondly, we have Eren's not girlfriend but still practically yandere in a very strange and subliminal way, Mikasa Ackerman. Mikasa is literally the goddess of badass and awesome (yes I am fanboying WHO GIVES A DAMN I LOVE THIS CHARACTER). She's incredibly strong, rivaling humanity's strongest soldiers even though she's only a Trainee. She's top of her class in both aptitude and physical skill, and she's got nice development over the series (aswell as having one of the series most freaky moments to her name). Finally, to round out the main trio, we have Armin Arlert, who's the typical \"Weak but Smart best friend\" who you see a lot in fiction nowadays. Armin is the crux of almost any situation's outcome, since he's a strategic genius, but this comes at a price of physical strength. He's a decent character who's unfortunately bogged down by his tropé. The rest of the cast is either entertaining (see Levi, Sasha, Jean, Zoe and Connie) or extremely underdeveloped and/or unlikeable (See Annie, Reiner, Petra and Krista). Now, if they're underdeveloped that's mainly because the show hasn't caught up to the Manga yet, but hopefully, the inevitable second season brings more of these characters and their motivations to life.\
The animation:\
It's good. Damn good. For the first work of an anime studio (although the show was partly funded by Production I.G), Studio WIT did an amazing job an the high detailed and stylized world of Attack on Titan. Everything is dark and gritty when it needs to be and lush and colourful when it needs to be. It's almost like pathetic fallacy in a way, because when the mood calls for it, the animation matches it perfectly. It's one of the best studio debuts in a while, and one that's just stunning from beginning to end.\
The soundtrack.\
HOLY HOT DAMN. This soundtrack is the bee's knees. Hiroyuki Sawano pulled out all the stops for this one, composing an epic, bombastic and beautifully cruel soundtrack that's almost too good. it's right up there with Final Fantasy VII and Star Wars in terms of how much I love this soundtrack, it's that good. And then of course, we have the openeng and ending themes. \"Fuerotter Pfeil und Bogen\" (or Guren no Yumiya depending on who you are) is the perfect way to get you into this show. It starts off depressing and then works it's way into an epic song fitting of the show's themes. The Second opening, \"Flugel der Freiheit\" (or Jiyuu no Tsubasa) is a good opening, just not as good as the first in my opinion. it's good, but it's missing something that the first one had. the first ending theme, \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" is fitting of Mikasa's character, and represents her feelings of the world she lives in. The second ending, \"Great Escape\" is just hard rock. fitting, but slightly underwhelming.\
Overall:\
I enjoyed the hell out of this show from start to finish. Sure, it's a bit repetitive hearing about the history of Titans and Mankind's fight against them and hearing about the events of the year 845 over and over again, but it's worth it in the end. With a solid plot, decent characters, amazing sound and animation, Shingeki no Kyojin/Attack on Titan get's a full recommendation from me.\

    This is my very first review, so you should do well to take everything i say with a pinch of salt. I am also unfamiliar with the source material that it's been adapted from, meaning that my review will focus solely on the anime, and more specifically, on the very first ten episodes that have been aired thus far. So, without further ado, let's get to it.\
\"Shingeki No Kyojin\", to me, felt like a breath of fresh air. In a time where most animes are undeserving of their notoriety, this series manages, for the most part, to practice what it preaches. In my experience, truly\
          \
        good animes are not well-received by your everyday anime fanatic. Viewers who long for something more sophisticated, of more depth, and of more substance are quickly disregarded as pretentious snobs, hipsters or people who pretend to gravitate towards lesser known series because it paints them in a more enlightened light. While it's certainly true that such individuals exist, it's also equally true, i find, that the arguments that are otherwise valid when directed in their general direction are now being used to discredit the merit of any opinion that opposes the opinions of those who are content with mediocrity.  Which is why it's refreshing to see that a show such as this one has garnered such interest, and gained popularity within all circles of anime enthusiasts. \
The story is about humanity's struggle for survival, and their attempts to not only prevent their own extinction, but to possibly flourish once again. The show does a competent job at presenting the titan threat as legitimate, ever-present and capable of unleashing true horror. The despair feels very real, as the human inhabitants of this fictional world meet their ends in the most gruesome ways possible. While the gore, blood and semi-graphic nature of the series sometimes feels self-serving, and the carnage at some points is only present for the sake of inciting a reaction from the viewer, it mostly exists as a tool to plunge fear into the hearts of the protagonist and his comrades, discouraging them, and compelling them to shake in their boots with sheer, utter terror. This in turn provides said characters with the right amount of internal conflict, as the narrative forces them into constantly questioning their determination, and brakes their will, while taunting them to regain their composure. There's a certain intensity here that manages to do what it sets out to do: Giving the characters enough reasons to feel conflicted, and the viewer enough reason to care about their predicament. \
Eren, in many ways, in your typical shounen hero. He's confident, sometimes cocky and his will trumps those of his peers. He lacks any astounding attributes, save for his undying determination to achieve his goal. In these aspects, he's a shounen archeype. However, what i liked about Eren was his anger. Most all shounen protagonists are infused with this quality, but their anger gets subdued at some point or another, which is supposed to further evolve the character, lending credence to the notion that anger is a hurdle that needs to be overcome. But not in Eren's case. There's one particular scene when his emotions get the better of him, and he has to be put in his place. But barring that scene, i fail to recall anything that would have hinted at him abandoning his rage. I liked that. I like that the protagonist taps into his anger, and channels it into something greater, giving it redemptive capability. The show realizes that Eren's anger is not innately bad, but it's how he'll use it that counts.\
Side characters are also given a fair amount of attention, as they are put in the limelight, explored, meditated upon and are given a fair amount of screen time. Granted, this is more true of some characters than others.\
The visuals are really impressive. Very flud, consistent and easy on the eyes. The art direction is to my liking, but that is more a matter of personal preference. Nothing else needs to be said in this department. It's awesome.\
The music is highly enjoyable, and shares a great chemistry with the visual style. Great sound.\
All in all, you should give \"Shingeki No Kyojin\" a shot. It stands out among most other popular works of it's kind, and is worthy of the benefit of your doubt, even if you have doubts about it. Give it a go.\

    I think this show was really good, with cliff-hangers at the end of each episode and each episode filled with amazing action and art. The one complaint I have of this show is the character development. They don't give time to get to know the characters, get a feel for them. I found that 80% of the time it was just action and blood and titans and killing. Don't get me wrong, it was really good. It's just that, if it gave more time to know the characters, maybe give a little background history for some of them, and a bit of plot centering around\
          \
        some of the main and main supporting characters, when they died there would be more feels and emotions rather than just, \"oh, another one died.\" It gives more character depth and a feel for the show, more than just brutal killing. I have to admit, the plot was good and it went at a quite fast pace, but in between all that there should be time to pause and look around. We don't know much about the history of humans with titans, and a time before that (well, as far as i can tell since i didn't read the manga). And can i admit? I don't know 3/4 of the character's names in the anime, and believe me, i can remember a character's name quite well. The ones in Shingeki no Kyojin don't seem to stick however, because the way i remember a character and how i like a character is through their personality, their past..etc. and not just their looks. I don't remember the names of characters in this anime because i dont see much character development or anything, and the supporting characters are barely supportive. they just die, in my opinion, without ever getting to know them. I can understand why people like it, and maybe it's just me, but i like more depth into an anime rather than action action action. other than that, the anime is quite good. the music and art is unique and its storyline is eyecatching and addictive :)\

    Sometimes there is an anime that garners so much hype and attention that it completely eclipses all other anime that are released during the year. These rare occasions usually mean that it’s popular in the west before being localized and usually means that even people who aren’t big into anime may have already heard about it. Honestly, I was kinda dreading watching this show, mostly because of all of the hype surrounding it, because you know what they say. The bigger the hype, the harder they fall. Now, does it live up to all of the hype, you ask? Well…to some extent. \
Overall, Attack on\
          \
        Titan does a lot of things right, with its great animation, fascinating plot twists and tragic and realistic characters. Through observing them, we learn from Aren that a man who gives up freedom for security deserves neither, we learn from Mikasa that the world can be cruel and usually boils down to kill or be killed and Armin lets us know that people who are unable to abandon anything will likely fail to produce any change. Although the lackluster ending and large amount of deaths kind of drag the show down. All in all, I feel like the overall message that Attack on Titan is trying to convey is that we shouldn’t take our life, our world, for granted. The people in Attack on Titan have never seen glaciers, or deserts or anything outside of their walls and these are things that we take for granted everyday, the real beauty of our world.  \
I give it an 8/10.\

    Shinkgeki no Kyojin or Attack on Titan in english, is probably one of the most hyped up shows that exist.  At first, I actually didn't want to watch this due to the amount of fandom and recommendations I got from other people on it.  But, after much persuasion, I finally watched it.  \
Story: For those of you who don't know, (I doubt anybody on this site hasn't at least heard of this anime), SNK is about a fight between humanity and these creatures known as titans.  A.K.A. Giant, stupid, naked, deformed people.  Driven to the near brink of extinction, humanity\
          \
        has built 3 walls in order to protect the remaining people of the world.  The story follows Eren Jaeger who becomes a soldier in the army, resulting in many experiences that any normal person would consider to be a traumatizing experience.  Now, I thought that the story format of this anime deserved attention and worth looking into.  The way SNK is formatted, is in a sense, like a movie.  The story is built around 5 or so arcs with a few \"non-exciting\" episodes in between.  Meaning that the whole atmosphere changes into a more somber sort of setting.  Each episode ALWAYS ends with a cliffhanger, adding onto the hype that this show has.  Each arc is sort of like a movie, and if you are a marathoner like me, then you would understand how it could be thought of like that.  \
Characters: Because there are SO many characters in SNK, I'm only going to review a handful of them.  (Sorry if I don't mention your favorite character).  First off, we have the main character, Eren.  After the tragedy in the first episode, Eren develops an angry and hostile mindset that because rather stereotypical.  His main goal really is to, \"KILL THE TITANS!  KILL THE TITANS!\"  Although his mindset does change later on in the series due to influences from other people, he really just changes right back to his killing instinct which becomes a bit of a let down in terms of character development.  Next, we have Mikasa.  As the main female in the series, Mikasa is Eren's adopted sister and teammate.  Though she truly is a badass at using the 3-D maneuver gear, her character is in need of help.  Throughout the whole series, Mikasa really doesn't do anything for her sake.  Everything she does is for Eren, Eren, Eren without any second thought.  Because of this, I feel sad to see such a good character result in something else.  Next, Armin.  As the most useless character in terms of fighting, Armin is Eren and Mikasa's childhood friend.  Throughout the whole series, he has shown many great deduction skills and planning.  His fighting style is to be questioned.  Armin has to be one of the most pathetic characters in this series due to his inability to really do anything right in terms of fighting, leading people to think \"how the hell did this kid graduate?\"  But, it should be good to note that later in the series, Armin creates a quote that becomes very apparent and important in the rest of series.  Next, Jean.  In terms of character development, the other 3 fall somewhat flat.  Jean however, has been given a great deal.  After numerous events that I will not mention due to spoilers, Jean starts to wonder what he really was working towards, ultimately changing himself to be more of an interesting character.   Next, the badass tornado spinning Jedi, Levi.  (hey, that rhymes.)  As the cold-blooded person in the series, Levi is undoubtedly one of the coolest characters to look at.  Though his past isn't too looked into, (they sort of explain it in 1 scene), Levi provides a great deal of guidance to his comrades and becomes sort of true to Armin's quote.   Other characters in this anime include the rest of the \"main cast\", including Christa, Connie (it's a guy btw), Sasha (my personal favorite), and Reiner.  In the future, I hope that these characters become more prominent as their characters have quite a bit of potential that is worth looking into.  \
Art and Sound: For art in this anime, the style in which it's made in is something I would call, black outline.  For many scenes in the series, the characters get a sort of bold black outline which is a very interesting way of drawing it.  One thing that can be noted about character design, is the massive amount of muscle detail that is on the colossal titan and female titan.  When you look at it, it's incredibly well done because they replicate the human body's muscle structure so well.  The scenery that the story takes place in is definitely a plus due to the amount of detail that they put into it.  And finally, everyone's favorite part, the action scenes.  Because of the 3-d maneuver  gear they use in the anime, the action scenes become a sight to behold.  The fluidity of the animation is very top notch and in a way, almost too fast for the human eye to see.  The way the characters use the gear is to their own style and is reflected upon how beautiful the scenes are when they fight.  For sound, well, it's awesome.  The energy and tone from both openings are very up there and become stand out tracks all together.  Sad to say, I barely watched the ending songs because I was too excited to watch the next episode.  Sorry about that.  \
Personal enjoyment: Whenever a hyped show like this comes along, I always sort of push it to the side, and for good reason.  Whenever a show like this comes up, it usually get ridiculed with side stories and eventually, bad execution of the anime itself.  For me personally, the best animes aren't even more then 25 episodes.  But, when I started watching this, I did, as all people who watch this, get gripped into humanity's fight for survival.  While yes, some of the characters fell flat, the overall anime itself was very good in its execution, showing how humanity has changed due to the titan threat.  Some examples are how the military police act compared to the survey corps, and the implementation of wallists, who are people who worship the walls as gods.  (I find that extremely weird.)  As a personal complaint, the anime killed off too many good characters that have potential.  There were a number of good people that had a lot of potential who were killed off too fast, resulting in well, feels.  I'm not too keen on horror animes as I usually don't enjoy them as much as I want to due to the deaths that occur.  Overall, while the gore was a little excessive I give this a 9/10 because the execution was very well rounded in almost all categories, and hope that the next season comes out before all the fans travel to Japan with 3-d maneuver gears in hand and demand the next season to come out within the next 5 minutes.  Also, anybody else creeped out that there is an Eren x Levi ship?  \

     Oh Shingeki no Kyojin.....how I loved you from the very start. This anime had me completely hooked since the first episode. I fell in love with everything about it, from the incredible animation, to breathtaking soundtrack to even the characters. Even though some of the characters were a bit lacking and didn't have  much development, you still cheer them on and don't want to see members of the squad die. It was an awesome series.\
 Having said that, my opinion on the series as a whole has drastically changed. The anime did a great job at following the series's source material, but I\
          \
        feel like the anime is better as something to regard as a stand alone thing. Like most people after the finale I decided to start reading the manga where the season leaves off. I won't post any spoilers, but it honestly feels like it does a complete U-turn into utter stupidity. They took such a cool and awesome idea and just bring it into the worst place possible. With the manga suppose to be only 20 volumes  it's expected to the end in about a year or so. With the chances of a second season of the anime maybe being the year after that. Those who are looking forward to it, I wouldn't hold my breath. It will most likely leave a bitter, sour taste of ash in your mouth and taint a series you once thought you loved. \
 I thought this season was great and honestly the soundtrack is what makes it. Enjoy it for what it is but don't expect much more. If they ever get around to making a second season, that's cool but in my opinion I feel that it is better left off as it is. It will get you hooked but then lead you into heartbreak and despair if you read what goes on after it ends. That's just my opinion, the opinion of a fan who feels betrayed.\

The first episode is really a mar mite episode, once your hooked onto it you will not get enough of it and that is exactly what happened to me. I was hooked to this from the very first episode and still enjoy re-watching it today. i loved the art style and the music in this, the eyes were just so perfect, i felt like i was just staring into each of the characters eyes and being hypnotized into\

        watching it. Also there were so many twist and turns i could keep up some of the time, but it keeps the story going and makes the viewer like \"that was awesome\". \
I mean it wasn't perfect obviously, the thing that i felt like it let down on was the story. there wasn't that much of the other characters back story's and i really wanted to see that. but you never know that might be in the next season which i cannot wait for.\

    Shingeki no Kyoujin is an awesome anime. Each episode has at least a few scenes of action and drama, so you'll almost always be on the edge of your seat. Usually I'd get bored of the drama, only sometimes though, in some anime and I wouldn't get to attached to some supporting characters. But this one really makes me want to cry for each supporting character and I'm male. Sympathy is only one of this anime's greatest weapons, it also has amazing action scenes. Anyway, this anime is really awesome, each episode has a cliff-hanger ending as well. It really delves into the beauty and\

    SHINGEKI NO KYOJIN: The lack of plot armour renders this show incredibly realistic\
The first thing that captured my attention is the animation. The art style is crisp and incredibly detailed. The characters are outlined with a thick black stroke, separating them from the background. The style overall is very refreshing. But animation and style are not the only good things about this anime. There are more!\
I’m very impressed on the writing of Shingeki no Kyojin. Yes, the first episode is quite slow, for it dumps information relevant for world building. But what I like about these information is the fact that they are not just\
          \
        used to establish the world. They have also set the tone of the show. They have successfully portrayed a sense of immediate danger. But after this information dump, which covers practically the first half of the first episode, the show is a rollercoaster ride. It has also successfully triggered an emotional reaction right in the end of the first episode, and that is really impressive.\
This rollercoaster ride is consistent up to the end of the first major arc, which is about ten episodes or so. The story slows down again to make room for another series of world building and character development. Then it dashes again for a thrilling ride. That’s basically the pattern of the storytelling. It is very rhythmic, and it delivers the things it has to deliver in its current rhythm.\
What makes the major arcs very thrilling is the fact that the characters don’t have plot armour, meaning that they could actually die even though it would prove to be inconvenient for the author. This is the very reason why the major arcs are very compelling. The viewers just don’t have an idea who will survive or die, and how the survivors will react to the situation brought upon by the deaths of their comrades. This tends to result to shocking sequences, and it opens the characters to development.\
Speaking of characters, Shingeki no Kyojin has a lot to offer. The primary characters, Eren Jaeger, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert, have very harmonic personalities. They blend well together. The secondary characters, even though they are not dissected enough, are not bland. They have their own unique qualities, and sometimes they could even get to the point that the viewers will gain favouritism. This favouritism is one of the reasons why the deaths of these characters become even more shocking. I must say that the lack of plot armour and the creation of interesting characters are a good combination.\
Another good thing about Shingeki no Kyojin is how it embeds music to its scenes. The soundtracks are perfectly suited to the emotion they want to portray. The sense of desperation is heightened when necessary. The drama is intensified when necessary. The action is more hyped when necessary.\
Since I just mentioned action, let me add that the action sequences of Shingeki no Kyojin is top-notch. The scenes where the characters use their manoeuvre gears are animated extremely well, and it is surprisingly consistent all throughout the series.\
Overall, Shingeki no Kyojin is one of those amazing, almost-perfect anime titles that come out once in a while. With an interesting story, decent character development, superb music and animation, it is one of those titles that will be sensationalized. But does Shingeki no Kyojin deserve the hype it gets? It definitely does. But as much as I like the series, I still couldn’t give it a perfect score. Like I said earlier, there are certain parts that seem to slow down the plot development. Aside from that, the story is not entirely finished, so a full judgment can’t really be made regarding it. The only thing I could do now is to wait for the next season, and once the whole story is already told, then a full judgment could finally be made. But as far as this season goes, it is amazing. I recommend this anime to those who love tragic stories. They’re in for a rollercoaster ride!",

        to it, but it got to around episode 5 where the whole episode was filler.  I know that anime's are good when they add suspense but for me this really killed it for me ex.(All talk one fight scene at the end for 1 minute).  For some episodes the whole entire episode felt just dragged out and there was no development in the story.  Now that being said when I hit around episode 13 the development took off and progressed very rapidly which was a nice thing since i watched bout seven episodes of what seemed to be no progression.  Now I am currently at episode 25 and just finished watching 24 and overall the series in was great in my opinion.  In all honest this was one of those anime's that I hate to have to wait for it to air since the progression at some points were extremely slow.\
So recap:  Art, sound, overall enjoyment has to be a 9/10.  If you like Guilty Crown, and SAO I highly recommended this anime, but if not then I would stay away or give it a chance.  Well I hope this review helped sorry its pretty crappy since its my first one but I hope you will enjoy this show as much a I did.\

    Amazing.. just simply amazing.\
This kind of story (just by the first impression of the synopsis) doesn't exactly fall into my enjoyment list, but I am SO glad I have it a go. This anime has changed my life. The story, itself, is very creative and interesting. I am very fascinated and curious of all the mysterious hidden in the story. In my opinion, the art is average, BUT the action sequences leave me breathless! The movement of the characters and action choreography is AMAZING. Many complex, mysterious characters that work very well together. I absolutely enjoyed this anime! I am praying for more seasons!!!\

    So this is my first review and I haven't watch that much yet, and I'm currently on episode 6.\
I wanted to write a review is because there are some who dont enjoy it and some who love it and I want to talk about both point of view so yer if you don't want to read its fine and I'm just say my opinion so don't get mad. :B\
Ok I agree on some people who didn't like the characters' personality,  the character are a little unrealistic  and how there's no other color haired beside black, brown, and a few blondes but other that\
          \
        I think the character are ok. Also the anime was a bit too fast paced but I guess I can't really complain since it has only 25 episode but I think if it slows down it would have made a little more entertaining and we could have understand the characters feeling a little bit more. Oh! and just thinking about giant eating is a bit terrifying... -.-\"\
So what I like about this anime was the animation, the art, sound, and the story/plot. I know some said it wasn't original but I thought it was a different and special kinda thing it just felt like an unbelievable story it was just interesting it kinda pulled me into the story and the time it took place was good time!\
Yep that's all I have to say as of right now. So, if you like that bit of terrifying/horror, some action and good art anime I recommend this anime for you! It's not to long so that you have to catch up on it and watching it is quite exciting. Also when watching think about what would you do if you were in the anime!?\

    First time I write an anime review, let's get bitter! *sips Jägermeister* (Get it?)\
This is probably one of the most hyped up animes to come across, and it becomes easy to see why with an anlytical mindset.\
With it's story being quite frankly piss poor and its characters not really memorable. What you remember after watching is the image of Eren standing on the wall above, saluting with his unshakable determination painted all over his face.\
\"I swear I will kill all the titans!\"\
At alot of points this show is painfully bad, especially the dreadful and drawn out story arc with the female titan (no spoiler). You'll\
          \
        go through alot of yelling screaming and misery watching this show. It often seems like they cant speak their sentences without it being at the top of their lungs.\
Alot of the criticism of this show is pointing out that it's just depressing and nothing but misery at every turn. They're absolutely right. And witht hat being maybe the show's greatest weakness it's its strength, as victories become incredibly sweet! It's motivating in every fiber when tables turn and our heroes quite literally punch back.\
The art style is unique but kind of hit & miss, and oh I hope you like brown... The colour scheme is not particularly varied.\
The best thing though, is the phenomenal soundtrack. This soundtrack is some interesting mix of rock, orchestration and actually dubstep-like beats with occasional aesthetics of German folk music. It is REALLY unique. It's sometimes utilized awkwardly for some scenes, but I do think the soundtrack is what impacts fans so heavily even if they don't realize it.\
Just watch the first opening and tell me you don't get shivers. It's so incredibly empowering.\
There's alot of flashback scenes and re-used frames, with filler on top of that, and the actual progression lies in the cliffhanger of every episode's ending. But it's all worth it for that ending fight. Trust me. If you've ever felt like you had alot of aggressions to unleash, you'll relate to the absolute fury that is the ending fight.\
That's what this show does. It breaks you down and builds you up again with such great motivation.\
So all in all the premise is so simple, the story redundant, characters meh. Sounds like it must suck then right? No.\
This show is strongest in visual and auditorial aspects and most importantly its almost symbolic nature. It captures the very essence of honor in a salute, and standing strong with your fellow soldier.\
It's all about amplifying your understanding of strength, determination and spirit. I do believe there's significant value in that, and as such I most definitely can recommend Shingeki no Kyojin.\
\"Keep your weapons aimed. Here comes the chilling face pushing down your fear\" ~Track 08 \"DOA\" of the official soundtrack.\

    I admit, I don't usually watch these types of anime, with all the blood and everything. But I have to say I really enjoyed watching SnK, because even though the first episode gave me goosebumps, it's the type of anime that makes you want to keep watching.\
Story: 8/10\
I like how it's about titans, or giants, which I don't see a lot in anime. That by itself was interesting enough, but then there's the group that fights against the titans. The technology they use seems really advanced, considering the year the story is set in (800's). And then you see the main character's father telling him\
          \
        something in his dreams and it gives it a really mysterious feeling, which also adds to the excitement and makes you want to watch more.\
Art: 9/10\
The art is more realistic than most anime, but not even close to real life. It has a lot of dimension and detail, especially the backgrounds. It's cool to watch all the soldiers jump through the houses with special gear because it's really good quality for the art. The only down side is that the characters are really thickly outlined, which kind of makes it look weird. I think someone mentioned this in a different review.\
Sound: 10/10\
There aren't really any problems with the sound. The character voices fit well and nothing else is wrong. No complaints.\
Character: 9/10\
The characters are each individually unique, and they fulfill their purpose. There are some parts that are like a typical ordinary-kid-turns-into-hero anime but also some unexpected things the characters do. I don't really have anything to say about this section, but no complaints either.\
Enjoyment: 9/10\
I have to give this section a 9 because of my own personal problems, because I'm not good with anything creepy or has parts with really defined killing, so I admit while I was watching I was curled up in a ball hugging a pillow getting goosebumps when I saw an arm drop from a giant's mouth. But even then, I still think this is one of the most exciting anime I've ever seen. It thoroughly shows each character's past, which then transforms into their reason for fighting, and I just wanted to see what would happen amidst all the excitement.\
Overall: 9/10\
It's a really interesting anime that will surely keep you hanging on the edge of your seat.\

    \"You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too. To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity\" - Eren Jaeger A quote that can be interpreted by many ways.\
\
Ah, Shingeki no Kyojin, there's not much to say about it that hasn't been said yet. So I've been thinking twice writing this review. Oh well, you can already tell I've chose writing. Anyway, Shingeki no Kyojin, Attack on Titan, SnK, was a successful series in every aspect. I can safely say that SnK is the best series YET that came out this year.\
Mankind's biggest threat on their very existence has\
          \
        emerged. The Titans, these beings can annihilate every single human. Humans tried retaliate against these monsters, but the difference in power was quite huge. Resulting in humans losing against the Titans. Humans who survived against the Titans made three walls enough to protect them against the monsters driving them to extinction. At last, humans succeeded on defending themselves. And for the last 100 years, the walls they made protected them from the Titans. Until one fated day, where a mysterious colossal Titan appeared out of nowhere and destroyed one of the walls. Claiming the place where humans are living. Once again, humans were on the verge of extinction. Survivors on the attack on Wall Maria where forced to retreat inside the inner walls to protect them. Eren Jaeger, one of the survivors on the attack on Wall Maria, swore vengeance against the Titans who took her mother's life along with the inhabitants of Wall Maria. As if you didn't know what SnK is about. Well that's basically the gist of it. SnK is a lot dramatic than most of action series these days. I couldn't find any flaws on the story. At first, I honestly thought that SnK was overrated, and now I hate myself for doing that(actually you can resent me for doing that.).\
One of SnK's priced things to brag about is it's art. The action scenes were perfect as Mikasa's body. Kidding aside, it was really good. I bet most of the action series that came out this year couldn't compete with SnK's art. Can you imagine all of the hard work they've put on those action scenes with the usage of insanely perfect CG's. SnK's art was definitely not made half-assedly, that I'm sure of.\
Music are always vital on every series. And once again, SnK delivered another achievement. Its music was fantastic! They had two opening themes that emphasized the series' action packed storyline. The ending themes were quite good too, but the one thing that really got my attention was the music being played during the show when something bad, good, ominous thing is going to happen.\
One of the things that stood out too was SnK's characters, and why is that? Try searching SnK on google, you'll be surpised on how many SnK characters were made into memes. One of the reasons they were made into memes were because of their own unique characteristics which separates them from your stereotype characters on a half-assed action series. SnK's characters compliments each one. Too bad, even if they have one of the best unique personality in a series, usually they die in an action series. Even a one-episode-character is fully drawn, what I mean is, even if he's just gonna be on air for 10 seconds he'd be quitely drawn good too. Shows you how they've put a lot of work in the art department.\
Naturally, if you like the series, it automatically means you enjoyed it. Right? And yes, that's the case for me. I've never enjoyed a series like this once in a while. The 25 weeks I've waited for SnK was worth every damn second. If you're looking for a series that would be worth every second, I recommend SnK HIGHLY.\
For my final thoughts on this high-all-praising review I made. SnK is like a shiny pokemon; it hardly comes out, and when it does, ITS EFFING AWESOME. I had to rape the caps on that one, I had to. This review will prolly end up as a sugarcoating review. Well can you blame me? Blame SnK for having that level of awesomeness, but I'm sure there still a lot that wouldn't be pleased on how the series turned out. The important thing is: SnK really captured me. SnK deserves a perfect 10 for me. It deseves all of it. Period. Warning : Avoid being spoiled on what the series would turn into. A bigger warning : AVOID BROWSING A RANDOM MEME SITE, you'll be surprised on how many spoilers you can encounter there. Their like zubat on an effing cave. They come infinity in numbers. My all-praise-highly unregarded-review comes to an end! Careful not to get eaten you rascals!\

    I've learned to run as if a Titan is chasing you.\
In all seriousness, A very good anime. Unfinished of course (I'll probably start the manga) but great so far. It's just... epic. Like they epic-aly dramatize everything which is not necessarily a bad thing, but by episode 16ish it got kinda old.\
I'm a bit disappointed in the character development. All characters started out promising but most ended up worse off than when the story started.\
Eren stayed the same desperate kid if not got more childish.\
Misaka started out a cool beauty but by the last episode became a borderline yandere (creepy).\
Sasha was weird and awesome but\
          \
        ended up a crying half the time.\
The one's who actually evolved;\
Armin the hottest girl in the series. Suddenly becomes level headed.\
Jean started out a selfish brat but becomes a compassionate leader. Awesome.\
Krista is Krista. (-w-)\
Oh but Levi is a sexy beast.\
Anyhow, there was also one scene that bugged me, when Eren was biting his hand to trigger his magical girl powers. That was just necessary. Like augh... I understand sacrifice, but at this point it was just gore for the sake of gore which is one of my problems with this anime. Like killing off all four of the elite survey corps in one episode. Why. \
All in all, this anime did explore the dark side of humanity in a way that was entertaining to watch. Honestly most of the world would react how people in this anime is portrayed though we like to deny it. The art was great. So frikin detailed, epic music, unique fight scenes. The pacing got thrown off towards the middle but otherwise my only problem is I wanted more...\
To the manga then~! (^w^)\

    Shingeki no Kyouji, or Attack on Titan, was a surprise, and a pleasant one.  Like a finely crafted piece of art, AoT knows exactly how to tickle your funny bone and then give it a hard whack with a blunt object.  The premise of the show is set in within a post-apocalyptic world where humanity, though living quite comfortably within the confines of their city, are essentially self-imposed prisoners.  The \"titans\", humanoid beings of immense proportions who run around all jolly and naked as sunshine while popping people like popcorn, have brought humanity to the brink of extinction.  It is essentially\
          \
        a story of survival and what would people do under extreme circumstances.\
What impressed me was the way the anime was crafted.  I've read many detractors to the anime who wonder why everyone is giving it such a high score, and whining about the over-hyped low quality of the overall plot and characters.  But I think the naysayers are forgetting a few key points.  One, its a shounen anime - that is, it's targeted toward young males.  Not to say females, or indeed males of any age wouldn't enjoy this series, but the genre dictates the tropes.  The shounen will have a male lead, it will have a romantic interest, it will be high on action and low on character development (sometimes to the point of simplicity).  But that's the shounen genre.  So if you choose to watch it, watch it with that in mind.  The action sequences are great, and to be honest, though the plot is hammered by some as being unoriginal, I thought the way they revealed certain mysteries relating to the situation was intriguing and certainly kept you wanting to watch more.\
AoT is able to create a very immersive environment.  The music, the almost flawless animation, the intense moments where you see human beings callously being gobbled like a fat cop would plough into a doughnut, then lick his fingers without another thought, all these elements hit home, and they hit home in an effective manner.  The contrast of these almost comical giant people, naked, smiling with glee and their freedom and their nudity, run around with huge grins all the while smearing the cobblestones with blood - the contrast of comedy and horror is very effective.\
The music is another highlight of this anime.  Most of the time I don't notice the music all that much, except when it's out of place with the mood of the scene and therefore intrudes upon my consciousness like the quiet yet insidious buzz of the mosquito around your ear.  AoT music stood out but for all the right reasons.  Combined with the fantastic action sequences and the way the various scenes of wanton brutality play on your heart strings, it is able to move your emotions around at will.\
To give the series the honesty it deserves, one does need to acknowledge the weakness of the series.  Firstly, although the anime is fantastically animated, and the action sequences are really very impressive, the series also uses a lot of still shots.  These will be clear to the viewer.  It'll come across as a little odd at first.  However, the series really does make up for this flaw.  The overall pace is excellent and I found every episode the plot advanced to a satisfying degree.\
The characters.  They're somewhat simple.  I honestly find it annoying when weak characters are voiced by women with high pitched voices.  I think it's unnecessary, and at times certain characters even look like young girls, though they're meant to be men.  Maybe it's a japanese thing.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me, but I found it distracting.  And the characters aren't all that deep.  I mean, they have unique characteristics, they're well drawn and easily distinguishable, but these characteristics are very simple, juvenile almost, to the point where the viewer doesn't really care all that much.  It can niggle away like an annoying gnat during the parts that hold your attention the least.  Mikasa's obsession with the protagonist, though explained through backstory, is a tad over the top.\
However, having said this, this isn't a character driven plot.  The plot is really driven by the events and action.  You could replace the main characters with any of the lesser ones, and you'd still get the same result.  There really isn't anything special about them.  Perhaps that irks some people.  I actually think it's done intentionally as a plot device and as another way to manipulate the emotions as a fiddler does with his fiddle.  We're meant to wonder what it would be like if we were in their shoes.  One can complain about the lack of depth with characterisation, but ultimately it's irrelevant.  If you want a really deep, meaningful, creative and arty-farty anime, then this is not it.  If you want something entertaining, action packed, extremely well executed and an overall polished production, that is the cream of a very bland and uninspired shounen crop, this is it\
Enjoy.\

    Before I start praising this series, let's look at negatives first.\
For one, if you do not plan to read manga afterwards, don't bother. If season 2 is ever to come, then only in about 2-3 years. And even then you'll end up waiting for another season to conclude the story.\
Isayama plans to have around 80-100 chapters over all. This season only covered 33-34 chapters. If you do the maths, you can see how many seasons are needed to see this story finished.\
Instead of getting answers, you'll end up with more question by the end of this season.\
You will also end up with half developed cast\
          \
        because there are so many characters and not all of them get to shine this season what can make anime watchers go \"Why were they even needed?\"\
Answers is simple \"They are, but not in this season\". \
I honestly believe that this series would benefit far more by having one big season as FMA. If FMA was done in this fashion, we would have pretty much same problem. \
Another problem could be slightly dragged story. While it is engaging, there are times when you wish the pace would pick up and get down to business already.\
What also puts off are thick lines around characters what makes them really stand out from the backgrounds. Sometimes it looks great but other times you just go \"No\".\
\
Having said that, let's look at positives now.\
The cast that did get developed this season is entertaining and characters of the main focus got time to shine and develop.\
A typical crybaby turned into powerful manipulator and liar.\
Egoist started to care.\
Unimportant character is important.\
And so on.\
Not a single character is white or black, each one is different shade of grey. Some are darker and some are lighter. Never the same.\
While Shingeki does keep a lot of shounen stereotypes, it also destroys most of them. And I mean DESTROYS!\
Tired of characters never dying like in Bleach? This is for you.\
Tired of \"friendship power wins everything\"? This is for you.\
Series also have some great and memorable soundtracks and action scenes with 3D gear are beautiful.\
Titans will make chills run down your spine while others will make you go \"WTF?\". Yeh, their designs are just that unique. You are either creped out or laugh out loud.\
While slowly, story keeps progressing. With every new answer, we get new question and with every new question we get closer to the truth.\
While some scene might seem pointless, they actually contain lots of clues and once you re-watch it you go \"How could I miss it?!\". So do pay attention.\
I personally enjoyed series a lot, the mystery of the world and titans are fascinating, characters are engaging and action is amazing.\
Originally I planned to give this series 9 but after several last episodes it had to go down to 8.\
Main reason is that anime team skipped some of the manga scenes which made events at the end confusing. \
Because of the added filler material, some scenes were handled differently and I just did not like it. For one, they completely destroyed Eren's development as a character. \
In manga he seemed to learn and develop while here he basically went to square one.\
So yeh, if you plan to read manga later on, definitely watch this!\
If no, better don't bother or you might end up with bitter taste in your mouth. \

    Shingeki no Kyojin is based on a manga by Isayama Hajime.it got adapted by Production I.G after their great adaptation of Kuroko no baske.both are among the Hyped ones in their own seasons and fortunately they both deserve it to some extent.some may rise against the hype and some of them have the rights to cause neither this or KnB are the masterpiece some claims they are but both are among great works in the industry and deserves some of the praises they get.\
The story is about a time when humanity is surrounded by titans and forced to cage itself in big walls for protection.one\
          \
        day though after years of peace a mysterious colossal titan appears out of nowhere and attacks the humanity and their walls leading many titans inside the walls.this attack leads to an event that sets our protagonist on a revenge journey so he joins an elite group tasked to fight with the titans.that is not all of the story however and it looks good already and it also has another side.the mystery side.at the same time there are also things happening in the story that you will realize later and there are some good hints implemented about them in some parts for mystery fans.as good as the story is it is far from masterpiece though.for example Eren’s squad is filled with the key people for the future events which isn’t very realistic but still overall SnK has a very good story with good presentation although keeping it up till the end is gonna be hard.\
While the story has many supporting characters sadly only a few of them are realistic.Eren the protagonist is your typical hot-headed naive brat which only do things with courage and his temper although I still like naïve characters that get to taste cruel things and grow up because of it but I don’t really support one dimensional angry kids…Mikasa is a girl that because of her hard past is apparently very powerful now and is perfect in many ways and through out the series everyone praises her until your ear bleeds. sadly having a hard past is hardly an excuse for being powerful since surely she is not the only one that suffered during those times but the creator wanted to have a powerful heroine so there you have it.at least the mangaka didn’t try to make her a beauty queen as well although in the anime they beautified everyone cause that’s a rule in animations it seems.she also doesn’t have any goal in her life so she just follows Eren cause she owes him(maybe there is a mysterious reason for that too beside her debt to eren since SnK love mystery)..sadly in the industry there is no middle ground for most of female characters,they are either too strong or too weak unless they are villains and in that case they only get good when the plot needs them to…on the other hand we have Armin,Eren’s friend that lacks the perfection and confidence but is actually a better character than both of them while ironically is not as popular and the reason for him being better is simple because he has better development through out the story and he is more real.the good thing about the three of em is that Eren is not the only one that steals the glories and the three of them helps and influence each other again and again and none of the three are useless which is a fact that I love about SnK.unfortunately the rest of the cast are usually titan food and are used for shock values except those that are important to the plot and most of them aren’t well developed although I can see their appeal for example Levi being among the strongest or Sasha being cute while hungry and weak and trying to be strong but still those doesn’t count as huge development or characterization although it is not that there is zero development here for example Jean’s growth can be easily seen through out the story or Sasha getting stronger a little later.also the characters are saved by the story and the dialogues for example I enjoy most of Reiner’s dialogues and actions cause its all misleading but at the same time it is not aiming to deceive the audience that much and its mostly aimed for deceiving the characters.you may think with yourself that screw development but sadly in these kind of stories which swing a death hammer on characters often knowing about some of them can make us care more about their death.it is true that the characters inside the story doesn’t need to know about them but the audience of the anime should know otherwise it turns into Danganroppa: The Animation.\
As I said shock value plays a big part in the series that sometimes works but not always.the first reason is as mentioned above lack of development.the second is some forced ones like the first scene with the survey corp which tries to show how helpless the humans are but just doesn’t have the impact it is meant to have although it is just my opinion on the matter…also sadly being branded as shounen you will see many adults being useless or stupid while kids doing the works but since 3D gear is probably better for young ones you can justify them doing some of the fights or doing it better at least.\
The art and character designs are sorta faithful to the manga but not that much which can be both good and bad since it effects presentation for example Misaka’s character in manga is presented better because of the dark impressions she gives in the manga while in the anime she is just a pretty face for viewer’s sake(first ED’s art can be considered closest to the manga’s art and design).on the other hand they did well with little details that weren’t included in the manga’s art to make it look better.while the production value is high and the animation is good when it is needs to be in some episodes you can easily see them saving budgets for big events so don’t get discouraged by those episodes although sadly many episodes feature long recap of previous events so you can be discouraged by that :D.but a good visual is not the only thing that this anime has.epic music was very helpful to the mood of the series specially with the good opening song that can give you a first impression of what kind of music you are gonna deal with through out the series.the voice acting is also strong although it cannot be considered a challenge for trained VAs.\
Overall the team actually put a lot of effort into this anime it is not just some random high budget one and since the material was good to begin with they managed to succeed once again so don’t be fooled by haters and give this a try if you like action genre.lets hope they continue with another season when they got enough material.also I gave this 8.5/10 but sadly MAL’s scoring system is flawed so it turns into 8/10 here.\

    I couldnt be bothered to write reviews for all the animes I've loved simply because the reviews on this website were so level headed. With Shingeki no Kyogin its all over the place.\
This anime deserves all the praise it gets. Its got absolutely fantastic animation and art, and the sound is above average in every regard. The anime is head and shoulders above everything released this season. But it isnt the art, sound, soul or tempo that makes this anime amazing. Its the unpredictability.\
There is shock after shock. Genuine ones. The characters are given more love than screen time and the anime genuinely grips you.\

        You feel the way they feel. You feel part of a system. Its not because its the best story, premise or situation. Its not even character development. Its the simplest formula, you're given something and then its taken away. You want more. You're given more only for it to be taken away. The anime was slow at times, but it kept moving forward. It is worth investing your time in. Watch the first 6 episodes and you'll get an idea that this isnt your normal run of the mill shonen.\

    - English Review (Translated version)\
I decided to see \"Shingeki no Kyojin\" (perhaps a little late because it was released years ago), due to its good reputation and the great attention among anime fanbase. And trully I don't regret it, because it has fulfilled the expectations.\
The story is interesting, it starts from a premise gives place to a dystopian future where humanity is threatened. But apart from this good base, they get to spin a solid argument with surprises and script turns that plunge you into that need to see the next episode to continue knowing details.\
With everything and obviously because it is a first season\
          \
        that has/will have sequel, the story is not completely finished (not to say that it basically remains definitely open) and we must wait to see the second season and know what will happen to Mikasa, Eren, Armin and company.\
Speaking of characters, this may be one of the strengths and, at the same time, weaknesses of the series. I am going to explain this. There are a lot of characters, many, and that's a good thing in the sense of the variety of personalities and style is obvious, which gives dynamism to development. But it is also a problem because there are a few potentially interesting characters (for example Reiner or Sasha, alias the potato girl) who we could see only in a couple of scenes where the personal growth couldn't be seen, precisely because it is impossible give development to many characters in 25 episodes.\
I did not want to finish without naming the spectacular, full-fledged, soundtrack. Starting by the opening (especially the first one, although the second one is not bad, but the shock of change in mid-season detract it), without forgetting the epics melodies and songs for most important scenes. Sublime.\

- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\
Me animé a ver \"Shingeki no Kyojin\", quizá algo tarde ya que hace varios años que se lanzó, debido a la buena fama y seguimiento que ha tenido siempre entre los aficionados al anime. Y la verdad es que no me arrepiento, ha cumplido las expectativas creadas.\
La historia es interesante, parte de una premisa que ya de por sí da bastante juego: un futuro distópico donde la humanidad se ve amenazada. Pero aparte de tener esa buena base, consiguen hilar un argumento sólido con sorpresas y giros de guión que te sumergen de lleno en esa necesidad de ver el siguiente capítulo para seguir conociendo detalles.\
Con todo y como es obvio ya que es una primera temporada que tiene/tendrá continuación, la historia no queda completamente cerrada (por no decir que básicamente queda abierta del todo) y habrá que esperar a ver esa segunda temporada para saber qué será de Mikasa, Eren, Armin y compañía.\
Hablando de personajes, éste quizá sea uno de los puntos fuertes y a la vez débiles de la serie. Me explico. Hay una gran cantidad de personajes, muchos, eso es algo bueno en el sentido de que la variedad de personalidades y estilos es obvia, lo que le da dinamismo al desarrollo. Pero también supone un problema porque hay bastantes personajes potencialmente interesantes (se me vienen a la mente Reiner o Sasha, alias la chica patata) a los que no se les saca todo el jugo posible y a los que apenas nos da tiempo a ver más que en escenas contadas, precisamente porque es imposible darle desarrollo a tantos personajes en 25 capítulos.\
No quería terminar sin nombrar la espectacular, con todas las letras, banda sonora de la que hace gala. Desde el opening (especialmente el primero, a pesar de que el segundo no es malo aún con el choque que siempre supone el cambio a mitad de temporada), pasando por las sublimes melodías épicas y las canciones de las escenas más importantes.\
En definitiva, \"Shingeki no Kyojin\" es un anime muy disfrutable. Si no lo has visto, como se suele decir: nunca es tarde si la dicha es buena. Hazlo, no te arrepentirás.\

    Shingeki no Kyojin, Any review about an anime as well-known/mainstream as this is bound to cause controversy.  The best way to describe this anime would be that it is the greatest anime non-anime fans have seen. If you want to convince your friends that anime isn't for kids this is what you show them.\
Anyway enough rambling into the review. SNK follows Eren and his friends as they fight back against giant Titans behind big walls... yep that sums it up. \
Lets get into specifics. The overall story of this anime is engaging enough and relatively unique in my opinion, however it really goes no\
          \
        where, the other thing is the inconsistent pacing this anime has, it goes from extremely fast to an abnormal crawl. I understand that slow episodes are required to add background and depth to the story but when you have 3-5 episodes with almost no progression it almost feels as though the anime is stalling unsure of which direction to follow. \
The areas in which this anime shines are extremely well-done the art and sound keeps you engaged and accurately enhances each scene. The art work is consistent and character designs are really well-done. But the sound track is where this anime really out does itself. The two opening soundtracks are amazing and the ending themes are also very well done combined with and engaging OST theres not much else to say. \
However in terms of singing its praises the song isn't very long. The anime's characters are extremely poor, they have almost no depth or value its almost as if they are simply used to portray ideals. Eren is just a physical embodiment of vengeance and rage with almost no depth what so ever. None of the characters come across as memorable or unique and is probably one of the worst points about the anime. It also fails to have any growth these characters don't develop at all throughout the series often leaving a bland and dull stain on the shows great sound and visuals. \
Overall this anime has a very enjoyable start until you realise that is all the anime has to offer and things begin to lose their initial wanderlust. If you're new to anime and you want a good action anime that isn't afraid to show some gore then this is a great one to start off with. However if you're an anime veteran looking for something new and engaging this might not be worth the watch. \
Id give this anime a 7/10. It's alright but it isn't the masterpiece that the community seems to think it is\

    How can I describe such a bad experience?\
Attack on Titan suffers from Fate problem; it looks like it was wrote to be an RPG game.\
Story:\
While the main idea of the show is actually good and kind interesting, the way they build and show the world for you it is disappointing. The titan idea is cool, the dystopia idea is great but the storytelling is terrible.\
All the things need to have an explanation and it need to be shout by the characters instead of being present to you by action, by interaction between the characters, by the world itself, by the story. The audience do not\
          \
        need Eren screaming about how unfair people are with outsiders and picking up a fight with a random soldier to show prejudice. Just by having someone badmouthing the outsiders and looking down to the main characters you could have an idea of the prejudice that the main characters could suffer, no need for a fight, no need for scream, just better storytelling.\
The Titans are almost indestructible creatures, so instead of running away, humans insist on fighting it. Even if it is almost impossible and they usually do not succeed. That for me is a plot hole, there is no reason to train or to prepare soldiers for a lost battle, instead they should train strategies for escaping, how to evacuate people, how to deceive titans, how to reconstruct and rebuild the walls faster... Real strategies based on how effective they could be as Titan killers.\
Cliché situations, how to make the main character hate something? Kill his mom - could be his dad, sister, or anyone really near, same thing! Put on him a sense of justice that came out of nowhere! How to help the main character realize that he has to save everyone? By destroying his city and making him a victim of prejudice. How to make a weak character fight along with other characters? Make him lose someone too because people are hungry in a very unfair way. How to make the main character the chosen one? My dad chose me. How to show that he is amazing? Oh, ok he can use it even if it is broken... - because Eren cannot suck at anything. All of this is commonplace in many stories. Instead of using this kind of cliché Eren could have trained with his dad before the actual first attack, he could be a scout already so when the attack happens he realizes that he cannot do anything against the titans and decide to become a better soldier. In the next attack, a titan eats him and it is able to fuse with it. Justice would come as survivor taught, the hate to the titans would be natural.\
The army/scouts is/are unprepared, they cannot deal with titans and general population, they cannot protect the city, and they barely have a reason to exist. I have never seen such an afraid army before, it`s like they didn`t read the contract for whatever was their work. The scouts training it`s a joke, no brainwashing, no one gets recognition by doing something good, there is this guy telling us who is great and who is not and why. Again, instead of presenting you by situations and letting you as part of the audience make some assumptions about the characters greatness you have someone telling you what to think. You also don`t have any sort of parameter to evaluate anything, you don`t see enough of the training to actually decide if they are well trained or not. It`s like when the RPG or Game characters are introduced to you and you need to choose someone, everyone is amazing period. A lot of shouting again.\
Every explanation is make on the act or by flashback, instead of using the scouts training as a way to explain the nature of the titans, they wait until the next attack and then they just make a flashback into the scouts training to tell you the nature of the titans. How convenient it is to explain stuff and just justify that the characters knew it before by using a flashback. It`s an alternative to actually introduce pieces of information in the narrative and letting the audience build the big picture.\
Characters\
They are all plain, does not matter if Eren is a psycho and Mikasa can fight, you absolutely don`t care about any of them because they are plain, and you even know when a character is going to die. Their designs are just generic and they appear for the first time shortly before their deaths with this huge unnecessary background. You don`t care about they also. \
Sound\
Music is very important here, it actually has a function in the anime.\
Art\
I like the style, it`s different and cool. Unfortunately, you can see the extensive use of computer and you get many scenes with no movement, plain static background, someone was too lazy to animate it.\
Enjoyment\
It`s painful to watch, you don`t even need to pay attention to what is happening. Although it uses the same strategy as Sidonia to keep you watching, just throw you the possibility of imminent death in the end of the episode so you feel like watching it because you want to know what is going to happen. The next episode is usually disappointing though.\
Overall\
I have no clue why it was such a huge success! I guess that the promise of death draw many people to this anime, also the lack of need to think about what you are watching might be the reason why it is so famous. Usually stuff that are very simple, full of blood, death and nudity get famous quickly even if they are badly wrote. \

    Despite doing action very well and trying harder than anything at dark and creepy, it's not as good as what people say.\
That's the gist of this long review, so if you don't want to waste your time, just take that.\
SNK begins with a thunderous roar and somewhere along the first 6 episodes I thought it might even touch that fairly elusive 9/10, but it fell so far down the poop chute that I'm still hesitating on giving it a 7 or an 8. Which is still fair, but for something hailed so highly, I'm sorry to say, how weak.\
Before anything in detail, I must concur\
          \
        with a lot of people and say that a lot of the problems in SNK stem from its pacing and terrible, abysmal amount of nothing really happening in certain arcs. \
However that could've been overlooked if not for the other problems SNK has:\
- First off, I'm gonna repeat exactly what I said with Youjo Senki, SNK is about war, about life in war, about war in war, about how to war the war in the war for war. Well unlike YS, it's not so much a war than a one-sided slaughter, but the problem stands nonetheless. SNK loves to throw its cruel and brutal deaths at you, sometimes about characters that had more than two lines in the entire show, even! But pointless slaughter is enjoyable for a time, and after that you need an actual plot to move towards. \
- Then there's the part about trying too hard with the gritty, dark and gloomy, which is definitely supposed to support the first problem about having no plot, and definitely doesn't help it at all. In short, it's pretty much a given by half-season that no matter who I'm introduced to or what new place we're going to, a lot of people will die, scream, kill or suffer. And it's past the point where I want to care. \
- Then there's the SUDDENLY I AM A SHONEN moments. Those really annoyed me over time. Essentially, in this anime that is mostly a giant world-sized Ant Simulator where you play at not getting crushed, where everyone is angry, or afraid, or envious, or has just abandoned all feelings because it hurts too much to try anymore, we get our cast(even the serious ones) to stop in the middle of a fight to talk about their feelings and explain the situation for the 3rd time this episode. It's not all the time, but it really is a mood killer when it happens.\
- And lastly, it might be a wierd statement but SNK feels like a european comic rather than a manga. There are a few core differences between franco-belgian bande dessinée, american comics and japanese manga, but one I affectionate a lot with manga is the philosophical side of it. Even in cheap shonens with no thoughts to it, catering to early teenagers, you always have some kind of message, a purpose, that writes the manga down with some greater cause. Naruto or One Piece are about loneliness and exclusion, or adventure and freedom. This side of manga always makes it more interesting because it makes you feel like you are not just having fun, but also observing some great cause being served. SNK just...doesn't have that. If it does, I never noticed it. It feels very much like a good BD, it's enthralling and fun and emotionally involving, but there is no \"manga-type\" message. It's not about \"what would life be if we were ants and another species dominated the Earth\", it's not even trying to explore that question. If humans are the dominant species, they grow and progress technologically and socially. If humans are being crushed by Titans, they do the exact same except the Titans block them. There is no big societal change or great questions about life and death, there is no purpose in SNK's story or cast, it's just a war for survival and there are no big questions about anything. A simple example: women are allowed into the army in SNK, fine by me, but shouldn't able bodied women who aren't in the army essentially be forced to have more children for war? Or less children to avoid starvation? Such questions just don't exist, for all intents and purposes, SNK offers a generic late european medieval society with Titans trying to destroy it, and that's it. Characters don't make any big philosophies about what life is as a bird in a cage, afraid to be eaten, they just get scared about it or get angry about it, and that's it. It never leaves emotional storytelling to go into any kind of message, and that's what I mean by \"feeling like a BD\". It feels like something that should've been in a Fluide Glacial collection, not a japanese manga, due to this weak point.\
Besides that, honestly it is pretty good.\
Plot: 3 : The entire plot is that the Titans win. Then a good twist happens around episode 8 or so. A really great twist actually. Too bad one twist cannot hold your plot running for the next 15 or so episodes! Seriously, nothing happens that shakes the situation at all. You meet new characters and new situations and everything, but ultimately, you come to that disappointing moment where you realise you're bored because none of the new characters or situations even remotely change anything. In the long run, the Titans win, there's the great twist, and then...nothing. The Titans keep winning. FOR THE WHOLE SEASON. The main plot advances so slowly on some that I fell out of the anime entirely several times. \
Art: 9 : It's an 8 overall, but I bump it to a 9 for a wonderful use of 3D mixed with drawings. Titans look creepy as hell, characters look quite nice and the rest is overall really good quality, but the thing that struck me really was the visual quality of the fights, it wasn't necessarily technically good(I.E. I didn't always feel or understand what was going on) but it was certainly very well done visually, moreso than 98% of anime.\
Sound : 10 : Hiroyuki Sawano, the same composer as Kill la Kill's, and a generally truly awesome voice cast and sound direction. I could hardly expect better.\
Characters : 5 : It's not like SNK doesn't have good characters, it's just that every character is just a tool in this war, and apart the Qt pie that is Mikasa, I really, really don't care if anyone dies here. Mikasa herself gets a pass because she seems to be the only character who has genuine feelings in the whole anime. The others all range from scared, to angry, to furious, to devastated, to angry, to sad, to devastated. I wouldn't say that the characters are bad, but it's definitely a fact that they're here as tools for the action or tools for the gloom. And since they exist just as that, few of them ever have any really good lines or epic moments, few of them feel like genuine people, they all feel like giant punching bags for Titans, here just to squeal, or like angry or gloomy people who want to kill Titans. Apart from Mikasa's affection for Eren, there is pretty much zero emotion that isn't a direct reaction to Titans attacking, whether it's anger, fear, or despair. It's a little weak.\
Enjoyment : 9 : Now while the characters are mostly only tools and feel fake, it doesn't in any way harm the action, on the contrary. It's a glee to see the fights and the slaughter, to see everything flying all over the place. It's a little harmed by trying too hard to be dark and sad however. But between glorious 3D battles, epic moves and numerous grand scale battles, it's one of the most enjoyable watches there is.\
Overall: 8 : It barely passes 8, but it does it. Again, I think that if the characters weren't just tools for the slaughter to go on, and if it had a more developped plot, SNK would reach the heights. It's got a strong premise, it has some good characters, it certainly flies the flag of Seinen most of the time, and it's serving us delicious action in a dark fantasy setting. There's nothing to dislike here, but the complete lack of proper characterisation that isn't just a reaction to the word \"TITANS\", the very small plot and the Shonenisation of some action parts really bring it down. Still, I'll give a shot at Season 2 for sure.\

    Of course, like most modern anime, Attack on Titan proves once more that popularity does not equate nicely to quality. I first heard of this anime perhaps one-two years ago, when it was gaining popularity in the school that I attend.\
I put it off for a bit, until I began to notice just how this cartoon had proliferated. It was \"hot stuff\"; everyone had seen it. Skeptical of most mainstream things, as always I am, I attempted to watch it objectively. I remember seeing the first two episodes and the recap, but I might have seen more. In any case, my affair with this turgid\
          \
        waste was fleeting at best. Never once did I manage to continuously view more than half of the series, that I am sure of.\
Now, where to start with this show?\
Perhaps I shall touch upon the art-style. I do not find it attractive, but I also suspect that element plays to the merit of the show in the minds of the many who proclaim to enjoy it. For that reason, I won't push any further comment about how the characters are actually drawn - I leave the judgement of that aspect up to one who wishes to see it. The true reason I dislike the art-style is the heavy usage of atmospheric effects. The animation has a hazy, colored lighting that is quite obviously an after-effect. I find it to be over-stylized, which is in line with the general overdone nature of this show.\
Then there is the setting. I don't particularly care for the setting, but I don't quite hate it either. I find that the plot's justification for having human soldiers attack the Giants at close range to be weak at best. As of yet, I have not seen the justification for such a powerful technology as the maneuvering gear that the soldiers wear. From whence come such powerful motors and elastic rope? In any case, I find it easy to suspend my disbelief to oversee these minor weak points. So, neither the art nor the setting provides too major a hindrance to my enjoyment of this production? What does, then?\
The anime has a horribly overdone story line. Subtle is perhaps the last word I would use to describe anything in this series. The anime attempts to portray a tortured youth. And how does it do this? With a myriad of disgusting scenes where eight year old children proceed to gore and murder their captors, where Giants -who, might I add, are practically caricatures for all of their hilarious joker-esque 'menace' - chomp and grind the body parts of parents, etcetera, ad infinitum. I have no problem with viscera or body parts. I do have a problem with it being overused as a \"story element\" and placed on a platter for us to oggle at. Do the production studios think us viewers to be such barbarians? Evidently -yes. \
The hyperviolent, exaggerated past of our protagonist appeals to the adolescent audience that this show has gained so much traction with. Screaming, blood, contorted faces, and sickening volumes of melodrama assault this fetid mess of an anime in some attempt to portray a gritty, or unique world. Instead, I see this as something that an edgy fourteen-year old would look at and proclaim \"masterpiece!\".\
Would it that this anime's only failing was it's loud pandering to an underage audience, but alas, under the superficial veneer of edge and emotion, lies a vapid plot. I have seen nothing in this anime to truly move me or make me think. Rather, it feels like a drug for the unthinking, a mash-up of mindless entertainment.\
One thing that this anime has indeed succeeded at is attracted a large fanbase of hormonal teens who enjoy seeing the clustered roller-coaster of false emotion that is \"Attack on Titan\".\

    Years have passed since one of the most breathtaking moments in modern anime (that being, the sudden apparition of the Giant Titan) impacted both audiences and critics in equal measure; and despite the many subsequent \"mainstream\" hits that followed the very same footsteps, Shingeki no Kyojin still remains as the unarguably most talked-about anime of the present decade. And that's not without a reason: out of all popular on-going shōnen manga prior 2013, Shingeki no Kyojin was undoubtedly the most intriguing. \
Set in a post-apocalyptic future, when giant humanoid creatures referred as Titans have already devoured most of the human population, the story revolves around\
          \
        a young boy, Eren, and all the chaos unleashed by Titans after destroying the wall protecting the last human stand in the world. Such a fascinating premise could have easily been brought down by mediocre decisions from part of the studio responsible of the animated adaptation. Yet despite many weaknesses the show carries along, the final product is a satisfying chiller full of twists-&-turns, clever cliffhangers and solid development of its main characters.\
To begin with, the series presents one of the most enthralling first episodes ever conceived, from our main characters brief background description to the absolutely amazing gorefest that comes afterwards. The plot, once in full motion, never ceases to thrill, with one twist after another, even if some of them might come a bit too repetitive. As a whole, the first mid-cour does enough on its own to stand as one of the most entertaining and effectively suspenseful series out there, which is no surprise when you have Tetsurou Araki to direct this beast of an adaptation.\
But as much as one can praise the first half of the show, it's undeniable the escalating decline in quality during the second half. For many reasons, most characters that once resulted highly entertaining to watch lose both screentime and appeal. Plus, the fact that the plot begins to show many contrivances and pretty deplorable \"mysteries\" by this time just makes it worse. And knowing how the source material was far from getting things wrapped up any soon, it's pretty obvious that the conclusion would just leave audiences disappointed.\
The characters, while not exactly complex or developed to the bone, have their fair share of characterization.The cast is composed by Eren, a young boy who seeks revenge for her mother's death by hands of a Titan; Mikasa, his over-protective sister; and Armin, the loyal childhood friend. Several other characters get introduced with time, and while most of them are relatively interesting, I just can't avoid thinking of them as mere archetypes with interesting motivations and quirky traits; with the exception of Sasha (the eccentric potato-eater of the group) and Armin, who manage to be highly memorable and likable all-around.\
The production values, though, are something of their own league. The drawing style is distinctively bold with emphasis in facial expressions, giving it an essentially comic-like vibe. The animation is fluid and detailed. The soundtrack is majestic and epic. The opening and closing themes are both invigorating and mesmerizing. You name it: there's simply no technical aspect where Shingeki no Kyojin fails at surpassing expectations.\
After all, high-concepts are meant to give lots of entertainment and leave audiences in awe. And in those two standalone camps, Shingeki no Kyojin does far more than enough.   \

    --Manga Spoilers--\
I know that Attack on Titan has been on the center stage when it comes to anime, and it is probably the most popular anime out there, so people criticize it a lot. Although it is mainstream, Attack on Titan actually has an interesting plot and it progresses much faster than any other anime I have seen, which is a good thing. The art is beautiful, and the characters are enjoyable. I have been reading the manga and it has been very satisfactory when it comes to plot reveals and twists and I am really looking forward to the second season. The story is\
          \
        truly intriguing and you are constantly trying to figure out the phenomenon of the titans and whatever is in that basement! Like I said, the manga has truly fulfilled a lot of the mysteries we have been questioning and I cannot wait until they are adapted into anime!\

    Since the second season of attack on titan is coming soon ,I thought it would be a good idea to write a review addressing some of the main issues that I've encountered while watching the show back in 2013,which lowered my enjoyment and my overall score of the show.\
the theme of hiding behind a great wall to separate ourselves from the other that is laying there and threatening us all ,was gaining popularity in media and politics and still,I think it was one of main reasons of the show's immense success,add to that the show's infamous reputation of killing its character in extremly graphic and\
          \
        ruthless ways,which helped elevating the level of suspense.\
even though they didn't use these deaths to push the plot forward or to twist it as other shows like game of thrones.\
the story take place in some sort of medieval ,fantasy world with steampunk elements or maybe in a parallel timeline (i don't really know),where a man-eating gigantic mysterious beings called the titans appeared out of nowhere and  drove humanity to near extinction, the survivors built enormous walls to secure themselves from this non stoppable force,the setting is interesting and the story seems to be one of those where humanity has to face its worst nightmares which is being kicked out of the top of the food chain.\
The setting hasn't been explored enough,I mean they gave us throught the series some information about the walls,the world they live in, but there was nothing about the political system inside the walls,do they live in a monarchy or a republic ,until now we don't know who rules inside these walls,you may ask why I should care but throught the series especially after the battle of trost, there were clear signs of conspiracy and scheming in the shadows ,and I think the ruling cast plays a large role in it.\
the pacing was inconsistent, it was fast during the first ten episodes then it slowed down for five boring episodes that led me to drop it temporarily.\
The characters were a major disappointed almost all of them annoying,forgettable or one dimensional, the main character eren is your average shounen lead,he is stubborn, reckless ,dumb and down to earth annoying, mikasa wasn't all that good she showed no emotions except for eren,she didn't have any real relation with any character except for eren ,her whole character revolves around eren and her obsession with him is really annoying,I know he saved her life when she was kidnapped but seriously why should they made them kill those criminal ,they were just kids that took out any sort of innocence in their character(at least for me),her character had a lot of potential but it was wasted,and what's the big deal about Levi why are all the people so mad about him,he is boring in terms of personality or design(he looks like he hasn't slept for a month,go get some rest dude)just because he is the presumed titan slaughter doesn't make him the best,the best character by far was jean he was well rounded character and his development was nicely done.\
the logic of the show seems a bit weird ,take for example the 3D manoeuvre, it is there just for the sake of cool action sequences,if you have steam power,why don't you use it to hit the titans weakpoint from a long distance instead of creating unreliable technique that takes a lot of time to master,yet most likely the user will end crushed under a titan's foot.\
the animation and the soundtrack were marvellous, the action was spectacular and well done.\
I hope the second season will be more consistent in its pacing and develop its character to break out of their archetype  (mikasa) and explore the setting more and reveal a lot of the show's mystery.\

    I know, I didn't watch this show till the end. \
Because I was really disappointed it self-destroyed all of its potential (like Sword Art Onlie for example).\
The first episodes were really well done, although the story wasn't that great. But after a certain episode, I felt disappointed about this really stupid twist (no spoiler). I watched a few more episodes, but my desire to watch it faded and I couldn't enjoy it anymore. \
I wasn't expecting much, because the hype train just startet rolling and I didn't know about it. But after watching half of it, I don't understand why people are so hyped about\
          \
        this particular show. Even after reading comments and reviews about it, I just can't understand. In my opinion, this show is just average. \
I don't think I'll ever finish watching it. I don't drop shows often, in fact, it's only the fourth I ever dropped till now. 4 out of 705! And I even finished watching horrible ones like Green Green and 11eyes xD\

    I went into this anime with high hopes.  I say previews and seen previews that only made me anticipate this title even more.  I soon found my hopes dashed within the first few episodes.\
Story - The first two episodes and the overall idea are the only reasons that I did not score the story-line even lower.  After those two episodes, the pace of the story kept getting slower.    It got so slow at times that I could have seen more happen watching the golf channel.  I only gave the story a 4.\
Art - I did not care for\
          \
        the art style at all.  It was too dark and often felt blurred for me.  This art style makes me feel like I am watching an unfinished art board more then a finished anime.  I gave it a 4 for art work.\
Sound - The sound track and voice acting was about the best part of this anime.  The music for the opening was energetic and entertaining leading into the show.  The music during the scenes was excellently done and quite enjoyable.  The ending theme was even better then the opening and is on several playlists for  me.  the voice actors did an excellent job putting emoting into the characters, even when I did not like the characters or did not enjoy the plot.    I gave sound a 7.\
Character -  I found Eren, the main protagonists, way to whiny.  It is no fault of the voice actor as it is clear the character was written that way.  Armin was slightly more likable then Eren, but not by much.    Mikasa was the shining light of the three major protagonist.  The supporting characters and antagonist were run of the mill to me.  Nothing bad, but nothing overly noteworthy to me either.  Mikasa was the main reason I gave characters a 5.\
Enjoyment - Between the story line and artwork, much of this anime was ruined for me.  There were a few enjoyable moments, but they were so few and far between, and mostly involved Mikasa, that I cannot say I enjoyed this anime.\
Overall -  If you love dark anime and the art style of this  anime, and if you do not mind  a plot line that plods along at a sloth's pace at times, then you will probably enjoy this anime.  I prefer a plot that gets somewhere in each episode and a more finished looking animation style.  After watching this anime, I went and watched Black Lagoon, another dark anime and found it to more of what I hoped for in Attack on Titan.  Overall score for me is a 5.\

    Attack on Titan is one of the most overhyped anime ever that’s biggest complaint, for me, is that people can’t shut the hell up about it. Anywhere you go that’s even vaguely anime related you’re bound to find something going on related to Attack on Titan because it’s an easily accessible show that many people will feel edgy for watching; when, in the end, they’re watching a shounen with some splotches of blood and rampant murder to make you feel like you’re watching something more adult.\
The plot of Attack on Titan is very basic for a fantasy. Big, lumbering giants are attacking the fortified walls\
          \
        of the last bastion of humanity. Branches of military battle Paul Bunyan in an attempt to exterminate them before they exterminate humanity. When they break through one of the walls and kill countless people, Eren Jaegar, our hero, watches his mother get eaten and decides along with his adopted sister to join up with the military and fight the bastards who took away his life.\
Why is this basic, you ask? Because as far as fantasy goes this is a very unrealized world. It’s essentially one city and a bunch of monsters. It works because of its simplicity and pulls people in because it’s easy enough for everyone to understand. Wall, bad monsters, good military, fighting!\
That’s not to say the plot is particularly bad in anyway. It’s just very slow moving and shounen-esque. The series starts off rather strongly and goes at a decent clip but the further you go in, the more plodding it gets. Ten minute action sequences get drawn out to ridiculous lengths because of brooding characters and constant flashbacks to things that don’t matter. Episode twenty-three’s ending sets up an awesome fight that gets you pumped up. But then episode twenty-four comes on and spends half the episode brooding and flashing back to more brooding. I understand the characters are all depressed and have all seen things but I don’t want to sit through their constant coming to terms with the fact that things are fucked up.\
That’s how the action sequences mostly go. So much time is spent talking about what they will do or brooding over all the things that have happened that any excitement to be had is lost and the scenes fall flat. Watching a bunch of sword wielding Spider-Men swing around a giant nude anatomy lab model should be exciting and fun. But most of the time, there’s too much going on on the sidelines and this is where you can see that this is truly a shounen.\
Another major problem I had with the plot was how needlessly dark and depressing it is. Okay guys, I understand that people die in war. I also understand that titans kill a lot of people. But I don’t need to see every death onscreen. It doesn’t add anything. Watching hundreds of faceless people die gives the show a feeling of childish masochism and ruins any emotion the audience can get from a main character dying. “How do we make this hardcore? Like, so hardcore people will think they’re watching something more than an above average shounen?”\
I know! Add so much death and destruction that just watching it and leaving with a smile on your face is a mark of your depravity. I feel like the deaths were there constantly to try to remind us that we’re watching something more than what AoT actually is and because of that, the constant death and murder becomes pointlessly uninteresting. If a character like Eren or Mikasa were to die, it wouldn’t really feel sad. Instead you’d say “Yup, that’s pretty clearly what’s going to happen.” Death works and makes you have feels when you are attached to the character or feel bad for the circumstances of the character’s death. And that rarely ever happens in Attack on Titan. About the only death you can feel really bad for is Petra, and that’s only because of the vague hint that she might have been married off to Levi. I appreciate the non-overtness of this, but at the same time, its effect on Levi is uninteresting. Levi seems a little different, but his character really doesn’t change much. So why should I care about Petra’s death and why put emphasis on it?\
That’s Attack on Titan’s biggest problem: it’s trying to be something it isn’t.\
Look at the character’s to see why so many people get drawn into the series. Eren Jaegar is a typical shounen main character who is idealistic and screams a lot and also has a monster inside of him. Armin is the nerdy little guy. Mikasa is an interestingly strong female lead and I can see a lot of female fans watching the show just for the sheer number of badass women.\
And that’s the accessibility. Accessible story, accessible characters, and an accessible world.\
There are some minor issues. Bad writing, some head scratching areas of the plot (I understand Eren wants to save humanity and kill the titans but he sure murders thousands of innocent civilians in the final fight), long uninteresting stretches of nothing happening. The Linkin Park-esque music that punctuates dramatic scenes really fucks with the tone of the scene and makes it laughable sometimes. But for all that, there is some good\
Great animation with fluid fight scenes. One of the best opening numbers of any anime ever. Some genuinely badass moments. Some genuinely badass characters. There are so many good things going on but there are also so many bad things that the series doesn’t excel beyond the realms of above-average. I enjoyed the hell out of Attack on Titan even through all its problems and I can’t wait to hear confirmation of a second season. While it doesn’t have all the aspects that make an anime great, it has every aspect of a fun and entertaining anime. Some parts do drag, the tone is not the best, the characters aren’t that exciting, the action is too slow, the attitude is juvenile, and the plot is weak; but damn is it fun to watch a titan punch another titan’s head off and send it into a clock tower.\
People who go into this expecting anything more than typical shounen fair with constant attempts to be edgy (edgy Linking Park music, edgy violence, edgy cuss words!) will be sorely disappointed. This is not the new Berserk by any means. It’s a dumb shounen that’s entertaining because of how dumb it is without being overbearingly dumb.\

Then he joins the military and can't quite figure out how to function as a team player. Something crucial to the titan killing effort. It's also long and drags with terrible pacing at times. The entire attack on trost arc is what one whole day? One episode spans 23 seconds. 23 seconds of thought and dialog is stretched to fill a 22 minute episode.

I will add this is a pretty gory show. That doesn't lower it's score at all, because it's supposed to be gory. But not safe for little kids and those who have triggers that require warnings. Hence the six out of ten, if you can put up with, endure, and tolerate AoT I recommend it, but not too highly as I can understand how it may not be everyone's cup of tea.\

    Attack on Titan was a really good anime. I recommend to people who like action packed adventures. I thought that the use of grappling hooks was a good idea and swords.\
SPOILER ALERT: When the titan brawled the other titan with the big nose it was really action packed and cool. It got pretty brutal though so don't watch if you're squeamish or unless you like big naked guys with no privates. I give it an 8/8 m8.\

    What makes me watch it in the first place was the title of this anime and art style. It was something I never seen before and the battles against titans looks interesting and entertaining. I think this anime is so amazing. The artwork design is pretty amazing and original. Much better then the manga artwork. Annie  Leonhart is one of the reason why I repeatedly watch this anime. She is simply cute, sexy, and badass. Now as soon as they make season 2, then I bet this anime would be at the top instead of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood on this website. \

    Attack on Titan is a great anime. It's not perfect by any means, but enjoyment wise it is really, really good. Of course, there are a lot of things that people won't like about it - nothing appeals to everyone - but for those who like high-octane, fast-paced gore fests, this show is just about as good as it gets. It's not mature, anyone who thinks it's actually deep is kidding themselves, but it's plain fun and even though it can be depressing, once you get past that it becomes a lot more exciting.\
These are my scores for the moment, but as with most anime\
          \
        I find it hard to judge a show overall before I've seen the ending. Endings tend to make-or-break it for me.\
What I'm worried about with AoT is that it might be more shounen than I'd like - I haven't read the manga, but if the characters gain new powers then it really waters down the humans vs Titans aspect of the show, and makes it a lot less interesting. But we'll see...\
STORY 7/10\
The story is pretty classic - humans are on the brink of survival from huge Titans etc etc. Whilst this is pretty cliche, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but it's definitely not the show's best point. There's enough driving it to keep it engaging though.\
ART 10/10\
I'm not an animation expert, but everything about AoT's art I just love. I love the detailed shots of faces, the way that each character is animated, the particle effects, the good combination of CG art, and especially the action sequences. It's been a while since I've seen action sequences that smooth. Everything about AoT is just insanely pretty. A lot of reviewers here are saying the colour palate is dull, but I've not noticed that - I think the lighting is beautiful, the characters are all drawn perfectly... *_* I can't rant about the art for this show enough!\
SOUND 8/10\
I love the music in this show for the most part, though there are some times it is a little too overpowering, and certain scenes I think could use a different vibe to the one they give it. But the music is great to listen to even without the show.\
CHARACTER 6/10\
I think pretty much everyone knows that the characters are the show's weakest point. They're cliche shounen stereotypes, especially Eren who is the classic determined protagonist who will stop at nothing to destroy his enemies and is always the answer to whatever problem needs solving.\
I personally really love Mikasa - she is just the right amounts of badass and emotional, not too stoic, but she'll do whatever it takes to get the job done. She's a fantastic character.\
Armin is growing on me, ever since he quit whining and actually used his brain to solve tactical problems (like plugging the hole in Wall Maria).\
The secondary characters make the show a lot better, but I feel they need more development than they're giving. Back stories for these characters would be nice, and would make the whole show a lot more complex and interesting, but alas.\
ENJOYMENT 10/10\
This show is just so fun. In spite all of its flaws, which are plentiful, there are so many great scenes, a whole lot of emotion and it's just a blast to watch. It's not mature, thoughtful, or deep by any means, but who needs that all the time anyway? The entertainment factor, like a lot of Tetsuo Araki's other works, is what really makes the show good, and to be honest that's enough for me to give the whole show an overall 9/10.\

    I know why you're here. You either heard SnK is the ''best friggin' anime of all times'' or that it's overrated. Well then , allow me to clear things up a bit.\
The story is very interesting , but after watching the anime , you'll realize it has 3-4 main points. That's it . But it's captivating , and that's what matters. \
The art is good . I cannot complain , since I'm no art expert. \
Voice actors did a great job . The music in the series didn't give me a headache.So , pretty good.\
The characters ...They're awesome . I mean I have many favourites\
          \
        , and I really can't say there's someone I hate. Of course , they all have their ups-and-downs , but we're going to overlook that. \
Now , you probably didn't get any real answer regarding this anime from what I've written so far. Well , there's nothing else to say really . So what makes SnK such a ''mindblowing'' anime ? What made it become such a world-wonder ? Was it the titans ? Was it the idea that this could happen ? Was it the love for the allmighty potato (you'll get it after watching ) ? \
I don't know . It's definitely overrated ,but at the same time , it's impossible to underrate this anime . It's a must watch .\
That's it for me . Hope you found my review helpful . \

    Well I'm going to make this review now, but I doubt it will explain how excited I was watching Attack on Titan and what I thought of. Plus, it isn't even finished yet so I'll probably be dead from anxiety.\
  - I'll admit that I was extremely skeptical when my friends kept telling me that the anime is amazing because of titans and bad-ass action. However, I actually enjoyed the show greatly because of how each episode was done when I watched it. \
    Attack on Titan is one of few shows that actually successfully explain, if not everything, the majority\
          \
        of the confusing things and make them work. I actually found the gear that the soldiers used more fascinating than the titans. This unique equipment the show contains makes it interesting to watch and not get bored by the typical armor and swords used in medieval times. In fact, that was one of the reasons why I desperately wanted to watch the next episode when I was finished with one. Not only that, but the equipment was necessary since throwing in a typical super-smart guy would make the show a cliche strategy fighting show. With the equipment though, it makes the fighting practical and not entirely reliant on the use of thinking. The show has a lot of scenes where reality kicks in, which is also necessary and good because it shows how conflicts arise as well as the diversity in the mentality of people. The main characters are actually the epitomes of the types of people prevalent in the show. Then of course, death would have to occur at some point, otherwise I'd think the show is like a typical movie where the protagonist just miraculously survives from incredulous strength or never dies because of \"luck\". Yeah, I think the chances are extremely low if you're going to fight against capriciously aggressive TITANS, who are powerful and bigger. This is when I got really into the series. Spoiler. I love the idea of the power Eren gets. I mean, transforming into a titan and then having imperfect flexibility and functioning of the titan. It's balanced, and it thickens the plot because it shows that titans don't actually have a pure,mysterious background. I say balanced because honestly, if you're going to focus on reality, you have a low chance of fighting against something that you barely have information on and that it was evinced that the adversary is physically stronger. And there you have it: an amazing plot that doesn't render the introduction of superpowers and movement feckless.\
  Nothing seems to be flawed because I thought the art and sound were pulchritudinous. For the plot, since it keeps moving and shows constant conflicts (not even just the titans, but humans against humans too -- it builds the reality and austerity of the anime) is amazingly good. I think this anime is very great and doesn't fail to demonstrate a serious story where people have to face a very difficult adversity and overcome it.\

    First of all, let me explain this; For those of you saying that the anime is way to overrated especially since it has just released a couple of episodes. I do agree with you that it is way too early to judge this serie. However, People act based on their feelings. And when an anime gives you the excitement like you have found a rare pokemon card, seems all the reason for me to rate it good.\

story 8/10\
The story concept of the titans invading the walls is pretty awesome. It is not your average action-story but something totally different. Even still, the reason i gave\
          \
        it an 8/10 is for the fact that the story is a little predictable. for those who haven't watched yet, u'll understand me later. And for those who did watch the serie, you will know.\
Art 9/10\
The art of shingeki no kyojin is pretty epic. Everything is so fine detailed and the emotions are pretty damn well expressed by the art. Although, there is one problem where not only me, but a lot of people bumped into when seeing the art. Honestly i am not fan of the thick line that has been around the characters. I would prefer if there wasn't that thick line. And i am also sure there are people who agree with me as well. but non the less, nothing to complain about.\
sound 9/10\
There isn't much to say about the sound. It is flawless and it has been put perfectly together matching the characters and the emotion of the characters giving a thrilling experience. However, i would like to see a different opening with different music.\
character 7/10\
now this is where alot of people will agree with me, or disagree. And there has been alot of arguments concerning the characters. i personally think the characters aren't divided equally. The strongest survives. I personally would prefer for misaka to be the main character since her skills are overall much better and greater then eren.\

    Storyline: \
Unless you're new to Anime, you probably know the deal with Attack On Titan.\
Bunch of crazy giant naked human-looking creatures try to eat humans for no apparent reason. \
(Next thing copied from Wikipedia to explain little bit about the show)\
One hundred years prior to the beginning of the story, giant humanoid creatures called Titans (巨人 Kyojin?) have forced humanity to retreat into a system of concentric walls known as Wall Maria (ウォール・マリア Wōru Maria?, outermost), Wall Rosé (ウォール・ローゼ Wōru Rōze?, middle), and Wall Sina (ウォール・シーナ Wōru Shīna?, innermost). Inside these walls, humanity lived in peace for one hundred years, but a sudden attack by\
          \
        a gigantic sixty-meter Titan and a smaller Titan covered in armor plates caused the outermost wall to be breached, forcing mankind to abandon the land between Wall Maria and Wall Rosé, resulting in turmoil and famine.\
To me, the story is very original and cool. It's so unique, technology, weapons, setting, titans, everything.\
Every episode leaves you wanting something more. There's a lot of action so that's always a plus.\
But one thing that really bothers me in the storytelling of SnK (Shingeki No Kyojin in case you didn't understand) are the fillers. There's so much un-needed bullcrap and you can clearly see that they just put'd it there so they'd have the planned amount of episodes and such.\
Fillers aren't neccessarily a bad thing, there are good filler moments but also many boring ones.\
Art:\
Artstyle in SnK is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, and animation in action scenes is AMAZING, there hasn't been a anime in along time which had as cool animations as in SnK. When they fly with their maneuver gears, killing titans. It's so hype.\
BUT, there are times animation gets clumsy and you can see they had some major problems with it at times. But if i remember correctly they actually talked about the problems they had with animators, not sure though.\
Sound: What's there to say. It's PERFECT. I rarely say anything's perfect but it is. When battle starts with some crazy music, you get so pumped.\
I never skipped openings and second ending song. The music in anime is a big deal to me because when you have music, it always brings more feelings to the show. And is the music forgettable like in some anime? I guess it's clear by now.. NO. I don't know what else i can say. EPIC and PERFECT. They should get awards just for the music, it's that good.\
Characters:\
SnK characters are very interesting but it's a shame we mostly see only maincast.\
We see sidecharacters interact now and then but not a lot which is a shame. Since there's so many interesting characters except the main cast, like Sasha and Conny, or Berthold who we see talking for like 1 minute in the whole show.\
I'm quite sure everyone wanted more from our Potato Girl (Sasha).\
But don't get me wrong, main characters are okay too. Although, don't hate me for this but i dislike Mikasa (main female protagonist). She's all about the main protagonist Eren, she doesn't care about else than him. But it's understandble since (SPOILERS) Eren saved her as kid. But it DOES get annoying at times when she says \"EREN\" 10 times per episode.\
Enjoyment: \
I had a blast watching SnK.\
It was such an feeling filled and epic adventure and i'd definently watch the series again.\
This was my poopy review again, hope this helps someone. \

    I found this anime to be quite enjoyable, with plenty of enjoyable characters, twists and battle scenes. The score was extraordinary, the art style wonderful.\
However, I did feel that at times, the episodes were written by George R.R Martin, and it was a tableau of blood, which I'm not criticizing, but I thought it was at times a little excessive.\
There is a problem of plotholes. There are often times where episodes create more questions than answers them\

    As we all know, this season has many anime with extremely poor quality and very few are worthy to interest you in watching them. But not SNK. It was the pleasant surprise and it had been a while since i watched something like this. SNK is the type of anime that breaks down the door of the \"mediocre anime apartment\" holding a minigun and unleashes hell on the pile of dullness that stroke us this time of year.\
The plot is pretty much known. Humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction by some creatures known as Titans. In order to protect themselves, survivors from all\
          \
        over the world gathered in a single place building a city with 3 walls. The story focuses on Eren, a young boy that witnesses his mother getting eaten by the Titans as one of the three walls falls to them. His desire for vengeance drives him to join the Scouting Legion to obtain the skills required in order to exterminate them. \
In other words, the plot is pretty simple and not the most original idea. There are many anime out there that share similar characteristics (humanity is threatened by non-human monsters). However, its depiction is what matters. You will have the feeling that humans are fighting for survival and for their very lives. Despair, agony, pain, suffering, fear all these emotions are present in mankind's forces. When titans show up, some people are frozen because of their fear, others will run, others will cry and others will make a stand. SNK says loudly to you \"NOTHING IS SUNSHINE AND BUTTERFLIES\". People will die, people will be eaten and others will cry. Hardcore and brutal.\
The art is excellent and is distinguished from its high quality. From the shadows and buildings to character models and enviroments everything is depicted in detail and beauty. The only drawback is that the city might feel empty at times with the roads and apartments empty. The battle scenes are dynamic and fluent, full of energy but they tend to become somewhat confusing at times.\
The characters are your typical anime cast. The food freak, the brave, zealous protagonist, the calm and caring co-protagonist, the leader etc. However, they all have a unique personality, a special past and their own reasons to fight the titans. The development to certain characters tends to becoming very interesting though, as cowards rise to heroes and weak-willed ones strengthen their resolve. However one thing is common: in a world gone mad, everyone fights for his survival and he does that alone or by trusting others to assist him. In the end, you will start empathizing the characters and quickly choose your favorite party.\
The soundtrack is top class. The first opening is epic, like a call to arms. You will find yourselves watching it over and over again, not being able to get enough of it. The tracks are always matched with the current situation and add to the drama and the realism of every scene. The background music cannot go unoticed and you will definitely search it in youtube to hear it again. When it comes to the voice actors, they are full of the emotions corresponding each scene. Whether someone cries, lets a battle cry or shouts it will always sound natural as if the characters where actually real.\
It will be very hard to find something in this anime you won't like. The only possible drawbacks are its somewhat simple story and the small number of episodes. The ending is a cliffhanger, meaning a possible season 2. SNK has the magic of keeping you hooked to it until the end. And I gotta say, I didn't mind that at all.\
Just keep one thing in mind: Everybody dies.\

    I can easily say that this is the best anime I have ever seen. I am caught up to the anime and currently hold all 10 volumes in my collection and this anime is almost flawless. I am very impressed with the art the sound is quite nice and the story. It basically is the Japanese version of the walking dead in popularity. I cannot go as far as to say this is my personal favorite anime, due to nostalgic reasons, but I can really say its a masterpiece. As far as enjoyment goes the only thing I really had against it is its sometimes\
          \
        incredibly slow pacing. But if you hang on to the end you can really get the fullness of this awesome series.\

    When I watched the first episode of Shingeki no Kyojin, I thought it was gruesome, and I stopped watching it. Then, I watched the first two episodes of Elfen Lied, and I ran back to SnK like a scared little pansy, and I actually ended up enjoying it so much that I decided to write this review.\
The Story: The story is probably the most original story I have ever seen in an anime. Most animes focus their stories around teenagers in high school. Well, SnK is about teenagers trying to survive while killing these stupid, naked giants who smile like a psycho and/or rapist. They\
          \
        eat humans, and thus, humanity has been pushed to almost extinction. Never have I seen an anime with a plot similar to this, and I find it really amazing. It makes people wonder what we would do if we were in this situation. I also enjoy how there's absolutely no fanservice whatsoever in this anime. In many animes, all of the giant breasts, the hundreds of panty shots, and the skimpy outfits distract everyone from the actual plot, so I'm glad that I can actually focus on the plot in SnK. Also, it is full of plot twists and cliffhangers that put you at the edge of your seat.\
Art: The animation is great. All of the scenes where people are flying around on maneuver gear look spectacular. The colors are generally dark which perfectly fits in with the dark theme of SnK. Nothing is too extremely gruesome (despite what I said in the beginning), so it's not all that scary.\
Sound: The soundtrack is badass. It sounds like medieval mixed with boss-at-end-of-video-game music. It is just so beautiful. It doesn't sound electronic and modern. It sounds like music you would hear at the time that this anime takes place. I couldn't imagine it being any more fitting.\
Characters: The main character is Eren Jaegar. He's the stereotypical \"Swears vengeance on everything\" character, but it actually really works for him because his mother was eaten in front of his own eyes. Mikasa, another main character, is more manly that anyone else on this show despite being a female. She acts tough, fights strong, but is also fragile when it comes to Eren being in dangerous situations. Armin is the third main character and a pansy. He gives up a lot and cries way more than he should, but I find this extremely relateable. Then, we got our huge supporting cast consisting of another badass female, a sexy neat-freak, a food-obsessed girl, a sweet and kawaii girl, a stereotypical douchebag, a creepy (but genius) scientist, and many others. The characters are all very relateable, and I found myself similar to many of the characters (mostly Sasha, Armin, and Hanji). The reason I ranked characters lower than everything was because the cast is so large to the point where I didn't care if someone was killed off. Everyone is always like \"I was so upset when *insert name here* died\" and I honestly can't even remember who they are. The people who get character development are the ones who shine through.\
Enjoyment: From the opening to the final frame of SnK, I enjoyed this so much. So many things are left unknown like the basement, the armored and colossal titan, the titan peaking through the wall at the end, Annie, Eren's father, and so much more. If there is not another season, I will curl up in the fetal position rocking back and forth snuggling my Ciel plushie while reading SnK fanfiction to the point where I fall unconscious (which I might have done before, but you get the point).\
Overall: If you didn't read all that, then I want you to read this: If you do not know if this anime is for you, WATCH IT! If you are a girl and think you are too delicate for the deaths in this anime, you'd probably still enjoy it. I'm a girl, under 17 (so I shouldn't be watching this, but honestly, I don't care), and I ended up loving it.\

    The manga is more enjoyable to see though. There were things that I didn't like of he series, like the start of every first episodes. It was all the same, and it wasted minutes. I like the style though, the style of the scary titans. Not like cute titans at all! And very realistic reactions and actions. You can feel the chill on you if you imagine you were on the character's place (or at least that's what I did).\
There is another thing I didn't like too much though, they wasted a lot in flashbacks. But I guess that's fine, I just wanted them to\
          \
        get out of the walls already, so that is all opinion of mine!\
A lot of people are discussing if there will be another season, and many many people think there will, because of the population of this series, it became, like I said, the best anime of the year. But there are other people who say there won't be, all the other things left on the manga so that everyone could go and read it if the curiosity gets to kill them.\
Every last minute of every episode, it makes you feel like you want to continue and continue watching, no matter what time are you watching it. (It happened to me when I was watching an episode at 11:00 PM and finally could stop when it was 1:00 AM)\
The music is kinda unique, and suitable for the anime.\
The style of every character is also nice, and all the heartbreaks everyone gets. You'll feel sadness, it is inevitable.\
The suspense on every episode is inevitable as well. And don't ever think there will be good endings or good consequences.\

    shingeki no kyojin is one of the best animes i've watched in a while. i finished watching it about a month ago, and found it very enjoyable. it has made its way to the top alongside my other favorite animes. to start, the art is gorgeous, and the quality of animation is spectacular. the characters are great as well. my only complaint is that lots of episodes contain filler and whatnot. in the beginning of the series, it takes about five episodes to go over one plot arc. overall though, i loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone.\

From the beginning i can see that it is well planed and they have down a very good job with the series.  I love that they hold things back from us and don't explain it all so we have to wait for the answer. I would recommend this series to everyone that love anime!\

    We've all been looking for that one anime to hype you and get you interested to the whole series instead of stop at the first episode.\
Story - 7/10\
I can't give all the points for the story, the fact that they never really answered the question \"Where did the titans come from?\" and such, and they left us with a cliffhanger at the end. The manga is still ongoing at least, and I love how theres not much difference between the manga and the anime.\
Art - 10/10\
I really love the art. The lighting captures the mood of the scene. The character's face in any kind of\
          \
        situation such as someone getting eating by a titan.\
Sound - 9/10\
The opening really gives you a preview of the anime and there are no spoilers  in the opening for those who like watching and listening to openings and endings. The background music really sets the situation or mood.\
Character - 10/10\
I just love, really love, how the characters are designed and how they fit into their personalities. The first time you'll see Armin, you may think he's a wimp, but he's not just a random character thrown in there, he's actually there for a reason. Finally, I love how the female character's chest isn't all over the place and the females aren't displayed as the usual \"damsel in distress\".\
Enjoyment - 10/10\
All the fighting scenes and flying around in their 3D maneuver gear gets you all hyped up and interested. There are scenes were you go \"What's going to happen next?!\"\
Overall I really enjoyed and loved this anime.  I hope you guys who want to watch it enjoy it too!~\

    Easily best anime of the decade.\
Story: 10 Amazing\
The story takes place in the late 800s. It talks about humans being pushed to extinction by these huge human-like creatures called the Titans aka Kyojins(Giants). As the story goes on, the main characters discover that the Titans aren't just the only enemies of humanity. The plot was amazing but the only thing I didn't like was the fact that I had to wait a whole week to find out what happens next, especially waiting for episode 6; that was the hardest and longest week of my life. That's how exciting the story was.\
Art: 10\
I wasn't a fan\
          \
        of this type of art before, but it looks like they have improved in 2013 and I have a feeling it's gonna get better.\
Sound: 10\
If there was a higher score than 10, I would give this category the highest score. There is no word(s) to describe how awesome the soundtracks were. If you just hear the Intro of the show you would be blown away.\
Character: 10\
I always liked these types of characters in anime series, the main character is always the one that's surprising us. There's the strongest characters, the smartest characters, the leaders, and the f**king OP enemies. \
Enjoyment: 10\
I had an amazing time watching this anime. I have already watched twice. There were funny moments, happy moments, epic moments and sad moments. Truly amazing experience.\
overall: 10\
from all the anime I've watched since 2010, this is my number 1. And I don't think it will change unless AoT season 2 comes out. :P\

    (disclaimer: long and jumpy review)\
If you want to skip the long reading, here's my basic review of it \"Rough start and awesome finish.\"\
If you are not okay with gore, this is not your anime. \
I started out with this anime unimpressed. I thought it was just a bunch of overloaded action (and to some extent it was a bit overdone in the beginning) but as the anime progressed I grew more and more intensely in love with it. Whenever I recommend it to people, I always tell them they just have to keep watching it because it gets better. \
One thing I didn't like about\
          \
        the anime was when the arcs were held out for too long. I think if this show were marathoned though, it wouldn't really be a problem. By the time it gets into it's final arc though, (starting at the mission) it is handled better in that most of the episodes are amazing individually even if they are dragging out the arc. This wasn't exactly so before hand where you'd sit there and stare at the screen blank faced with disbelief that the anime with such amazing abilities has just yet again, given you another episode where nothing happens. However, as I said before, they do a better job of this later on in the series, and by that I mean, even when they aren't moving quickly to give you every bit of the juicy arc asap, they are making every episode up until the overall climax of the art, super amazing. \
OH AND THE ANIMATION Oh my goodness, if you are a fan of watching beautiful animation then you have come to the right anime this is so so so so SO very well done. Sometimes I'd just rewatch certain clips or look for gifs of them online because I loved how well done they were (seriously, I did those things). \
And if you like an anime that keeps the style of the manga, this is definitely your anime. At first I was a little put off by the style, but I very much like it now. (Especially when you see them older, I'm just saying) \
Now the characterization is very interesting. I'm going to focus on the trio of the show for this. There's Eren who is an annoying shit (my personal opinion), but yet has some charm to him.  He's interesting in that he's an earnest and stubborn character, but not in the adorable way, but in an angry way. He's all about revenge, which might make you think of Sasuke from Naruto from my little description right now, but honestly, it's not very much like that. Mostly because Eren is a little shit, but still. I kind of like Eren despite his super angry titan-killer self, and that might just be because he's kind of dumb-blind for it. He has little direction in anything but killing titans, just a lot of drive, and he has to work hard to be good at anything. He trusts his friends and works out his problems. He isn't afraid to take risks and tries to do what's right. I kind of like him (even though I still also kind of think he's annoying). His dark nature is more believable in the manga though, so I'd advise people to read the manga even though it's very similar to the anime (after you watch the anime though because it will make the manga so much easier to understand). \
Mikasa is the girl in the trio and she is a bad ass. She's cold and doesn't talk unless she needs to. She's fine with fighting before speaking. I do find her also a little annoying (more so in the beginning), but I also respect her. I like her character a lot mostly because she isn't just a quiet badass, she's got a person in her. She's not just a two dimensional character, she has a bit of life to her. I think she's misunderstood a lot and people just assume she's a boring character without a lot of depth to her, but that's not true at all. I'm not just saying this because of what's happened to her, she herself, is an interesting character. She is a follower of Eren, but thinks for herself. She's protective of the ones she loves and trusts her friends (though she does know when to step in and tell them to straighten up). Although she's a genius, we're shown that she does have moments of weakness and still has much to learn (and not in the way where the character is defeated and has to work their way through rivals and stuff, but through the leadership and advice of her fellow soldiers). \
Armin. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER (as well as Sasha) He is ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS because of the way he is introduced to the story. You think he's some weak push over but he's not. He is strong and independent, he is powerful and innovative. He doesn't realize this himself but is eventually beginning to see his own strengths (which he has always had). He's also curious and won't allow himself to be squished. Armin is interesting because he has a lot of weak points that he overpowers to become a better soldier. He's just awesome. I also love how well of a tactition he is, it's absolutely wonderful. There's a couple episodes that are mostly about him, especially this one episode that really explores him, and they're pretty damn good. Like on of the episodes was so good I just like... loved it better than some of the best action scenes. That's how much I love him. He's also stubborn and I like that he thinks for himself while considering others. He's observant and tries to understand whatever he can from the nonsense others see. He's definitely someone who you'd want to become king or something.  \
So yeah. I love that guy. \
I don't know, I kind of find most of the characters annoying (besides Sasha I love her, and Armin) but I kind of like that. It makes it feel like the characters aren't for your enjoyment, they're there because that's who they are. It make them feel more real, more independent, and allows for exploration without allowing the viewers to interfere with their development. It just feels more honest that way. So, yeah I like that they're annoying because I feel like it makes the story itself better.\
I really loved the anime by the end of it, so much so, that I read the manga as well and was super thirsty for the next season. It's ridiculously good and well worth watching. I just remember watching it in the beginning and think oh it's this type of anime, or that type of anime, an I kept on being proven that it wasn't exactly this or that. It's just really well done and complex. \
OH COMPLEXITY HOW COULD I FORGET. This shit is so good, like the foreshadowing, oh my goodness, and the suspense, oh my goodness, like I just want all of the story right now so I can figure this shit out you have no idea. THERE ARE SUCH IMPORTANT THINGS NOT EXPLAINED THAT JUST LEAVE YOU SO READY FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAS YET TO COME. Especially if you are someone who loves details like I do. They keep on hinting at stuff and \"approaching\" stuff and then it's like lol nope. Do you know how much food they've dangled in front of me only to lead me into yet another trap of awesomeness to cover up their taunting illusions?! Oh they are so good at misdirection it nerves me! One of the major reasons I continue to watch this anime is because of the small things and because of the many things we do not know of yet. So good so good. \
And the MUSIC holy shizam. I personally thought music was alright, but then the second ending was like, wow i really loved that so much. I did like most of the music anyway though. (I actually downloaded the soundtrack for the anime which I don't do often). I like the voice actors a lot too, they're pretty good. \
Okay, so it sounds like I'm bashing this anime a bit, but I really do love it a lot. It's got such a great story and is wonderfully developed by the end of it. It's become one of my favorite animes where before I thought it was \"Ehhhhh.\" Now it's just.... I JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH. Also, in the very last episode, I am telling you now, watch until the very last second or so help me we will have a problem. It is essential that you do so, understand? So yeah there's my very odd review of Attack on Titan. I hope you also fall in love with it! \

    Attack On Titan; The anime known by everyone and loved by most. \"BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME!\" some say. \"BEST ANIME OF 2013!\" even more preach. \"WHY SO OVERRATED?!\" can be heard in the background. Out of all those, what am I saying? \
. . . IT'S PRETTY GREAT!\
\
The PLOT:\
The plot (because MOST wouldn't know, would they) can be summarized as the human race's fight against a threat of total annihilation. To add insult to injury, by ugly deformities that look like men. OH THE UGLY HUMANITY! \
The plot is actually a pretty good one. Although it has obviously been used before, I haven't seen\
          \
        any anime recently that have done it well. I have not read the manga yet, but so far through the anime, I have found hardly any plot holes that were probably placed unintentionally. The plot seems to be going on a great track. \
One of the odd things I noticed was that was probably better seen with the element of suspension of disbelief is how they managed to go from guns to gas-powered, navigationally-controlable, FUEL SUPPLIED DUE-HICKIES. Your man-on-man guns don't work, huh? Why not try to make 'Anti-Titan' guns by improving the aim and get a sharper point on your lead-balls. You could've probably invented a modern anti-tank rifle before you created that 3D Maneuver Gear. What's the downside to a gun though? Two things: \
1. You would have to sneak up on them by waiting until their back is turned before firing.\
2. You wouldn't get those kick***, mind-boggling, eye methamphetamine of action sequences (Se graphics)\
The plot is very engrossing, as the many questions presented by the plot usually present more and more questions that all lead to the biggest question of all: \"What are the titans? Why are they here?How do they reproduce? Why do they kill when their metabolism seems to be like that of a plant (producer class metabolism)?\" These are the main reasons that make the titans kind of creepy for me. A world filled with creatures that are superior to us whose reasons to kill is unknown and whose known information is selective and cryptic. As the story continues, we keep getting introduced to new forms and traits of titans, new phenomena, and new implied information. I would hate to be in such a world, uncertain of the enemy on the world in which our races reside in. It can be unnerving, which makes it great.\
Simply put, the plot is great, although the suspension of disbelief is sometimes recommended. Not everything has to make sense to the greatest extent. It is very interesting, and is done very well.\
\
ART: \
WHAT DO YOU THINK? The visuals are OBVIOUSLY great and very well worked on. OR at least if you don't get too picky.\
The basic artsy layout is a VERY detailed background on top of VERY rough characters. The background graphics could at some points by seen as overly done if anything, and are very appealing to the eye. The sketch-styled characters really make the background stand out (EVEN MORE). I will point out that if you watch the anime in top resolution (720p or 1080p), you may notice some mishaps on scenes that they thought could be made AMAZING with the implementation of epic-scaled graphically-programmed scenery that you could easily overlooked. These aren't really bad, for-say. To me, they are fun easter eggs. An example of that was in Episode 18, when the female titan ran directly above Eren; After the titan slid back, that computer-programmed tree top that it split from the bottom fell in the background in slow motion, seamlessly penetrated the ground with no resistance and no ground damage as if going through a mirage, and slowly fell with the ground unscathed. It's minor and short, and could be easily overlooked, but it is a sign that not EVERYTHING is perfect. Still, it was all great.\
The titan design was usually pretty good and somewhat disturbing. They are supposed to closely resemble humans if they were left naked, dumb, and slightly deformed. At the beginning scenes, they do a great job, but sometimes they push the similarities too far. For example, what kind of barber decorated the combed back hair and policeman like trim on that titan.\

Along with that, what was up with that skeleton-like titan Levi was to fight. They are a little too UN-human, don't you think? \

All in all, if you were to get really picky, you could name many flaws with the graphics, but the graphics are amazing when looked upon as a whole. GREAT! JUST GREAT!\
\
Sound: \
The sound was synched B-E-A-UTIFULLY to the numerous battle sequences throughout the show. I always enjoyed listening to the awkward and abstract sound effects. They all seemed like combinations of techno backgrounds, medieval themes, eerie sound effects, and opera. TONS AND TONS OF OPERA. Surprisingly enough, after the first half was released and people started posting the OST collection on YouTube, I actually got very bored with the random music, showing that the music was made well only after it was battle-implimented. \
One odd thing that I noticed was the odd indian-like singing that was disturbingly placed in the background of random songs for no apparent reason. The first time that I noticed was in the ending of eighteen during the tense awaiting of the unknown to show up. It kinda made the situation awkward for me, and nothing else. The second time was in 23, when the super-loud and booming music could be concentrated on enough to hear the indian sound as the camera zooms away from the blonde whatshername. It was extremely easy to ignore, yet they still did it. It's probably just me, so don't worry about that.\
\
Characters:\
Here is where I think the anime could have done better, but not by too much. At the beginning, the protagonist is this little kid who always lost his temper on people he didn't find strong. Because HE was the strong one, right. That KID was the strongest little twelve-or-so year old shounen EVER, right? WRONG! He was very weak and was protected and boosted ego-wise by his (what I call indebted) friend whom he helped by sadistically stabbing a sex trader or two who stole her and killed her parents and giving her a pep talk to help her EPICALLY plunge the last guy's insides with a knife. The kid is very hatable, somebody who I halfway wanted to punch in the face for getting hostile to those he deemed weak. \
At the ending of the first episode, his emotions turn from a hate for titans to a bigger hate for titans. Throughout the rest of the series, he gets a military position, increases his hate, and decreases his levels of sensitization. Then, he gets a new ability, increases his hate, and decreases his levels of sensitization. Then, he gets promoted, increases his hate, and decreases his levels of sensitization. I don't see any patterns there. \
So, yeah. The series is centered around a character driven throughout the series by nothing more than hate. I don't always think that that is the world's best plot setup, but it does create for some good action sequences and dialogue.\
Also, the many characters obviously do not provide for the best relationships between the protagonist and his comrades, but that is understandable, as there are obviously too many of them and most of them are to be nothing more than death counts. Honestly, one of the things that failed me was\
(SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN UP TO EPISODE 13 OR SO. TO GET PAST IT, SKIP TO THE NEXT ENTER)\
the emotional connection to Marco. When the guy found his friend Marco leaning on the building half-rotten and pale, he hardly recognize him. In my case, I didn't recognize him AT ALL! No, they did not make his corpse that gross. In fact, I probably wouldn't have recognized him if he was standing up in perfect condition and yelling \"HERE I AM\" in his great voice. This was supposed to be a scene of incredible emotional tole, but I couldn't recognize him because I had no idea who he was. He didn't have many speaking roles and blended in like any other to-be-killed grunt of the military. Still, I had to look him up on the wiki.\
(SPOILERS OVER)\
As you can see, I didn't the characters that much. Mikasa's bad***ery made me enjoy her, and Levi and his wife (yeah, right) were my close second favorites, but Eren was a huge pain. Yes, weakness had to do greatly with it. He improves a lot and becomes useful, but his hate-driven character is not my favorite. \
\
Overall:\
Despite all of this, I love the show and am sorry that the last episode of the season is coming next week. I loved the highly illogical Maneuver Gear for its flashy use. I loved the scenery for its epic detail. I loved the bad***ery present in some of the characters. I LOVED the cool graphics. The plot is by far my favorite part, and it is extremely gripping. My only problem was Eren and the I'm-a-dead-man soldiers. The production value was high, and it paid off. I am hoping for another season, because god knows he isn't going to escape the you-know-who, reach the you-know-where, and discover the you-probably-don't-know-what, and defeat the you-know-whom. Let us wait for the last week. \

    This is a show that i wanted to like more, it has ambition, and very interesting premise, and some fantastic battle scenes. There's a real sense of tension every time we see the giants appear, and there's also a nice mystery cooking in the background that keeps you guessing. The animation is fluid, a good score, and overall solid in every technical aspect.\
My problem then comes with our main characters. One is your usual anime hyperactive \"i'm gonna do stuff real loud\" generic protagonist. He's impulsive, reckless, and not very bright but full of energy. In contrast we get a girl that is the silent\
          \
        oh-so-deadly warrior, who's obviously superior to the protagonist in terms of skills and judgment. Yet she's usualy a complete bore to watch, even when we discover the background story of her childhood, i still couldn't feel much empathy for her.\
I still enjoyed most of the show, but it didn't remain in my mind afterwards. Not as, say, Guin Saga and Mononoke. Months after watching them i still keep thinking about them. This one has potential, i still will see the second season. I haven't read the manga, but i assume it has better character development.\

    This anime is amazing and one of the best ones I seen. It's one of those type animes that keep you watching and not wanting to stay. There is lots of action, drama, and yes gore. But at the same time the story doesn’t skip out on crafting a strong story line the builds and the characters are well developed. There actually times where I was wanted to cry and there times where I would say \"What the...\" in certain scenes.\
The artwork of the anime is stunning as well. I think the person created it is amazing and news how to create a work of\
          \
        art. The soundtrack with the anime is also great and it's one of those instances where the anime and the music work perfectly. In fact throughout the time of watching Attack on Titan, I listened to the soundtrack when I'm not. I replayed the openings and ending over and over. It's that good. For those who haven't seen the anime give it a go before the next season comes. The links to the anime is below.\

    SPOILERS OF COURSE!\
This is going to be an insanely short review and I'm not going to touch upon the story just yet, because the series has barely passed the half-way point.  Anyone who has reviewed the story thus far is a fool, because things can change quite drastically with 12 episodes left to go. (imagine reviewing Evangelion at the 12 episode point without seeing the other 12).\
I will say this.  the story is set up rather well.  Titans spawn out of nowhere and push humanity to the brink of extinction.  I can give that an 8 as of this point.\
As for\
          \
        the art, in all honesty, I'll just say this.  The scenery is beautiful... the quick movements as the characters speed through the sky using their maneuver gear is well animated and smooth, HOWEVER, my issue comes with the characters.  Their lining is SO DAMN THICK that I seriously still have not gotten used to the series after 14 episodes.  apart from that though, it's not horrible or anything, it's just something I'm not used to, so, I gave it a 7.\
The sound is fantastic.  The opening theme took a while to get used to, since I'm not into Male Japanese singers, only female, but it has certainly grown on me.  Apart from that though, the Soundtrack, the background music throughout has been absolutely stunning, and certainly gets the mood built up as our heroes swing through the sky slashing titans... all except for...\
ARMIN.  yah.  Armin.  as far as characters go, I have really liked everyone.  except Armin.  I actually don't even think he has killed a single titan up to this point of the series.  He's the exact type of character I dislike in anime.  I TOTALLY thought that when Eren was eaten by that titan, that Armin was going to go bat shit crazy and start killing everything in sight.  now, I get it, this anime seems to take a bit more of a realistic approach to how SERIOUSLY doing this would affect a person, and I get it.  It would be traumatizing as hell, and many of the characters DO have their moments where they are completely traumatized, and THAT'S FINE. That's completely realistic, but damn it Armin, just seriously, get your shit together.  EVERY other character is simply great and have all had their moments of being entertaining, fun, and bad ass.  EVERYONE.  except Armin.\
As far as enjoyment goes, I'm definitely enjoying the series, however, each episode, a character seems to have an epiphany where they  monologue for 10 minutes, and sometimes, yeah, that's important, however, many times it's basically the exact same things they said in previous episodes, and the bad thing is, it always seems to happen JUST as the action scenes are about to start, and you're ready to see some bad ass titan slaying.  or, even worse, it happens IN THE MIDDLE of the titan slaying and you're stuck waiting to finish an awesome action scene while a character has a monologue about plot points that have already been established.\
Overall, it's so far a good series.  I'm enjoying what I see, and apart from Armin, the characters are enjoyable and realistic.  Along with a badass soundtrack, this series delivers heartpounding action scenes that will keep you wanting more... until the monologue starts half-way through.  \

    My two reasons for watching this were its insane popularity along with the fact Bobduh didn't drop it, so I figured, how bad can it be? ...and dived right into it. At first it seemed like an interesting concept, but later it proved to be just a god damn shounen that has no intention of actually being over by the episode 25. That's what I get for not researching beforehand. And that would all be great if plot wasn't so damn slow. It has its good points, so it isn't a total waste. Particularly its world and the idea of everyone fighting big ass titans\
          \
        using spiderman like abilities. \
What was keeping me interested the most was to see the development of the story, to see how they will uncover the secrets of what's actually going on, and then what will they do about it and how. That would have been mind kind of story. We get some fighting and some non fighting, and find out a couple of clues for what might be going on with the world, and that's it. My biggest problem with this is that it's just shounen enough for it to matter. It means the plot logic suffers, and the pacing suffers, and the average IQ suffers. And all those combined make the show nearly unwatchable for me. \
It's not totally shounen though, at least enough to leave me hoping it'll actually do something useful with its second half. But then halfway through second half I realised this isn't gonna be over any time soon. It felt stupid dropping it at that point so I just finished it for the sake of finishing it. My opinion of this was going to be highly based of what the show will do with the overall world situation questions and how it will handle it. It ended up not answering them and hence not handling it at all. So it's silly to write a review for this as it could be either 10% of the story or 50% of the story. But even though I'm interested to see the resolution of what the fuck is going on with the world, I don't think I'll be watching the next season, for this season annoyed me to the point of nearly dropping it at places. \
Lot of action sequences were really fun and high budget. Some visuals were good. Overall style being a bit distinctive was both a plus and a minus for me, as well as the design of titans, as it's both unique and innovative, as well as visually unappealing and creepy as fuck. Though I guess it needs to be pointed out this doesn't suck as much as actual shounens, like Magi or Naruto or whatever, it's still far above that.\

    I find the world of Shingeki no Kyojin to be fairly well defined. In the opener episode of Shingeki it briefly touches up on the effects the Titans have on society. Character tropes are established. Then an horrendously exhilarating Titan invasion finishes off the opener leaving one wanting more. And it doesn't let up, humans are pushed back without a light of hope. This gives the viewer an idea of how desperate the situation is. But while I love the world of Shingeki no Kyojin the story starts to drag itself as it gets further into the story. Minor characters have character development and long\
          \
        monologues that do not seem to serve a purpose. \
I love the art style of Shingeki no Kyojin. The high contrast and the defined shapes give a good sense of depth. Separating the characters apart from the 3D background. The fast paced action scenes are animated brilliantly. Now what sets the animation back for me is that it seems incomplete, if not obviously incomplete. Still frames that become more apparent as the story progresses, choppy animation in the latter half of the first season and most disappointingly are the unlayered 3D polygons that show up in the anime. It is difficult to forgive an anime that is unfinished. \
I love Hiroyuki Sawano's music. And the tone his music fits Shingeki no Kyojin perfectly. Intense orchestra music to heighten the situation or rock music to accompany the action scenes. The voice actors do their jobs perfectly. Great emotions of desperation and anger are felt by the main cast and even some of the minor characters. \
Strong and aggressive characters are nice because they seem to pull the story along nicely. Eren likes to be served on a hot plate full of character development. Mikasa is the badass silent type who supports the main character, basically his women. Making it hard to hate her. Then we have Armin, the weak guy who depends on everyone else. As far as my opinion goes, I do not believe the 3 make a good trio. But each of them in their own spotlight, make for a pretty interesting watch. \
I was completely invested into this anime from episode 1. Everything about it wowed me. There were parts in the anime where my jaw dropped and parts where I felt chills down all the way to my bones. Honestly I loved this anime as my number 1 anime of Spring 2013. But then I lost that fire as the story progressed. So unfortunately what I wanted to give a 10 for enjoyment just doesn't meet the criteria.\
I like the world. I like the style. I like Hiroyuki Sawano. I like Eren Jaegar. I liked this Anime. I like it at 7.\

    Attack on Titan (Attack of the Titans) has an interesting history, in fact, the real problem comes in its execution, leaving enough desire, both in story, characters and even in action scenes without saying that the pro final medium anime becomes something quite ridiculous, but managing to impress for its graphic violence, art and even the soundtrack and irritability for its protagonist worthy of pity, I think many would give anything to take a beating in Eren, so boring itIt is.\

 Mikasa is Eren's adoptive sister and mutual childhood friend of Armin. Mikasa shares an unbreakable bond with Eren following events in their past, and rushes to protect him whenever he is in danger. Mikasa possesses impressive fighting skill and strength even as a child.\
 \
 As a teen, Mikasa is considered a genius among all the army trainees and is incredibly skilled at combat and agility. She constantly worries for Eren's well-being and lives to protect him.\
 \
 When Mikasa was younger, her parents were murdered and she was taken hostage to be sold into slavery. Eren managed to find her and killed two of the three kidnappers by catching them off guard, despite only being a child. The third kidnapper discovered the scene and began strangling Eren while holding him in the air. Mikasa, trembling, grabbed Eren's knife from the floor. In that split second, Mikasa came to terms with the cruelty of the world, gaining perfect control of her own body and using that strength to kill the kidnapper in a single strike through the heart&mdash;killing him to save Eren.\
 \
 In the aftermath of this trauma, Mikasa asked Dr. Jeager where she could possibly go from here. She was cold and had no place left to call home. Eren gave Mikasa his red scarf and Dr. Jeager welcomed her into their family. Because of Eren's heroics and this gesture, she feels she owes her life to the Jeagers. She continues to wear Eren's scarf from that day into adulthood, and they are inseparable.\

 Eren is Shingeki no Kyojin's protagonist. His adoptive sister, Mikasa, notes on numerous occasions that he acts on impulse without thinking things through, and she often pulls/carries/throws him when he starts fighting with others to protect him from himself. Along with Mikasa, he tends to spend his free time with their mutual friend, Armin.\
 \
 His father is a doctor (whom is well respected by Hannes and potentially many more) whilst his mother is a housewife.\
 \
 When Eren was a child, he saved Mikasa from being sold off when a visit to her home with his father. Three men&mdash;killers of her parents&mdash;were in her house, and he killed two of them&mdash;one by slitting his throat and the other by charging at with a quickly assembled spear. Mikasa herself killed the third man after Eren urged her to fight whilst the man strangled Eren. After this, he gave Mikasa his scarf and Eren's father adopted Mikasa into their family.\
 \
 Later, when the Colossal Titan broke through Wall Maria the debris from this attack scattered and hurtled towards his home. He could only watch on as his mother&mdash;trapped under the rubble of their house&mdash;was eaten by a titan. This event lit the fire of revenge within Eren that he would kill every giant and not live a life cowering in fear.\
 \
 Sometime after this&mdash;before the time skip that jumped a few years ahead, to when he became a soldier&mdash;his father injected him with something. It's unknown what at this time but it turns out, because of the injection, Eren can utilize the ability to transform into a titan himself (which explains how his limbs were able to regenerate) with side effects of a high fever and massive stamina drain.\
 Eren has a special titan power called the \"Co-ordinates\", by which he can direct abnormal titans to attack elsewhere.\

 Marco Bott is a member of the 104th Trainees Squad, and graduated as the 7th ranked trainee in his class. He was assigned to fight the Titans after the breach of Wall Rose, and given command of his own squad. \
 \
 <b>Personality</b>\
 Marco is an idealistic person, valuing the good of the group above his own interests as well as understanding and coping with his own shortcomings and limitations. The others respected him greatly, and considered him to be a natural leader suited to his dreams of joining the Military Police. Unlike those who join the Military Police for safety and privileges, his reasons of joining it were genuinely faithful. He was shown to be an excellent judge of others, recognizing Jean's potential as a leader and encouraging him to believe in himself. He was also shown to have a talent for preserving order among the other trainees, whether resolving arguments or keeping them calm during battle.\
 \
 <b>Story</b>\
 Marco is first introduced during the initiation of new recruits, and is intimidated by their instructor after expressing his desire to join the Military Police. He later attempts to maintain order when the recruits question Eren about the attack on Wall Maria, hiding the others when their questions become too upsetting. During his time as a trainee, he befriends Jean Kirschtein and the two were often seen together. He seems to have been one of the only people to recognize Jean's potential, encouraging him to embrace his natural abilities as a leader.\
 \
 After the Colossal Titan attacked Trost, Marco was assigned command of the 19th Trainee Squad and ordered to support the vanguard forces. He was eventually among the trainees stranded when the retreat order was given, without enough gas to scale the Wall and escape Trost. When Mikasa and Jean rally the others into charging headquarters, which had become surrounded by Titans, Marco is quick to join them. Inside the station, he became vital in Armin's plan to reclaim the overun supply room and leads the main group. Armed with rifles, the recruits acted as bait and lure the seven Titans occupying the room into position. Marco managed to maintain order in the group, keeping everyone calm until they could fire and blind the attacking Titans.\
 \
 He is later seen among the regrouped forces, attempting to keep order when people like Dazz give into their fear. Marco did his best to comfort them and keep morale high, even when they were ordered to return to Trost. He joined the other recruits up on the Wall, acting as bait to distract the Titans from the main operation involving Eren Yeager. Later, he was among the recruits that head into the city to battle the Titans. There, he helped to rescue Jean when his gear malfunctioned and would eventually join the others in battling the Titans while Eren sealed the hole in Wall Rose. \
 \
 He dies during the battle for Trost. His death serves to illustrate the grim reality of life for the soldiers, as even the most talented can meet an ignoble end while facing the Titans. \

 Dazz is a member of the 104th Trainees Squad.\
 \
 In chapter 12, when Dot Pixis announces the plan to reconquer Trost District, Dazz has a breakdown and starts screaming that he doesn't want to die. Though Marco Bott tries to quiet him, a commanding officer overhears and threatens to execute him. Dazz replies that execution would be better then being eaten by a Titan. However, Dot Pixis then announces that all deserters will be pardoned&mdash;but have to live with the guilt that they abandoned their families to the Titans. Dazz is unable to leave his family to that fate, and returns to participate in the operation to plug the breach.\
 \
 After the mission, he briefly appears in Chapter 21 standing next to Sasha Blouse when Irvin Smith gives a speech urging the 104th Training Squad members to join the Scouting Legion. As he is not present in the group of trainees who join, he presumably opted for the Stationary Guard instead.\
 In Ch. 40, Ymir and Historia Reiss recount a story about Dazz from training. Wanting praise and recognition, Dazz undertook harsh physical training in the snowy mountains. However, he wasn't strong enough to endure it, and nearly died. Ymir told Krista to leave him behind or her own life would be endangered; when Krista refused, Ymir used her Titan shifter powers to bring Dazz back to the camp safely.\

This choice ultimately causes further casualties and forces the scouting legion to dump bodies weighing down the carts. After this incident, Levi confronts Dieter and hands him Petra's Scouting Legion Badge saying that it was Ivan's.

 Annie is a Titan-shifter, and as such, it was revealed that she is the Female Titan who killed most of the Scouting Legion members during their 57th expedition. Annie was part of a group of Titan-shifters that initially aimed to wipe out the humans inhabiting the walls until the revelation of Eren's capability to transform into a Titan forced them to change their plans on capturing him instead. She is also the culprit behind the killings of the two captive Titans that Hange was researching.\
 \
 As the Female Titan, she had attempted to kidnap Eren on numerous occasions, with the two even engaging in hand-to-hand combat in their Titan forms. She aims to capture Eren with the supposed goal of bringing him \"somewhere.\" When she was suspected by Armin to be the Female Titan, the Scouting Legion had set up a trap to capture and interrogate her, though she was able to see through their plot which resulted in her attempting to escape. Mikasa and Eren manage to stop her from escaping, and when the soldiers tried to bring her out of her Titan form, reminded of her father, she wrapped herself inside a hard crystal thus making the soldiers unable to obtain any information from her.\
 \
 Though she is affiliated with Bertolt and Reiner, she tends to isolate herself from her fellow Titan-shifters. Despite her callousness and brutality in physical combat, she has shown genuine concern and respect towards her past classmates, notably Eren and Armin. Despite her seeming disinterest toward her own combat skills, Eren has deduced that she has a great fondness for it, as evidenced by her showing interest in further teaching him her techniques. As the Female Titan, she has the unique ability to generate a hard crystalline substance to protect/cover specific parts of her body.\

Sasha saves him from falling to his death by firing one of her grappling hooks into his leg. Eren tells Sasha to take Samuel somewhere safe, then instructs the other trainees to attack the Colossal Titan. \

 As Samuel has not been seen again since then, it is unknown whether he lived or died.\

 Hange is very passionate and driven in pursuit of new knowledge. She can be seen as very hyperactive, often diving into projects without thought for personal safety (and frightening lots of subordinates in the process), instead preoccupied with observing and documenting the subjects. Some misunderstand these acts and Hange is seen as eccentric and having more than a few screws loose. She also enjoys discussing this research, but as the lectures can be very long and detail-oriented, not many fellow soldiers find them interesting.\
 \
 Hange is often excited by Titans and is always eager to experiment with them, coming off as extremely emotional regarding titans. For example, she cries at the amount of pain being caused to a Titan during experimentation.\

  synopsis = "Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations. After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.
