    To witness such influential work after so much time is a truly wondrous experience. Hokuto no Ken has set many standards -- as formulaic as they may be -- that are still used today. One would believe that it will be a vichyssoise of platitudes, but instead it presents itself in a more qualitative fashion than works of today which are based on same formula.\
Hokuto no Ken tells story about ambitious and brave men in a world where compassion and love would seem pointless. It subtly indicates on necessary human values, which are easily missed underneath its excessive violence. There isn't one main plot which\
          \
        extends throughout the entire manga, but more like series of episodes which are all loosely tied together. Often will you feel that content was abruptly thrown in, rather than initially planned. This was due to obvious money milking reasons, which prevented possibility for fluid progression.   \
Artistic impression will remain memorable, especially in the later chapters when Tetsuo improves his meticulousness and utilizes wide panels as best as possible. From the very start and onward there's a steady improvement in his art, be it the post-apocalyptic scenery, facial expressions or motion from panel to panel. However, his sense for proportions is a bit distorted, maybe those grandiose anatomical features were done with goal of portraying magnificence or rather sheer force of certain characters, but even as such they remain off-putting at first and require getting used to them.\
Side characters received excellent characterization and are easily relatable to. Even villains have more profound reasons behind their atrocious actions and leave you with bitter taste in your mouth after they are killed. However, some of revelations (motives) felt quite asinine, far fetched, and should have been avoided completely. \
Kenshiro serves his purpose as allegory for God. Be it certain situations in which he's depicted, how other characters perceive him, or his very personality. You could say that he merely serves to keep things in motion, for it is very difficult to feel attached to his character. He is how he is throughout the entire manga, there are no surprises regarding him, and emotional response is mostly drawn from the way he affects other characters, never from him directly. This weird approach makes him devoid of usual -- intelligence insulting -- typicalities that main characters have, but in no way does it make him an ideal one. \
Hokuto no Ken could easily be classed as masterpiece, but, I personally like to consider it as a far from perfect -- enveloped in a peculiar charm -- timeless classic. ",

Well you're in luck because this manga is the manliest one around (yes I've read Berserk) .It's the epitome of manliness .The 'man' in 'manga' has never been so fitting .\
Plot - 8\
Well I obviously wasn't reading this for fan service so I can say that the story  was pretty good .There's a difference between this and Berserk though .This story as a whole isn't as good because the story telling isn't as smooth .There are some cases of the notorious Deus Ex Machina\
          \
        moments which come up in this manga .Obviously the MCs abilities can cover many areas in an understandable fashion but when you somehow have the ability to make someone tell the truth in one chapter but for the rest of the manga that power isn't called upon again the reader might feel slightly put-off .The last parts of it also felt a bit dragged out and unnecessary .The first part of it however was extremely...........manly .\
Art - 8\
This art is sort of weird for me to judge .Sometimes its downright awesome but some other times (especially in the some fight scenes) it felt sort of lacking .The characters' martial arts also felt a bit bland to watch (head splitting aside) .I liked the art a lot but I'll cut down a mark since it's a bit inconsistent .The drawings of horses and machines are especially glorious if you ask me .The characters' design are also very...err........manly .\
Characters - 6\
Ah yes ,this is the weakest point .No I didn't dislike them at all .It's just that some of them were so (and I hate to use the term) one-dimensional .Some villains were practically just badly written .Backstories for some of them also pop up out of nowhere sometimes as though it's just a convenient plot device .I feel like they could have been handled better to be honest .I also didn't really feel anything when some of them died apart from a loss of some.........manliness\
Enjoyment - 8.6\
Not quite at Berserk's level if you ask me but great nonetheless .I can't give it a 9 on my list but I can say that it's a pretty strong 8 .More people should read this because it's pretty damn good .Manly deaths ,lines and characters were a great plus if you ask me and I could mostly ignore the things I didn't like because each time I was about to feel like it was dropping in quality Kenshiro just had to say \"Omae wa mou shindeiru\" .\

    Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star) is a series primarily known in the west nowadays for over the top manliness, a few memes such as \"Omae wa mou shindeiru\" and it's anime movie being glorious, gory 80s action. Compared to it's peer in 80s Shonen Dragon Ball or the series it inspired, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Hokuto no Ken has become vastly underrated today, despite it easily being one of the best series to come out of the Shonen demograph.\
Note: I will only be reviewing the first 136 chapters of the manga. This is because whilst the 2nd part introduces quite a few new\
          \
        details, the numerous retcons, plot holes and overused tropes within Part 2 make it's entirety a disservice to the series when chapter 136 already gave the manga a solid, complete ending.\
The plot of the manga is somewhat simplistic, yet well executed. Whilst there is some escalation in scale of keeping the stakes high with each major enemy, it never reaches the point where past foes such as Shin ever lose their relevance due to the combat relying more on skillful techniques than raw power, making it a stark contrast to the typical Shonen. There is very little plot holes within the series as well, with the only ones standing out being the plot point of Raoh being shocked if he were to see how similar Mamiya looked to Yuria never happening and the Tenryu Kokyu Ho's effects seeming to have been retconned by the time of the Souther Arc.\
Leaving aside these smaller aspects, the story with it's grim post-apocalyptic setting, fusion of 80s and medieval aspects and a well executed hero's journey lead to quite an enjoyable story.\
The characters within the world are hard to judge as a whole. Though most are likeable for the sheer manliness aspect of the series, only Rei, Mamiya and maybe Raoh gained much development. However, all the main cast are fleshed out well enough and each one has a web of connections to other characters in the series to help make their interactions and goals quite interesting. For example, how Jagi links to Shin and Kenshiro as a manipulator of the plot's events, the differing goals of the Nanto Rokusei members or the conflict of the Hokuto brothers help make most of the cast engaging. The only character I found actively dislikeable was Lin having no use beyond being a plot device and damsel in distress, yet even she had her moments.\
Some of the elements of it's cast seem to be particularly outstanding in their class. For example, Kenshiro's somewhat anti-hero role of being clear he doesn't consider himself a saviour/hero or Raoh having quite a few layers to his character beyond being a mere bad guy help display it as a great influence for the story telling of Shonen manga in general. The rivalry between these two characters is second only to Rikishi and Joe's within Ashita no Joe in terms of Shonen rivalries, with a clear balance between hatred and respect for each other and both growing in various ways throughout the series.\
Furthermore, Mamiya is one of the most well realised female characters within the medium. Whilst never given enough prominence to seem to relevant, her past, determination and weakness helps her present the idea of a female doing what she can in a world in which her disadvantage is obvious, much akin to someone such as a less plot relevant Oscar from Rose of Versailles or Casca from Berserk.\
The art is easily the series' strongest point and helps make it such an entertaining work. The very realistic, well shaded and detailed artwork that just gets constantly better throughout the series is a feast for the eyes only surpassed by a handful of manga series that help make the series so well known. With it's distinct  style of characters' eyes and faces to the general testosterone fuelling muscle mass, great gore and manly tears, there's nothing not to love about the art that helps keep any lover of 80s pop culture engaged.\
Overall, Hokuto no Ken is a series that whilst not the top tier in any of it's fields, performs good enough in all categories to be considered one of the best Shonen series out there, or manga series in general. Just stay away from the Part 2 material.\

    Was one of the defining battle manga along with Dragon Ball and I sometimes wish this one had turned out to be the most popular because it has a lot going for it. Great apocalyptic setting with the gore and violence, characters actually die and don't have that Dragon Ball problem of coming back to life and had amazing art for a weekly series.\
Takes a few chapters to find itself, Ken is overpowered  and obliterates everything until he encounters his first major antagonist which takes 30+ chapters. The second half of the manga was weaker and only existed because of pressure on the mangaka\

    Hidden meanings in works of fiction are only apparent if you look hard enough within stories. Amongst manga series, Fist of the North Star is a prime example. What appears to be a shonen battle series is actually less of a mindless slugfest than you think. Upon inspection, a deep examination of the human condition can be found.\
Why do we live, and what do we live for? The various characters of Fist of the North Star have different answers to these questions.\
Kenshiro has become an icon of Japanese pop culture, and is responsible for most if not all shonen protagonists who followed him, being not\
          \
        just a fighter, but the best fighter around. Before Dragon Ball invented the tropes of shonen series, Kenshiro was around, ending evil wherever he found it.\
He is not, as many say, an antihero, as that  becomes apparent when other members of the cast appear.\
The art is simply sublime from start to finish. There isn't a gradual rise in quality, it starts the way it means to go on. I don't think any other shonen series matches the quality of its artwork.\
If you want a shonen series with less focus on teenage protagonists are more focus on blood-and-guts (if you're squeamish, don't even go near this series) combat, this\
iis the one for you.\

 A strong and mostly stoic character, Kenshirou is compelled to punish evil-doers and can perform feats not possible for most people. His mastery of the ancient martial art Hokuto Shinken allows him to kill or cripple with a mere touch. The results tend to be very messy -it usually causes parts of the victim to explode- but the art also includes several other means of killing. He can also use this art to heal or to alter people's behavior. Later in the series Kenshirou learns parts of other martial arts.\
 \
 When angry his spiritual powers reach their peak, normally culminating in the dramatic destruction of his shirt and jacket (which, despite the obvious lack of a wardrobe or clothing store, are always replaced in the next episode or story arc) to expose his muscular torso.\
 \
 His catchphrase is Omae wa mō shindeiru (おまえはもう死んでいる), meaning \"You are already dead,\" which he usually says before a villain's head is about to explode.\
 \
 After surviving the nuclear war, he tries to live in peace with his fiancee Yuria, until Jagi instigates Shin, a jealous rival from the Nanto Seiken school, to challenge, then defeat Kenshirou. Shin then engraves the iconic seven scars on Kenshirou's chest and leaves him for dead. Prior to this event he was more forgiving of his enemies, as shown in a flashback of Jagi's failed assassination attempt against him, in which Kenshirou chooses to spare Jagi's life after defeating him rather than end it. When Kenshirou later fights his old rivals in the present, particularly Shin, Jagi, and Raoh, they all remark on Kenshirou's acquired mercilessness.\
 \
 The initial story arc centers around Kenshirou's quest to reclaim Yuria from Shin. In the very first chapter, he meets a pair of orphans who follows him in his journey: Bat, a thief; and Lin, a young girl rescued by Ken. Through the course of the series, Kenshirou protects the weak and innocent from the numerous gangs roaming the post-apocalyptic wasteland, eventually gaining his reputation as the \"Savior of the Century's End.\" Kenshirou's skills improve through his encounters with members of the Nanto Roku Seiken and his Hokuto Brothers.\
 \
 Although still emotionally repressed and stoic like most male heroes in 1980's media, Kenshirou is notable in anime culture for being a sensitive and kind-hearted man who broke the then-ironclad \"men don't cry\" cultural expectation. He is famous for openly shedding tears, if not outright weeping for the suffering of innocents and the deaths of his few noble enemies. This trait is unfortunately downplayed in the 1980's anime adaptations, but comes back into the franchise in the adaptations of the 1990s and onward. \
 \
 In the 1970s, Kenshirou was born in Taiseiden, Land of Asura to the Hokuto Sōke family. Ryūken named Kenshirou after his older brother, Kenshirou Kasumi, because both had a Big Dipper-shaped birthmark on their heads. The identity of his parents has never been made clear, but he has an older brother named Hyō. Hyō and Kenshirou were caught in a fire and were rescued by Kaiō's Mother, at the cost of her life.\
 \
 With the Land of Asura in political turmoil, Jūkei send the baby Kenshirou away to Japan with Raoh and Toki to be raised by Ryūken.\

For this blunder he was scolded by Toki and subsequently swore revenge on both Toki and the Village of Miracles. \
 Amiba later teamed up with Jagi, who helped make Amiba resemble Toki and even scarred his back with a club to recreate Toki's scar. Amiba then learned enough Hokuto Shin Ken techniques from Jagi to successfully impersonate Toki. With the real Toki imprisoned in Cassandra, Amiba tarnished his image and tortured both civilians and martial artists with his experiments.\

 He performed sadistic \"new pressure point tests\" on living humans and reported his findings to Raoh. He also claimed that he could learn any martial art under short periods.

He originally resided in a small village run by Toyo, but when the food supply began to run out he left so that the younger orphans could have his share. While wandering he is captured and imprisoned at Lin's village, which is where he meets Kenshiro. Impressed by the strength of Kenshiro, he tags along with him (somewhat by force), believing that this way he will no longer have any trouble finding food. At first, he is depicted as a selfish nuisance, but after a while Bat is shown to be a virtuous person, as evident by his reasons for leaving his home village. Bat is rather cowardly and careless and will often jump to the wrong conclusions, but this masks his kind nature and he is usually willing to help out in a situation when he can. Bat is very good at fixing machines and can also drive, an example being a dune buggy used as transportation throughout the first part of the manga. He looks up to Kenshiro like an older brother, and likewise Kenshiro begins to see him as a younger brother. \
 \
 After viewing Kenshiro's many death battles, he is able to grow remarkably into an expert martial artist. After the time-skip following Raoh's defeat (the segment which corresponds to the Hokuto no Ken 2 anime series), he is the young leader of a band of resistance fighters known as the Hokuto Army (北斗の軍,, Hokuto no Gun?), fighting against the dictatorship of the Imperial General Jakō. He has also fallen in love with Lin, whom he protects without hesitation. When Lin is kidnapped and taken to the Land of Asura, Bat secretly follows Kenshiro to save her (but does not show up until the end of the arc). After saving Lin, who had had her memory erased so that she falls in love with the first person she sees as result of Kaioh's Shikanhaku point, Bat is prepared to let her see Kenshiro first, but Ken walks off before she can wake up and leaves her with Bat. Before he leaves, he tells Bat \"My fate is one of constant battle, you are the only one who can truly make Lin happy\".\
 \
 However, Bat is aware that Lin's feelings for him are not genuine and erases her memory again with his limited Hokuto Shinken knowledge during their wedding. When Kenshiro's memory is erased after a thunderstorm (he assumed that Yuria was the one who erased his memory, so that he can be happy with Lin), Bat poses as him during the fight against the blind Bolge, but is defeated and then tortured by Bolge who believes him to be Kenshiro. Bat is ready to die, so Bolge would think that Kenshiro is dead and no longer search for him. However, Kenshiro and Lin regain their memories and they set off to save Bat. Bolge is killed, but Bat is fatally wounded in the fight. In the very end of the manga, Lin chooses to stay with the (presumed) dead Bat, accepting to reciprocate his feelings out of her free will. When Kenshiro leaves Lin and Mamiya, Bat is then suddenly brought to life. Bat was saved by Kenshiro pressing on his pressure points with the use of Hokuto Shinken. \

The manga and anime gives two different origins thorough the course of the story. In his first origin, Raoh and his biological younger brother Toki, were adopted by Ryuken after their real parents died. A second origin shows that a young Raoh and Toki, along with an infant Kenshiro, were actually refugees who were sent to the \"Eastern Land\" to be trained in the art of Hokuto Shinken by Ryuken. \
 Raoh trained under Ryuken along with Toki and Kenshiro, as well as another student named Jagi. In spite of his ambitions to become the greatest martial artist in the world, Raoh lost the rights to the Hokuto Shinken succession to Kenshiro. Refusing to give up the style, Raoh killed his sifu Ryuken in combat and formed his own army, taking the name of Ken-oh, King of Fist. Among his many subordinates includes his adoptive brother Jagi, the Toki impersonator Amiba, Uighur the Warden of Cassandra Dungeon, Juda of Nanto Seiken, and Ryuga of the Star of Sirius, among others. Raoh also begins to ride a large black stallion named Kokuoh-Go (黒王号, Kokuōgō).\
 \
 Raoh first appears in the story after Kenshiro and his allies destroys Cassandra. Raoh and his army begin to occupy Mamiya's home village afterward. Rei is the first warrior to challenge him, but he proves to be no match against Raoh and is defeated. He is then challenged by both, Ken and Toki, and managed to thwart both. In the end, Raoh fights Ken again and the battle between the two men end in a stalemate, with both too wounded to continue fighting.\
 \
 After Souther's defeat, Raoh re-emerges to resume his \"conquest of the heavens\". He gauges the extent of his recovery by challenging Koryu, Ryuken's former rival for the Hokuto Shinken succession and defeats him. Raoh then challenges his brother Toki to a fight and defeats him, but spares his life out of sympathy due to the fact that Toki was already dying from a terminal disease.\
 \
 Raoh later fights the warriors of the Five Chariots, who challenge Raoh on behalf of the Last General of Nanto Seiken. When Raoh discovers that the Last General is actually Yuria, he rushes to the Capital of Nanto to capture her only to be confronted by Kenshiro, who has now mastered the ultimate Hokuto Shinken technique of Musō Tensei, the Unconscious Transmigration of Souls. Raoh manages to escape from Ken and takes Yuria captive with him.\
 \
 Vowing to overcome the fear he felt fighting Kenshiro, Raoh decides to challenge Fudoh of the Mountains, the first person who ever made him feel fear. During his confrontation with Fudoh, Raoh learns that the only way he can ever learn Musō Tensei is to experience true sorrow. Raoh decides to take Yuria's life to achieve, only to learn that she is already dying from a terminal illness as well. Feeling sympathy for her fate, Raoh is able to master Musō Tensei as well. Raoh challenges Kenshiro to a final battle at the Hokuto Renkitōza, the North Star Mind and Body Training Ground. The two brothers engage in a long grueling battle, in which Kenshiro emerges as the ultimate victor. Raoh praises the strength Ken gained from fighting against other rivals before he uses his remaining life energy to the heavens and restore light to the world.\

Rei is hired alongside Kenshiro by Mamiya to protect her village against the Fang Clan. After Airi is found and rescued by Ken, Rei becomes Kenshiro's closest ally and supports him for a few story arcs. \
 During an assault on the village, Rei challenges Raoh in Kenshiro's honor but is easily defeated by a technique giving him only three excruciating days to live. With the help of Toki's Hokuto Shinken, Rei's life is extended and his hair turns brilliant white. He uses his final moments to avenge Mamiya, who was once tortured by his Nanto Kōkakuken rival, Yuda. Shortly afterwards, Rei dies an off-screen death. In the 1986 movie, Rei again challenges Raoh but this time his death is almost instantaneous.\

 He had secretly fallen in love with Yuria, Kenshiro's lover and had slowly become insanely jealous. Jagi soon corrupted Shin, and convinced him to take Yuria for himself. Shin promptly challenged and defeated Kenshiro, then tried to convince Yuria to love him by wounding Kenshiro with his fingers, giving Kenshiro his distinctive seven scars in the shape of the Big Dipper.

 Shin went on to amass an army to steadily conquer the land, under his flag of \"The Bloody Cross\", in an attempt to fully win Yuria's love.

When he kills someone with his style, his adversaries actually die while feeling great euphoria and pleasure instead of horrifying pain. According to Ken, Toki had the most elegant style of the four brothers and was favored successor to the Hokuto Shinken style.  \
 During the war, Toki was exposed to the nuclear fallout while forced-shutting the jammed doors of the bomb shelter that Ken and Yuria were in. Toki survived for two weeks without food and water, but the nuclear exposure turned his hair white and left him terminally ill. Thus, Toki renounces the succession to the Hokuto Shinken style and becomes a wandering doctor, easing the people's ills. Toki wanders into a village full of sick people and heals everyone there. The village became known as the \"Village of Miracles\" and Toki becomes heralded as a miracle maker. \

 However, Toki is taken captive by Raoh's army and imprisoned at Cassandra, while Amiba impersonates him in an attempt to tarnish Toki's reputation. Kenshiro rescues him from Cassandra and Toki joins him in his battle against Raoh. \

 Toki and Raoh are later revealed to be actual blood brothers; Raoh and Toki were orphaned when they were children and adopted by Ryuken, who was seeking a student to train.

When a hunter killed Toki's pet dog (a parrot in the TV series), Toki demonstrates his fighting ability by pummeling the hunter relentlessly. Realizing that Toki has learned to fight by merely watching his brother, Ryuken began training Toki as well. At that point, Raoh made Toki promise that if he ever followed the wrong path, Toki would try to stop him. Toki attempts to fulfill his promise as an adult, seeking to stop Raoh from using Hokuto Shinken for his own gain. However, the now-weakened Toki is easily outclassed and defeated by Raoh. \

  Toki later dies from his illness after a confrontation with Ryuga, a General in Raoh's army, and tells Kenshiro to \"turn his sorrow into anger\" before dying.

He represents the \"Star of Enchantment, also known as the \"Star of Betrayal.\" Vain and treacherous, Yuda earned his title due to his egotistical vanity and considers himself to be the most beautiful of all warriors. \
 After the nuclear war, Yuda broke up the Nanto Roku Seiken by joining Raoh's army, along with 27 subordinate branches (it is later revealed he was manipulated by Souther into doing so). Vain and treacherous, Yuda keeps a harem of concubines full of female slaves who worship his beauty and is more than willing to sacrifice his own underlings for his own gain.\
 \
 In the past, he kidnapped Mamiya on her 20th birthday, murdering her parents before her eyes and making her part of his harem before she eventually escaped. He fights Rei, who sought to avenge Mamiya's honor. Yuda had been envious of Rei prior to the war, feeling that the beauty of Rei's Suichōken style was overshadowing his Kokakuken style. After he is defeated by Rei, he stabs himself with Rei's hands so he could die \"by someone beautiful like him.\" At his death, he concedes that Rei is more beautiful.\

 Kenshiro and Raoh eventually learn of the Last General's true identity and they both race over to the Nanto Capital to get to Yulia. Eventually Raoh reaches her first and fleets with her to his castle as his captive.

Kenshiro defeats Raoh and sets off with Yulia, whose life expectancy was briefly extended thanks to Raoh, to live their last remaining years together. \
