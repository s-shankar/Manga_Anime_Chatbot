    Note: The following review DOESN'T contain spoilers.\
Akira is a very controversial piece of art &mdash; but a piece of art regardless. It isn't easy to watch it, and it isn't easy to review it, either: Akira the movie is such an ambitious and influential project that grasping it in its entirety is far from being trivial.\
Story\
Akira's story is among those where you need either high intuitive and perceptive abilities to understand everything that goes on, or to watch it several times. It doesn't really help that Katsuhiro Otomo stuffed almost 2000 pages of story into 2 hours of screen time, but at least the movie\
          \
        has considerably good re-watch potential, which might help to release part of the strain.\
What we have is a post-WWIII Tokyo of not-too-distant future, led by greedy politicians and torn apart by terrorists trying to bring down the corrupt power and biker gangs that roam the streets. There is no usual hi-tech cyberpunk fantasies about living online, free information or global communication &mdash; just a demonstratively dystopic setting involving modern society abandoned to rot on its own. This is driven up further by the secret military experiments in attempts to magnify and control human psychic powers, which actually led to the WWIII in the first place. These social, political and semi-scientific, semi-mystical aspects mix and intertwine as a couple of teenagers get accidentally involved in all this mess.\
Art\
Where Akira definitely wins is the art department, being a clear milestone in animation. It's been almost 20 years since its release, and I've yet to see many movies, especially anime, drawn with this amount of detail. There are very few still shots, every movement is scrutinized and animated at 24 frames per second, creating a remarkably fluid image. Dialogues are all lip-synched and everything looks as natural as it was possible to do at the time.\
Character design can be called dubious, but personally I like it, since it's considerably truthful to actual real-life images, where people actually tend to have noses instead of some weird pointy bumps, and eyes that don't take half the entire face. Most of the characters are pretty much ugly, and it helps them match the gloomy setting really well. The only weak spot in it is considerably small difference in facial design, which is why some characters (especially younger ones) look similar to each other.\
Sound and music\
Akira is actually rather silent most of the time. However, when the sound plays, it's almost always highly dynamic and spot-on. Most of the soundtrack is dominated by industrial beats, minimalistic ethnic motifs and chants, and is intended to set the certain ambience in the movie, so you'll likely fail to enjoy it too much outside of it. But for what it's worth, the sound work is really good in the movie, especially considering the time of its production.\
Characters\
I can't say there's too much to it when it comes to characters. The movie's limited length (compared to manga at least) didn't leave too much for character development, so you mostly see more-or-less clear manifestations of certain archetypes rather than complex emotional and psychological twists, even though not all of them are simple to read through. Some appear initially negative but proven to be decent later, while others appear good at first but eventually show themselves to be corrupt.\
Pretty much the only characters who let you get some insights into their backstory are Kaneda and Tetsuo, especially the latter. Both are almost equally confused by the events engulfing them (kinda like the viewer, actually), and it's very interesting to track their relationships throughout the movie.\
Enjoyment\
This is a very subjective matter, but personally, Akira is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. It has a lot of shock value (assuming you're shocked by immense amounts of graphic violence), it has furious action, it has plot riddles, it has mystery, drama and horror elements, all presented in a coherent (but sometimes overly gruesome) manner. Some people regard Akira to be a gratuitous bloodbath, but there's much more to it than the amount of gore, it's just that those people are unable to look deeper than that. There is a lot of symbolism ingrained underneath the visual layer, and it takes some time and effort to find all the links to cultural and other contexts.\
That being said, if you enjoyed watching it for the first time, chances are you will enjoy it the second time around, and probably even more at that. The final 20 minutes literally eat my head from inside every time I rewatch them, much like End of Evangelion or other similar movies. And for this alone I think it deserves its 10.\
\
Overall, I'm still of the opinion that Akira is a masterpiece and deserves watching, whether you like anime (or any form of animation, actually) or not, at least for its great cultural and historic value. There are many movies and cartoons that are far more enjoyable, and it's not like Akira is the absolute limit of anything and everything. But as more and more titles surpass it in various respects, Akira stays like the Colossus of Rhodes, being a great achievement on its own and one of the most influential landmarks in the history of anime for years to come.\

    Akira is a film adapted from the manga series of the same name by Katsuhiro Otomo. The film was a huge success, even outside its native Japan, and is often heralded as one of the all-time greatest anime ever produced. I first saw this film in 2007, and I have no desire to see it again. I know \"classic\" anime and I tend to not mix very well, but I cannot understand why this film was and still is championed as a \"great\" example of anime. The only thing great about this film is how it teaches you what NOT to film in an action\
          \
        film.\
Story:\
\
It's the future in Tokyo, or Neo-Tokyo, and everything has gone to Hell. The streets are a warzone between gangs, the government, and everyone else. In between all of this are a number of children with psychic powers that enable them to do pretty much whatever they want. One of these children is a teenager from a biker gang named Tetsuo. He and his friend Kaneda get caught up in the government's attempt to . . .\
I'm sorry, I'm giving this plot way too much credit. Do you want to know what I recall this movie being about? It's a series of one senseless act of violence after another. Sure, there are scenes of expository dialog, and an important flashback, but this is pretty much the entire movie right here: someone gets the crap beaten out of them. Someone else gets shot. Someone else gets exploded. Someone else gets the crap beaten out of them. Throw in nonsensical psychic powers, among even more people dying whether they deserve it or not, throw in one of the worst endings in cinematic history, roll credits. The film does not even bother to explain most of the things that happen. It's pretty much like all those mindless action flicks that plagued Hollywood in the 1980s, except animated. Then again, Akira was made in 1988, so I guess it was just following the leader in this regard. 3/10.\
Artwork:\
Akira is famous for its fluid animation. Indeed, it is the oldest anime I've seen that has motion as fluid as what you would expect from an American animated film. As gruesome as the violence is, it is well-crafted. So why then does this only get a 6? Two problems. One, the coloring. I know, this is a bit unfair, seeing as how Akira is a pre-digital anime, but the coloring is drab for the most part. At times, it is fitting of its dystopian setting, but other times, it's just, well, drab. And two, this film has some of the most bland character designs I have ever seen in a theatrical animated film. It's like the filmmakers weren't even trying in this aspect. This and the coloring bogs down my score, but at least there's no choppiness in the animation. 6/10.\
Sound:\
The sound is alright. The soundtrack is eccentric, but works. The sound effects do their job. The ending credits song is lame retro 80s synth fluff, but it could've been worse.\
I got to see parts of Akira in both Japanese and the English dub by Geneon. The Japanese dub is superb. Unlike most anime, Akira's Japanese dialog was recorded before the animation work was completed, much like an American animation. Unfortunately, because of this, foreign language dubs look off compared to the original. Now, dub purists are probably thinking, \"But . . . but . . . Johnny Yong Bosch! Wendee Lee! Joshua Seth!\" Yes, I love them too, but honestly, if for whatever morbid reason you do decide to watch Akira, you're better off seeing it in Japanese with the subtitles on. 7/10.\
Characterization:\
Characterization? What characterization? This, along with the threadbare plot, is what killed Akira for me. Who are these characters? Why are they doing the things they are doing? Why should I care for them? Only one character gets any such development, and that's Tetsuo. We learn his motivation and his desire to strike back at the world, and why he and Kaneda are conflicted with fighting each other at the end, but that is it. Seriously, that's all the characterization you get in this film. When a character dies, you don't care for them, because you know nothing about them. The characters whose names I even remember are Kaneda, Tetsuo, and Akira, and that's only because the first two keep shouting each other's name, and the last has his name in the title. Like, for example, who was that girl Kaneda kept hitting on? The one that, thanks to the lackluster character designs, looks like a boy? What was her purpose in all of this? What about all those government guys? The rival biker gang? The other children with psychic powers? And why does Akira do what he does in the ending? None of this is either elaborated, or done in a way to make me care as an audience member. 2/10.\
Enjoyment: If all you want to see are brutal, pointless acts of violence, then you're in luck, because that's exactly what Akira delivers, in spades. If you want more than that, you're going to be sorely disappointed. I know this is a compressed adaptation of a manga, and the manga is supposedly better, (I don't know, I haven't read the manga version of Akira) but couldn't Otomo have made the anime at least stand on its own for those who haven't read the manga? As it is, it is a confusing mess, chock to the brim with sensationalized violence. Now, mind you, I don't mind seeing mature content in my entertainment. What I do mind is seeing \"mature\" content used only as a means to shock and awe the audience. That's all Akira does, and somehow, it managed to delude a large number of anime fans into thinking it was \"deep\" and \"meaningful\", when all it really is is a crappy 80s action flick that dissolves into nothing by the end. That's about as much sense as I can make out of the ending anyways. 3/10.\
Now before any of you say \"You just hate Akira because you didn't see it back when it first came out!\", I want to point out that that is a moot point to make. My favorite film by Hayao Miyazaki, Castle in the Sky, predates Akira by two years, and is a much, much, MUCH more enjoyable film than this. And also, Katsuhiro Otomo would go on to make the film Steamboy, which, unlike Akira, actually has a proper plot, characters worth giving a damn about, really nice coloring, and slightly less bland character art. So really, there's no point in seeing Akira anymore, except to laugh at it, because as far as I'm concerned, the anime version of Akira is nothing more than a joke.\

    Often hailed as a classic, I can kind of see where the praises are coming from. These kind of hard hitting, apocolyptic anime always seem to attract acclaim. But personally, I couldn't really get into it that much. Or perhaps it's because I just didn't get it. \
My main problem with \"Akira\" is the vagueness of the story. I mean, I'm not the biggest fan of these abstract, philosophical stories to begin with, but \"Akira\" also suffers from a lack of completeness, which only serves to exasperate my confusion even more. I was watching it with a friend and he was having to constantly explain\
          \
        what to me what was happening using knowledge that he'd accumulated from reading the manga (and in fact my friend didn't fully understand everything himself either cos he hasn't read all the manga). My own view on this is that an anime should be made to be self contained, I shouldn't have to go digging for the manga in order to understand what is going on. \
The presentation of \"Akira\" was supposedly amazing at the time. But if it was, it hasn't aged particularly gracefully, though it hasn't done too badly either. Some of the background scenery still looks great, but the characters themselves look kind of wobbly.\
Even though I didn't find the music particularly to my taste, I appreciate the fact that it tries to do something different. The chant heavy soundtrack used often had a primitive and alien feel to it. In the context of the anime, it worked quite well in a weird way and didn't sound out of place. Unforunately the same cannot be said for the voices, which sounded rather horrific on the dub, with the sub sounding a little but not much better.\
Other than Tetsuo's character, which was quite well done, I found the rest of the character to be a little wooden, which probably affected my enjoyment of this anime a bit. And as you probably will have guessed by now, I'm not too impressed regarding the grand, complicated plot underneath that's nigh on impossible to follow unless you've read the manga.\
If you like those philosophical kind of anime, you'll probably enjoy \"Akira\". I can't deny that it's an interesting watch, but for me, that's about as far as it goes.\

    So I finally got a chance to sit down and watch it, namely the English dub. What do I think about it? It was pretty good for an anime that came out in the 1980‚Äôs and it holds up pretty well to this day. I was very surprised that the show was actually directed by the writer of Akira as well. Not many people can write a manga and get to direct it as well when it comes to movie. This means that the show would have come out how he wanted to and not changed around as it went from hand to hand. Just\
          \
        how close is this to the manga? Well as of now, I have not read the manga so I can‚Äôt answer that.\
Some things do bother me with the story and mostly with the characters though it is more based on my preference of character then anything else. I just think that the biker gangs felt a bit forced. I never been in one, never even been near a gang like that before so I can‚Äôt say for sure but I think they wouldn‚Äôt be so open with what they were doing for so long without already being caught by the cops. I may just be analyzing it a bit too much but it just got on my nerves. That also goes for Kaneda always trying to get into Kei‚Äôs pants.\
The main story had a very deep underlining meaning both in psychology and in humanity itself. It‚Äôs hard not to spoil anything about this when most of it happens at the end but I do have to talk about this. There is a back and forth aspect that seems to happen of what science could learn but at what price. It‚Äôs there when they mess with Tetsuo‚Äôs brain and the results that happen after. Let me tell you, the results were not pretty. We are always striving for learning more about ourselves and to push ourselves to the max but at what price do we pay for such an idea? Are we even willing to push us to a point that we ourselves are not considered human anymore? And what would happen if such a power was placed in the hands of someone who didn‚Äôt fully understand how to use it? Something that Kiyoko says in the show rings pretty true no matter what you‚Äôre talking about. I went something like ‚Äòwhen you are given this much power, you must chose how you use it.‚Äô Sort of similar to Spiderman‚Äôs Uncle telling him ‚Äòwith great power comes great responsibility‚Äô but the idea is still the same.\
The animation was rather gory and bloody for the most part with a lot of dark depressing textures. The place they lived really did look like a back ally pig sty but I believe that was what they were going for. For the time this came out, the artwork is rather good and I was surprised by just how much detail they put into the background as well as some of the movements. They even placed the streaks from the tail lights of the bikes in. I don‚Äôt think I have seen that much detail put into a show that was hand drawn except for Studio Ghibi‚Äôs movies. While the design of the characters were pretty realistic as far as anime can go without not looking like anime, they were still rather simple and it is understandable when people have to draw them time and time again. Once in a while, the lighting and shading didn‚Äôt work all that well and I don‚Äôt remember much shading on the ‚Äòchildren‚Äô except for the wrinkles.\
The voice acting was surprisingly well done for the time it was dubbed. I can understand why this movie was what got anime going in America because the voice acting was what I would of imagined the characters to sound like. Because of the somewhat realistic artwork and the constant yelling that characters did, the lip sink suffered slightly. I can only say slightly because what they did do; they did a damn good job in doing it. One person who stood out really well was Kiyoko‚Äôs voice actor (The female little child) Melora Harte. For those of you wondering, I did watch the 1988 release of the dubbing and not the new 2001 version; at least I believe it to be.\
I can truly understand why this is called a cult classic, being as a symbol of ‚Äògreatness‚Äô in the anime world. As the years have not been all that kind to it, it may not hold that title for animation and voice acting but its story is still something that should be kept in the minds of those who watch it. If you haven‚Äôt watched it, you are missing out even if you don‚Äôt like this stuff.\

    I've been watching anime for years and I have to say Akira is one of the best pieces of work i have ever came a crossed. The animation and action sequences hold up very well in comparison to some of the animes coming out to date. The pacing is almost perfect and the art and music are simply a work of art you really feel like you're in that world. Classics are classics for a reason and Akira is a classic anime.\
Caution there might be a few spoilers contained in this review.\
The movie starts off with a large mysterious explosion which destroys Tokyo, the movie\
          \
        then begins 31 years later in Neo Tokyo. Akira for the first 20 minutes or so follows a punk high school bike gang and takes you through a bit of their daily routine so you can build a relationship and relate with their characters. Right off the bat you're introduced to 2 of the main characters in the movie, Tetsuo and kaneda. Kaneda is the leader of the bike gang and is more or less what you would expect from a lead anime character he has a big heart never gives up. As far as Tetsuo goes he is portrayed as a weaker character that is often taken care of by Kaneda. Following a clash with a rival bike gang the tone of the movie changes, as an unknown kid is introduced to the plot the movie switches from punk bike gangs to a more complex story about mysterious abilities, government experiments and cover-ups.The movie uses alot of references about the war and bombing of Hiroshima, if you follow along closely you will see there references used such as when Testua blew up and created that nuclear explosion, well the same area in which that took place is when Hiroshima was bombed from the americans. Although it doesn't have a direct story telling of the bombing, there is references used that point to a post apocalyptic setting and the history of war and military power.\
Directly following this Kaneda and the rest of his gang are dragged off to jail while the unknown kid and Tetsuo are taken by the government. The action in Akira is very well paced at no point do you feel overwhelmed with continuous fight scenes or long drawn out scenes of talking either. From art direction to music this movie is a masterpiece especially when you factor in when it was made. It is a very violent and dark movie well in it's right though as the violent and dark overtones are needed to portray the story properly, this is not a Disney movie and to spite the art style is not really a movie for children simply because besides the violence there is no way a child would be able to follow the plot, nor would they be appropriate for a child.\
I think it is important to point out that while I enjoyed the movie a lot there are some things that had a few issues with nothing big enough for you not to watch the movie but that should be mentioned non the less to make this review as thorough as possible. The first of which is the story, while it is complex and you get a pretty good understanding of what's going on I felt that it could have delved deeper into the history of Akira and some of the other characters. At times it seemed like they were trying to compress something much larger into a 2 hour and 5 minute movie. How ever, if you read the manga, the original story is far greater. So i really recommend you check out the manga if you want to see how the entire story is portrayed. It is much longer. Its a shame that a movie was cut so short.\
Akira is one of the best anime movies I have seen in all my years of watching anime. It is in all respects a classic that should be seen by people interested in or thinking of getting into anime or who's already an anime fan but haven't seen it yet. If you like action or complex stories then you will enjoy Akira, it's a solid mixture of both never giving too much of one and too little of the other and while you probably won't fully understand the story from the movie or relate with some of the characters it's a minor spot on a beautiful work of art. But you should definitely check out the manga as thats the original story and where the movie took place from. The manga is fleshed out alot more and dives deeper into Japanese modern history, the war and the characters.\
I hope this review helps clear up the argument or debating on if this movie is a movie worth checking out! In all honestly i can say you probably won't be disappointing!\

    Oh Akira, where would anime be without you? Would Ghost in the Shell ever have come about without your cyberpunk aesthetics that influenced anime more than any other work, this side of Blade Runner? Would The Matrix have ever come about without either of those two works? The answer is probably no, and so I do have to offer some thanks to Akira for helping to inspire people from inside and outside Japan.\
That said, I still think that Akira is largely a hodge-podge of crap.\
The first few moments of Akira are breathtaking. We take in the lights, the sights and sounds of neo-Tokyo, a hauntingly\
          \
        familiar yet eerily distant dilapidated, frustrated city, rife with neon lights, traffic noise, and trash.\
Sadly, it's all downhill from there.\
See, Akira is a trilogy of 6 hours or so wrapped up in a 2 hour film. It introduces new characters, violence, and important plot devices faster than the motorbikes the characters blaze down the highway with. For a lot of people, this rushed pace, combined with the \"weirdness\" factor is going to be a turnoff. It is actually rather surprising to me that this anime is as popular and mainstream as it is, because I do not consider it very accessible at all.\
The terrible pacing, sadly, becomes a bit of a snowball affect, or feedback loop. The more that is introduced the viewer, the more that needs to be introduced to try to clear up the former, but it doesn't really work out and now you're left with all kinds of new ideas that all feel horribly underutilized or misused. It doesn't help that the dialogue feels a bit like 80s Dragon Ball Z; lots and lots of yelling, little substance or insight into the characters or plot. Banal might be the word to use.\
On that note, the central love story of sorts that is introduced halfway through the film is developed so fast, you might not even know it exists until you sit back and think about it for a bit, only to realize it was way too sloppy and feels forced. The characters never had much experience together, but before you know it, their trying desperately to save one another at their own peril.\
To be fair, the original manga is a large scale work, but that doesn't eliminate all the blame for this mess. \
Problem is, because there are so many characters and loose ends regarding them, it's hard to feel attachment, or even repulsion towards any of the characters. It feels sort of like they are all running like a chicken with their heads cut off, if I can use that term. Kaneda is not a compelling protagonist, and his rivalry with Tetsuo and his rise to power is suitably mishandled and tough to swallow. And the bottom line is, most of these characters are stock stereotypes. Kaneda is a bit of a womanizing gang leader. Tetsuo is... well, we don't really know what he is, but it's apparently enough for him to threaten every living thing on the planet. And yell a lot at Kaneda and everyone else.\
A lot of people seem to like the soundtrack and sounds of Akira. While I admit the roaring motorbikes and city noises are great, the music seems inadequate. It peaks at all the wrong times, trying to drum up drama when there is little to go on. Perhaps part of it has been lost in translation over the years and it was more effective in the 80s. I myself am not convinced.\
It's all too bad, because their are interesting ideas here; themes of fear of technology, class struggle, and more, but once again, they're rarely actually explored; merely hinted at by the film. We're not ever told why it's relevant or why we should sympathize or feel antagonistic at any of them, besides the shock use of violence. When you throw in the psychic powers and government conspiracy and the like, the whole thing just feels bloated without having real substance. It's a film lacking exposition; the aged psychic children, and powers, Akira, it's all barebones and too little to go on. Relevancy is never established.\
I can't leave without saying that the violence is over the top, and not in a cool, stylized way. It more borders on ridiculous. But maybe that's fitting in a film as ridiculous as this. For me? I'll try to find something more thought out and compelling.\

    Akira is a 1988 Japanese Animated film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo based on Otomo‚Äôs manga of the same name.\
\9In the year 1988 a mysterious explosion destroys Tokyo while supposedly also causing World War III. 31 years later, in the year 2019, a new city, entitled Neo-Tokyo, is built which is in a state of constant chaos due to constant skirmishes between rival biker gangs as well as barrages of anti-government attacks carried out by various revolutionary groups. This is the stetting of Akira.\
\9Within this setting the plot focuses on two major characters. Shotaro Kaneda, the arrogant leader of a biker gang, and his childhood friend/rival,\
          \
        Tetsuo Shima, who throughout the film develops strange psychic powers that are frighteningly powerful and prove to cause much destruction.\
\9The first thing that most people will probably notice is the animation of this film because it is of an extremely high quality. Japanese animation, or anime as most people call it, is sometimes criticized for having ‚Äúlimited animation‚Äù. Japanese animators generally don‚Äôt aim for the same fluidity of motion that, say, American animators usually do. Plus they are often guilty of cutting corners by doing things such as giving characters static faces while they are talking. To be fair though the art in a lot of anime is usually a bit more detailed than what is usually seen in American animation. With that said however none of these criticisms can be applied to Akira because every scene has extremely detailed and fluid animation that, in my opinion at least, rivals that of Disney. If someone asked me to show him or her the animation of Akira I would show a river because that is how fluid it is. \
\9One reason why the animation is especially impressive is due to the fact that a majority of the film takes place at night. Now this might not seem like a significant point to some so let me explain. Similar to those who work on shooting live action films, animators, while working on scenes that take place at night, have to deal with lighting, or at least with presenting the illusion of lighting. This is something that can lead to animation becoming more complicated since, not only do animators have to worry about drawing shadows in realistic ways, they also have to use more colors in order to make everything fit in with the supposed lighting in scenes. It is for this reason that many animators try to avoid doing scenes that take place at night. But rather than taking the easy way out the animators working on Akira toughed it out and made sure that every scene at night was colored in a way that gave the illusion of realistic lighting and the results are truly astounding. It is for this reason that I have the upmost respect for those who worked on animating this beast.   \
\9In fact it is because of the animation that I recommend watching this film with the Japanese voices, even if you prefer to watch anime with English dubbing. This is not because the English dubbings available are bad per say, it is just that Akira is a very special case. For almost all anime the animation is finished before all the dialogue is recorded. What this means is that the animation for the mouths in anime aren‚Äôt done in a way that follows the delivery given by the voice actors. Instead the animation is usually edited after the voices are recorded so that the mouths move within the time in which voices are heard. This means that mouths will just open and close during certain intervals. Because of this it generally isn‚Äôt that jarring to watch an anime with an English dubbing since the Japanese voices wouldn‚Äôt really fit the animation for the mouths either. With Akira however the Japanese voices were recorded beforehand so the animators were able to animate the mouths so that they follow the delivery of the Japanese voice actors. For that reason alone I believe that everyone should watch this film with the Japanese audio since it not only will fit the visuals, but it will also allow viewers to really appreciate the extra bit of effort that the animators put into the mouths.\
\9And while I‚Äôm on the topic of audio let me just say that the soundtrack by Shoji Yamashiro is pretty amazing. Many of the tracks have a unique combination of techno, traditional Asian instruments, and distorted singing/chanting. This ultimately culminates to create music that is intense enough to accentuate a lot of the chaos that ends up happening on screen while also sounding very unique. Although it should be noted that there are one or two somber tracks that do help calm down the mood on the rare occasion that the film decides to take a breather.\
\9While Akira might stand out from its peers because of the technical quality of its animation, the animation is not the only reason why the film is well known among otaku. The other, and possibly more significant, reason why Akira stands out from its fellow animated brethren is due to its level of violence. In the years that I have been watching animated works there are few non-exploitation anime and films in general that approach the sheer amount of violence that Akira showcases. At times it seems like the film can‚Äôt go five minutes without having some violent act taking place, weather it be an explosion, a bout between rival biker gangs, governmental forces gunning down rebellious citizens, or Testuo using his powers to plaster the ground with someone else‚Äôs guts. But while the violence might seem a bit gratuitous to some, I actually think it is an ultimately positive aspect of the film. Neo-Tokyo is supposed to be a chaotic and brutal city and if people weren‚Äôt getting beaten and murdered left and right then the city would hardly seem as brutal as it does within the film. Plus it also does good job of making the audience never get too comfortable during the intense action scenes since you are always aware that death is never far away from anyone who lives in Neo-Tokyo.\
\9Even though Akira is a very unique and technically impressive film, is isn‚Äôt without some flaws. The film is a 2-hour adaptation of an over 2000-page manga and while the film does manage to condense the central plot into the allotted run time, this does seem to present a few issues. First of all, since the film has to cover a lot of material in a relatively short amount of time the pacing is really jacked up. I can really only think of two or three scenes in which the audience is really given a scene devoid of either really exciting action or plot exposition. Now while some might argue that this is a good thing since it means that the film never gets boring, it is also a factor that may serve to confuse some viewers. \
\9Now while I am a firm believer that the majority of scenes in a film should serve to move the story along, at least when talking about plot-driven films, I do recognize the need for quiet time where not much is happening. While these scenes might seem boring and meaningless to some, I believe they can serve an important purpose within many films and stories. They give the audience a chance to take a breather so that they don‚Äôt get overwhelmed with plot details or action as well as giving them a chance to reflect on what has happened thus far. But in Akira it seems that almost every scene has characters either spouting plot exposition or participating in some really intense and really bloody violence. This means that the viewer can‚Äôt really take time to think about what they had just seen, since there aren‚Äôt any scenes that don‚Äôt serve to either put the characters in danger or move the plot along. This can be seen as an especially big problem for Akira since many may be tempted to step away from the plot to just admire the fluidity of the animation or the extremely beautiful and densely detailed backgrounds. This is probably one of the major reasons why I see a lot of people call the film confusing. It also doesn‚Äôt help that some of the dialogue is a bit more cryptic than it needs to be.\
\9Also, the film doesn‚Äôt address some details with the amount of explanation that some may desire. For example, within the film there are a number of people who are fighting the government in a revolutionary movement. While the government of Neo-Tokyo is shown to be rather inept in a few scenes of the film, it is never really explained why people are so angry with the government. Many other details like this such as the affect that World War III on the world, the nature of Tetsuo‚Äôs powers, and where these angst-ridden teenagers go when they aren‚Äôt hanging out with each other go on unexplained. While I‚Äôm sure some won‚Äôt mind, I know I certainly didn‚Äôt when I watched this film for the first time, I recognize that some may get annoyed with the lack of explanation that the film gives pertaining to some details. While I would‚Äôve hated it if this film were to be bogged down by too much exposition I feel that the film would have been improved if some of these topics were more thoroughly explored. At the very least it would have given the world of the film more depth. Plus it is not like Katsuhiro Otomo didn‚Äôt write this story without thinking a lot of this though. Having read it in its entirety, I can truthfully say that the manga did go more in depth with certain aspects of the plot, such as the anti-government movement that various characters are a part of. This leads me to believe that the reason why a lot of things in the film were left unexplained was more due to time constraints than lazy writing. Personally, even though I am usually a strong opponent of people splitting up stories into parts, I believe that the plot of Akira might have been better if it was split between two films. This would have allowed Otomo to provide the audience more calm and soothing scenes, while also providing time to add more depth to the world. \
\9And for my last form of criticism I will just warn people that at a few moments during the third act of the film the dialogue devolves into characters just screaming each other‚Äôs names really loudly.  \
\9But while these things are certainly flaws, I can‚Äôt ignore that they somewhat serve as a double-edged sword. While the unrelenting pace and lack of explanation might serve to confuse and aggravate some viewers, I can‚Äôt deny that they also make the film seem even more chaotic. The most common tagline that I‚Äôve seen in promotional material for Akira is ‚ÄúNeo-Tokyo is about to explode‚Äù. This tagline I feel perfectly encapsulates the feeling that the setting gives off. Saying that Neo-Tokyo is about to explode suggests that things are building up, that the city is practically bursting with problems and its soon gonna let it all out in a glorious explosion. In a sense the plot and pacing reflects this very chaotic feeling. Within the film the viewer is shown countless problems which are plaguing Neo-Tokyo. These include, but are not limited to, gang violence, poor education, trigger-happy government forces, trigger-happy revolutionary forces, as well as a government in which nothing ever gets done. While the scatterbrain way that the film decides to show the audience all these problems certainly do hurt the plot, at least in my opinion, I also feel they help the setting seem even more doomed. The kinetic pacing of the film as well as the sheer amount of the problems it shows suggests to the viewer that Neo-Tokyo is a city full of problems that no one really has time to solve. The fact that said problems aren‚Äôt really ever given full explanations ultimately hinders the audience‚Äôs ability to think up solutions to these problems thus they reach a sort of unsolvable status within the minds of viewers. This all ends up making Neo-Tokyo seem all the more ugly and all the more hopeless. In no way am I saying that these points make up for the ways that the flaws within the writing detract from the film‚Äôs quality. I‚Äôm just saying that it is flawed in a way that does help reinforce some ideas about the film‚Äôs setting. Neo-Tokyo was a city built to help Japanese citizens deal with the destruction of Tokyo. It is then is ironic that it seems to be a city constantly on the brink of destruction, at least as it exists within the year of 2019. But while it is a setting that is constantly in a state of turmoil, I am still able to find things to enjoy every time I visit. \
\9While the screenplay might be badly written in terms of plot, it does a surprisingly good job with creating sympathy for the protagonists of the film. I‚Äôll be the first to admit that I wasn‚Äôt too fond on a lot of the characters when I was first watching this film a few years ago. Kaneda, Testuo, and friends seemed like completely unlikeable violent and arrogant teenaged boys who liked to spend all their time hitting rival bikers with steel pipes. But as the film goes on and you learn more about these character‚Äôs pasts and their environment, you begin to feel bad for them. While you may be repulsed by their violent tendencies, you realize that these are kids who had to deal with living in the horrible dump that is Neo-Tokyo. Thus they had to deal with all the problems and oppression of the city has while growing up. Because of this, I at least, gained a strange understanding for the anti-authoritative attitude as well as a strange sort of sympathy for the characters. There are also a fair amount of scenes within the film that really show that these characters have a sense of camaraderie and that they actually do care about each other. This in turn makes it easier for the audience to care about them since most of the characters all seem to put at least some significance on each other‚Äôs lives. It is also easy to feel bad for these characters since they end up getting involved in a lot of conflicts that they don‚Äôt personally want to being in and then just end up suffering because of it. Kaneda gets involved with an anti-government group not because he actually believes in their cause. Rather he just joining them because the government has taken Tetsuo away from him and he believes that following the group will allow him to protect his friend. Similarly, Testuo never really chose to get psychic powers, he just sort of got them and because of that scientists take possession of him so that they can study him. Inevitably these powers end up causing harm to his mental state, his physical state, and the lives of those around him and in that sense his character is extremely tragic. By the last third of the film, despite the fact that I found both characters to be unlikeable at first, I had quite a bit of sympathy for both Kaneda and Testuo and was really rooting for both of them to reach a happy conclusion. This in the end makes it all the more sad when the tragic and self-destructive aspects of their friendship become more apparent. I must also admit that part of the reason that I was able to feel sympathetic towards these teenagers was partially due to the character design. There is just something about the art, probably the more roundish heads, which make the characters seem more juvenile and thus easier to feel sympathy towards, since you think, well they probably don‚Äôt know any better. While Akira‚Äôs violence might make it seem like it doesn‚Äôt value human life all that much, it‚Äôs characters do ultimately give the film a sad emotional core. \
\9Now before I begin to wrap this review up I cannot forget to mention the significance of his film. Akira was the film that introduced a lot of Americans to Japanese anime and it is likely that if the film was never made and was never release on home video in America, the international anime fan community would never be as big as it is today. Plus, while Akira was certainly a landmark in terms of Japanese animation, one can see its influence on many American films such as Chronicle and The Matrix. Akira might not be quite great enough to be considered a masterpiece but it has certainly left an impression on culture, or at least the nerdy side of culture, which can still be felt today. Also I must say that the film has what might be the most epic and craziest climaxes that I have ever seen. In fact, I would say that the climax alone makes watching the film a worthwhile endeavor, at least if you aren‚Äôt particularly squeamish.\
\9Akira is a film about a lot of things but above all it is a film about destruction. Within the film one can witness the destruction of many human lives, of body parts, of friendships, of cities, of governments, and of societies. Heck, some might even argue that while watching, you can see the film‚Äôs plot get destroyed before your very eyes. Yet it is ironic how a film about so much destruction was able to lead to the production of so much beautiful animation, to the creation of some very real and sympathetic characters, as well as, arguably, an entire international community of fans. Perhaps like the phoenix, Akira is a film that proves that new life and thoughts can be born out of death and destruction. Akira is not a perfect film. It‚Äôs writing is too flawed for me to give it that high of praise. What Akira really is though is a thrilling, destructive, bloody, and melancholic roller coaster ride and while it may be a ride that is held together by duck tape and staples, it is one that I thoroughly enjoy every time I experience it.

    First off the story is taken from a well developed manga.. A six epic manga style story that can actually be considered an ominbus but still just a really big manga. xD\
Start out with cool biker gang and leader on cool bike. But wait a minute .... who's that other biker gang coming to harass them. Just some random gang for action?! Important to the plot? Why heck no. Not in this movie. In fact, this biker gang that for some reason choose to dress like the Jokers from Batman Beyond come in and mess with our heroes and are never seen from again.\
However in\
          \
        all this a strange boy walks out into the street. And he appears old. Real old. Heck maybe it will be explained later. Seems important to the plot to have a kid, who is like fifty walk out onto the middle of the street. And there are cops surrounding the kid. Uh oh, story is picking up. Ain't it.\
Tetsowo (whatever) crashes and Kanda and the rest of his gang go to jail or back to school pen for juvenile delinquents while Tetsowo goes to a hospital.\
Kanada sees a pretty girl .... that looks like a boy and springs her and his friends out of jail or wherever they were, by causing a riot. Pretty clever our hero. He tries to hit on her but she will have none of it. In fact, it turns out she works for some kind of resistance. A resistance, oh boy where is this going?\
So to sum up, we have an old looking kid that the government is interested in. A rebellious biker gang, two in fact and one has a cool looking bike the other dresses up like clowns. and A resistance! 0.0 A resistance a against what? It's so secret not even the audience knows. I think they want to bring down the government. From how this movie played out you'll never know it.\
But Kanada's got that nice tough guy image who won't rat out this do nothing resistance, so they let him go.\
Meanwhile Tetsowo leaves the hospital. He just walks out. But not before the army just ran some test on him to see if he was psychic? Why they do that? Just because?\
Well Tetsowo goes to see his old girlfriend but a couple of nameless bad@$$ street punks see him and because he's weak and a punk, he gets his butt whooped and she almost gets raped. Thank goodness, Kanada is there in just the nick of time.\
Oh yeah, Tetsowo is doing drugs because his guts just open up and spill out onto the sidewalk. As he realize it's all an illusion. The army comes and takes the druged Tetsowo away leaving behind his friends, important to the plot, they die by Tetsowo hands er mind ... gee I hope I didn't let loose any spoilers making it Kanada's job to go out and kill him.\
So now Tetsowo is in another hospital and freaky stuff starts happening to him. More drugs, yes! but more old kids!! Is the cause of these weird events, and not drugs. Drugs given to him by the military of Japan to keep his powers in check, so it's okay that he's doing drugs. Oh did I mention that one of the old kids is the kid he crashed into 0.0 This kid who ran away at the beginning now seems content to live at the army base. WHY?? Maybe that old little psychic girl decided to give him some. She seems quite chummy with that fat old kid psychic one. I think he ran away because he wasn't feeling the love in the group. It's up to your imagination of why he ran away in the first place and got hit by Tetsowo.\
Meanwhile the leader of this army and a scientist is going over the data about Akira and how Tetsowo matches. They comment on how strong Tetsowo should be compared to Akira. All in the present tense. Mind you. Which will become important and will seem very odd later on.\
The leader of the army wants to know whats the best way to control Tetsowo for the good of Japan. And there's a few bits of him talking to show you that he isn't out for power but rather to protect japan.\
Back at the hospital, Tetsowo has gotten rough with the three old kids and through this shake down of old child-like little people, he learns that he has psychic powers. And again he walks out of the hospital but this time he kills a number of people just because he can.\
Uh oh he is enjoying it.\
He goes back to the bar and kills everybody. Including his former biker gang. Wait! I forgot to mention the bar at the beginning. No wait, the bar was only seen for about a minute and it didn't have Kanada or Tetsowo in it, just random people who where going to die 30 mins later in it. Yep, I was right to leave it out.\
Completely not important to the plot. Like a lot of things in this movie.\
side note: The biker gang at the beginning is the clown biker gang. We finally find that out. Now that the story is almost complete.\
From the shake down, Tetsowo learns about Akira. I forget either from the old kids or the army leader he learns about this guy named Akira and he sets out to free him. Of course, a bunch tanks get in the way. No problem for the newly powerful Tetsowo. The army doesn't want him to awaken Akira, but he's going to do it anyway. He's such a bad boy. ;)\
After tearing up half the city, Tetsowo finally gets to Akira, only to learn that he's dead. Wait what?!\
So the army built a vault and sent tanks and missiles after Tetsowo to keep him from waking up .... a dead kid. A brain in a jar no less.\
Okay at this point, I'm really pissed off.\
Kanada hot boy looking girlfriend gets possed by this guru and she talks about a bacteria with the power of a human to help explain Tetsowo to the audience and to a revengeful Kanada.\
Not only does this boy looking girl gets posed but she also through her contacts with this useless resistance is able to get Kanada a laser rifle.\
It's laser time kiddies.\
Kanada tries to avenge his fallen comrades with laser action and the Army leader tries to shoot Tetsowo with a laser cannon orbiting in space. Wait? Why didn't he do that at the beginning when those tanks weren't working ... oh well, who cares.\
Well both attempts fail and Tetsowo gets more powerful but wait, what's this .... He's turning into a monster. A monster that's eating up all of Tokyo! And he's now crying out for Kanada to save him.\
but wait what's this those three old kids have come out of nowhere to save the day.\
Kanada gets sucked into the monster and the three old kids go into it to rescue him.\
inside the monster known as Tetsowo there is a montage of his early childhood of being bullied and about the kids, who got old and never grew up. At least physically.\
the end.\
I have watched this thing five times. Everybody loves this movie. I keep on watching it thinking, maybe this time I will see the thing everybody else sees or I will finally understand something i didn't see before. I just keep saying to myself why did I waste my 90 minutes on this crap. In reality, the only thing I found is that people invent something that isn't there. I did agree with one person's interpretation of the movie but I still didn't like. It just fails on sooo many levels story wise.\

    OK... I'm sure you can tell by the scores I gave this anime that I found this anime to be RIDICULOUSLY overrated. I've watched it maybe 5-7 times in my life. First time was just to watch what all the fuss was about, 2 through the last was 'maybe I missed the reason why people thought this was so great.' the very last time I saw it, I remember saying 'Nope, I was right. Still weak.'\
When people say 'arguably the greatest film of all time', I'll be first in line to be on the arguing side. The two main characters of the story are both\
          \
        whiney and lame. The ending was creepy and gross, and if this anime weren't drawn so damn beautifully then I would bet lots of money that it would lose a substantial portion of its fanbase. \
It was the very first full length anime movie I ever saw. I was in my early teens, and luckily for whoever enjoys reading my reviews I was born with that 'there's gotta be better than this' kinda curiosity and gave other animes a chance. Next film was Ninja Scroll, much better, much more entertaining. \
So yeah, Akira... summed up in a gesture... I give it an apathetic shoulder shrug any day of the week. \

    \9As much of a \"classic\" or \"must-watch\" anime as this may be, its only strengths are the same as a generic explosion film. There isn't a story to this anime, at least not one that I could follow. It appears to have a rebellion type plot with some sci-fi mixed in, but I couldn't pinpoint where the beginning, middle, and end were. This is \"adapted\" from a highly acclaimed manga and was even directed by the mangaka himself so the poor adaptation may be due how little time it had to adapt what was released of the manga at the time.\
\9The action scenes are done\
          \
        well and the colour palette is impressive seeing as what was available at the time the movie was made. Unfortunately all of the characters look similar and in a fast paced movie it can be hard to know what characters are in a scene without other characters referring to them by name. Since the movie is action based the characters don't address each other too often so you may watch through an entire scene without even knowing which characters were in it.\
\9The sound effects were done well and sound quite realistic when they need to be. The music also sets the tone of the scenes well. The voice actors do a much better job than the character designer and the characters do sound different. Their voices also sound good in general and make the movie come alive more than anything else does. If you have a good knowledge of seiyuu you should be able to tell the characters apart by voices.\
\9In addition to not being drawn differently, the characters also don't differ too much in their personalities. The antagonist was completely forgettable, the protagonists form a group consciousness which makes it hard to follow which character did what, and the female characters look and act so similar to the male characters that it can be hard to even know that they're female to begin with. One character they designed differently from the rest was some sort of alien, but he also has a female counterpart who is indistinguishable from what he would look like in drag.\
\9I personally couldn't find anything to enjoy about this anime. The battles were nice, but if that's all you're there for then the sad attempt at trying to give the movie some sort of plot could just be classified as filler. The story feels like a dementia anime but lacks the satisfaction of understanding it almost like a maze with an entrance and no exit.\
\9There isn't much to this anime at all. The sound is good and the sakuga is nice to look at, but from a storytelling standpoint there isn't anything of any value.\

    I first watched Akira a long time ago and the first time I watched it, I will admit, I was very confused and very creeped out at a lot of parts. I watched it again a few years later and this time I understood it much better and could actually sit through watching it without squirming and the overall concept of Akira is extremely fascinating, it really is a good movie with a lot of meaning in it, and it is extremely moving, as well. The storyline takes place in a place where most of would recognize and not totally feel out of place, but\
          \
        the overall feeling of the place is dangerous and reckless and not a place you would necessarily want to be, but a place you could definitely imagine yourself being. It starts off kind of normal and then suddenly takes a very odd turn in being very science-fictiony and going into many deeper meanings of children, loyalty, family, love and believing what's wrong and right.\
The animation is very good for when the anime is from and even now, watching it makes it feel better because it does have older, rougher animation, giving the feeling of the anime an even more dangerous and unfamiliar one.\
The music is very good and also goes extremely well with the movie and the voice actors are excellent in English and Japanese.\

    This anime definitely deserves its spot among the classics. The details and politcs of the film coupled with its interesting characters and mind-boggling themes make it highly enjoyable to watch time and again. But be warned, this is most certainly NOT for everyone.\
One thing that is sure to turn many viewers away, and that should be mentioned, is that this anime is rated as it is for a reason. If language, graphic violence, protrayl of drug use, and sexual stitautions bother you, then stay away. There is an attempted rape scene that I find to be difficult to sit through. The world in which this\
          \
        movie occurs is a very corrupt one on all fronts: morally, socially, politically, psychologically, and physically. It is very dark at points as such. However, they do not go over the top to make you terribly uncomfortable, I feel. The aim, while it does want to shock you, is not specifically geared towards grossing you out. Yes, it looks at the darker vices dwelling in human nature, but it's not as in your face about it as, say, Elfen Lied. Everything unsettling about the movie is all meant to enhance and make more real the world in which it occurs, it does not go beyond that. I'm not sure how best to explain it, but let me put it this way, Elfen Lied did not sit well with me and I didn't like it, but for some reason, Akira, while also full of violence and sinister themes, I enjoyed. The evil undertones of the Akira world make it seem real and less repulsive, if that makes any sense.\
Another thing that can turn people off is the art style. Personally, I very much like the art style, but I will admit that the first time I encountered it, I was a bit reluctant to keep watching. It's very unique and the aim of the film isn't to make really pretty characters to look at but realistic ones. The buildings and vehicles of the film seem to have a life of their own and were awarded just as much thought and attention to design as the characters. For this reason, Kaneda's motorcycle, the coolest design of one I've ever seen, I consider to be a favorite character of mine; yes, character. The bike is so full of personality that it deserves  character status.\
While I would argue that the film does have some amusing moments,  it is not at all light-hearted. Plus, said amusing moments are mainly amusing to me because I get a kick out of sarcastic, satirical humor. So, you humor lovers won't get much out of this one. It's also not for you romance people. Romance, while present, is not one of the main drives of the film and is almost tacked in as a short of after thought. This one is mainly for those of you out there who like to think about things or watch something and ask 'What....the....'. If you like Stephen King novels, then I'd wager that you'd like this, even though it's not strickly horror. That is just an opinion of mine. I am a Stephen King fan and if you think about it, Akira has an attitude akin to one of his books. If I'm wrong on that though, sorry.\
The major themes of the film seem to be the nature of friendship and betrayl and how far man can truly force his evolution and pursuit of progress before it overtakes him and leads to a regression. Basically, it's about limits and knowing where they lie. \
I forewarn you now that the one big downside of the film is that many, many things go unaswered and unaddressed. This is likely because the film attempted to condense a manga of monsterous proportions into a single movie. As a result, the two are very different. In fact, while Akira the manga actually deals mainly with a boy named Akira, Akira the movie awards the same boy I think a total of a minute of screen time. It might be even less. I'm including dialogue spoken by him as well as the images shown of him. The movie is really more about Testuo, an underappreciated social outcast and weakling gone berserk, and Kaneda, a street smart but book ignorant punk who's head of a street gang. The relationship between the two and polarity of their characters makes their interactions highly entertaing to watch.\
All in all, I would recommend this movie. You should try it out if only to say you've seen it.\

    You must remember, this movie was made in 1988. If you're going to critique it accurately, you must take this into account. This anime led the way for the growing popularity of anime in the West, with Akira considered a forerunner of the second wave of anime fandom that began in the early 1990s. One of the reasons for the movie's success was the highly advanced quality of its animation. At the time, most anime was notorious for cutting production corners with limited motion, such as having only the characters' mouths move while their faces remained static. Akira broke from this trend with meticulously detailed\
          \
        scenes, exactingly lip-synched dialogue &mdash; a first for an anime production (voices were recorded before the animation was completed, rather than the opposite) &mdash; and super-fluid motion as realized in the film's more than 160,000 animation cels. Notable motifs in the film include youth culture, delinquency, psychic awareness, social unrest and future uncertainty weighed against the historical spectre of nuclear destruction and Japan's post-war economic revival.\
In a nutshell:\
1988\
revolutionary\
made it possible for you and I to watch anime\
Not only for its time, but even still today, its suspense, paranormal structure, and plot are highly regarded.\
In all fairness, it really does deserve a 10\

Critic's Log - Earthdate: December 3, 2012. Review #25: AKIRA\
\
The time has come, This is my 25th review and I have a special movie to talk about. I will now review the 1988 landmark anime film... AKIRA!\
\
\
In the year 2019, 31 years have passed since the outbreak of World War III. In the city of Neo-Tokyo, all authority is waging a never-ending struggle against underground forces that virtually rules the shattered city, A top-secret child with amazing powers of the minds breaks free from custody and accidentally involves a biker gang in the project. The incident triggers psychic\
          \
        powers within one of the bikers named Tetsuo, and he ends up being taken by the army and being experimented on. Tetsuo's mind has been warped and he is on a path to destruction.\
\
\
To be technical, this is a TMS Entertainment production and  this anime film is directed by Katsuhiro Otomo (who also created the manga of the same name). It is also a landmark anime for one obvious reason. For 1988, the animation blew everyone away. When I first saw Akira, I was blown away. I knew it was made in 1988 before I saw it but I find it almost hard to believe that it was made in the late 80's. It has fluent animation, the action scenes sometimes looks badass. I love the Bike Chase scene in the first 15 minutes of the film. The animation still looks amazing. If you didn't research this movie on Wikipedia, I'll tell you this then. This anime film has more than 160,000 animation cels throughout the two-hour experience. There was a whole lot of effort put into the making of this film. This film was one hell of an achievement.\
\
\
\
The animation is not the only good point in the movie, although it may be the contributing reason on why most people would like this movie. The music by Yamashirogumi Geinoh really fits the movie well. I like some of the ominous themes in this movie. The music is mesmerizing throughout the movie.\
\
\
\
As far as voice acting goes. This will be a lengthy topic to discuss. Oh well, here goes... The Japanese Cast is not bad, in fact it's pretty good. Mitsuo Iwata is fine as Kaneda, Nozomu Sasaki is good as Tetsuo, and Mami Koyama is not bad as Kei. There's a lot of seiyus that are not really big names but they play their roles just fine. Here's a little fun fact about the subtitled version, the voices were recorded before the animation was finished. Also, the animation staff focused on matching the characters' lip movements match the dialogue (which was a first for an anime production). As far as the English Dub goes, there are actually two dubs to Akira. The Streamline dub (which was from the 90's) and the Animaze/Pioneer Dub (which was done in 2001) I will actually state my opinion on both dubs. It is going to be very difficult for me to comment on the Streamline dub because I know there are some people that have grown up watching the Streamline dub and they actually liked it. I am more familiar with the Animaze/Pioneer Dub because that was the first dub I saw. I have seen a little bit of the Streamline dub and I tried to get used to it. There are some people that like the Streamline dub and there are some people that don't like it. I personally didn't like the Streamline dub, I'm sorry for those that like that dub, but the voices sounded way off to me. I was surprised that Cam Clarke voiced Kaneda though. So what do I think of the Animaze/Pioneer dub? I think it's a good dub. Johnny Yong Bosch fits the role because Kaneda is a punk and Johnny was a perfect choice for Kaneda, Joshua Seth is also great as Tetsuo. Wendee Lee was also good as Kei but I felt Kei sounded a bit older than her age in this dub, this is just a minor nitpick but Wendee Lee's performance was pretty good. as far as other performances go, Jamieson Price was great as the Colonel, and there were some well-known dub actors in the movie such as Michelle Ruff, Michael Lindsay, Mike Reynolds, William Frederick Knight, Skip Stellrecht, and Steve Blum. The Animaze/Pioneer dub is good, but I sort of prefer the subtitled version on this one. Kevin Seymour really did a good job as ADR director in which he didn't disappoint in the later dubs that he worked on with animes such as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Code Geass. I've said enough on the voice acting\
\
\
\
As far as characters go, the characters (in a way) have personalities that would fit the setting of the story that which the movie presents. Kaneda is a street punk that has a sense of humor. His best friend Tetsuo really has some problems which I really can't blame him too much for since he has a inferiority complex. I almost found Tetsuo as a whiny little bitch but there is a slight cool appeal that I see in Tetsuo and it was somewhat fascinating to see Tetsuo progress in character development. Kei is an alright character of all the bunch, She doesn't have too much development compared to how she developed in the manga. The Colonel on the other hand is a pretty good character from start to finish. He may be tough and ruthless but he has his reasons. I like how he is pragmatic to recognize the danger that Tetsuo's fledgling powers pose. I also like his sense of honor that reflects on the Military. Call it a soldierly sense of honor if you may. I like the Colonel. The other characters are pretty good for the most part.\
\
\
\
The story of Akira is a bit hard for me to describe because the animation is what most people remember about Akira. There's definitely a lot of style with some substance to go with it. The story does have a post-apocalyptic setting and most of the scenes you see or will see does fit that setting. It's obvious that this is an adaptation of the manga of the same name and Otomo-san took some liberties from turning his 2,162 page manga epic into a 2 hour film. It's not completely faithful to the manga but since Otomo-san directed this film, I don't have much room to complain. I will say that the manga has a far more complete story, this movie does have a story but it can be a little hard to remember for some people. I guess it's good for the most part. There are times I just get blown away by the animation and totally forget about the story.\
\
\
Akira was available by Pioneer/Geneon before it went out of print, it was later picked up by Bandai Entertainment until they went under. It was rescued by Funimation. At the time I'm writing this review, it will soon be available from Funimation. The manga by Katsuhiro Otomo was available by Dark Horse Comics until the rights expired and it was picked up by Kodansha Comics. The Akira manga is available from Kodansha Comics. An American live-action film was in the works but it is in development hell.\
\
With all that said, Akira has incredible animation that ended up as one of the most popular anime films today. This film has garnered a cult following which I think the animation contributed to that. The music is mesmerizing and a tripfest in some themes. The movie has a couple badass characters as well as some badass moments. The story may have not been faithful than the manga but it is directed by the creator of the series so there's really no need to complain about that. This is a really cool movie and anyone that likes anime should see it. You won't be disappointed for the most part.\
I give Akira a 9 out of 10, It is EXCELLENT!\

    Well this film was definitely an experience. It took me only a few minutes to realize the animation was superb. It really was a visual delight. The opening sequence was just the tip of the iceberg of what was in store for this one. I adore surreal movies and this bizarre ride of utterly beautiful and horrific imagery had me glued to my tv for just over two hours. The characters themselves are so-so in my opinion with the exception of Tetsuo who was at once creepy and lovely. I watched the film on adult swim also so I saw it with the new and\
          \
        improved dub. As I said, the stand out was Tetsuo, but I also really liked the Colonel. Surprisingly, I didn't so much like Johnny Yong Bosch's Kaneda. It was a lot of yelling and his character was very back and forth with his emotions. One minute he was scared and the next he was flirting and laughing with Kei. It was a bit weird so I may need to sit through it a second time with the subs. \
I may need to watch it again anyway because the plot was a lot to take in. It's truly an \"epic\" experience of a sci-fi feature. Unfortunately, I had not read the manga and have heard it explains in better detail, so I was confused in some parts. One thing I did love was the ending. The symbolism and religious undertones were flawlessly placed along the way and it was perfectly open for interpretation which I love. The music was brilliant as well and the intense violence was gorgeous. it was beautiful and dark and shocking which are things I enjoy in my movie experience.\
Overall, I really liked this film. I would recommend it for sure, but go in with an open mind. 8/10 stars.\

    Dense with world building, pure chaos and audio-visual spectacle, matched with visceral emotion and moving character relationships unlike what anime almost ever sees; Akira is a triumph of modern animation. \
In an audio-visual sense alone, Akira is a masterpiece. The direction is fucking impeccable, framing the city in a more interesting and revealing light in every single shot, without ever distracting from the real focus of the shot. Composition and flow are Katsuhiro Otomo's legal middle names. Visual metaphor is abundant and ranges from surreal, like the visual surrogates for the three naked babies, to unnerving and powerful, like Tetsuo's glass of water or the\
          \
        motif of Kaneda's bike. The savage chaos of all the action is enhanced tenfold by the constant movement and kinetics of the direction, that, while not on par with the level of pure fucking anarchy shown off in the manga, is among the most impressive explosions of technical mastery in the medium.\
The animation itself is jaw dropping as well. Beyond just the base fluidity and detail of the drawings, the detail and weight in the way characters walk, the movement of bikes, the shape and way gravity affects the debris and more adds so much more to the experience of watching the film than you could ever imagine. And do I even need to mention the color design? Every frame of Akira is worth framing on your wall and tattooing on your ass. The attention to detail in the sound design, the lip flaps, the voice acting, there's a ton more to the audiovisuals, but it's not even worth saying at this point.\
The profound griminess and anarchy of Neo Tokyo is conveyed so effectively and efficiently that it is nearly scary. The graffiti ladened walls and harsh lighting, contrasting with the bright neon lights of the buildings and motorbikes gives an immediate sense of not just a hell of a society, but a highly manufactured and technological one. Akira‚Äôs Neo Tokyo also has a wonderful detail rarely seen in Sci-Fi films, that being the fact that there are buildings that people actually seem to live in. Far too often in science fiction cinema, such as in the Ghost in the Shell 2017 film, all of a city‚Äôs buildings will be either corporate buildings or stores. Where are the houses? The apartments? Where does everyone live? This is Neo Tokyo‚Äôs true accomplishment; not the immediate conveyance of it‚Äôs atmosphere, but the fact that it feels so alive. \
As for the script, Akira is so covered in hype and intense action, well presented thematic concepts and beautiful character stories I don't even know where to begin. The buddhist and imperialist themes of the film are quite blatant, as the former is introduced through literal plot elements, and the latter can easily be presumed from the nature of the fact that it's an anarchist post-war technology based world, that is falling apart. The allegorical side, that being the criticism of Japanese youth after the second World War, is very poignant as well, though not as much so. I pretty firmly believe in Tetsuo and Kaneda's arc being the center of the film; Tetsuo rebelling against Kaneda and eventually becoming a fully fledged individual in the final moments of the film, ironically only after shedding his human form, is some real Biblical shit, and Kaneda the sociopath showing true compassion for his best friend and giving a viking funeral for Yamagata is equally so. The only flaw in the script is the lack of development given to Kei, which is slightly bothersome, especially compared to the manga, but nothing worth getting super upset over.\
Akira is a rip roaring action epic in it's own right, and the fact that it weaves in such dense commentary, emotional gravitas, spectacle and world building is just the icing on top. A modern masterpiece of not just Japanese cartoons, but of film.",

    What is the most famous anime of all time for casual viewers that aren't really huge otaku? If Akira isn't number 1, it is certainly in the top 3. When Akira was first released in the US, it quickly became a cult classic and a \"movie that everyone has to see\". I went to China and bought (for 1$ each) a massive criterion collection of classic films like Bicycle Thieves, La Dolce Vita, The 400 Blows, Ikiru, etc. Guess what came in that collection? fucking Akira! What is it that makes this film SO good? I will attempt to answer this in a few paragraphs.\
Warning:\
          \
        review contains spoilers! Skip the plot section if you haven't seen Akira. Seriously though, how have you not seen Akira?\
Plot: 8/10\
One thing that needs to be said about the plot is that a LOT is left out from the original manga. That means that much of the background info about the world of Akira is never answered in the movie and you will probably be left with many questions. The main plot is that a bike gang in post WW3 Japan are engaged in a turf war with another bike gang called the Clowns. Our bike gang is led by the charismatic and likeable Kaneda. The runt of the gang is a frustrated, psychological mess named Tetsuo. Tetsuo is always getting picked on and wishes for great power so that he could experience being on top and pushing other people around. After a motorcycle crash caused by a bizzare smurf creature running into the road, the government experiments on Tetsuo and gives him super psychic powers to try turn him into a government controlled psychic weapon. All the smurf creatures are actually children that were transformed by the Japanese government. Tetsuo predictably uses his powers to wreak havoc and be a massive dick. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Tetsuo was an evil little shit to begin with! The psychic counsil of smurfs decide to tell Tetsuo about a former powerful psychic named Akira, even though they say they don't want him to find Akira. Tetsuo obviously starts immediately searching for Akira. Kaneda and some chick named Kay now need to stop Tetsuo's rampage, but this is easier said than done. In the end, Tetsuo is only defeated after the Smurfs resurrect Akira, who summons a black hole that seems to wipe out Tetsuo and most of the city, besides Kaneda and Kay for some reason. The film ends in the style of Kubrick's 2001 with a mind bending WTF sequence and heavily hinting that Tetsuo has become a Godlike being in another universe. I feel sorry for that universe!\
Characters: 8/10\
The main characters are the fairly righteous and honorable gangster Kaneda and the weak, frustrated Tetsuo who becomes increasingly insane and corrupted by power. It is interesting that many of history's most horrible dictators were once abused children that felt powerless and angry just like Tetsuo. This makes Tetsuo a fairly realistic villian and far better than the average 80s anime villian that was simply evil because...why not? Now why the government was so stupid that they gave someone obviously evil and mentally unstable Godlike psychic powers is anyone's guess. Akira does have more than a few plotholes, especially since it is a VERY condensed adaptation of the original manga.\
Sound: 5/10\
The soundtrack is certainly...unique. I really didn't like it though. It is very hit and miss avant garde style of music.\
Art: 10/10\
When this first came out, it was one of the most incredible looking animated films the world had ever seen! Even today in 2014 it looks visually stunning. The number of colors, the animation, the character models. Everything is absolutely spectacular. The amazing and often surreal visuals are the highlight of Akira. If it was just a novel with no visuals, the story and characters are fine, but not good enough to give it such long lasting cult appeal. It is the visuals and imagery that steal the show and make Akira such a classic of anime and film in general! Akira looks so fucking cool my crazy Russian ex-girlfriend bought a motorcycle and got a motorcycle license immediately after watching Akira. Driving around on a motorcycle weilding a metal pipe makes you look like a badass!\
\
Overall: 8/10\
There has been talk for 20 years of a live action American remake of Akira. Eventually we did get Chronicle, which is extremely based off Akira and has the Tetsuo/Kaneda relation between the 2 main characters. The runt of the gang gets corrupted by his new powers and goes on a killing rampage in the same style as Tetsuo. When the Tetsuo character is wandering around killing people in a hospital gown with the exact same camera shots as the original Tetsuo's hospital rampage, it is pretty hard to miss. Hell, when the Kaneda character screams ANNDREEWWW as a blatant homage to the original infamous scene, everyone in my entire theater started screaming TEETTTSSSUUOOOOOOO! Despite the relative success of Chronicle, no \"official\" adaptation is likely any time soon. Honestly I don't think a live action film can capture the surreal visuals of the original that made it so special. Chronicle already did a great job remaking the plot and characters, but those weren't what made Akira truly great. Like I mentioned, the plot and characters are good, but it was those trippy visuals that took Akira from simply good to legendary!\

    Breathtaking, imaginative, and ground breaking. Even these few words don't really justify the late 1980s film \"Akira\". \
Story: 7\
Film is a lot different than serialized works because execution is key. This is not to state that execution isn't important in a serial, but just lesser in comparison. A movie doesn't have a elongated run time too double back, and fix issues. Execution is something that \"Akira\" suffers from. This is a large tale with many different layers, with an expansive lore base, and a fleshed out world. Sadly 2 hours isn't quite enough, and quite a few things are left vague compared to the Manga.\
          \
        After a couple of viewings however there is enough within the film to piece the entire puzzle together, but an extra couple of minutes of run time could of helped. This aside \"Akira's\" overall plot, and setting are really imaginative. By the time the credits rolled I was taken aback by what I just finished watching. The film not only left a impression on me, but on the industry as a whole. \
Art: 10\
Captivating almost doesn't do it justice. Age usually isn't kind to older works when you go back too a certain point. Dodgy frame work, and overall lack of detail become noticeable with these films of the past. But not with \"Akira\". Brimming with creativity \"Akira\" delivers a vibrant dystopia filled to the brim with overwhelming attention to detail. Every gunshot wound, and gory mutilation is jaw dropping. This for me at least is the films strongest aspect. It feels like you are watching moving art. Now the character designs have that realistic kind of feel, which is a plus because it adds to the overall effect of the film. \
Sound: 8\
The OST is funky, wacky, and demands your attention when it's playing. This is both good, and bad. I found the score to be highly original, and fun. But the issues lies in the fact that it is just plains ridiculous, and jarring during some ques. I loved it, but be weary it's not for everyone. Now the voice cast across the board did a stellar job. Special shout out to Iwata, Mitsuo who voiced Kaneda. He was smooth, ridiculous, and a lot of fun, and his voice contributed to a lot of this.  \
Character: 7\
This is another issues with the film. With so much to tell a lot of the characterization that was present in the Manga got reduced down to a couple of scenes. Even then it was only for a few of the characters. Such is the way with a film adaptation, but luckily I still feel it did a good job with how much time they had. Kaneda was the ever likable protagonist, and a bad ass to boot. I found myself pulled into every scene he was in. Tetsuo is the other main character in this story, and one of the central focuses of the tale. Both were unique, and likable in their own ways. Now from the supporting cast there isn't much.  I did however really like Colonel Shikishima. For a good chunk of the movie I was actually on his side, but besides him the rest left much to be desired for. They were enjoyable, but didn't have much under the hood. \
Enjoyment: 9\
One of my favorite Anime films, and in my eyes a true classic. \"Akira\" left an impression, and lived up to its praise. \
Overall: 8.2\
This film is truly unique, and a classic that stood the test of time. With a few execution problems, and a little lacking in the character department this film still deserves its acclaim. I would highly recommend this to just about everyone for it's an experience that one should form their own thoughts on. Anyways those are my thoughts, and as always thanks for reading.",

    When comes to cyberpunk, I always have dificult in analyse things up, because they're too much mixed and non-linear. Not that I don't like non-linearity, but sometimes people make of it an artifice of narrative to make things sound like \"complex\", even not being. That's is the case of Akira.\
The story was a little odd in the very beggening, but after a few scenes it becomes completely awkward to me. I don't like when the plot elements are thrown in my face, but the contrary is not good at all. You can't situate yourself in Akira environment (at least in anime) because it lacks the\
          \
        development factor.. The characters are just too strange. I can know what they doing sometimes, but I never know what they are and why they're doing that stuffs. Seriously, it comes a point where you just can't link the points, even trying so hard. And by the end you comes to know that there's no points. Just arbitrary cyberpunk violent events shooted towards you in 24fps.\
The animation was gorgeous. Seriously, even by today's standards, that was a great masterpiece. It can be hard for newcomers in anime even process those high-frame scenes and detailed scenarios. The sound was rare focused, but when it appeared it was pretty interesting. Based mostly in percussion, you can see the Originality factor that lacks in almost every anime I've watched.\
Last but not least, the characters. Oh boy, here we comes to decepction again. I don't know about the manga (I plan to read soon), but in this movie, the characters are just mediocre. I'm surely not the first one to say that only Tetsuo has some development, because it's the pure truth. Sounds like they're are used only as an attempt of dramatize the empty story that we see on the movie. Instead of telling their motivations, showing some meaningful dialogues like those that are in Ghost in the Shell, etc, we just endup by watch a bunch of thrown characters being utilized for senseless violence exposition and confusing more and more our minds and expectations for the show.\
Anyway, it's like a lot of anime I've seen until now. A undeniable well-designed anime, but with a weak story-telling and almost empty characters. I wound't recommend to anyone, except for someone who doesn't want to understand anything and see a lot of violence exposure.\

    Contrary to many opinions, this movie is quite bad. Firstly, the whole background story about Akira itself is never explained, which causes alot of confusion during the movie. Then there is the static characters which just drag down the plot line, because you have no idea why or how they are connected to it. The movie itself contains very little action until towards the end, but even then it gives little satisfaction. In many ways this is like dragon ball but on a much lower scale then even that.

    Over the years, many anime have come out that have helped define the genre. Full Metal Alchemist will often appear at the number one spot on any top-ten list you come across. There are the classics from the 90‚Äôs such as Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and Neon Genesis Evangelion that constantly remind us of an older generation of anime. And who could ever forget the big three of Bleach, Naruto and One Piece? Many of us became interested in anime because of their influence. Still, although these names have left their mark on the history of anime, one stands above them all. That anime is a\
          \
        true masterpiece. That anime is Akira.\
Akira is considered to be a landmark in Japanese film, as well as one of the most influential animated films of all time. Not only has it influenced much of the art of the illustrators in the manga industry, but it also helped to open a gateway to anime for those outside Japan. The movie has also garnished a huge cult following since its release.  \
Now, don‚Äôt think that I think Akira is a masterpiece just because it‚Äôs old and influential. The presence of Akira was initially what drew me to watching it, and I can assure you that Akira is worthy of its following.\
Starting off with the story, the setting of Akira takes place in the year 2019 in a city called Neo-Tokyo. Thirty years prior was a nuclear explosion that demolished Tokyo and sparked WWIII, and Neo-Tokyo was built on Tokyo‚Äôs ashes. If you want more than that, read the synopsis, although I would recommend not doing so. The story of Akira is one of the most complex I‚Äôve ever seen. If you read its synopsis, you‚Äôll just get spoiled a few things and still be confused. From what I can see, the main thing that turns people off about Akira is just how convoluted it actually is. You see, the writer of the source material (who was also the writer of the movie btw) still had not finished the story yet. Along with that, there was tons of material to fit in one movie. I read about a third of the first volume of the manga and I could tell right away that the writer had to change a lot of things and cut a lot of corners to make the movie possible. All things considered, Akira‚Äôs adaptation to a movie was spectacular. Also, I think that Akira‚Äôs complexity works for it as the movie has a lot of re-watch value.\
Without going very in depth, I will discuss the characters. Backstory is minimal (which is logical seeing that it‚Äôs a movie with a large cast) but the amount distributed is appropriate. We get a general sense of what drives the characters‚Äô actions, and that is enough. It would be appropriate to say that the characters fall in certain ‚Äúgroups‚Äù during the course of the movie. Characters find themselves in different places and do their own thing, all while coming together at the end of the movie. While the cast size is moderately large, there are several members that make big impacts on the story. The less forgettable characters the better. \
I will talk about art and sound at the same time, as they are my favorite parts of the movie. A big reason why people like to avoid older anime is because, well, they look old. Also, if an old anime doesn‚Äôt have a big enough budget, the animation suffers even more. A good example of this is Neon Genesis Evangelion. You would have these scenes filled with movement, only for the movement to stop, exposing the animations age. For an anime from 1988, Akira has aged wondrously. Your blood begins to boil as the song ‚ÄúKaneda‚Äù starts playing while the biker gang moves out, leaving behind a trail of light. You quake in fear as a helicopter is thrown down a street while you hear: DUUUUUUN. DUUUUUUN. DUNN-DUNN. Suspense hangs in the air when an unstoppable foe crushes a tank with sheer mind power as a crowd cheers, screams and wails. \
I think I made it clear how big of a spectacle Akira is by now. \
As you already know, I enjoyed Akira a ton. When I look at Akira I see a timeless classic. In fact, whether you like it or not, that is what it is. Even if just to appreciate its impact on anime, it is certainly worth your time. Akira is a landmark in anime, movies and entertainment. ",

    It looks pretty; that's for sure. Not the expanding mass of human organs: that was pretty gross. But, Akira's reputation as a technical marvel is well-earned. Fluidly-animated action takes place in detailed, Blade Runner-esque cityscapes and ominous military interiors. Everything from the futuristic motorcycles to the giant, sweating teddy bears creates a vision of the future that is captivating, haunting, and surreal. The iconic animation of Kaneda shouting \"TETSUO!\" consists of 131,354 cels. \
This marvelous display of excellence in animation goes on for about two hours. It was adapted from a manga series of six phone books. While watching the film, a particular thought flashed\
          \
        through my brain several times: \"man, I bet that got a ton of development in the manga.\" The movie introduces this expansive world with its own tense political atmosphere, but I never knew what those protestors were protesting. I didn't know what that crooked politician was up to. Most of the character development goes to Tetsuo, the angsty psychic boy, while Kaneda never truly feels like that iconic hero he is supposed to be. And Kei: am I supposed to care who she is? The whole plot of the movie feels rushed and lacking that narrative detail I assume was in the phone books.\
Should you watch Akira? Sure. Fans of animation will want to see all that hand-drawn, cyberpunk glory, and once again, it does look impressive. But, I don't think the story earns the word \"iconic.\"\

    I gave this movie a 6, and here's why. You'll enjoy this movie very much if you're some kind of deep hipster art major or a dumb ass with a philosophy major. This movie is very visually pleasing and I say that not knowing what other sh*tty movies looked like in the 80's. Bottom line, it looks good. Now lets talk about the story, and I won't spoil the \"story\" if that's what you want to call it.

If you're like me, you stumbled on this sh*tty movie thinking it'll be like a nice \"Dragon Ball\" anime with a nice plot and plenty of action that makes sense, but no, all you get is a waste of two hours and then another hour wasted searching on multiple websites like reddit and yahoo answers to find the meaning of the movie because it left you confused and with a disgusting head ache. Even when you search for a meaning, multiple hipsters that tried to answer the question \"what does the 1988 anime film Akira mean?\" you're going to get a bunch of different answers because everyone who acts like they know what it means just interpreted themselves and then go as far as calling it a piece of art. I'm going to end this on the note of saying that if you want to get brain f*cked and have no idea what you got into, then go ahead, watch it. Just don't go thinking it'll be about motorcycles and futuristic weapons, because it's not. You're better off wondering why Vince Vaughn still acts and ruins or films like how this movie will ruin your life.\

    In every medium there exist certain seminal works whose influence is beyond all doubt. They go beyond mere popularity and endure as milestones long after countless other works which might have been a big deal in their own time have long since been forgotten. In theater they are the plays of Shakespeare and Sophocles. In live action film they are the likes of 'The Godfather', 'Rashomon', and 'Lawrence of Arabia'. And in the world of animation if there is any work that has the right to stand in defiance of its successors and dare them to even equal its feats it is 'Akira'.\
-Story-\
What happens when\
          \
        a civilization loses its initial energy and drive and gets in a rut? Most give themselves to hedonism, a few casually meddle in things far beyond their capabilities, and none give much thought to the consequences. The world of Neo Tokyo in 'Akira' is such a world. The city is an exhausted thing convulsed and wracked from within, not even aware of what it wants or is searching for. But such a state of affairs cannot continue forever, and when hubris and happenstance unleash something new, something nobody was prepared for.... well, let's see whats behind that curtain.\
'Akira' is a film that feels longer than its 2-hour run-time for all the right reasons. A lot happens here and not all of it is immediately obvious and blatantly explained, but enough of the story is straightforward that it is accessible on a basic level (although sitting down and thinking is most definitely the best way to go here). And get ready for some detailed and prolonged discussions over its meaning and themes. My personal theory is that it's about the decay, rebirth, and progress of civilization with a few statements about human nature thrown in, but I wouldn't exactly be surprised to hear radically different claims. In any event, you'll be mulling over 'Akira' long after you've finished watching it.\
-Art-\
The opening 5 minutes of this film are the animation equivalent of dropping the mic, and it doesn't go downhill from there. I feel SORRY for the next anime I review in the art department, how the heck are they going to look remotely good compared to this. Ridiculous levels of detail and fluidity are reached- if the age of cel animation is past this movie alone will ensure it will never be forgotten. The color palette and lighting is also excellent, 'Akira' is able to convey multiple different times of day and light sources extremely well. Being a product of the peak of the Japanese post-war miracle certainly helps the budget, but you can't just buy quality like so much rice, a stunning level of talent and effort clearly went into 'Akira'.\
-Sound-\
The soundtrack didn't go for techno, or rock, or anything you might associate with generic Sci-Fi. Rather, it is actually very simple, even primitive. Taiko drums, woodblocks, and simple tribal choirs are used here and to great effect. Take a look at the opening motorcycle sequence alone: it isn't a bombastic 80's 'battle' track meant to emphasize how 'radically cool' our protagonists are, but just a few voice and woodblock instruments to emphasize that the fight between two bike gangs we're watching is superficially high-tech, it's really just the latest version of some very primitive human behaviors. You could play it over 2 groups of samurai fighting in the Sengoku, or 2 cavemen slugging it with rocks out and it would fit just as well. Silence is also often used to great effect- the soundtrack knows what it's out there to do and doesn't waste time on stage just because it likes being seen. It's a toss-up whether to go with the new Johnny Yong Bosch and Wendee Lee dub or the Japanese original, though while I'm typically a dub supporter the English sub version might be slightly better (one or two Japanese voices seem to fit a bit better, and in the English dub there were a couple times when it seemed like lips and sound didn't line up just right). I understand that there's an older dub, but I've never seen it and can't speak for it good or bad- although 'old English dub' aren't exactly words that inspire confidence.\
-Characters-\
In a 2-hour film there are limits to how well you can develop a cast, that's just part of the medium. Still, 'Akira' does a good job with the time it's given. The highlight is Kaneda, my favorite 'delinquent' character. He's able to go from street-smart hard-case to desperately playing dumb and innocent in an instant. He's no saint, but you do get the sense that deep down he's not a lost cause. The rest of the cast gets less development but you can at least tell their basic personalities apart and nobody feels redundant or unnecessary- they work fine for a movie-length story. The cast may be the least impressive part of 'Akira' but even so it's still pretty good.\
-Enjoyment-\
After I first watched this film I couldn't believe that I'd taken so long to get to it. If the purpose of most anime is to create interest for the source material, well, you have my attention. You definitely need your brain on to get the most out of this film, this isn't exactly 'Ninja Scroll'.\
-Overall-\
It's freaking 'Akira'. The art quality boggles the mind, the sound is a daring gamble that paid off in spades, the story leaves you wanting to watch the movie again in the hope of finding even a single new detail. There's a very good reason this film is considered a cornerstone of anime. Lord Akira sits upon his Olympic throne and looks down in amusement at the champions later men have declared 'the greatest ever'. His place in the pantheon is unchallenged, and that is why 'Akira' receives only the second '10' rating I've ever handed out in these reviews.\

    Akira has been lamented as a work of pure genius and one of the most important works in the medium. It has also been criticized for its supposedly overly complex plot and gratuitous violence. It has been called revolutionary. It has been called disgusting. It has been called beautiful. It has been called overrated. I am just one man, so I can't give you all the answers, but I can tell you one thing.\
I really fucking love this movie.\
I've seen it, in total, three times. Each time brings a new level of understanding to the film. The plot is very complex and will probably take\
          \
        you at least two viewings to truly grasp what transpired over it's two hour runtime. \
It's set in Tokyo, after a catastrophic event leveled the city thirty one years earlier. It's been rebuilt into a dystopia ran by corrupt politicians. The streets are a war zone, as terrorists and protesters launch attacks daily. The city is destroying itself from the inside out. Not only that, but the government has been conducting experiments in an attempt to control extremely powerful psychic beings, who caused the damn destruction of the city in the first place. All of this, mixed in with a group of teenagers in the wrong place at the wrong time, creates a very complex and multi-faceted plot.\
I've heard the manga is very long and a lot of it had to be condensed into one film, and you can see a bit of strain here and there. Some plot lines aren't as fleshed out as others, some characters who seem to hold importance only make brief appearances. Despite all of this, the film really excels with its philosophical and intellectual themes and at its core, a story of two friends torn apart by the circumstances that be.\
There are quite a bit of characters in the film, from the military Colonel who only wants to save his city, to the mad scientist intent on learning the \"secrets of the universe\". Due to the limited running time, a lot of characters are only thing archetypes and don't get much development. This is a shame, but it doesn't really detract from the overall experience.\
Besides the Colonel (who is a very awesome character, if you ask me), only two other characters really have depth. That would be Kaneda and Tetsuo, two life-long friends who are forced to turn against each other. Tetsuo in particular, as his character is morphed into something completely different from when the film starts.  It's intriguing to watch as their relationship changes over the course of the film.\
Artistically, Akira is a marvel, especially for its time. The sheer detail in the sprawling, mangled cityscapes is particularly beautiful. Every shot has exquisite detail; it's crazy thinking about how much work went into this film. The film's look matches the dystopian setting perfectly. While the art is great, it's the animation that really excels. Every motion is extremely fluid and blends together realistically. The lip movements are perfectly synced to the voices as well (which is kind of rare, in my experience). \
The only detractors are the rather bland character designs. Several of the characters (especially the teenagers) have similar looking faces and it can sometimes be hard to tell them apart. It's a small problem, but I felt like it was worth mentioning nonetheless.\
The soundtrack is a booming behemoth of a creature. Industrial beats and ravaged, breathy chants blend together well, complementing the grotesque mood of the film. The sound effects are good as well, it captures the whirring of the motorcycles and the explosive action sequences well. \
The first two times I watched the film, I selected the English audio track. For the most recent viewing, I decided to use the Japanese audio track. While the English was pretty good overall, the film benefits from its native language. I felt like I understood the film better with the subtitles, honestly. Hey, though, it's up to you on which audio track you want to listen to.\
As for my personal enjoyment, I find this film to be incredibly entertaining. I hear the word \"boring\" getting thrown around a lot with this film, and I completely disagree. It has visually stunning actions sequences, a complex plot with many themes, good character interaction, and an ending that is still being interpreted to this day. Is it perfect? No, of course not. The plot can seem a little strained at times, and some characters are underdeveloped. You know what though? I honestly do not care. The film enraptured me from start to finish. \

    Akira is one of the most popular and influential anime movies ever made. I thought it was really impressive, but I also think that this movie is far from perfect.\
Plot (6/10) My main problem is that Akira's very confusing. There a few plotholes and the ending makes very little sense. That's because Akira is based of the manga with the same name, and it's probably not possible to fit a whole series of manga into 1 single movie. Also the manga wasn't even finished at the time. Especially the second half of the movie suffers from this. Therefore the plot is a little awkward at\
          \
        times and it almost feels like the movie tries to be deep, but fails. The overall premise isn't bad though: it's about a biker gang member who gets physic powers and goes on a rampage. Kinda like Elfen Lied, but less violent (which doesn't mean that Akira isn't violent though).\
Art (10/10). Probably the strongest aspect of this movie. It looks fantastic! Especially for a movie from 1988. The animations are great, the camera views are very impressive and the mouths actually move in a realistic way, insteadt of just opening and closing. The overall artstyle looks good too and I also really like how the city of Neo Tokyo looks.\
Sound (8/10). The music is really memorable and sets a creepy atmosphere. The Japanese voice acting is good, like in pretty much every other anime too (haven't watched it in English, but I heard there are 2 English dubs for some reason).\
Characters (7/10) The characters are pretty cool, but they seem a little underdeveloped at times (again, this is probably because the anime differs from the manga, so some characters play a different role in the original source material). I thought Tetsou himself was a little bit unbelievable. He became totally crazy and went on rampage, because he was bullied by the other gang members. My problem with Tetsou is, that he doesn't actually feel like a bullying victim. he was more like the Kuwabara of the movie IMO. \
Enjoyment/Overall (7/10). Akira is a great movie and you should definitely watch it (I mean it's a classic after all). It's very impressive from a technical standpoint and overall a really memorable movie  with great action scenes and some interesting ideas. BUT I didn't really understand what was going on half the time and the ending was disapointing for me. \

    Akira is a really crazy sci fi film that brought anime upon the western world and is one of the best anime movies of all time. If you ask me it was certainly one of the best anime films of its time and truly marvelled me. The action, the characters, and the story were are all awesome and the animation was utterly spectacular. But I have to say it was quite violent at sometimes it would make you gag and you lose direction because of the non stop and frustrating action scenes. The film was really good and I say great but went overboard with\

        the violence , sheer brutality, and explosions. Akira is an anime film I would recommend to anyone obsessed with anime and I really liked the antagonist tetsuo for his psychotic but sympathetic personality and his powers as well. But for me I did not like the blazing actions scenes and I prefer if there was a little in the direction in the film too. This anime gets 7 out of 10 from me for awesome and the cornerstone of anime films today but really needs to give people information on what's going in the plot in other words this anime was real cool but not and far from perfect. That's my review later anime fans.\

    Well, Akira, anyone who has watched anime knows Akira, you may not know what it's about but everyone has heard the name. Akira is definitely the most and possibly most talked about anime there is. But is Akira good is the true question, is it good, the answer sadly is no. \
Story 3/10: Okay, read these lines out loud \"KANEDA! TETSUO! *RATATAT!* *BOOM!**GRAHALGRAHAL!!*\" congratulations, you have just recited the whole plot of Akira that you will be able to understand. Yes there's more then just that but it makes absolutely no sense. You will always here from people \"read the manga\" but that's the problem,\
          \
        you shouldn't have to read the manga to understand the plot of the anime, that be like saying you have to read the comics to understand the plot of The Dark Knight.\
Art 10/10: This is Akira's true saving grace, it's ungodly good animation. Most anime features stiff characters that stand perfectly still for a majority of the time with nothing but their mouths moving into only a single position so it looks like the only thing they're saying is \"ah ah ah ah ah\" and it still somehow manages to look choppy. Akira on the other hand has constant movements from characters who actually move in a somewhat more relaxed and realistic manner, and they even have slight movements with dialogue and lip syncing, LIP SYNCING! And on top of it that animation is so smooth you will be in awe, I don't know how many frames per second Akira has but you will never find any anime that moves this smoothly (and this movie was made in 1988)\
Sound 5/10: First on music, the music in Akira was fine, nothing wrong with it what so ever, but it's forgettable. Most people will never remember a single song from Akira or feel compelled to listen to it again. Now as for the voice acting, first a little info, there are two dubs, one made back in 1989 (streamline) and another in 2001 (pioneer,) and there is constant debate among the Akira fanbase as to which one is good and bad, the truth is they're both bad. The streamline has the right emotions displayed and the actors can actually scream in pain and such when the script calls for it, but the characters in Akira are a bunch of 15-18 year old punks while the cast sound like they're all 40 year old greasers from the 50's, while the other dub had more suitable voices but the acting was half-assed, so you have a choice between bad acting or distracting out of place voices (I haven't seen the sub so I can't really talk about that)\
Character 6/10: The characters are kind of a love hate thing with me. For one I liked the major characters personalities, Tetsuo's punk \"kiss my ass\" nature (later turned psychotic power hungry mega being badass,) Kaneda's cocky, fun-loving, \"I just don't give a fuck\" attitude, and most of the bikers. Most of the other characters though were just horrible, from that resistance fighter with the mustache (pick which one) to the girl who looks like she's Kaneda's clone. Which raises the other issue, the character designs, every character looks like every other character from that group, Kaneda looks like Tetsuo with combed hair, the girl Kaneda meets looks so much like him he's practically moving around with a mirror, all the resistance fighter guys have trench coats and pencil mustaches and there's no way to tell any of them apart.\
Enjoyment 6/10: Okay, Akira had a confusing as all hell plot and lacking character designs, but still the animation is wonderful and that does help make the action scene brain melting. You will enjoy the hell out of the biker gang fights, the shootouts, the mutation scene near the end, and even some of the dialogue because of the movements and lip syncing (LIP SYNCING! The lips actually move to accommodation the word being said!!! I still can't get over this!) is enjoyable. So yes although a lot of the time you're just gonna be saying \"get on with it!\" there will be many enjoyable moments. \
Overall 6/10: Akira is essentially the Citizen Kane of anime, what could possibly be called the single most important movie in anime, and it has truly set the bar from animation quality (a bar that no other anime has come anywhere close to.) But ultimately this film is the most over-rated anime there is, yet it's one of the most important to anime, I'd say watch it just so you can say you have (maybe you might enjoy it if you did read the manga, who knows.) \

    Fact: The Wright brothers' airplane was the first ever man made, rideable, controllable, heavier - than - air machine. It revolutionized human civilization on the scales with which only a few discoveries/inventions are comparable. \
Question: Was it a GOOD airplane? \
No. It was a crapy piece of junk that could barely fly and couldn't make a turn. \
Conclusion: not EVERY \"first\" is the GREATEST. As a matter of fact, not every first is even AMONG the greats. \
Akira, in many aspects, did for anime what the Wright brothers' plane did for aeronautics. It revolutionized anime. It changed many viewers' perceptions and expectations of what can\
          \
        be done with this weird art form from the land of the rising sun. It proved that it can do a lot more than disproportionate girls with eyes the size of flying saucers and foreheads you can land a 747 on. Heck, to be fair, it even looks a LOT better than the Wrights' ground breaking but rather deformed effort. \
It did a bunch of other things too, though. Other, NOT so praise worthy things. \
Akira set the trend for countless followers who thought LOOKING cool, IS being cool. Brought about the doctrine of \"the hell with logic and cohesiveness as long as you have awesome visuals\". It yielded a never ending array of smartass-wannabe anime and manga in which the amount of MEANINGLESS blood and gore and angry pre-pubescent protagonists were directly proportional to how fuckin' philosophically deep! the piece would be. \
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against blood, gore, or philosophical depth. But I need to see an effort on the part of the artist. An effort in creating a universe in which such extremities - or any other plot device for that matter - make SENSE. In creating characters from which such behaviour is justified, or at least understandable. Not a mish-mash of ideas pasted together SO haphazardly that you get the feeling not even the creator knew where he/she was going with it. \
All in all, nobody can deny the influence Akira has had on the medium that is Anime. But just like the Wrights' plane, it can barely fly. And I doubt you'd be willing to take a ride on that thing even if Emma Watson would promise to tag along. You'd much rather appreciate it on display, in a museum, with both your feet solidly on the ground. Akira should be approached in the same way. It's a museum piece. A damn important one indeed. But not necessarily a good one.  \

    Akira is a very complex movie. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff happening all at once and it uses a lot of symbolic imagery to tell its story. Because of this the average person probably won‚Äôt understand it on their first watch, so you‚Äôll probably have to re-watch it a couple of times before it starts to make sense. \
But that's kind of what I like about akira, it isn‚Äôt a simple, linear story. It's more of a jigsaw puzzle that you have to solve yourself. Each time you re-watch it, you‚Äôll start to notice tiny little details that probably flew over your head the first\
          \
        time you watched it. After a while the pieces of the puzzle will start to fit together, and you‚Äôll finally start to understand the meaning behind the story. \
Katsuhiro otomo (the author of the akira manga) basically put all his opinions on political issues, social issues and even life itself into akira, so it‚Äôs quite a lot to take in. It also tries to condense a six volume manga into a single movie (but i think it only adapted the first two volumes and part of the third volume) so some of the ideas aren‚Äôt as fleshed out as they could have been. however, I still think the content covered in the movie is pretty good. \
I won‚Äôt talk about all the individual themes present in this movie for two reason:\
1: It's already been talked about multiple times in the past, so if I started to talk about that kind of stuff then I‚Äôd just end up repeating what other people have already said.\
2: The thing I enjoyed most about the movie was trying to figure out the meaning behind the story by myself and I want people who haven‚Äôt seen the movie to have the same experience with it as I did.\
I will however talk about some of the more basic elements of akira‚Äôs story. \
One thing I really like about akira is how there isn‚Äôt one single protagonist. While the story mainly focuses on kaneda and tetsuo, it is also some times shown from kei‚Äôs point of view or colonel Shikishima‚Äôs point of view or from another character‚Äôs point of view. This gives the story has a huge scope and also lets you see the social issues of neo-tokyo from different perspectives. \
Not only can akira be praised for its complex narrative, it can also be admired purely for its artistic and technical achievements. Visually speaking, it's years ahead of its time.\
One thing you‚Äôll notice about akira is just how much movement there is in each scene. This makes it stand out from other works of its time, as most 80‚Äôs anime had very sparse animation and relied heavily on still images and reused animation.\
Another thing worth noting is the character‚Äôs facial expressions. In a lot of older anime (and even in a lot of modern anime) the only part of the face that is animated is usually the mouth, the rest of the face just remains still during dialog scenes. Characters usually have big and very detailed eyes. This is because  their emotions can be shown through their eyes instead of through their other facial features. \
Akira isn‚Äôt like that though. You‚Äôll notice that the characters in akira have very simplistic and usually undetailed eyes. All their facial features can be seen clearly, where as in the majority of other anime they are usually simplified and go unnoticed. The character‚Äôs emotions are told using their whole face, not just their eyes. \
The audio for akira was recorded before the staff started to animate. Because of this, the japanese audio syncs perfectly with the character's lip movements. \
Every single background in akira is incredibly detailed. For example if the scene takes place in a prison cell, it isn‚Äôt just an empty prison cell. There‚Äôs always litter on the ground, graffiti on the wall etc. It‚Äôs simple thing, but it adds a lot of life to each scene.\
Overall akira is a must watch for fans of classic sci-fi anime and also for anyone who is trying to get into older anime. \
Thanks for reading. Any feedback will be appreciated, as long as it‚Äôs constructive.\

    Akira is a violent 1988 dystopian cyberpunk apocalypse (based off the identically named manga) that boasts incredible animation, atmosphere, scenery and unique imagery, that all seem to prove the English tagline of the film right; \"Neo-Tokyo is about to E.X.P.L.O.D.E.!\"\
Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, the author of Akira, whose other works include such manga as Domu and Mother Sarah, films both live-action and animated (his other most notable anime film being Roujin Z), and contributions to anime anthologies such as Manie-Manie Meikyuu Monogatari (localized as Neo-Tokyo in English-speaking regions), Akira drops us into the world of Neo-Tokyo in the year 2019, 30 years after the original\
          \
        Tokyo was destroyed by a massive explosion. The city of Neo-Tokyo is a dark and gritty place, with seemingly no care for its average citizen and their dwellings, being accentuated with futuristic neon lights, huge large-screen display televisions and holograms alongside tall monolithic skyscrapers and tidy urban plazas. The local government responsible for this decaying city seems to be at war with local protestors and rebel groups as well as struggling to control its rampant and aggressive criminals, and  it's within this setting that the apocalyptic events of Akira begin.\
Despite being 30 years old now at the time of writing this review, Akira's animation is fluid and full-ranged, rarely if ever taking animation shortcuts, with impressive techniques and continously believable in its motion and physics, even during some of the more supernatural scenes. The art of Akira is also stunning, with its futuristic technologies, skyscrapers and decaying urban areas all being rendered in meticulous detail, with a fittingly industrial colour usage to match its dystopian, hostile atmosphere. With all this futuristic stuff on display, the soundtrack is in contrast quite ancient-sounding, with tribal drumming, dramatic and loud chants, and eerie ambience, which is all used to quite memorable effect in the film, while also being interesting and haunting outside the film's context. If I were to describe how Akira's visuals and audio were used together, it would be that everything was done to make the film feel absolutely huge in terms of physical size, even in small scenes set within apartment rooms.\
Now, despite how memorable Akira is, its characters and plot are somewhat weak. They're there for the most part, and the main characters do have somewhat clear personalities but don't ever really develop beyond their initial personalities, besides one of them, nor do any of the main groups' in the cities' motivations ever get explained. The film never really explains what the rebels plan to do or what they're doing, what the military plans to do to handle any of the city's problems, where psychic powers come from, nor who or what Akira is. The film's story, for the most part, focuses mostly on what happens to Tetsuo, one of the main characters of the film, as he begins to change as a result of his powers from a timid young man to a power-tripping egomaniac, and gives us some clear understanding into his mind as to why he acts as he does, and as a result he becomes the only truly fleshed out character in the film. The motivations and personalities of the characters do get fleshed out somewhat more in the manga (though even then some things still go unexplained) as the film had only adapted the story of the manga about halfway into its publication, but for the most part, in both the manga and film, Akira focuses on its visual spectacle to deliver extremely memorable imagery, and the film does have many memorable moments.\
The film has had 2 dubs, and I've watched only the Streamline dub (with Johnny Yong Bosch as Kaneda). From comparison, I find the original Japanese has more fitting voice acting for its main and supporting characters and is generally better than the dub, though the Streamline dub is by no means egregrious enough to worsen the experience of watching Akira.\
Overall, I give Akira a 7. It's a very engaging movie with very impactful and stylish visuals that I still find incredibly unique among its peers and well done for a project of its scale, and some scenes carry incredible energy and memorability, but its weakness of plot and characters detract from multiple rewatches, though I'd still recommend you'd give it a watch.\

    Akira is God.\
The first time I watched Akira I was awed by the scope of everything the movie perfected. The animation is undeniably gorgeous, the action is undeniably engaging, and the characters are undeniably likable. The climax and ending was both bizarre and incredible, something that I had to show everyone. I watched Akira a couple more times with the same feelings, even if the people I showed it to were bored to death and/or fell asleep. Keep in mind these people also dislike The Godfather.\
After watching Akira again this year, I came away with even more. I‚Äôve read the manga twice by now, and\
          \
        it‚Äôs only heightened my adoration of the film. Akira is more than a classic, more than an iconic set of characters, more than an influence upon the entire science fiction genre of film. This time I watched it alone on a weekend, relaxed and without any prior or upcoming stresses. This is the perfect way to get a real feel of a film. It sounds cheesy, but my favorite movies are all movies that I feel like I‚Äôve touched the soul of. I flow with the film, missing nothing, feeling the mix of the soundtrack, the dialogue, the action, and the backgrounds. I interpret the film, whether a meaning is meant to be there or not. The movie becomes more than a movie; it becomes a feeling or oftentimes a piece of philosophy.\
Akira is God. He‚Äôs explained in the movie as life energy itself; as one with the knowledge of all creation and even before. In reality, at-least at first, he‚Äôs just a kid who had the same ability as Tetsuo and the other nursery kids, but more. My first thought when I finished the film this time, when the animation becomes abstract and you hear loudly ‚ÄúI am Tetsuo,‚Äù was that they were humans tapping in to God‚Äôs power or the Tao or Brahmana or whatever we wish to call it and it ended up too much for them. I then realized that yes, this is partly true, but more than that they BECOME that power. They reach the Hindu ideal of moksha. They become One with God. Therefore, Akira is God. By the end of the film, Tetsuo, Kiyoko, Masaru, and Takashi are as well. Kaneda has some idea of this when he escapes the explosion.\
The back of my bluray/DVD combo pack quotes The Village Voice as saying ‚ÄúA fever dream masterpiece.‚Äù That is undoubtedly one of the best descriptions of the movie that I‚Äôve heard. The things that happen in Akira are absurd, awesome, and beautiful. It‚Äôs one of my favorite films to re-watch and it‚Äôs just really fucking cool. If the brotherhood between Kaneda and Tetsuo doesn‚Äôt make you cry, you‚Äôre fucked in the head. Watch Akira again, you‚Äôll keep on getting more from it.\

25 years after this cultural phenomenon was released in cinemas worldwide, it is still unbelievable to fathom its almost traumatic impact it has had on nearly every form of media since. AKIRA, an adaption of quite possibly the greatest game-changer of illustrated literature, was among the first anime to cross the Pacific over to the United States of America. It was a test of the waters, to see if the West could appreciate anime as a new media form.\
Few other decisions in film have left nearly as large of an impact.\
From the start AKIRA was a cult classic,\
          \
        an innovation, a new art form screened in art houses across the country. It was a whole new look at a new style in storytelling, one the general public could never experience in the West. Much like Akira Kurosawa's impressive filmography it is almost unfathomable how much of an impact it has had on film since. It has heavy and prominent influence in such media as Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 4 and 5, Cloud Atlas, AI: Artificial Intelligence, one of the best episodes of South Park (Trapper Keeper) , Ghost in the Shell and nearly every other manga/anime since, and most notably The Matrix. The Wachowski Brothers even said if it weren't for AKIRA, The Matrix could not have been made.\
The manga series it is based on is massive, spanning 6 expansive Volumes and chronicling a larger than life saga of greed, corruption, madness, and anarchy all surrounding a tragic event that will forever change Neo-Tokyo. The film does its absolute best to try to cover the 2000+ page manga series, but to be fair the manga wasn't even finished by the time the film was released. It summarizes entire issues with 2 sentence lines, and though not required at all to read the manga prior (As I had not) reading it would give a possibly overwhelming clearer picture and backstory. However, the film is articulately crafted enough so these densities go unnoticed to one who simply wants to enjoy the greatest and most influential anime film ever made.\
Yes it is an anime film, but don't think of it as simply drawing on paper. This is a full blown deep psychological science fiction cyberpunk social commentary on humanity and brotherhood, one that demands constant viewings to keep up with. The more I think about AKIRA, the better it becomes. The animation has aged like fine wine and it still the greatest traditional animation I have seen since Fantasia. There is so much effort put into every line, every color choice (As them manga is black and white color choice really stands as noteworthy here), and it diverges away from the anime cliche of mouths flapping to \"kind of\" make it match their words. The audio and mouthing are as perfectly synced as they can be, and that's very rare for anime.\
It doesn't take much to think of this as not animated and simply a moving canvas. From the blazing neon of Neo-Tokyo's gangs riding their motorbikes to the mass destruction of a man-made God leveling the entire city, every frame looks like a deep and extravagant artwork. There is a ferocious and lively intensity and passion that pops out to the viewer and demands attention with its pure extravagance.\
Aside from animation, the film score is simply majestic to say the least, easily being Top 5 material for my favorite scores in film. Shoji Yamashiro has created something truly unique here, a style I have yet to see replicated at all. Diverging from the trope of cyberpunk setting requiring synth electronica music bombarding out of computers, AKIRA's score is a tribal one, with chants in Latin and Japanese, oriental chimes, melodramatic organs, and tribal beatings of drums. Few film scores get me as hyped and pumped as \"Kaneda's Theme\" or \"Tetsuo\" or make me feel enlightened as \"Requiem\". It feels almost evangelical, which is perfect considering the film's heavy religious parallels and Hiroshima influence. It's beautiful, disturbing, angelic, upsetting, enlightening, and haunting all at once.\
While still being strikingly philosophical and cerebral the film is still one of the most compelling and crowd pleasing I have ever seen, and every time I watch it with company we all anticipate the next \"TETSUO!\" or \"KANEDA!\" and cheer with passionate euphoria at their cues. Though it pales in comparison with the sweeping epic of written fiction it is an adaption of, this was sort of intended, as author and director Katsuhiro Otomo intended to make 2 totally different stories. The film, a religious commentary while the manga is a political one.\
And this is all without even gracing the plot.\
In the year 1988, all life as we knew it came to an end. However, the end was just the beginning.\
2019. Neo-Tokyo. A wasteland of innovation and chaos. Anarchy reigns in riots on the streets, and the army and government try in lal their power to suppress it and reclaim order and civility. A biker gang, two members of which named Tetsuo and Kaneda, roam the streets, fighting other biker gangs. In a freak accident, Tetsuo is seriously injured and is seized by the government. In hidden labs he is experimented on, turning him into a psionic soldier, a God among men.\
They fail to understand what a God does when he finds out he is being controlled by mere ants. Thus, the true end comes.\
NEO-TOKYO\
IS ABOUT TO\
E.X.P.L.O.D.E!\
This is all you need to and should know. An epic by every definition, AKIRA was, is, and always will be a true landmark, a pinnacle of animation. Calling it the greatest animated film made is a horrible understatement given the connotation of \"animation\" as it is much more. It's an artistic pinnacle, the beginning of a revolution of storytelling here in the West, the bridge to a whole new world in Japan, the bringing of anime to the West. A haunting, bizarre, at time revolting, yet all in all poetic and strikingly beautiful and breathtaking experience you will never forget, and find it hard to walk away from.\
Oh yeah, as rule of all anime, sub over dub. The English dub is laughable and the Japanese audio actually fits the mouthing of the characters.\
The manga however totally and wholly CRUSHES this film in every way possible. If a fan of this film, check out the manga. It is unbelievably better. But it's fine, they're both totally different stories.\

    Akira is one of those movies that everyone whose seen it, or at least most everyone, will recommend it to all of there friends. The way I found the movie was no different, one of my friends recommended the movie to me and without saying to much it is a very unique and interesting movie. I will say this though, I've since read the manga and it is a lot more detailed and layered then this movie is, but Akira stands out in its own right for simply being such a unique film. the story is both open ended and satisfying, a type of ending\
          \
        that is rarely done correctly in any medium much less anime. I'll  promise you that you'll be thinking about the ending to this film long after your first viewing. When I watched it my first time it messed with my head so bad that I watched it again the next day to see if I had somehow missed something. Every time I've watched Akira I've noticed something I didn't see before, which in my opinion is what a true master work should be like.\
As for the art style, I think it has aged very well for a show that came out in 1989. older art style hasn't ever effected my enjoyment of the anime I've seen, but it is understandable if you are used to more modern animation. I think that this movies art is like its story, unique and interesting. \
I can't really go on with this review without saying something that i didn't like about this movie though, because its not perfect. A lot of characters had to have much smaller roles in the film then in the manga, another reason you should definitely read the manga. The characters other then I suppose Tetsuo don't get much development in this movie which Im not going to lie, was a bit disappointing. All I'll say is that if your looking for a very character driven story this might not be what you're looking for. Overall this is a great film, and I'm happy to recommend it to all my friends who haven't seen it.",

    I doubt that I could say anything about Akira that hasn't been said already. It's THE legendary anime movie, the one that all my friends/even random strangers said they'd heard of or they knew was excellent.\
I respect what the creators were trying to do. I respect Akira's art and how great it was at that time. I respect the effects Akira made on the anime genre and its introduction into mainstream cinemas, etc.\
But I didn't like Akira. I'm not saying that it shouldn't be liked (thanks for the messages, by the way, all so lovely.) I just didn't like it, personally. I'm entitled to that.\
          \
        Not everyone has to like the things you like. I don't like green beans. I don't have to like them because someone else does. The end.\
Story: 5 for Mediocre\
There was too much going on, to a point where I did not care about it. From my understanding, thousands of pages of manga were condensed into this two hour configuration. Well, it shows, that's for sure. Yes, there's points, but the story wasn't suspenseful enough to get me into discovering what they were.\
Art and Sound: 7 for Good\
I respect the art and sound. The art is nice and it flows together well. Can carry its weight now, but isn't exactly timeless. The colours were too muted for it to look like something other than straight out of the '80s or '90s. But I'll give credit where it's due.\
Character: 5 for Mediocre\
Going back to the story -- there were too many things going on for me to care about the characters. None stood out.\
Enjoyment: 3 for Poor\
I didn't enjoy it. (Again, YOU can enjoy it! I just didn't.)\
Overall: 6 for Fair\
My personal opinion: Akira is overrated. Nostalgia is a helluva drug, and I think a lot of people are swallowing it down in spades. \
And I think even more anime-watchers are trying at seeing something. I hate that this movie was portrayed as something I should like, because I enjoy watching anime. But it just wasn't for me. Was it the \"cyberpunk\" theme? Was it the weird green girl that was the final straw? Who knows. Take my words with a grain of adobo, too. No hate, all love. If you like Akira, that's cool. If I liked it, I would've given it a 7.\

    tl;dr\
The film was very character driven, yet because of how condensed the show was, I never attached to the characters and thus nothing worked for me. \
Most of the positive reviews here seem to be written by people who have read the manga, which explains a lot. Perhaps I would of enjoyed the show much more if not for how meaningless everything it seemed. I guess you could say that it's The End of Evangelion, but without the Neon Genesis Evangelion. The show mostly revolved around a 70 minute long landslide, with the rest devoted to setting the stage. Now, while the landslide was undoubtedly\
          \
        impressive, I can't help but think the the show got its priorities mixed up beforehand, there was definitely a buildup to the fallout, but the groundwork for all of this was never laid in the first place, which was developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. I firmly believe that this is the show's achilles heel and is the sole reason why I did not enjoy an otherwise interesting film. \
The meaning of the plot disappointed me, it was an age old aesop that perhaps would've stuck with me had I been more immersed in the story. Again, the reason for this is the lack of empathy developed between me and the cast.\
Aside from this, the animation was impressive, but not revolutionary or unbelievable. The OST was poorish, it seemed short, but atleast nothing was repeated too much because most of the show was without music, nothing stood out as being amazing, but atleast one tune struck me as bizarre. The theme is low tech mild dystopia cyberpunk, and at least the world was very well done. I'd love to watch a longer show set in the same universe. \

    I was recently asked a question that has been bugging me for over a week. What anime has been influential to anime today? Several came to mind, but  after some serious debate I believe Akira is that great classic. It has cemented the imaginations of many illustrators and led to the growth of anime outside of Japan. \
Story: 8/10\
In a post-apocalyptic community of Neo-Tokyo, wrecked with stagnation, anti-government, and gang violence sets the stage for Akira. The story essentially is an example of society tearing itself part at the seams and how this effects everyone including the characters. The story is action packed with\
          \
        good pacing, so nothing ever feels rushed. Other than that, I don't really have any negative comments on the story. I could list off all the positive, but that would take forever. \
Characters: 9/10\
Unlike most animes or stories, the characters are neither good nor bad. Instead they are not painted simplistically and they all are surprisingly complex with various backgrounds. For example, Kaneda is a street thug, skirt chaser who is caught in the middle of a revolution. Tetsuo is a misguided youth suffering from an inferiority complex that manifests latent psychic abilities. Nobody is black or white, but vary in shades of grey. \
Art 10/10 and Sound 9/10:\
One of the movie's greatest aspects, is its powerful and graphic scenes. The animation quality is outstanding even trumping alot of modern day animation. The detailed, and unparalleled background art is inspiring. No background is ever used twice, be it from blinking street lights or a random person exiting a building. I have yet to find an anime with so much detail in everyday environment. The characters realistic and smooth motion is something I also noted with modern animation as still a problem, in which Akira delivers. The music is also something that stands out fitting each scene incredibly well. Along with detail in even the small things from a ceiling fan to revving an engine.\
Akira has the best anime has to offer, and has a magnificent story that you will never forget. Akira is not for the squeamish and is a chilling vision of what the future may hold. Akira is a classic that should be remembered for decades to come. \

    Akira - 7/10\
First, let me talk to you about the setting:\
It's a futuristic dystopian world after the world war 3 where everything is solved through violence and unrest spread through the commonwealth as the country is breaking down through revolutionary protests with biker gangs and secret organisations struggle to co-exist and the army is working with the police to hunt down anti-goverment groups.\
There are people trying to control the power of god all for their self-interests but none of them know if they can control it. They all want to be strong and want to be leaders, even if they can't.\
The Art is awesome, really\
          \
        really good on that, the animation is all 24 fps smooth, which is better than any anime out there now.\
The action is pretty damn great, probably the best part of the movie, has everything ya ever need to it.\
Overall Akira is more of a visual action experience rather than something really serious. Though most of the scenes do carry a deeper meaning, none of them are in proper context or are connected by a serious plot.\
Then there's also the symbolism\
The city is corrupt, the politics are corrupt so bad no one even trusts each other anymore everyone is so consumed into their own interests that everyone becomes a black hole, the whole city collapses into itself, just like the antagonist's power consumes things, his ego consumes energy from being powerful, being a god-like being and above all else not being on the recieving end and not needing help, however not realising that it's not something bad, and losing control at the end.\

    \"Akira\". The name itself still holds a certain magic about to Anime fans. It's where it all started for many here in the United States. It set the mark for all that followed in it's wake. For some, it was the moment in their lives that animation ceased to be something for children. This was no cartoon. This was Anime. And almost 30 years later, it still has that effect on people. Conjuring images of the bizarre amidst a glow of city lights and speeding motorcycles leaving behind that familiar light trail. The movie is the definition of legend. And like with all legends, the\
          \
        truth can be somewhat disappointing.\
The basics of the film itself succeed. It tells a good story and uses art that even 30 years later holds up pretty well with scenes that still prove to be more innovative than most that has come since then. Providing images that stick with you and leave an impression along with characters you remember should be the goal of every film maker. And while they do succeed in that regard, I was disappointed by the way it all seemed to unravel and become confusing towards the finale. I am okay with an ending that leaves more questions than answers and inspires discussion, but a lack of satisfaction will always irk me.\
Along the way there were many things that stood out to me, I liked the soundtrack and many of the side characters. Little touches here and there that made the world on screen feel fuller. The Sub vs. Dub battle here is a matter of personal taste. There have been more than a few dubs of this movie in a few languages, watch in Japanese for a more authentic feel or the revised English dub (featuring many, many, familiar voices to Anime fans) but the general consensus seems to be STAY AWAY from the original English dub. It is truly terrible and takes away from the film. \
I cannot put into words what made me feel disappointed about this film in that it is a good movie and not a masterpiece. I saw glimpses here and there of what made me think this was masterpiece material, but when all was said and done I felt frustrated and unsatisfied. Call me jaded for being exposed to too much anime before viewing this if you want, call me a dope for not completely understanding the ending, but I honestly think \"Akira\" is an overrated film. And I liked it. But, I do not love it. I think every Anime fan should watch it, just to pay respect to a founding father and enjoy the movie for what it is- a nice ride and a good film. 7/10. Check it out. Cheers!   \

    Can you believe, I recently watched this movie last week. For a long time I've been left out but not anymore. Oh yeaaaaah!!!! Okay, I'm gonna type down what I thought about this one. \
Once upon a time I was born on 1994, the end. So obviously I do not have the same experience of those people who've watched this animated movie when it was something out of the ordinary on 1988.  As for me I think it was all right cool. Its not bad nor great. it just that it didn't 'send chills down my spine' effect, but surely I was entertained by\
          \
        how much this movie bursting with eye catching colors. It's very entertaining, it's almost like; who cares about the plot. \
Let me think... I don't remember having any favorite character and that's really unusual for me because I always got one that I root for! In this movie I got nothing, nada! zero! I feel like among the characters no one stands out, Haha! They don't overshadow one another's purpose on the movie. You know what I mean? You feel me? Wtf, am I talking about. Or maybe if I rewatch Akira, maybe I'll have a different perspective. \

    I've been on a spree of classics lately, watching classics i have never watched before. These anime would be shows like the original evangelion, cowboy bebop, trigun, hell, even one show no one even knew existed, at all, samurai deeper kyo. Then i kept being told to watch the classic anime movie Akira. I gotta say, i AT first wasn't too impressed. BUT, once i started watching it I finished it and said..... THIS CAME OUT IN 1988?!?!?! That changed alot of my opinions. \
Story: 7/10\
I'm not gonna lie, this isn't the interesting part, the story isn't the great thing about this show, it's the\
          \
        way it tells the story. But in terms of just what the plot is, it's nothing we haven't seen before. So basically this war torn hell hole of a city is the dog shit of cities, and there exists bike gangs. That being said the show isn't about the bike gangs at all, once an accident happens and one of the members, tetsuo shima, is badly injured, he is brought in by the army, and he gets experimented on, and he gets crazy psychic powers, and wants to show the world now that he isn't weak, he is the tall big bad buy now. Basically, this guy is tired of life treating him like crap, and now takes his vengeance on the shit hole city. simple, but good enough to make you watch.\
art and animation: 9/10\
Now to present day animation, yes, this animation is shit, but looking at the time, it's freaking amazing! this movie was made in 1988, and for that time it looks amazing. I mean jesus, evangelion's original 1995 release looks like crap comparatively to this seven years prior movie. It's fluid and it has so much good detail for the background in the city and any eviroment it's in, however i point out the city because the animation makes the city really look like a dark place where street bike gangs  would hang out, and there's not many shows that pull that off as well as i wish they would have. \
Sound: 8/10\
In the first half of this movie, the sound really didn't do anything to me, so thought i shouldn't get my hopes up. But one you make it half way through, you can hear that there is actually some good music in this movie. These songs fit the action scenes of the movie very very well. I would love to poin out the names of these songs BUT..... I hdon't know the names at all, so, yeah. As for dub vs sub, i did not watch this subbed, i watched this anime dubbed, and it payed off very well. for a pre bebop series, this had a rather well acted dub in it... again, now that I've said that, remember, it's a 1988 dub. FOR 1988, IT'S A GOOD DUB.\
Characters: 10/10\
The characters are definitely the highlight of akira, no way in hell there not. Well, for the most part. They showed off one of the main characters very well, that would be tetsuo. Tetsuo is very flushed out, in fact so well flushed out, he is already one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He's so well done and had such good Characters development, i would say he's almost justified for what he did. now main character number two, kaneda, is very good as well, as he is a childhood friend of tetsuo's, and he is trying to stop him from all this bad stufff he's doing, and get him either A help or B kill him. The rest of the cast is a bit pointless to talk about, but it's only because there are a few more, but they really just aren't anything special, but they do serve their purpose, but you'll have to watch and find out.\
enjoyment and overall: 9/10\
Akira is an instant classic along with it's other 90's peirs, and in all honesty, that is why i praise the living crap out of this anime movie. This movie was so far before it's time, and in all honesty i feel it's not given enough credit, like, at all. It's flaws are minor, but they do exist, and even though it is old as holy hell, if you look at it for what it is and just look past the animation and see that it's time of release is what it is, you should have no problems watching this movie, for it is an instant classic.\

    I finally got round to seeing the proper Japanese version instead of the awful english dub. It made all the difference. Perhaps the only criticism I have is that it's slightly too long but there's so many ideas crammed into it and so much going on it can be forgiven or that. It's not a film that ties up all it's plot points nicely in a simplistic resolution at the end but rather one that leaves a number of questions unanswered for the viewer to interpret and think about long after the film has ended. This is a film for those who like to be\

    Akira is one of the greatest animes, and After watching it, I see why. It is much better then most anime today and you never see anime movies with beautiful animation like this anymore. The colors were great and so was everything else. Especially the music, it was very different and always suited the mood.\
Although the story is a little confusing, it is still very enjoyable. The characters are outstanding and you an relate to them... other then the being taken and tested on part of it. Tetsuo is a great character and seriously misunderstood. His hair grows periodically through the movie, I think this\
          \
        is where Toriyama got his ideas for DBZ.\
Overall I loved it, I edit with it sometimes too, this two hour movie was DEFINITELY worth every second.\

    Right off the bat of my review, I'll say this: I'm bias. At least for Akira anyways.\
Normally, I tend to avoid being bias at any costs but seeing as this is my first review on this site, I'm going to be bias. Why? Akira is my favourite anime movie.\
The Story: 9/10\
If you've read the manga and watched the movie, you'll understand the differences between the two. I prefer the manga which is why the story didn't get a 10 from me. Don't get me wrong, the movie might be different from the manga but that doesn't take away from it and it's best to view\
          \
        these two as totally different stories involving the same characters.\
Art: 9/10\
I love the art style of Akira and most of Otomo's works. There are a few minor points in the art style that I don't care for. For me, his style when drawing women isn't that great. Most people become confused on whether or not Kei is male or female.\
Sound: 10/10\
How can you not give this soundtrack a perfect score? It's completely fresh and it stepped far away from people back in 1988 were use to hearing. The tracks are long and set the mood for the scene they play in. I would touch more on that but I would have to spoil it in order to express my full enjoyment.\
Voice Acting:\
(First dub = Streamline dub - Second dub = Pioneer dub)\
I didn't rate this and I'm never going to. Akira has two English dubs that I'm about to touch on. The Streamline dub had bad synchronization between sound and mouth movement during some scenes and it was also bad that when some character's should have been shouting their dialogue, the words were softly spoken. Of course this was 1988 we're talking about so it's expected to be bad (but you can find some humor in the bad voice acting). Kaneda and Tetsuo have better voice actors in the Streamline dub (in my opinion) because they sound more natural to the character as opposed to the Pioneer dub. It should be noted that I watched the Pioneer dub first and prefer the Streamline version. The Pioneer dub fixes a lot of the problems but if you're like me, you'll find one thing very annoying: Joshua Seth. The entire time I was watching the Pioneer version, I just kept thinking about Digimon and how annoying Tai's voice is. I wasn't able to pay as close attention to the movie as I should have during my first time. If you don't want to get into the whole 'which Akira dub is better' situation... just watch it subbed. Probably the easiest way to watch it. Another thing to note is that the Pioneer dub has a lot of unnecessary swearing which can get annoying after awhile.\
Character: 8/10\
I only give it an 8 because I want to rate it high but at the same time, in comparison to the manga... the characters were under developed. It's a shame that certain characters from the manga weren't included (Chiyoko) and that some had minor roles in comparison to their larger roles in the manga (Lady Miyako and somewhat Joker). Kaneda, Tetsuo, Colonel and Nezu were built up strong but in comparison to the manga, it lacked. (Yes I know I said to view both of them as two different things XD)\
Enjoyment / Overall: 10/10\
I enjoyed Akira because it fit my more mature views on anime. I admire it because it helped set standards for certain anime of my generation today. I would touch on other things that made it enjoyable but I can't because I don't wish to spoil anything. I'll say this much: I watched the movie first and loved it (especially the climax) and when I read the manga, it helped draw in an emotional connection to the characters and story. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone because not everyone will love it but I do suggest taking some time to watch it if you haven't already and see if you like it.\

    After typing this I realized I need to watch it again to give a better review but until then‚Ä¶.\
I first saw akira when I was 14 I think.  Got the lend of it off a guy in my class.  He and his mates were hyping this film up to me, and I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot myself.  My first impressions weren‚Äôt that great.  While the art was good, it was the story, characters and pacing that let me down.  Why were there little old man children,  what was the point of him turning into a giant blob,\
          \
        these thing I just didn‚Äôt understand.\
A few years later and few years more mature I gave it another go.  Able to better get what was going on and having since watched a lot more anime, my opinion of it did improve.  I still dont understand what the hype was and id say the movie was average at best.  \
Story (im gonna be kinda vague here so as not to spoil)\
From what I can remember (its been a while) it starts off following a biker gang through neo Tokyo as they get up to the sort of stuff you expect from a teenage biker gang, riding around, fighting rival gangs that sort of thing.  They run into the military chasing a boy who looks like hes really old.  One of the group (tetsou) gets taken away by the military. When he awakes he has telekinetic powers.  He escapes the facility hes in and his power begins to go to his head corrupting him as he was portrayed as a rather weak character before who envied the bike gang leader for being stronger and sticking up for him.  Then its up to the protagonist/ bike gang leader to try and stop his friend from destroying the world.  Also the character Akira eventually helps (theres a bit of mystery around him,  hes kinda like jesus).\
Characters\
Didn‚Äôt care for any of them.  I know tetsou had to be weak and whiny so that later he can be powerful and arrogant but this led me to just not care about what happened to him. The main character was a stereotypical anime lead.  Everyone else barely get any development. Generally that‚Äôs the problem with the characters, any depth to them is not provided by in the movie.\
The art was good and there were a few memorable pieces of music.  The film suffers in that it doesn‚Äôt provide enough depth, because of this I didn‚Äôt feel attached to any of the characters  and spent a good portion of the movie wondering when Akira would actually show up.\
While I may have only really said bad things about this film I still recommend people watch it as it is an anime that everyone will eventually come across at some stage and it is still worth having an opinion on it because of this. Whether that opinion is good or bad. I‚Äôve known people with no interest in anime at all and yet they‚Äôve heard of Akira. \

    Those poor people who think anime are just  kids cartoons. They have no idea what kinda of terror and horror can be created through anime, and that it doesn't matter if its animated or not. In fact, in animation, literally anything can happen. This is why anime has some of the best horror media can offer. And honestly, I believe that we have Akira to thank.\
Akira was created in 1988, and is set in Neo-Tokyo after World War III. The city is in ruins and a wasteland for criminal activity. During a gang fight, Kaneda and Tetsuo encounter strange men from the government, and\
          \
        Tetsuo is kidnapped and used as an experiment, ultimately gaining massive telekinetic  powers. Kaneda fights to regain his close friend, while the government fights to secure him. Tetsuo uses his newfound powers to prove to everyone that he is no longer weak, which results in an all-scale battle. The story is quite exciting, and the suspense is fantastic. You get a sense of grit and roughness, which in itself makes the story more real. Combined with superpowers and a future setting, the result is a wonderful experince.\
For the time it was created...you know what scratch that. It doesn't matter what age this was made. The art for Akira can stand up to some of today's best animation, let alone the 80s.Being able to read their lips was a new experience for me, and personally blew my mind. Also, the design of the city is amazing and truly innovative. Aside from that, there are several scenes that show just how phenominal the art is (remember the \"blob\" scene).\
The soundtrack, sadly, didn't stick. In fact, when there wasn't any sound, I found myself even more terrified and on the edge. This worked in a sense, but I would've liked to hear more music. As a musician, I prefer a soundtrack that drives the movie.\
The characters are only a handful, but surprisingly realistic. They all have the attitude you would expect them to have in a failing world. However, even through all the chaos, they still show signs of being human, which is truly notable.\
Akira was overall enjoyable, but there are some parts that are overly disturbing (again, the \"blob\" scene), and this at one point made it hard to watch. I would recommend this only to people who can handle very graphic violence. If you can handle it, I don't know why you haven't seen it, honestly. This is, for me, the horror anime that made horror anime what it is today, and must be watched.\

    After watching the English dub for the 1988 anime film Akira, I must say I was impressed. Coming in at a clean two hours, Akira's huge impact on the anime community was nothing but obvious. Remember, this was before the 90's, which brought the uprising of long anime such as Dragonball Z, Naruto, and other action fueled, supernatural adventures. \
Akira follows a motorcycle gang placed in Neo Tokyo in the year 2019, where the event of World War III has caused the entire city to turn into an industrial dystopian future. The most focused on members of the bikers is the leader, Shotaro Kaneda, and\
          \
        his friend and fellow comrade named Tetsuo Shima. The bikers operate within a sort of gang war against other gangs in order to compete over control of Tokyo.\
Meanwhile, the government has been performing tests on a group of children to enhance them with unearthly powers, most notably Akira, one of the children who lost control of his abilities and caused a massive explosion, leaving a gigantic crater in Neo Tokyo. One of the children escapes the testing and wanders onto the streets, alone and frightened. \
During one of the more brutal motorcycle chases, Tetsuo crashes violently into the escaped child, by which giving him strong psychic powers. Going practically insane with his new-found abilities, Tetsuo starts rampaging the city, seeking Akira in hopes of resurrecting the powerful figure in order to rule Tokyo alongside him, and ultimately take revenge on the people and place that babied him his entire life. The government and the bikers, led by Kaneda, fight to stop Tetsuo before he destroys them all, along with himself. \
My overall impression of the movie, as previously stated, was impressed. The animation was nothing short of beautiful, the sound design was excellent, and the characters, especially Kaneda, appealed to me greatly. The scenarios that Otomo constructed, although perhaps a little more dull compared to other post apocalyptic environments, moved and melded in a way that was incredibly natural and satisfying. I've always been a fan of destruction, with large explosions and large scale battles. This movie combines both in a wonderful blend of sleek movements and fantastic creativity. My only true problem of the movie was undoubtedly the story. Although the supernatural theme intrigued me greatly, sometimes the plot seemed to add more fluff and fodder than was entirely necessary.  The writing for the characters was great, but some points seemed to be missing, almost like the movie left some semi-vital questions unanswered due to the need to get to the more important parts. And I know, the movie was adapted from the GIGANTIC manga, so of course it had to be cut down to a portion of what the manga perceived. But even with that I think the movie could have done well to expound on some details that I found rather important to my personal understanding and my entertainment experience. The story, although rather silly and plodding at times, was darn fun and it coupled well with the other great elements. I'd say, if you are a fan of anime (doubtless you are if you're on this site), go give it a try. Perhaps not, as many people say it to be the greatest animated flick of all time, I think that it is wonderful and just beautifully done. \

    Akira is one of the greatest anime movies I've ever seen. I don't think it had any dull parts between the beginning and the end. I loved the twist(s) at the end and the way the story evolved as I kept watching.\
Akira was the first anime I saw that I knew as anime. Quite possibly caused me to actively seek out more of it's kind though very little was available at the time of it's US release.\

    Let's take a look at a movie considered not only a classic but one of the best Anime movies ever made.\
Story:\
In 2015 it's very hard to judge how influential or revolutionary this movie was. The plot starts out very confusing, as we get introduced to these shriveled kids on one hand and Kanedas bike gang on the other. Once these two strings meet, the story becomes much clearer, though it still leaves some unanswered questions in the end. That's not a bad thing in general, but after watching this movie, I still don't really understand much about Akira, his powers and where this all came\
          \
        from. Nonetheless, the plot keeps moving forward and has a satisfying end, not really a happy one, but not a downer ending either.\
7/10\
Art:\
This is where Akira really shines. It's hard to believe that this movie is now almost 30 years old. The animation is so incredibly fluent and detailed that one has to wonder why Anime has come to where it is now. Akira looks so much better than many things released 10, 15, even 20 years later. Especially Neo-Tokyo at night is just a feast for the eyes. I'd say this is the visually best Anime possible for 1988.\
10/10\
Sound:\
The soundtrack is incredibly fitting and only used when it feels necessary, making its impact when it actually plays much higher. Its epic when it should be, its creepy when the story asks for it, it never fails to hit the point. The abscence of sound effects in multiple scenes just adds to the overall feel this movie has. The voice acting is very good too, maybe better than in many Anime of today.\
9/10\
Characters:\
This is where I do have a little problem. For a 2 hour movie, we have a very numerous cast of important characters. This leads to not everybody getting enough screentime and/or background to fully sink in. For example, I have no clue who that long-haired, buckettoothed guy was who tried to flee with his money near the end, nor do I get what his motivations were. Apparently this is a problem coming from trying to fit the stroy of a multiple volume manga in the time limits of a movie. The main characters are developed well enough though, so it's not a deadly flaw.\
6/10\
Enjoyment:\
I didn't think I would enjoy this movie as much as I did. Sure, it has aged a little, as we have seen many elements recycled multiple times by now, but it has aged really well and still provides 2 hours of entertainment that do not feel as long. Due to the compression of the source material, you never really have a scene that feels unnessecary, though it focussed on too many things at once from time to time.\

    So I have been told that this movie is a must to watch as it is considered to be a mentor for many anime (like DBZ, Ghost in the Shell and others). \
Indeed, this anime movie was quite enjoying to watch there was many things I did not expect to be enclosed in one movie. It is action, mysterious and Si-Fi I don't know if you could say it also has superpowers. However, this movie is quite old but the art is very decent and the characters are distinguished, the sound track precisely was something different I believe there was much efforts done to produce\
          \
        these tracks as most of them are made great for the scenes. \
The story is also one of the weirdest I have enjoyed, slice of awkwardness and the story plot is quite good written. I like the general essence of this movie as it represented many emotions, fears, and daily lives of people. It also somehow enfolds several great messages for the generations.. Oh! I think I went too deep, I should finish this review. \
In nutshell, if you haven't seen this movie yet you should consider watching it soon! \
Until we review again! \

    This is another no shit Sherlock review from me. Of course you should watch it it‚Äôs a classic. But labeling something as a classic gets tricky when you apply age and critical merit to its story. Akira succeeds in some ways and not in others like anything else. It did do a great job of breaking anime into the west with vibrant colors and broad cityscapes driven by an exciting tour-de-force action-heavy plot.  Don‚Äôt let Akira‚Äôs reputation as a classic change your viewing experience though; like anything else it isn‚Äôt perfect. Experience it as though you‚Äôre looking at a painting but pay attention to\
          \
        the quick flashes of backstory that flesh out the characters. Try to bear witness to the colors and the scenes before you, and try not to think too much about the frame in a first watch. The brief scenes of character development and theme are lost as fast as they appear, but take them with you when you see Tetsuo grow throughout the movie. While it really only focuses on Tetsuo and Kaneda‚Äôs relationship, what little character development there is strings together a nonstop scene. But at the same time that‚Äôs a damn good scene. \
\9Akira doesn‚Äôt as much focus on a plot and characters as much as it does its art and soundtrack, which are both gleaming tens in my book. Every shot or frame is meticulously crafted with tons of detail. And even if every alley rat isn‚Äôt the focus of the shot they make the rustic buildings and gleaming lights feel very truly alive. Throughout the movie I felt drawn in, almost kinesthetically to the world. There aren‚Äôt many cut corners and pretty much every gun barrel or bike insignia is there to stay in every scene. Akira conquers the animation game by modern standards even though it‚Äôs almost thirty years old. Add the haunting soundtrack to the menacing story of unknown power and the entire experience packs a punch before you think about it critically. \
\9The film is very much about Tetsuo and Kaneda‚Äôs delinquent struggle in relation to the breaking world around them and ultimately how their power struggle goes far too out of hand. It‚Äôs a convincing relationship and it really carries the whole of the story. But that being said don‚Äôt look for a postmodern character study in the film. Some characters like the rest of Kaneda‚Äôs bike gang are sometimes only determined by a single glance or scripted line. While I think his protectiveness over Tetsuo could carry to his fellow riders and make Kaneda a better rounded character, they deliver their purpose for moving the nonstop film along. Tetsuo‚Äôs love interest and the other characters like the Akira subjects could have done the same to make him a better character too. \
The original psychic energy kids are a smidge underused and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel about them towards the end of the film. The trio adds a lot to the story but not so much to the cast of characters. They do a great job at holding the plot together and add to the mystery of the world. The idea of three compliant children to the government in a world where the youth are often protesters and fighters is really interesting. However seeing as how one of them is escaping in the opening riot scene, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that they‚Äôre compliant to their captors. The rest of the characters, like their captors of the military commander and the scientist simply serve their purpose. They‚Äôre certainly not exciting but they add the thematic punch to the plot, that science can‚Äôt give the power-seeking government what it shouldn‚Äôt be messing around in.\
\9Pacing is one of the issues I had with the movie. The two protagonist‚Äôs back stories aren‚Äôt fleshed out until the end of the film, and I wasn‚Äôt really sure why. I‚Äôm glad the scenes from Tetsuo and Kaneda‚Äôs upbringing were placed into the film, but placing them could feel strange for first time watchers. Tetsuo‚Äôs gradual spiral out of control is a terrifying and impactful part of the experience, and the first time I watched it, I wasn‚Äôt really sure why you‚Äôd experience it that way. But with multiple watches of the film, you‚Äôll find the parts are all there, even if they feel out of order from the average linear storyline. Giving the film a second watch helps you soak in all of the most important plot points, which is important if you want to dissect the cryptic and subjective ending. But this movie will always be worth a watch to me. Akira gritty, greusome and horrifying yet smart in its ideas and main characters even if they aren‚Äôt fleshed out much. Grab your bear and go watch it with some milk.",

Akira packs a LOT into a very small package, creating a grand, yet easily confusing narrative. In the end, it feels incomplete and almost requires a part II to sort everything out. Nevertheless, the theme of human suffering as the cost of tyranny and greed (and in Tetsuo's case, wrath) is profound, even if the rest of the plot is convoluted. \

Sure, I gave it a 10 on the rating scale, but truth be told, there is no number here that could truly justify the quality of art and animation in Akira. The level of detail in the characters and the ultra smooth,\
          \
        realistic motion of the animation is the closest you can get to godliness. If Walt Disney was alive today and saw Akira, I have no doubt in my mind he would tip his hat off to the animation crew. To this very day, Akira makes even my most favorite anime look amateurish in comparison. \
Sound: 10\
Backing up the godlike animation is an almost equally impressive level of sound effects and chilling music. The motorcycles engines, the blasts coming from the bombs and weapons, and a soundtrack that elevates every scene. The voiceovers do an excellent job at conveying the emotions of the charactes, which is even more important considering the characters lips sync with their words. \
Character: 7\
A great cast of characters move the plot along well, although some characters deserved more light shed on them. Tetsuo and Kaneda are almost polar opposites, yet they're still as close as brothers. As the story unfolds, their brotherhood is shattered as one's quest for power and dominance creates a schism between them. It's a classic Greek tragedy with the destruction of the city around them serving as a metaphor. \
Enjoyment: 10\
As confusing as Akira's main plot is, that couldn't stop me from enjoying everything else the anime had to offer. It took a couple of rewatches to really understand what was going on, but thanks to the quality of the animation and the subtext of its characters, each viewing never felt old.\
Overall: 10\
Even if this isn't your cup of tea or if the goriness may be too much for you, I recommend any anime fan to watch Akira at LEAST once. As a work of art, it is a timeless masterpiece, and the seemingly exhaustive work of the animators needs to be appreciated. There will probably never be another hand drawn animation of this quality ever again. \

    Rich with detail and full of vibrant and dynamic characters, Akira has it all.  A grungy Neo-Tokyo comes to life with beautiful panoramic views of life in a post-apocalyptic era.  The imagery really jumps out of the screen as the film continues playing through a tale of man trying to control forces of unearthly power.\
One thing that gives this anime movie credit is the characters.  In every scene, you can feel the characters' emotion and their drive.  Heavy in action and drama, this is not a light anime.  Themes weighted on Loyalty, Respect, and Friendship play throughout the movie and\
          \
        bring it to life.  For any action-anime fan out there, this one will leave you on the edge of your seat til the very end.\

    Story- The story in Akira was original, powerful, and left you with a lot of thoughts and ideas swimming around in your head. There isn't another anime like it, and it's a classic. Although I found that in some places it was a little bit hard to follow.\
Art- Personally, I am not a big fan of that kind of art, but it was good all the same.\
Sound- the sound was good and really demonstrated what was going on. There could have been more music, though.\
Characters- The characters all had their own interesting story behind them, but I think that this could have been explained a\
          \
        little bit more so that we can connect more with the characters. It would have been nice to see more detail in the relationships between characters, and some characters were quite similar to others. \
Enjoyment- Akira is action packed, and in some places, quite shocking. Very good.\
Overall, I enjoyed Akira. It was a good movie.\

    This was an alright movie. Nothing spectacular to blow away everyone's mind away, and it's definitely not terrible enough to end up getting a dirt low rating. Now it's probably because I watched this after seeing so many other shows that I think this way, I know many people say that this show revolutionized anime as we know it, but compared to the newer shows today that are actually pretty good this one doesn't really live up to a comparison. Now if I saw this early on during my first couple of shows and first couple of movies I would have fallen in love with\
          \
        it. So needless to say, if you're trying to get into anime and if you're prepared for a tad bit of weirdness, this might be up your ally.\
So if you've seen a lot of shows already, don't go in thinking it's going to be the most amazing thing. If you're new to anime, here's a cool movie that gets a little weird, but hey anime can get strange sometimes.\
Story:\
Now from the cover of the movie and by the opening scene, I was to believe this was a motorcycle racing movie. Sadly it is not about the racing, or really about motorcycles in general, it's about a sort of side character meets with another sort of side character. Their meeting is far from normal though, their meeting changes their lives pretty much for the worse. Now without spoiling much, I know that sounds good and all, but there's magic powers involved out of nowhere so it got a little strange from that. To sum up the story in one sweet sentence without ruining anything, the friend gets too involved in top secret military stuff and pays the price by going insane. There's also a cult group who prays for the end of the world, but the movie never focuses on that. \
Characters:\
The characters are meh, I didn't really care about any of them at all. I knew who two of them were and the rest of them were just kinda there. This movie will make characters show up and then never show them again, and then grab new characters half way through the movie and then drop them from the movie again. So basically the movie is about a few people doing things bad for everyone else.\
Art:\
It's just an old anime, it has that 90's vintage look, nothing too special there. Although there were really good animations for a few scenes, with a lot of moving parts and flashing lights. Also the music wasn't really all that great, there's are also a few sound effects from other sources so you might hear a few sounds you could recognize from other shows.\
Overall:\
Not a terrible experience, but if I knew the show wasn't going to be all that great I would have avoided watching it. It's a long movie with a shifting plot, and it wasn't ever too confusing to follow, but I just didn't really like how things ended up.\
Pros: Good first movie, introduction to anime and preparation for weirdness\
Cons: Not such an amazing movie, plot changes, characters get dropped\

    Akira is an ultra-violent, cyber-punk, sci-fi, and other hyphenated words film adapted from the manga of the same name. A lot of people don‚Äôt like it because they don‚Äôt understand how difficult animation is and probably don‚Äôt care, and a lot of what happens in the film appears to be random ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try to mind-f*ck the audience‚Äù type of stuff. Another contributing factor to the Akira hate train is that so much of what makes it great has been aped to death, especially by bad 90‚Äôs OVAs (I‚Äôm looking at you Genocyber). Jaded audiences have been beaten over the head with this stuff for years,\
          \
        and with each head beating comes diminishing returns (it‚Äôs the law). So what does Akira have to offer in 2017? And why did I give it a 10?\
I guess the first thing we have to discuss is the kind of anime fan Akira is aimed at. I‚Äôve made a handy little quiz to help YOU determine if you‚Äôll enjoy Akira:\
Question 1:\
A) Do you think weird pseudo-philosophy regarding the next possible step in human evolution is interesting? \
B) Do you watch anime for the cute girls?\
Question 2:\
A) Do you miss the hand drawn animation of years past and appreciate the time, effort, and skill it takes to make an animated film done in this fashion not look like crap?\
B) Is jiggle physics and mouth flapping all the animation you need?\
Question 3:\
A) Do you enjoy avant-garde music?\
B) What does avant-garde mean?\
Question 4:\
A) Do you find realistic interpretations of possible dystopian futures compelling? \
B) Every work of fiction should take place inside a game.\
Question 5:\
A) Do you enjoy parsing through symbolism and partaking in multiple viewings in order to have a more complete understanding of the media you consume?\
B) Do you want to watch something once, pad your MAL list, and forget about it? \
Question 6:\
A) Would you like to have a more well-rounded understanding of anime, and animated film in general, its history and foundations?\
B) Things made before 2011 are boring and I hate them.\
Now, tally up your A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs. If you had mostly A‚Äôs ‚Äì Congrats! Akira might be right up your alley. If you had mostly B‚Äôs ‚Äì Well, who am I to judge you? I am most definitely an A person. Akira was my gateway into anime fandom, and I still love it. It‚Äôs a perfect example of how to take something long and complicated (the manga) and adapt it into a two hour film while maintaining the integrity of the source material and ensuring a satisfying story is told with a beginning, middle, and end (a noteworthy accomplishment in this medium). It‚Äôs also my favorite piece of cyber-punk fiction, and opened up a lot of doors for me in that genre as well. In short, Akira is and always will be a 10. If you haven‚Äôt seen it and have any interest in animation, science-fiction or (most importantly) motorcycles, I whole-heartedly recommend it.    ",

    Considering the year of production I respect this anime highly for its story and characters.\
The story moved fast and I was never bored. For me however, I felt it jumped into large developments a little too fast; though, because it is a movie I can understand why.\
The art of Akira executed in this year makes my jaw drop in surprise because of how much work it must've taken.\
I didn't give it a 10 for personal reasons. The personal reasons were mainly because I consciously realized while watching it that the story was moving a little too fast. Second, even though I totally accept and love\
          \
        the initial setting, it became a little far fetched for my tastes. But that's just me.\

    Almost everyone has seen this movie, people call it a culture classic... I can understand that for its time, the animation was simply stunning, revolutionary, soo good that you have to see to believe, and that the story explored themes probably never before explained.\
BUT, why?\
Why?!\
WHY?!?!\
Everything was going nice the first hour or so, yes they did cut some content from the manga at that time, but no big deal, you could still understand and enjoy it, and being a fan of the manga, I surely was happpy so far with the movie, but I was like, we are at the middle of the movie already,\
          \
        but storywise they are still at chapter 7-8 of the 38 chapters, and keep in mind each chapter (readed the Epic's version) was around 70 pages or so, and from these 7-8 chapters alot was already trimmed or completely skipped, but it was still enjoyable and made sense so far...\
But how can they adapt the rest of the 30 chapters (again each with around 70 pages) in another hour?!?!\
There is no need to be a genius, to understand that it isnt possible to adapt with integrity, to say the least. So instead they decided to butcher alot of the rest of the story. \
Almost every big event didnt happened (the explosion that at the middle of the story changes the world once again, giving a more apocaliptic setting, didnt happen, just to give you and example there is many more stuff, this was just one of the most importants, since it changes everything after)\
Those big events that got animated (like I said after the first hour), totally different context, the setting to reach them was very different and the way they progressed, also all for the most part original. \
Almost every character role is reduced to the extreme, major characters die earlier on the story, when they should had survived for almost the whole rest of the story, Akira is a supportive character, with almost 0% appearence, while in the manga he is the main focus since in the later 65% of the story, what happens revolves around him, and I could on and on....\
The later part of the movie is a mix of part of some of the scenes of the manga with its original spin off, but the thing is that the story already was complex on the manga, and had themes that deserved time to be well explored. \
And everything is so rushed and butchered here, that TBH, if I had not read the manga first, alot of the stuff would just be confusing, and it would not be my fault, alot of the detail to almost everything was lost in the adaptation...\
The story supports the whole thing, so it took major impact on the characters, they development just didnt felt right, you can see the potential they have, and they almost none if it was explored decently.\
It sucks. It really does... and most of the people, they have only seen the anime, so they will say okay, the cast wasnt great, but it wasnt that bad... the thing is that if you read the manga, you will really see the poor job of the overall plot and cast.\
The ideas are there, but they deserved to be given much more time and context.\
It is like they had only budget to make a 2 hour movie, to adapt the whole manga series. \
And to be fair I do know the movie came out before the manga finished serialization, there are some similarities with both endings, but the rest is 80% original material, and original material isnt long enough to support a story this big. \
I would had prefered less budget and more movies. Let the manga end, they properly adapt the rest.\
Take a leap of faith, and give it 2-3 more movies (this first movie would have adapted more of those first chapters also), and we would have a masterpiece movie series, that would make justice with all its heart, to the manga epicness!\
I m sure they would had enough money with the sells from the first movie to keep the budget high.\
Lets leave behind all the negativity. \
The score is very fitting to the movie, while simple, it adapts surprising well to the scenes.\
And the animation like I mentionated before... it is some of the best animation around, the animation motion, the smoothness and fluidy of it, if it still this good for this day and age (thanks to 1080p and the super-fluid motion presented, since to produce the movie more than 160,000 animation cels were used), how it was for its time?!\
Probably, the \"God of Animation\" descended, was inspired, and enough time, and crafted its best work yet!! \
AMAZING animation for its time isnt enough to justify, nowdays while the colours are old, and the animation is old by visual picture to picture standarts, I would still call it outstanding.\
How it flows, it is like the frames per second are much higher than the standart 24 fps, and you have it running at 45-50's fps. \
It is that impressive, most of the movies up to this day, while gorgeous animation wise, dont have this smoothness!!\
I bash the story and character adaptation, but it was still a enjoyable experience, and the sole reason the movie scored this high... the sound does help, BUT it is the art! \
I cant not praise it enough, it is literally porn-animation. \
Most people will see it for it, and I do think that is how I will remenber the movie also.\
Despite all these major flaws, solely by its animation, it is something I would reccomend wholeheartedly.\
Watch the movie, expecting to read the manga after if you want to get the great plot nicecly fleshed out, that is how you can experience this great cult classic series. \
In the movie, the plot will interest you, then confuse you. The ending will make you inspired perhaps but never memorable due to the terrible plot adaptation, when it could had been something more... and then the animation, it will spoil you nicely, make want for more! \
Ask why every movie nowadays doesnt has this standart of animation! \
I can understand with TV series anime, but for the movies... enough limited animation BS!\
This movie visual quality wise, is the reason I love anime this much.\
If I had just seen it much before, I m sure I would have got into \"the real anime universe\", much earlier.\

    FOR THE PEOPLE READING MY REVIEW PLEASE READ THE AWESOME MANGA AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE. SO How to start my review of my favorite anime of all time no correction my FAVORITE ANIME OF ALL TIME AS WELL AS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMATED MOVIES ALL TIME. For starters everybody on this site knows what the movie is about cuz if not im not giving any spoilers at all. The characters are amazing from the awesome Shotaro Kaneda, and the main antagonist Tetsuo Shima and minor characters Kai and Yamada, and the general. The supporting characters did their job in their roles and influencing the\
          \
        plot. The animation........THE ANIMATION IS GORGEOUS!!!!!! To the point it brings most modern anime to shame MOST ALMOST ALL MODERN ANIME TO SHAME. im serious about that part. For instance look at the neo tokyo in the beginning of the film looking at it makes me happy everytime and the motorcycle chase one of the best moments in anime history in my opinion watching that part gives me energy. The music it took me three re watches to enjoy the soundtrack it's not metal or electronica techno it's actually traditional japanese music with the claps the chants and whatnot. Before I end my review let me say to those who read my review. Read the manga and show the movie or anime to your friends or animation enthusiast.\

    Akira is amazing. It is one of my favorite films ever. I just watched it for the first time ever and I already want to watch it again. It has absolutely beautiful art and animation with some good sound design to boot. The only place where it suffers a bit is in the story department and I'll explain that but if you want to know if you should watch Akira the answer is YES.\
Story:7\
The story is Akira is good.... I can't say it's great because it just isn't as much as I wish it was. I'm gonna avoid spoilers but it starts strong in the\
          \
        story department but I feel it loses sight of where it's heading after a while but then it picks back up near the end. This problem could probably be attributed to a 6 volume manga being adapted into a 2 hour film. The story gets the job done but I feel that it could have used a bit more tweaking.\
Art:10\
Now this is where Akira truly shines. The art and animation is gorgeous and evokes so many feelings I just can't describe This film came out in 1988 and is mostly hand drawn with cell animation with CGI used in very few spots and wow it just looks fantastic. The action scenes move smoothly and look awesome, the backgrounds are detailed and help to build this gritty world we're shown, and the lighting oh I am going to talk for a while about the lighting. This movie uses its lighting to such great effect in every scene. Every scenes tone is set almost immediately by the lighting whether the characters are in a dingy bar or a laboratory or even a sewer the lighting sets the scene's tone perfectly. What I'm trying to say is that if you like animation in any way you NEED to watch this film as it is one of the smoothest 2d animated films I've ever seen with amazing art direction and fluid animation.\
Sound:9\
The sound is also great. I'm not one who ever remembers music in movies and it's not different here. I don't find myself humming these tunes, none of them would work to hum anyway, but they fit everything going on. The music fits the scenes and what's going on so in that department it's good. The sound effects work is amazing. I'd need to watch it again to point out specific places but the sound design makes this movie. The hum of the motorcycles, the loud sounds of gunshots, the explosions going off it all sounds great. Now I watched the original English dub from I believe 1989 and it's good. Like many older anime it has some lip syncing issues but I like the voice actors and I feel they fit the characters and none stood out to me as being bad.\
Character:8\
The characters are also good, Shotaro Kaneda, our main character, is interesting and realistic. He seems to care about another one of our leads, Tetsuo Shima, though Tetsuo it seems feels like he's being looked down upon which leads really to the films main conflict. These two characters are awesome to see onscreen and see them interact you can tell there's history between them. The only lead I felt was a bit weak was Kei. She was fine if not necessary but then near the end she suddenly becomes important with no explanation. I've never read the manga but I expect this seemingly odd transition is more well explained there. The \"villains\" are also good but I don't want to call them that since they aren't just \"oh we're sooo evil\". They feel like real people with reasons for what they're doing. Overall the characters are really good.\
Enjoyment:10\
Regardless of any issues this film has I had an absolute blast watching it. It had me engaged from the first minute to the last minute.\
Overall: 9\
I don't often give tens to anything so this was hard but the few problems were a bit too severe to make it a ten but it's definitely worth the watch \

    This film maybe old, but it is still talked about today. After watching this, now I understand on why this film is very iconic not just in Japan, but also around the world. Though it is iconic, this film has its major flaws.\
31 years have passed since World War II. One day, a top-secret child from an experiment accidentally escapes and bumps in to one of the bike gang members. That member is Tetsuo. The agency kidnapped Tetsuo for experimentation. Then they discovered that he is developing psychological powers of his own and it is growing at a very fast-rate. He then used this power\
          \
        to seek revenge on the society that once called him weak.\
The story has so much potential, but this film doesn't even answer everything on what is happening. Because of that, the film is left with HUGE plot holes and it isn't satisfying.\
The animation is beautiful. There are so much moments on this film where everything moves smoothly. Despite the film looking old, this animation was at its peak by the time it was airing. Not to mention, that beautiful soundtrack. The OST sounds very dark and apocalyptic and it fits the theme of the show. The voice acting is also superb. They really capture the emotions of each character they're playing with.\
Another major flaw is its characters especially the ones revolving with Kaneda and Tetsuo. The way they act on this film just kind of makes me laugh on why are they doing this in the first place. Okay, so Tetsuo now has the power and... He's taking revenge on the society? For what reason? Oh, because they called him weak. Well, I am not convinced because they only had a little screen time on why. This film only shows little flashbacks of Tetsuo being so down by the society and how he met Kaneda. Because of this, I am not really attached with the characters. Like, I just don't know how to feel about them. I am attached with the setting it's placed, but definitely not the characters.\
I enjoyed it because of the feeling I got throughout the story. It really felt like you were there and I was at the edge of my seat. Though, I'll be at the edge of my seat a lot longer (despite the film ended) because of the plot holes it left unless I read the manga (I'll read it soon). This film is iconic because of its animation and concept, though not every iconic stuff are masterpieces. If you consider this film a masterpiece, that is fine with me just as long as you get my point. Will I recommend this film? Yes. Sometimes, we have to know some iconic stuff of anime and answer why this is iconic.\

    For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\
1.Art - Yeah.... so I watched the renowned Akira and I haven't done any reviews since school started up, so I figured I should start making reviews again since I'm on break.  The art was fantabulous!  It was so amazing that I have to make up words to describe how good it was.  It was also, in fact, hand drawn meaning that the level of animation I viewed was amazing because of it's\
          \
        fluidity and the fact that it was hand drawn. It was like watching water flow through my computer screen.  The actual art of the characters and setting was hugely unique and I couldn't get tired of it.  I would like to say that the character's faces were a little repetitive but because of the unique style it didn't bother me that much.  The art in this anime really set the tone for the story and was entirely unique in my eyes, so I can happily give art a 10.\
2.Sound - So.... oh dinners ready, I'll be back in a few............................... ok I'm back.  That was good taco salad, anyway, I really enjoyed the soundtrack.  All of the songs were perfect for the atmosphere of the show.  It kinda made me feel tribal and shit, it was pretty cool.  The soundtrack pretty much did it's job perfectly, which is to enhance the story.  This is why I don't really have much else to say about it.  I give it a 10 for being perfect in my opinion.\
3.Character - On thing that I liked about the charters in Akira was their intense rivalries and relationships with each other.  They all had very distinct personalities that set them apart from each other and identified themselves as characters.  The roles of all the characters all interlope and everything is connected.  The characters were lovable and I really don't have any complaints about them but that being said, they are not super interesting characters so I can't give them a 10.  They will get a 9 though.\
4.Story - The story of this show........ alright let's tackle this.  I want to start of by saying that this show does have a good story and I very much enjoyed what story it had but here is where my opinion will probably differ from most.  IT WAS SO CONFUSING FOR ME!  I never really had a defined clue of what was going on at any moment.  The story had me questioning what the whole point of it's self was and as a viewer I don't believe that an anime should make it's viewer confused.  Of course I can't give any spoilers, but at the end of the movie I didn't even know what the point of all of it was.  I brainstormed if I had missed anything important and I couldn't come up with anything I had missed.  I can't see how the story was so amazing if it doesn't have an overall purpose.  Now, you might be thinking, \"hey just watch it again and you'll get it\"....... well I shouldn't have to.  The creator of the anime should make his/her anime amazing the FIRST time around so that their anime can be easily consumed by consumers.  Of coarse this is my theory but it is very important to leave a good impression on the viewer rather than a confused one.  BAH who knows maybe I'm just dumb... I'll give it a 7.\
5.Enjoyment - Well although I had some major issues with the story I generally enjoyed the anime as a whole.  As I was watching I felt like I was in this dystopian future work that Akira created.  It really took my breath away and I was thrown amidst this huge struggle of power.  I did enjoy it a lot but making sense out of the story really took from my enjoyment so I can only give enjoyment a 8.\
This anime is an overall 8.\
*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\
Caution:\
!Keep in mind this anime has very intense gore.\
!Keep in mind this anime has dark subject matter.\
!Keep in mind this anime has nudity.",

    First off I will point out there are 4 ways to watch this.\
And there have been 2 different English versions of this Anime movie.\
The Original translation that was in theatres all over was done under one company that eventually went broke.  That translation and the voice actors were much better then the later.\
Of course watching it in the original Japanese is best if you know Japanese.\
But again the voice actors give a yet different feel then the later (and first) English translation voice overs.\
A later movie Spriggan which seems similar but clearly a kind of a copy of much of whats going on is\
          \
        nothing compared to this.\
Additionally if you watch the MANGA of the same title you will get yet a different story and feel.  And that is really over the top great!\
Again my rating of a 10 is based off the no longer available English translation and even the Japanese version.\
This movie was way ahead of its time when it came out in the Early 90's and really put to shame all the other anime, and really made American animation look like a absolute JOKE.\
This movie was noted for its use of computer assistance in the animation sequences that any animator at Disney or elsewhere take for granted.\
If anyone gets ahold of the ORIGINAL English version I suggest re-watching if you ended up disappointed like me when the NEW Akira re-release occurred...\
It is a fun roller coaster of a ride for a movie!  The ideas on Psionics, general science, and just realism is real key to its success.\

    Akira is as many have already stated, a classic... and a bloodbath.  After watching the film I admit I was left with feelings of confusion.  Although I suspect this may be partialy due to the dubbing.  The art is well drawn and fluid.  The characters blend well with the backgrounds.  The story is rather complicated, however the watcher should not feel completely lost after watching it.  The story is fine in terms of continuity, so there will be no irritating contradictions.  The characters are well done but many minor characters are in all honesty complete steriotypes.  The\
          \
        film is a classic of animation, modern anime can barely compare to the fluid animation present in thid film.  I will not be any more specific than this.  Too many reviews offer small yet irritating spoilers.  My last point will be to tackle the violence in the film.  Earlier I stated the film was a bloodbath.  This is true.  However the majority of seemingly pointless gore is towards the start of the film, although the intensity of gore after that increases.  I believe the purpose of the gore towards the start of the film is to help the person watching understand the ugly nature of the world they have been cast into and why the characters seem so flawed.  I am not normaly into anime which involves a lot of bloodshed.  Infact another of my favourites is \"My Neighbor Totoro\".  Do not be put off by the gore or the knowledge that there is gore.  The gore is a requirement of the film.  The film is not a requirement of the gore.\

    Akira‚Ä¶..The first anime I ever watched..i know that‚Äôs actually quite clich√© for an otaku to say now but damn its been 19 years since my first viewing on BBC2 in 1992. I‚Äôve thought about it for a while and I‚Äôve decided to base my review upon how this movie affected me then and how I think about it now. I‚Äôll try to be impartial considering this is my favourite animated movie of all time (to date). \
Animation \
Upon viewing this the first time I was just dazzled by the detail in animation keeping in mind before this most animations I had seen were from the\
          \
        Walt Disney camp. I was especially captured by the background / landscape detail ‚Äì scenes like when the ‚Äúkid‚Äù Takashi screams and a whole tower block of windows shatter were just mesmerizing.\
 A slight downside was maybe the character designs were a tad carbon copied but this never really bothered me at all. I just passed it off as the chosen character template.\
Again, scenes containing tremendous destructions and everything within the last 30 minutes where just so mentally stimulating to a young 6 yo‚Äôs mind it still brings a giant sense of nostalgia every time I re-watch it. I don‚Äôt really expect anyone watching this today to be blown away as much as I was but I think it can still be appreciated to some degree\
Sound \
Upon watching this anime the first time I am proud to say it was in its original Japanese language version with English subtitles, since then I have watch 2 different English dubs and of the two I can honestly say the first dub is the more acceptable but the Jap is my preference.\
The dialogue in Akira is really nothing spectacular, same goes for voice acting and background music. Actually the only thing I really love about the sound is during the memory sequences near the end of the movie, very nice.\
Story\
A lot of people make a big deal about how confusing the story is, well I believe Akira on a whole is a story you either want to understand or don‚Äôt, in the case you want to understand fully what this is all about you will probably find yourself re-watching this again or reading the manga.\
Akira to me is not just one simple story but a story that contains many sub-plots, ideologies, concepts and interactions, but at its core deals with friendship, politics and science.\
It‚Äôs hard to say how today‚Äôs audience would take the story of Akira because upon first viewing it‚Äôs a complicated story with many subplots that eventually come together.\
So in a nutshell I believe Akira has some great concepts that come together well but may take some patience and concentration to fully digest and enjoy.\
Character\
I‚Äôve read a lot of reviews where other people claim the worst part of Akira were under developed characters‚Ä¶.well I completely disagree. The characters in Akira are predictable-yes because everyone is just playing their role in the story, the teenagers act like teenagers, the scientists act like scientists and the army surprise surprise act like the army would! I mean are you expecting each character to delve into a monologue about how they are feeling or what they are thinking lol akira is long enough without it.\
These charters are on an adventure whether they know it or not and I found it entertaining watching them all come together so in my humble opinion there was nothing wrong with any of the characters in akira.\
Enjoyment\
Akira to me is just a dazzling experience of a fictional Neo-Tokyo which was animated wonderfully and given an exception storyline to boot. I have 3 different editions of Akira on DVD so I guess that kind of answers the ‚Äúdid I enjoy it‚Äù question.\
Value\
Well in the past I have recommended Akira to other people with mixed results. In todays anime scene Akira is still rated highly but many people find it confusing and overrated so I think newbie‚Äôs to anime may not enjoy Akira but it serves as a good tracing point in the history and development of anime in general.\
So bottom line, Akira still has high value to this day but I think it‚Äôs a movie more suited for the experienced and not so superficial anime fan.\
10/10\
Btw If you did watch Akira and did enjoy it I would recommend these titles: Neo Tokyo, Memories, Metropolis & Megazone 23.\

    Okay I know more than a few people are going to hate me for writing this review but Akira is not all that great. Yes it was one of the revolutionary films that helped to bring anime to America but still I just disliked.\
Story- Well in this case I have to say the story is original sense it's very old most likely it isn't copying anything and probably is being copied itself that being said the story line is complex I got it on the first try but to somebody who isn't border line crazy from watch series that are meant to mess with your\
          \
        head like FLCL or Soul Taker (I've got more if you want to get a list of major animes that mess with your head message me) it's probably confusing as hell.\
Art- ...Uh okay so yeah it's old art style matches the period from which it comes from as does the animation. However this will not halt my critique of how manly drawn the women characters were and lead me to question why everybody had absolutely gigantic foreheads I mean seriously they're foreheads were bigger than their chests. I kind of disliked some of the over the topness of drawing deformities in the anime but am pretty okay with it seeing as it was kind of necessary to get the point across at times about what was happening.\
Sound- Okay sound was good and so was the voice acting. Though I'm kind of otaku and refuse to watch it in english (always jap voice with eng subs unless its fruit baskets)\
Character- A lot time is spent focusing on a few characters that are important which is good that is what you're supposed to do and they did a good job of helping you kind of understand how the main characters thought...psychiatrists would crap themselves if they tried to psychoanalyze those guys.\
Enjoyment- I've had to watch the dang thing six times to appease the whole understanding where the roots of american anime come from and every single time I felt the same way. I don't mind watching this but I'd much rather be doing something else.\
Overall- It's okay I mean I'm not cutting off a toe to watch it hell I wouldn't even cut off a toe nail to watch it but hey this is one of those things that everybody just has to watch once so that you can really appreciate modern day anime.\

    How could we describe some of our biggest fears? Certainly, there are many troubles in society that make us think twice before saying that we live in a beautiful world. Well, to those who still have some doubts, Akira is a film that you should watch. \
And I don't exagerate when I say that this film is marvelous. As many others have done before and after, this film shows animation in its best context and does not try to be gentle with us. \
Akira talks about a lot of things at the same time. Many movies who try to tell a story this way usually\
          \
        fall and aren't able to be a good cinematographic product. It is not the case with this movie in particular. \
We have a lot of troubles in society who are perfectly and harshly, even viciously. shown in this movie. The way we learn this story is quite striking, and the visual and direct metaphores that are used are meant clearly to shock the spectator. We have a lot of blood, a lot of people dying, and we don't think at any point that it is \"gross\" and that there isn't a good reason for it to be. \
The espers are probably one of the strongest points in this movie. They are these kids with scary and disturbing faces who seem to hide some kind of power that is being exploited by the army and scientists. From talking about poverty, and the worst side of society, the movie moves to a point much more symbolical and strong not only because of its impeccable visualization, but also because of how, I repeat the word, \"striking\" are the characters. \
The feeling of losing some of this new comrades that the film introduces us is present at any point in the film. We clearly see a development about Kaneda or Tetsuo, two of our main characters, and how the things that they are seeing and facing change them, specially Tetsuo. \
By using shocking methods, the films tells its story and divides himself in three acts: we have the introduction and the idea of what will happen, we have the progress and then we have the final act, which concludes in not only an epic way, but also dramatic and certainly unexpected. \
I can perfectly state that this film is as good as many made by Studio Ghibli. The strong message behind it, and its way to tell us what he wants to tell us by simply being natural (as sadistic, as graphic and as fluent as it wants to be) and sincere, is probably what is most important in \"Akira\". \
How many times have you seen a story talking about gangs and the creation of the universe, or the Big Bang Theory, at the same time? Well, my dear friends, Akira does it. And what an ending, please! \

    Akira is a great movie that years ago raised the bar of what anime is. The story is outstanding, and one most people need to re watch many times to understand it in its entirety. This is because Akira's story structure operates on many different levels.\
At first, Akira seems like a pretty basic shounen anime. However, it touches on many different theories such as multiverse theory and chaos theory that might seem a little odd in a powerful action movie like this. These references are subtle, and I know that they went over my head while watching the movie. If it wasn't for the research\
          \
        I did after watching Akira, I would have never gotten the level of fulfillment that I did from the movie.\
Yes, the art can seem a little tacky and overly vintage, but in my opinion this overshadowed by the multiple layers of plot, and diverse cast that is set up. While it is not my favorite movie, it is certainly deserving of a 9/10 rating.\

    This past week I was fortunate enough to see a midnight theatrical screening of an anime and manga dear to my heart, AKIRA, by the renowned Katsuhiro Otomo, creator of METROPOLIS, STEAMBOY, MEMORIES, ROUJIN Z, ROBOT CARNIVAL, etc.  It was in the original Japanese language too, subtitled. He has in no doubt made a name for himself, and this is his masterpiece, as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is to Kubrick and STAR WARS is to Lucas.\
The movie begins with that famous opening scene where the cyberpunk is presented visually in its purest state, years after the trend had already begun in earlier Japanese films\
          \
        such as BURST CITY, and DEATH POWDER, but it took until 1988 to perfect it and complete it into its final transformation and most solid state. It is presented in Neo Tokyo in 2019 after a first bomb. The night sky is black and the teenage biker gangs, the Capsules and the Clowns, are out, as if the Government has lent over the keys to the city at these hours and the streets belong to them. The film takes a chance to scan and admire the city, and bustling futuristic advancement with 3 dimensional holographic billboards and neon signs atop business, and tall skyscrapers and neon lighting everywhere. The kids chase each other over nothing too rational, or at least we get no reason other than that they are rival street gangs... probably territory. The music score is as iconic as the score in PATTON during Patton's speech, or in THE GODFATHER at the dinner table, or PSYCHO, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC, JAWS or STAR WARS. They bust members of the opposing gangs off of their bikes into restaurant glass windows and beat each other from their rides with lead pipes and run over arms and bodies, and the Capsules seem to have a closer kinship and concern and sense of 'family,' than the clowns who attribute their gangsters to just a number.\
Tetsuo when we first meet him makes it obvious that he has an adamant desire to prove himself, admiring his friend Kaneda's bike, custom made and unable to drive than any other that Kaneda himself. \"I could drive it,\" says Tetsuo. During the ride, Tetsuo runs into an elderly looking kid who has escaped from a man earlier in the film trying to help him escape, but a governmental authority shot the guardian dead, and the boy ran off. Now faced with Tetsuo almost running into him, he uses some force to push him away, and his friends quickly show up. The authorities show up as well, and they bring each boy in, but Tetsuo under separate circumstances. The other boys are put into an alternative school, but Tetsuo is experimented on, and only regroups after escaping from the hospital, noticing a difference in his mental state, and the film so effectively paints this psychological alternation without overdoing it, making it believable. He envisions his guts spilling out from beneath his stomach, and we see it, and afterwards, the camera pans from a point of view of everybody else, seeing nothing but Tetsuo putting his invisible guts back into his belly. We know it is from their viewpoint, but it does not tell us. It is very well done. The authorities come and take him back.\
Kaneda begins to involve himself with Kei, a girl he met earlier in the film, and within the movie, her involvement can be a bit puzzling. It really takes the manga to completely understand her role in the plot and story. Within the sole spectrum of the film, she is best used by the elderly children to explain Akira and Tetsuo, stating also that the universe has many particles of energy compressed, old, and stored. Tetsuo is like giving an ameba an abundance of power, consuming all around it. The elderly children speak through Kei and explain this to Kaneda. Tetsuo enjoys a newfound power he receives, and escapes the hospital he's held in and wrecks havoc after a fantastically animated scene in which he halucinates and sees the childhood toys around him, a bit demonic, but never stated that way. The genius is that it is so subtly implied. He kills those that stand in his way, including an old member of his gang and the bartender and drug dealer at their old hangout. Kaneda is warned and goes to approach Tetsuo, who finally feels as if he's on top, or above. He isn't below Kaneda anymore. Kaneda always saved him. He had the cool bike and was the ladies man. Tetsuo battles Kaneda and mocks him, asking him if he feels frustrated. The military is also in full swing, shooting from space at Tetsuo with satellites, as his power is far more expanse than anything before ever. It is a massive scene, and he is scene as a 'god' with followers, but his empathy is dead and he is past the point of controlling himself, not caring whether they die or not, killing them. He even travels into space to destroy the satellites that attack him. It doesn't look overdone and silly either, or outrageous and unbelievable. Sure, there are no explosions in space because a flame cannot ignite without oxygen, but we are able to gloss over this fact as sounds leaves the scene. Otomo included this detail, and it sort of cancels out the fictive element. It even expands more, the scene that is. Tetsuo literally expands and his control goes beyond his grasp. The elderly kids use Akira to kill him, sort of. He's brought into an area out of reality and condensed, like the particles storing energy. The film ends on a hopeful note. If you wish to know the style of anime, think GHOST IN THE SHELL.\

    Akira is all in all, a great movie. Although it is slow moving and slightly long winded, it has a great psychological, dystopian feel to it, making any sci-fi fan become attached and wanting to watch more.\
Due to the nature of the anime, and it being gory, and disturbing in places, this isn't a family type movie, and suits more of the older range of fans, that are at least sixteen or over. \
The art in this movie has amazing quality for the time it was released, and some backgrounds are incredibly detailed and suitable for the scene. Although, if compared to more modern anime,\
          \
        it wouldn't be appreciated as much.\
The music in this anime makes an impact on you, ranging from the eerie backing tracks, to the techno beats. It fits into the scenes and the movie wouldn't be complete without it.\
In my opinion, I didn't like the movie at first as I had watched it when I was only ten years old, making me bored all the way through, and not understanding much of the storyline. but now having rewatched it, I have come to truly appreciate the movie.\

    To be honest I love Akira 1988 however it's missing out on alot of details contained in the manga...\
Their were a whole lot more characters and their was more explained and explored in the overall series that's why i feel like this movie fails in certain aspects...\
it fails to characterize important characters like \
Granny Chiyako\
and a ton of others including Akira himself which makes an appearance in the manga\

    Well, I saw Akira for the first time last night and I have to saw it is a work of art. A major breath of fresh air that I needed in anime. I normally dont like watchin the dub version of anime movies and shows, but I honestly have to say I loved the dub(both of them). The storyline can be a little confusing at first, nothing a little rewatching cant fix. I loved the characters, they were so original and had crazy personalitys. I really enjoyed it as screwed up as it was. This is by far my favorite anime film of all time.\

    So, a lot of people take issue with the fact this movie only covers about one volume of the manga, but here's the thing: manga and film are two totally different mediums with different storytelling capabilities. If they tried to emulate the epic scope of the comic, it would have been disastrous; it's a little messy as is, but the cloak-and-dagger politics take a backseat to a subtle character-oriented approach, which makes it compelling. Who can't identify with this kind of adolescent rivalry? I can't do the animation justice, but's amazing. I dunno, maybe you just \"had to be there,\" i.e. had to be around\
          \
        13 years old having no idea what to expect when you saw it, but it left imprints in my brain.\
The typically Japanese impenetrable spiritualism the film eventually slips into is potentially alienating, but it's worth noting it has more depth than any of Miyazaki's eco-sermons. \

    As You all know Akira is the first anime to make a really big difference in animes. Its true, Akira is a really good anime with one solid story. Even sometimes good animes also have some false. In this case, the problem is that the story mostly contains fighting scenes. I love fights but, there are too much. The last fight scene alone took about 40 minutes. The gang styl life is depicted correctly. The blood, the girls its all there.\
Another problem I had was music. I am pretty sure that I didn't hear any good music in this anime. Once in awhile there would\
          \
        be this sudden 'thump' and everything goes real silent. Its weird but, at the same time it kinda good for the story.\
Other than those stuffs the movie was really good . The animation wasn't perfect but, hey its an old anime. The setting in the future japan was a really good for the story. I watched it in subbed version which was good compared to the dubbed version which was squeaky.\
Well to wrap it up. I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it highly to everyone.\

    AKIRA REVIEW // (Spoiler Free) \
A title which has always been shoved in my face as an anime classic...well after watching it I can fully say yeah, it's classic as hell. \
Akira is a story set in a futuristic Tokyo, rebuilt from the ruins of World War III. We follow the main protagonist Kaneda, who ends up deeply involved in a secret government project. Little does he know this project involves telekinetic humans. This is the foundation of the story, which breeds more complex themes later on. \
Story:9/10\
Akira has a plot designed to intrigue and mystify. Pacing may seem a little slow at some points,\
          \
        but I would say patience is the key to watching this film. The story is a gradual tension builder, but in many ways does is succeed at keeping the audience entertained, there are exciting bike chases, a lot of explosions, stunning visuals and an epic ending to all endings. \
Art: 10/10\
Wow, the art is stunning, this for me is the highlight of this film. True to its 80 style, its unique character designs and scenery allow it to remain timeless. It may not have the most realistic art like we see in modern anime but that's not Akira's aim. The abstract scenes and use of contrasting colours fit the futuristic setting perfectly, truly making it a 2hr piece of art. Never have I seen so much detail to an animation, from graffiti marks to drinks cans and peeling wallpaper, it's all visible in such intense detail. The transition from each frame is flawless and it's hard to believe this was created over 20 years ago!!\
Sound: 10/10\
In terms of voice acting, all actors gave an extremely believable performance displaying a wide range of emotion, in particular Tetsuo and Kaneda who had screams filled with pain and distress which forced you to feel for them. More astounding were the soundtracks used throughout, they complimented the most dramatic parts of the story and built a sense of tension which will make your heart beat faster. The tracks had a unique vibe to them as well which could only be described as 'Akira' with an almost jungle feel to it...you might think thats sound out of place in a city setting but it only enhances the chaotic nature of the film.\
Character: 7/10\
I feel that this may be the only aspect which could have really been expanded on. Kaneda is an extremely likeable guy, with a very cool and reckless attitude, in fact he's the kinda guy who you might wish to be friends with. He acts as a comedic relief at times and is really the only one who makes that full connection with the audience. However, all the rest of the characters somewhat come across as unrelatable, whether they lived or died wasn't that much of a heartache. Though it must be appreciated that this is a two hour film and along with the dense plot their isnt much time to fortify strong character backgrounds. \
Enjoyment: 9/10\
Akira is an experience in itself, yes there are a few moments which are slow and...well...down right strange (my advice is don't watch it if your feeling kinda sleepy) but for the highly dramatic moments there is no other film like it. This film looks as though the animation team have really pushed their artistic ability to the limit, this is not half-assed, this is everything they had to offer and more. No one else could pull of the unique feel this futuristic film gives off, you watch it and you feel like you've watched something special and beyond the 'casual-lets-entertain-for-money' anime film. This is a film which may not be appreciated by everyone, since it's not exactly a film designed to satisfy the audience, rather take the audience into the uncharted depths of anime. I consider this a classic and staple for anyones anime list.\
Overall:\
(45/50 = 90%)\
= 10/10\
A.k.a Something you have to watch before you die.\

Akira is a very dark, very violent and depressing dystopia. It basically managed to set the standard for classic thriller/horror anime that can very easily be related to evangelion. I would advise this to any anime fan dubbed or subbed it was dubbed twice though so don't be surprised if you find multiple versions.\

Akira's influence on the anime industry is unbelivable! Along with Spirited Away, this bought anime to the attention of everyone, kids and adults alike to then get them into other popular anime like Dragonball Z and Studio Ghibli films.\
Anyway, onto the movie. I thought it as a 2 hour bloodbath at first, but as I thought more, I saw it on a different level. The animation is beautiful. I didn't find the story that amazing, but it was OK. \
I liked it because of the animation, the tension throughout the whole thing and the awesome Plush Toy scene.\
Overall,\
          \
        Akira is a great film, with action, stunning art and tension. I recommend it to people who like mature sci-fi films and who enjoyed Cowboy Bebop!\

    This is a old animated movie, but what makes it great still echos significance for future animation. We all know or have at least an idea that animation of all sorts cost lots of money, time and overworking of the staff. \
Instead of conserving money, this one appears to throw it into the vast ocean known as expense which is clearly shown throughout its animation. From one who watch lots of anime, it appears as if everything as come to life. The environment itself moves even as the character continues to speak to make it as life-like as it can be. This is not prevalent\
          \
        in most anime today as most have to deal with a budget and making this type of animation is really expensive. \
The film itself was a box office failure(cost over 1 bill. yen and lost about 25 million yen), but it is still considered one of the greatest anime in terms of its soundtrack and offering something that we barely see.\
There was not much of a story in my opinion, but for those who have watch much anime in a lifetime, it is an appreciation to the eye to see something that flows like real life.\

    A classic anime movie! This is a must see! Even if you are not an anime fan. The animation is spectacular, Very well detailed and fluent, especially being from (1988) The story is a bit hard to understand. It does not spoon feed you the information, you really have to really pay attention when watching. And also this movie is NOT for kids \"Very Violent\" This film is more for a mature audience. \
Akira is consider to be the \"BEST\" anime movie. Akira is also consider to be an important animated film as well! Akira made anime more mainstream for adults and as well mainstream\
          \
        for the western country's!\
For what this masterpiece of an anime did and how well it aged, I think it deserves a 10 out of a 10!\

    Liked:\
Art and Animation:  This is hands down one of if not the most consistently visually impressive pieces of animation ever released.  The level of detail, the fluidity of the movements of the characters and also the unique and striking art style help this film to truly stand out among it's contemporaries.\
Sound:  The soundtrack and even the regular sound effects like that for firing a gun or something exploding are simply top notch, as the sound helps to build a strange and scary sort of atmosphere that helps keep interest.\
Characters: Many are given more than enough charm and style to help them to\
          \
        be remembered, as the vast majority are members of biker gangs they have a delinquent sort of characterization surround all of them.\
Disliked:\
Story: The story tries to talk about very deep and complex themes but doesn't go into much detail considering this is adapted from a phone book length manga.\

    Moving on to something I just watched for the first time a few weeks ago... Having watched it in English, this was sort of like a Digimon reunion for me. I spent a good third of this movie picking out voices and linking them to other roles I knew the actors from. Luckily, this didn't take away from the enjoyment for me. This was a really good dub, especially given that it came out in 1988-- a time when good anime dubs weren't exactly in abundance. And this feels a little like a side note, but there was just something satisfying to me to hear\
          \
        child characters being voiced by actual child actors and not older actors who are capable of making their voices sound all young and squeaky. \
I don't love this move... but I feel like I could. Only a few weeks have passed, but this movie is really sticking with me. I would love to rewatch it to see if I get anything more out of it the second time around. \
This movie is set in 2019... It's funny to think that the 'distant future' the creators had in mind is now only 3 years away. But I think that may be one of just a few aspects of this movie that doesn't stand the test of time. The animation-- also reminiscent of an older time-- isn't anything flashy, but given that this movie was supposed to be gritty and real, not shiny and attractive, it works just fine. \
I didn't find any of the characters to be all that likable, but like with the animation, I also got the sense that they weren't supposed to be. I would have liked to see some of the supporting cast gone into a little more, but I also acknowledge that the focus was really on Kaneda and Tetsuo and I found both of their characters to be developed sufficiently. \
I'm not really a lover of sci-fi or futuristic settings, but Akira certainly held my interest throughout. To the point where I wasn't all the satisfied with the ending-- mostly because I wanted to see the characters go on and get a little more plot fulfillment. The friendship between our two main leads was really this movie's strongest point, made more realistic by the fact that it wasn't cheesy or overdone.\
My score may go up in the future, but even after just watching it this first time, I would definitely recommend it to someone else. \

    One of the greatest masterpieces in the history of animation! You can witness the excellence of Katsushiro Otomo of creating a plot so surreal and complex that leads you to a knew concept of understanding animation.\
Everytime I met someone who likes japanese animation, I ALWAYS ask \"have you watched Akira yet? If you don¬¥t, please go watch it\", because I think this movie is important to a knew recognition of what is really GOOD in anime and what is only good or what can be ART and what can be only comercial.\

    Akira is the anime that inspired an entire genre of anime. Where Dragon Ball Z is what a lot of people state to being the most inspirational, Akira Toriyama stated himself that Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were inspired to a massive amount by the original Manga for Akira. I don't know how close the anime is to the movie but I can tell you a few things that I liked about it, because there wasn't much if anything, that I disliked about this animated film.\
1. The action scenes aren't overly long\
The action scenes are short and the film isn't completely made up of\
          \
        them. I can more so relate this to Neon Genesis Evangelion as the film takes more of a chance to develop the characters, no matter how subtle the development is.\
2. There is no definitive bad guy\
Where as a lot of people would look at this as a bad thing I'm not a firm believer in a fight between good and evil. There are a lot of scenes where the character being portrayed as an antagonist does something good, and the character being portrayed as the protagonist is doing something bad. They take a good look at human psychology and take us on a right through one of the main character's delve into insanity caused by an over abundance of power.\
3. The message we get from the movie is debatable\
This film is what would happen if the entirety of Neon Genesis Evangelion were to be a movie rather than a series. They could have just as easily dragged the entire film out into a 20 episode long series, but they didn't. And the ending of the movie leaves a lot of debatability and theories that could be made up from the film.\
And the animation is amazing as well as the completely acoustic soundtrack.\

    It's the year 1995 and my world is about to explode.\
In a gaming magazine I read about anime, japanese style animation with adult themes and great stories. And it has come to Sweden. In a shop I find a few imported VHS-tapes, I buy a few and Akira is the first one I watch.\
It cannot be overstated how much this movie really blew my mind. It was a cartoon, but it had violence and blood and a deep and interesting story. The animation was detailed and fluent and the music was fantastic.\
But how well does it do today, after the initial shock?\
Story:\
The story is interesting\
          \
        enough and has a few tricks up its sleeves. It's not the most cerebral story ever and it's not terribly original, but it works well and it holds on to you.\
Art:\
There is really nothing about the art I can complain about. When I still had it on VHS, I actually replayed a short scene where a smoke bomb goes off just to see how good it looked. Sure, I've seen a lot of movies having the same quality since, but few of them are as good in presenting an overall mood as Akira. The palette really works for this movie.\
Sound:\
Most sounds in the movie are good, but not anything you notice a lot. But the music - the haunting music. It is perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks I've ever heard. It fits in so well with the movie and is yet outstanding on its own. Few other soundtracks even get close to this.\
Character:\
The characters are believable, but they may seem a bit bland at times. But this is not a movie primarily about characters. It may seem to be a movie about Kaneda and Tetsuo, but that plot only serves to carry the bigger questions found in the movie. The characters aren't the greatest ones ever made, but they're good enough.\
Enjoyment / Overall:\
I've always enjoyed watching this. A good pacing, an interesting story, nice visuals and fantastic music all adds up to a great movie. It led me into the world of anime and manga and to a certain degree, it has shaped my life.\
Perhaps a few lines can be written about how it compares to the manga. In short, it doesn't. They are two different (although similar) stories with the same characters. Both are great and can be enjoyed on their own. They don't go together or complement each other, but that is no reason to skip out on either.\

    This is one of those animes I wish I would've watched sooner,A perfect example of why people say old is gold...Trust me,you don't wanna miss this piece of absolute awesomeness.\
Story-Set in a distant future,It starts off as a normal Sci-Fi based future about ..But then the story unravels slowly & develops into something far more deep,serious & extraordinary...The story mostly revolves around humans experimenting with superhuman abilities,human evolution & so on.\
Artwork-For an anime that came out on 1988,I think Akira showed one of the most stunning,beautiful & impressively detailed art style & animation that was possible back on those days...Also had very good action scenes\
          \
        too.\
Characters-The characters are very simple but every important character played their role very suitably..The MC,Villain might seem pretty common now..But that doesn't make this story any less amazing.\

    okay so not even gonna lie i found this shit off of a cinefix list and i do not regret watching this movie. easily one of the best horror movies ever made in anime. akira is the epitome of how terrifying an apocalypse by a single person can be.\
story (spoilers for the second half of it I guess): \
so basically in the opening scenes you have a dude trying to escape a riot and he is protecting one fucking ugly ass kid and gets lit up, only to find out that he's an esper. enter the main character Kaneda who is one badass motherfucker for\
          \
        being like 14 years old. he and his biker gang are fucking shit up and they find said esper kid on the bridge and Tetsuo gets murked by said esper and is taken away in a helicopter. there he has operations that pretty much fuck him over and learns to harness an enormous amount of psychic power. basically Kaneda wants to find (and eventually stop) Tetsuo from going berserk (spoiler: doesn't work too well) and then one of the most horrifying sequences occurs in any anime. just unreal animation, doesn't even look like its from 1988, but i'll get to that later.\
art:\
stunning. the night is lively and dark. as the movie goes on the sky and colors become gloomier. the opening scene has an amazing skirmish between biker games and is executed perfectly in the Neo-Tokyo (so close damnit) night. when Tetsuo goes berserk in the city, it is jaw-dropping that someone actually drew this. remember, this 80's movie had better animation than shit we see today.\
sound:\
vibrant music. watched subbed and don't regret it. might have to rewatch just to appreciate how perfectly the sound describes the situation in this movie.\
characters:\
incredible. Kaneda is an excellent lead and you can't help but root for him because he's a badass and the only one in the city with probably millions of people to take on the antagonist Tetsuo. also, Tetsuo is an excellent antagonist and you can't help but to hate him for everything he stands for (fuck that pussy) and is a truly terrifying villain. Shikishima looks like a bad guy at first but he is a man with a great moral standing unlike the rest of the government. Kei is the least interesting as her personality exists for like a couple of scenes.\
enjoyment:\
fucking loved it. re-watchable. not one dull scene that made me want to skip a part in this movie. end was not as happy as the premise would lead you to believe. honestly when a movie sounds great and has fantastic artwork it will glue your eyes to the screen for its runtime, in this case 2 hours.\
recommendation:\
must-watch. should be regarded as a classic and recognized along with horror films of that late 80s to early 90s like a Silence of the Lambs. i would even say as to recommend it to people who are a fan of horror and have never watched anime before since this might be the one to hook them in.\

    REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS\
Akira is a great mix of distopic future concept, violence and mystical powers. If you liked A Clockwork Orange, 1984 or Brave New World you will probably like this anime. \
Ok, it has deffects in the story and the animation, but if you consider that was made in 1988, its actually great! I really don't know about the manga but this film shows very well the premise and of Akira.\
I recommend that you DON'T CREATE TOO MUCH EXPECTATIVE, BECAUSE IF YOU DO THERE'S A GREAT CHANCE THAT YOU WILL BE DESAPOINTTED. \
IT IS AN OLD ANIME FILM BRO, consider that and you\
          \
        will see that it is a great anime!\

    Whenever someone comes up to me, asking advice for a quality anime movie they should watch, a movie that almost always jumps to mind is Akira. I mean, how could it not? It's undoubtedly one of the most famous anime movies of the 80's - no scratch that, of all time. The reason Akira is so famous is thanks to a plethora of reasons, the most notable being that it exposed a lot of the western world to an almost untreaded world of animation and art. Not to say that it was the first anime that made it over seas, but it's no doubt one\
          \
        of the first major cases of a serious break-through. Some suggest that if it wasn't for Akira, anime might not have ever been big outside of Japan. Do I agree with those opinions? I'll leave that for you to decide. \
So what's so great about the movie that when it came out in America it was heralded as one of the best animations to ever come from Japan? Well, there are a number of reasons why. First off and foremost, the animation is unbelievable. Even when I watch the movie with friends today, they still can't believe how well the movie was animated - and this is before I even tell them the movie is from the 80's. Akira was so far ahead of the animation found in America, that at the time of it's release, it not only shattered our perceptions on what the set level of animation-quality was, it ushered in an entire fanbase that would help dictate the level of animation from then on. Besides that, Akira is full of memorable characters that really round off the most important aspect of Akira: it's story. I don't want to give too much away because I don't want to spoil anything, but Akira is an immensely deep and thought-provoking ride that explores a number of psychological and philosophical themes. The ending is quite infamous for confusing a large number of people, but it's inability to clarify what exactly happened at the end was more than likely done on purpose. \
Overall, it's one of the greatest anime movies of all time. If you want an anime that's as kinetic and beautiful as it is deep and though-provoking you don't need to look much further, Akira might be exactly what you're looking for. \

    It has been some time since I watched Akira. However, I still remember this feeling of confusion that I felt at the end pretty well. There are many series similar to Akira in terms of its topic. Yet, what differs it from the rest is the fact that it does not try to give you a certain answer at the end. Rather, it encourages you think further and further about it. I think that is what I like about it. It such a great anime with a great story, not to mention the art. \

    REVIEW: The Art for an 80's film was superb, very very detailed, the animations are very fluid and nothing is ever kept still. The backgrounds were all moving and alive. It's beautiful but there's a lot of gore and guts too so watchers beware. Even by today's standards only a few can match the art of Akira. Now the plot is complex but well made and is very imaginative, the anime did a great job of showing that to the film. The only problem with the plot is its fast pacing which kinda ruined the character development, maybe because they have crammed a lot of\
          \
        manga material into a 2 hour film. I'm sure the manga is better and will explain things a lot better (more character development and on what happens after and before the movie) and I'm hoping that I can read it one of these days. The Concept of having God-like powers is explored quite well, they showed that with greater power, the more isolated someone will be. He/she will transcend into something not human, and might view humans as mere animals or insects.(Of course his/her perspective will change they way Tetsou's did as he was able to kill one of his friends without hesitation). Overall I am very pleased with the movie and was amazed by the art and plot. If you like Psychological, Scifi and Thriller then this one is for you, The plot is kinda heavy but if your like me (who loves seinen btw) you'll enjoy this.\
My Personal Rating: 9/10\

    If you actually look at the words next to the numbers when you rate various Anime's that you have seen on this site, the word next to 10 is 'Masterpiece'.  There are very few 10's on this list because giving an Anime a 10 means that there is virtually nothing that I would change about the work, and that I enjoyed it immensely.\
Akira is one of those genre-defining, some would say 'cult classics' that people gush over.  However, in this case it is not done without reason.  The story is beautifully done, and is stylishly animated, which should come to be expected\
          \
        seeing as the basis for this movie is one of the most famous and acclaimed manga's ever created.  The characters are not fleshed out the best, and sometimes the dialogue leaves a little bit to be desired eg. \"KANEDAAA!!\" but these small quips are easily outweighed by the immersive setting and plotline the movie presents.  The director chose to, instead of fleshing out the characters, put most of his time into creating a complete world for us to revel in for the duration of the movie.  The integration of the soundtrack with the movie as well is masterfully done; the sound is there when you want it and disappears when it is not needed.  Nothing in this movie feels out of place when you watch it.\
My final statement as to why Akira got the elusive 10, and is simply because there is nothing quite like Akira, nor will there be again, which is why this piece truly deserves the title of 'Masterpiece'\

    Looking at Akira objectively its nothing special.\
However,\
Any animator or aspiring animator must watch this. It's does a lot of things first and pioneers many aspects of modern animation.\
Aside from this you are getting a slightly above average story with very typical or rather archetypal characters, nothing wrong with that however if you are someone who hears how high regard this film is, and then proceeds to watch it them you might be the first to point that out.\
It is still definitely worth your time but don't expect a masterpiece. Thats the end of evangelion you are looking for. As a technical piece, its put simply,\

        masterfully crafted.\

    Warning possible Spoilers\
This will probably for a good while be the oldest thing I've seen that's anime related and for an anime Movie/film that came out in the 1980's that looks this good is damn impressive.\
Akira is set in the year 2019 (which isn't too far away) after WW3 and one day while riding their bikes Kaneda and Tetsuo suddenly end up getting involved with something they wish they hadn't.\
I enjoyed the story it was interesting seeing how Tetsuo was changing after he had gained psychokinetic powers and how he suddenly learned to use it until he lost control of it and engulfed his body.\
          \
        I also enjoyed seeing Kaneda trying his best to help out Tetsuo even though he didn't accept his help at all which then lead to the both of them fighting each other.\
It's difficult trying to explain the story because even though I enjoyed it was pretty confusing especially towards the end of the movie/film, but I did enjoy the story well the bit's that didn't go over my head.\
The Characters were actually pretty good it was interesting seeing Kaneda's and Tetsuo's past which basically started the whole fight between them by the end because Tetsuo felt weak compared to Kaneda since he always looked after them so I liked the rivalry that developed between them. I thought the other supporting characters were alright, but felt like they were a way to advance the plot and didn't really get much development so I didn't really feel attached them by the end, the Espers however were a peculiar bunch since they had the same powers as Tetsuo because they were experimented on as children which gave the Movie/film a darker tone, but their usage in the Movie was basically so they could destroy Akira and give Tetsuo a run for his money which was really underwhelming.\
I loved the Artstyle this is possibly one of the best things I've seen in anime because it just looks amazing, I liked the way the city was designed with it's dystopian setting plus the Bike Kaneda had is something I want to own it looked that cool, The destructive power that Tetsuo had was showed to great effect throughout the Movie/film, I liked the soundtrack too it gave off that distinct 80's vibe that stays with you.\
I really enjoyed this film/movie despite it being confusing at times it is definitely a good watch for anyone who is into dystopian future's or seeing people go out of control with newly acquired powers or if you really want to see something that looks really good, if you're also an anime veteran this is certainly a requirement to watch  \

    The short and sweet:\
The movie is a staple of what some call the \"must see\" anime. It is by no stretch an amazing anime but it does hone back to the 80s a time when anime movies felt like 80s movies. The story is pretty weird and takes place in a future 80s version of Tokyo. Basically a boy and another boy duke it out at the end but involves terrorism and a hidden monster that almost destroyed Tokyo years ago bla bla bla 80s movie tropes later.

    In terms of Anime movies, this is by far the best I have ever seen, (at least for now it is.) I enjoy this because its art/story/characters are all great; in fact almost everything about Akira is just outstanding, truth be told. I love the characters, especially Kaneda. \
It's a fun film to watch and the story and theme behind the movie is just great. Its cyberpunk theme and the overall tone of the film makes it real great and I could rewatch it many times without getting bored. It's definitely a great one. \
I can't see very many Anime movies coming close to this\

        one but I cannot be too sure. I just love everything Akira offers and when I first watched it I was intrigued and very evoked. It's a perfect 10/10 film for me, for sure.\

    Not to long ago I was recommended this movie to watch from a friend, and he told me it would be a worth while movie to watch. At the time I was sick, so I had plenty of free time to watch the movie, and I got to say that yes; in someway the story can be complex. But it's interesting to think of it in a different view point. \
The animation is very good for the time it was made, and the sound wasn't that bad either. Although the character development can be laughable, it felt real in some way. The characters were actually\
          \
        easy to relate to in a sense that you could tell they put effort in the idea of a punk like character. \
The soundtrack was a bit... off, but not bad. If you're looking for something to keep you thinking, or just interested, this movie is for you. However be warned that it can be a bit goreish at times, but nothing extreme, and some of the scenes are a bit trippy. So yes, I highly recommend you watch this movie if it is your first time watching it. \

    I had heard so much about this anime before I actually saw it last week. Needless to say, I got raged at by some of my friends for not seeing it sooner, but I think it's better that I saw it at this age, because I doubt I would've understood it back when  I was younger. \
Though the ending didn't completely make sense to me, I thoroughly enjoyed Akria, because of its story, the animation style and the characters. I also loved the dubbing, I thought it was good. It was funny, I was recognizing voice actors immediately. I heard Tetsuo and thought, \"That's\
          \
        Hige\", then Kaneda \"That's Kiba\", and when they finally got to Ryu, \"That's Hub!\". \

    The animated movie that changed completely the way the world saw Japanese animation. There is not much to say about this outstanding movie witch has not only an avveneristic art style and image rendering but also has a definitively great sound track wich will drag you into the futuristic and aliening atmosphere of this masterpiece.\
In comparision to the manga it lacks quite a big piece of plotline and characters but when it comes to a pure rewiev of this adaptation it all becomes clear..... a true backbone of Japanese sci-fi animation.\

    Review 17: Akira (NEO Magazine, Review Competition Entry)\
Fancy an action packed Anime with bike gangs and scientific experiments??? \
Keep reading; Cause there's going to be an overload of it soon enough.\
Akira, just the name gets you intreged. The Anime itself is quite old, its not based on a tv program, was bought out quite a while back and whilst only at the age of 12.... Gets you pulled, dragged and drowned by the anime world.\
The first anime I ever watched which made me fall to my knees with the disappointing ending which I didn't really understand at first...opps??  \
With the first few scenes focused\
          \
        on a motor bike gang it already draws in those previous lovers of the anime world.\
With the youngest and the most wimpiest kid in the gang being the main characcter it already stands out from the others. As we all usually see the main character being the strongest, most violent and demanding in the group if we focused on various types of Anime.  \
With Tetsuo Shima as our main character it just shows that the stereo typical attention seeking main character is not always the best one to go along with. This young boy is an orphan, abandoned by his parents at a young age and literally tortured by other children who belonged to the same orphanage as him.\
We meet other characters along the way like Shotaro Kaneda, his best friend who was almost like his older brother, also he started up the bike gang in the first place. He's seems to be the strongest out of the group.\
Also the rebelion group, The Espers who are unfortunate children who are constantly being tested on....And Obviously the goverment themselves.\
With loveabe characters, some slight confusion, classical animation techniques, motor bike gangs, crazy scientists, children with granny like skin (eww) and the classical rebelion group that should be admired.\
For me its the film that got me in love with anime from a surprisingly young age, which some people would find bad as its aged 18, I got over the violence and from it I've matured. Its an anime for beginners I think but an old time favourite.\
Its been 2years since ive watched it, and I remember it all as if it was just the other day.\
A 5 Star rating from me. ~Amy\
Friday 1st Febuary. 8:10 pm. ~AmyXxxx\
P.S. \
This is actually been entered to be featured for the competition its just been sent off so I hope I can get into the magazine. Fingers crossed ^.^\

    Akira can be summed up in this one sentence, and as you've seen by my reviews/watched list, this may come as a shock - this film is a rival to Studio Ghiblis masterpieces. It's a bit more gory, but just as moving and well produced. And I'll get on to those reasons now:\
Story: The story I won't summarize a) I have to much else to write about and b) that's what bios are for but it is darn emotive.  The setting is beautifully presented in terms of how it's dealt with (I'll get onto the art soon), the script I guess, and it's all\
          \
        totally believeable. Whether this is because it is a future Earth would be a logical explaination. The one thing I did not like, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is it is set in 2019. Sure, this was made in 1998, but we will NOT be that advanced in 5 years. That's why 2050 is always a good bet. The atmosphere is also bang on. In one instance, the whole film goes silent as one of our protagonists go through space... Moments like that. 9.\
Art: As stated above, the art is beautiful. Again, this is becoming a little like CGI, in that if it's hand-drawn, it's guranteed a high score, but this seriously is Ghibli/Cowboy Bebop level of standard, and you can never complain with that. The character models looked a bit... Awkward. Western-ised I guess is the best way to describe it. 9.\
Sound: Despite what I said about the little touches of silence that add to the atmosphere, there are actually quite a few periods of silence, and well the background music is OK, it's barely audible. However, credit has to be given to... Well, the credits. Awesome song that fittingly finishes an awesome film. 6.\
Characters: OK... We have Kanade, Tetsuo, Kei, The Colonel and the Espers are the main characters in the film. Kanade and Tetsuo take 'turns' in both being the main protagonists - Kanade does end up being the 'good guy', but Tetsuo's rise and struggle to power and then containing that power - reminiscent of Hitlers rise and consilidation of power if you have ever researched that area of history. \
Kanade is a natural born leader and is just very relatable and likeable. He is the leader of a bike gang (the bikes are VERY nice, neon and futuristic and oooooo SHINY) and, yeah, typical of a good protagonist to be fair.\
Next are the Espers - they're a mysterious trio, with their background only being explained at the end of the story, and they're actually the weakest of the bunch because of this - only getting screen time to explain Tetsuo's mysterious powers he's just obtained (trying to be as spoiler-free as I possibly can...)\
The Colonel, as you'd expect, is the leader of the military force following these bike gang wars (as explained via Kanade being a gang leader) and also protecting the scientists who are trying to find out what these mysterious powers both the Espers and Tetsuo are. His character gets more fleshed out at the ending of the film, but he's not a bad character by any means beforehand.\
Lastly, Kei. Honestly, she's the love interest. Yes, as it is a film of this high a quality, she's done really well, but that's all she is. 9.\
To sum it up, I really cannot put it in better words than this:- A real, proper rival to the Ghibli films. There IS quite a few gory moments, but please don't let that deter you, or you'll miss out on a smashing film. 9.\

    It's a classic. If you can overlook the two main characters screaming at each other constantly it's a one of a kind experience. The story is about two members of a biker gang. Through a chain of events one of them gets psychic abilities, and proceeds to have a mental breakdown at everyone else's expense. The story and character development in this series are very well done. I was actually empathetic towards the characters, and the bizarre art that accompanied the story during the use of mind powers amplified this. Defiantly worth watching if you haven't already.\

    Akira, one of the most influencial animated films in history, released in 1988 it opened the doors for mature japanese animation in north america and is still remembered by many as one of the best anime of all time.\
The film is a two hour adaptation of a 2000 page manga, So the first viewing of this film might be a bit disorienting due to its lightining quick pacing and short amount of time to introduce side characters and sub-plot elements.\

    Akira is highly acclaimed, a lot due to its great animation effort, and the manga popularity also seems to have helped.\
Indeed it is a quite positive effort from Katsuhiro Otomo. Regarding the hype though, I do not find it all that spectacular, nor do I get the feeling that I am watching something all that unique. \
It is a blend of sci-fi concepts in a dystopic setting, with a major plot that builds up well to a chaotic but interesting finale. However, if you go down to the detail, the characters don't stand out all that much, their adventures and action parts are a bit\
          \
        vulgar, and even the main plot does take some wild turns that sometimes feel forced.\
Nevertheless, it has influenced lots of forthcoming series, the psychism and energy field thing are definite highlights here. \
This is a film to watch, to some extent important and unique. Just take the care not to expect too much of it as I did.\

    I have heard so many good things about this movie, even to the point where it was you weren't a true anime fan if you haven't seen this movie! So I watched it recently and I have to say, the animation is really up to its name. One of the best I have ever seen animation wise. Overall the movie was just OK for me though. The visuals is what really made the movie for me. I found the story kind of confusing and really needed to pay full attention while watching it. It was very different and it was a taste of something I\

        haven't seen done before, which is nice. I think this movie is worth a watch- it shows the wonders of animation to the fullest and the dub cast was excellent.

    Note: This is a spoiler-free review\
Like many other Gen-X anime fans, this movie cemented what good anime was supposed to be to someone in an emerging market.\
This movie is greatness; Neo-dystopian realistic post-war setting, plenty of action, science fiction plot and story mystique, inner workings of urban life, the street life of motorcycle gangs, topped with smart and intelligent dialog; American audiences were starved for smart anime having grown out of the after-school fair of Robotech - ignorant and unaware of the sagas like Macross it had chopped and spliced - because it was thought audiences wouldn't get it.  Akira proved that wrong. \
          \
\
From the explosive action-packed first frames to the ending metaphysical denouement this film set the standard for thought-provoking science fiction anime long before 1995's Evangelion.\
The film has aged exceptionally well; the animation holds up, the sound is great, the dialog is still smart and the themes mature and relevant to people today as it was in the Cold War era.. all while being more accessible to most audiences than many anime that followed it.\
This is a must-see film; not just for the sake of anime film history, but because its still as entertaining now as it was when it first hit theaters.\

    I did not understand that at all... I can't say it was good and I can't say it was bad... \
Disclaimer: before anyone attempts to say my age has anything to do with me not liking this, I remember when this movie dropped on VHS almost rented it at blockbusters choose to get Gall Force; Enternal Story glad I did, had I even watched it then I would have had this same empty feeling I have now. Only probably a lot more so and instead of continuing on to like a lot of anime would have probably been completely turned off to it.\
I like the\

        main character, the graphics where good, the mutations where interesting, the music was strange in a good way, the story left much to be desired, nothing was ever actually fully explained but enough was there to see the potential unfortunately it felt like the addition of that potential was more of an after though to the action. \
I have a couple of friends who like to write stories and whenever they run out of idea's they randomly insert a random \"then the world ended\" or \"suddenly the apocalypse happened.\" I could have sworn this was done by one of those friends, LOL. I kept waiting for stuff to be explained as it held my interest slightly had me curious what was going on, and then the world just ended and nothing was explained... I even typically find the best movies or tv shows are the ones that keep you guessing or questioning, even if nothing is explained at the end it gives this unsettled feeling but keeps ya interested with questions all the way through. This was hardly like that and honestly just felt shallow the entire time. Didn't have enough bad qualities to be bad, and didnt have enough qualities to be good. Just shallow...\

         While I myself did not particularly enjoy the movie as much as I would have others, I would still like to take the time it was done into consideration - I imagine that this movie was quite different for when it was released (and is still quite noticeably different). I found some of the characters lacking in their development throughout the movie, however, I did find myself wondering who the main character was truly: Tetsuo or Kaneda. Given the theme of the movie, I do give this good merit. All in all, while I personally did not have a great\

After she's discovered that she isn't a member of The Great Tokyo Empire, she's denied food and later on recruited by Tetsuo's aide with three other girls to serve as Tetsuo's playmates. \

 Tetsuo gives each of the girls the government-issued drug, and mistaking it for a medicine, Kaori instead saves it for her sick father; which ends up saving her from sharing the fate of the others girls whom end up being killed by the strong effect of the drug.\

 Her caring and innocent nature earns her Tetsuo's trust and genuine affection, and she becomes the person to whom he turns for comfort, especially whenever he suffers the strain of the power evolving within him. After Tetsuo begins to mutate and he no longer able to control his powers, his aides plan to assassinate him; hearing of that Kaori takes off to warn him, but gets shot by them.\
 \
 When Tetsuo finds her dying body, he enters a battle with the American army, then with Kaneda. Later on he attempts to revive her, but fails. He then carries her dead body to Akira's cryogenic chamber and she was last seen by Kei when she takes cover inside it after Tetsuo's body goes through another mutation. \

In order to prevent any further destruction, he is captured and taken into custody, never to be heard from again. Now, in the year 2019, a restored version of the city known as Neo-Tokyo‚Äîan area rife with gang violence and terrorism against the current government‚Äîstands in its place. Here, Shoutarou Kaneda leads \"the Capsules,\" a group of misfits known for riding large, custom motorcycles and being in constant conflict with their rivals \"the Clowns.\" During one of these battles, Shoutarou's best friend Tetsuo Shima is caught up in an accident with an esper who finds himself in the streets of Tokyo after escaping confinement from a government institution. Through this encounter, Tetsuo begins to develop his own mysterious abilities, as the government seeks to quarantine this latest psychic in a desperate attempt to prevent him from unleashing the destructive power that could once again bring the city to its knees.
