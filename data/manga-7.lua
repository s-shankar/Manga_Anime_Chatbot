    What can I say about Hajime No Ippo other then it's a great story that gives otaku everywhere some self confidence to be strong.\
The story consists of one Makanouchi Ippo, a social outcast who is picked on because he is passive, poor and smells bad because of his family fishing shop. One day Ippo is being bullied out in the open and a man jogging by scares off the kids. Ippo asks the man to teach him how to be strong and thus begins Ippo's run of determination.\
The theme of this manga is \"What is it like to be strong?\" and pure determination and hard\
          \
        work. It has very good character development showing every last spec of emotion that all the characters feel at every moment, as well as epic fights (although I do admit the fights wouldn't be like that if they were real) \
There is a good bulk of training in this series and it takes up a good chunk of the series but is more then made up for when the fights roll around. And you know what? I don't mind all mind that much because that's what boxers do. Train, fight, train, fight. Very good insight on what a boxers day to day life is like.\
The comedy in this manga is great. Usually in manga when there is filler people dread, but Hajime no Ippo delivers the most hilarious filler I have ever seen in my days.\
All in all Hajime no Ippo is a great long running story with a mangaka that has as much stamina as his protagonist when it comes to writing. (And I'm not sure about all of you but Hajime no Ippo has motivated me to start working out more and become more  active)\

Overall: 9\
The reason for the submission of this review is that I thoroughly enjoy the series (so much so that I read 870 chapters in 2 weeks, whilst going to school), and that the other half caps review is trash.\
First off, the premise of the story is very similar to any other shounen manga, Eyeshield 21, Naruto, etc. I could go on. However, it is unique in the fact that boxing is a blend of both the action and the sports genres - leading to none of that ridiculous superpower crap, yet not sounding completely unrealistic and solely created to\
          \
        maintain interest I might add, when a new ability or move is created.\
In the first few hundred chapters the story progression is relatively quick, with Ippo advancing through the Pro Test, the Rookie Tournament, Japanese Rankings, and finally the Boxing Championship. \
However, past this point it is simple title matches - that is not to say the enjoyment is greatly diminished. I still enjoy it to this day, definitely one of the higher rankers of shounen manga.\
The art is pretty archaic, not so much so that it is downright unattractive; but, it still maintains that aged feel of classic manga. Although it has somewhat progressed throughout its publishing the overall feel is still there. I personally don't mind it, but to say I prefer it to the the standard of modern art styles would be incorrect. Although, the actions scenes are brilliantly illustrated, utilizing in full huge swishes of wind and the like.\
Character design is, again, good, but nothing amazing. \
Characters, the part where this manga truly shines - Takamura is undoubtedly the most popular character; his antics make him a very likable chap. However, he is not simple comic relief. He carries an aura of idolization, with all boxers in Kamogawa Gym, save Ippo's eventual kouhai - looking up to him. This admiration is not unwarranted, Takamura's record is superhuman and he is an absolute beast in the ring.\
Ippo, somewhat standard fare, the young, na√≠ve boy unhappy with his current life experiences a contextual epiphany and suddenly desires to become 'stronger'. However, Ippo is unique in that he does not start off as a complete wimp, containing power equivalent to those several weight classes above him. \
The rest of the support characters are sufficiently likable, one may find themselves sympathizing with Aoki and Kimura's plight, being overtaken by their kouhai and never being able to retrieve the Champion belt. \
I also found the Itagaki puns hilarious.\
Enjoyment was very high, the fights keep ones testosterone at its peak, at least with what a manga can achieve at any rate. The training is amusing, the large amounts of manliness, guts, effort flying around is enough to get one's posterior on the edge of their seat.\
Overall, Hajime no Ippo is one of my favourite mangas to date, and a shining example of a good shounen sport manga.\

    Since the author realized that he's going to make this run as long as he lives (or as long as there's interest) it has become a formulaic, and repetitive story. It basically runs like this:\
-Training\
-Fights\
-End fight filler\
-Rinse and repeat... FOREVER!\
Of course there are good fights with the occasional serious Takamura title match. However, there are too many filler fights (Ippo title defense and Kamogawa gym underling matches) to keep things interesting during volume 50+. With how things are going, this manga will stretch forever.\
It is likable though since I have lasted up to v60 and still going but I have found myself scanning the post\
          \
        and pre-fight fillers as well as the filler matches in hopes to get to the more important matches. This basically sums up how HNI is going.\
Unless the author keeps things interesting, I will simply skim through the repetitive and formulaic discussions/fights and go through the important matches.\

    Ever thought of reading a good sports manga which combines quality and quantity? You need something to feel and dive into? Then Hajime no Ippo is the best manga for you. \
It may be that you discovered the Ippo anime and are not sure whether to start reading the manga or not because of the huge amount of chapters (1000+). Well, it's definitely worth the time. But let's review this manga as if you had no knowledge of it. \
Story:\
The story begins rather simple, a boy named Makunouchi Ippo is getting bullied and to grow stronger, he starts with boxing under the very strict trainer\
          \
        Kamogawa Genji, an old but very experienced man. \
There he meets his idol and competitor Miyata Ichiro who becomes Ippo's motivation to train harder and harder. \
Sounds rather simple and you might think it'd get repetitive after over 1000 chapters, but it doesn't. The story shifts from character to character in the Kamogawa Gym and even from former challengers which become part of the ongoing story. \
Where the story shines is that it combines multiple genres and subplots into one huge ongoing storyline. You have extremely hilarious comedy (most times about genitals, stupidity and later puns), dead-serious boxing matches with immense tension, drama, slice of life (combined with comedy or things to think about, so no boring stuff) and some love life, most characters are adults after all. Build-up and pacing are very well handled, you don't even notice little time skips. \
Everything is connected to each other so you often see friends/former challengers appearing in the story even after their fight with the main cast either for plot or comedy purposes. So it's no \"enemy appears-loses-next enemy suddenly appears\" pattern, it's dealt with great story telling, build-up and characterization skills. The crazy thing is that you never know who wins which is an ongoing phrase in the story (\"you never know what can happen in boxing\"). It's not rare in this show to cheer for the \"enemy\", because they're do well written. \
Art:\
Now, you have to consider that this manga started it's serialization in '89, so don't expect too much in the first hundred chapters.\
I have to admit, when I first encountered this show, I didn't like the art at all, but that was because I was used to the generic shonen art style which doesn't need time to adapt to. \
This art is really great. You have wonderful double pages of either the park with the sky where Ippo & co. are always jogging or epic boxing matches with perfectly drawn shadows and motions; even the faces of the crowd have emotions drawn into them. You can tell from this description alone that this is drawn with a lot of passion and love. Character designs and overall world building are rather retro but it is really cool and fitting. I couldn't imagine Ippo with flat screens and smartphones. \
What makes \"Ippo\" a relaxing read is also the pattern of the panels. It stays retro by having strict panel borders, not like most new manga where you have to find out what's actually drawn there with characters out of their already screwed up panels. So the art looks simple but is drawn with lots of love for detail. Even after 25 years of serialization it never disappoints to stay fresh. \
Character:\
\"Ippo\"'s characters are so unique in their respective way. No fight is random because we get introduction and characterization of new challengers to an extent that you sympathize with their determination to win which ends in very dramatic and breath-taking matches. \
Spirit is a key point in every character in \"Ippo\", there are fights when someone even being unconscious keeps on fighting for his goal which speaks for the character's determination. \
Some early beaten characters appear later on in the story where we get to see how their boxing career unfolds which often crosses with other former introduced characters. The characters' growth is immense as you could expect from this long running sports manga. \
Enjoyment:\
It really never gets boring. Between the serious fights you have light-hearted, inspirational or funny moments and even detours from boxing like cooking or baseball matches - always ending in a hilarious way or benefiting to further events. Even our beloved Ippo has a really funny and cute \"love\" which is often held back by a certain someone or other occurrences, but always really funny and cute. You will even cheer for Ippo to be as strong minded and confident with women as he is in the boxing ring, haha. When you're into a long exciting match you will have read 30 chapters before you even noticed. The pacing slows down remarkably during fights to thoroughly explore the way the competitors are fighting which really is necessary and a good point. \
You get to learn a lot about real life boxing when some real boxing strategies or punches are being introduced which is also a huge plus. It never ceases to amaze me how well the mangaka George Morikawa combines boxing punches or strategies with each character's personality. \
Overall this manga is recommendable for everyone open to read a longer project and not searching for one-shots to add to their finished manga list. You don't even need to like boxing or sports, this manga is so thrilling, inspirational and funny. Most people I know who saw the anime (yes, they're too lazy to read the manga, but I'm working on that) got the extreme urge to work out or start jogging because this manga portrays how hard work pays off over and over again. \
Don't feel scared because of the huge number of chapters, see it as a blessing that you don't have to wait weekly for one chapter but instead read as much as you want for the first weeks or months until you caught up. :-) \

    So this Manga starts off absolutely Amazing and is thoroughly incredible throughout about 900 or so chapters.  EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS ABSOLUTE TRASH PLS DON'T READ IT I AM DOING YOU THE GREATEST FAVOR. This manga is as bad if not worse than the way Fairy Tail went out towards the end and i do not make that statement lightly. Essentially what i mean by this is the whole entire last arc is the worst thing to ever grace the medium that is manga. Ippo our MC goes on a large training montage and road to redemption which is all great and dandy but\
          \
        after that man......after that i can't even say without raging. Its bad guys, real bad. Like so bad i feel like my best friend of 18 years stabbed me in the back and stole my wife from me (if i knew what that was like i imagine it'd be the same feeling as this). Just dont read this after around Chapter 900 or you might break your laptop in anger and disappointment as so many other people have. Specifically chapters 1199-1202. Skip those or risk my voice in the back of your head saying \"I told you so\". Unfortunately this is just a Manga that went through the all too classic downfall of having gone on for too many chapters and eventually lost everything that made it so great from the start. After all 1200+ chapters is quite a lot and this was almost to be expected but just the way this manga falls apart is heartbreaking. \

    For a long time I succesfully avoided reading Hajime no Ippo, allthough knowing, that it is one of the longest running current mangas and widely regarded as a great sports manga. However after exhausting my backlog of mangas to read, I finally started it and read all 1000+ chapters in under two weeks. That alone should tell you, that I enjoyed Ippo.\
I won't get into detail about the story, there are probably more than enough ressources to read about this. Basically it's about Ippo, a weak and shy boy, who gets bullied a lot. Through chance he meets the rising boxing star Takamura and joins\
          \
        the Kamogawa gym. He then starts his journey through the ranks of the boxing world in a quest to find out, what it's like to be truly strong.\
After a while most of the time the manga follows a pretty strict formula. First a boxing match is announced and/or a new enemy is announced, then follows training and pre match strategy meetings, followed by the fight, followed by some \"filler\" like chapters that depict the every day life of the Kamogawa boxers in a generally humorous way.\
While the story is mostly predictable, it is presented well enough to be interesting and continuing reading. The true strength of Hajime no Ippo lies in it's characters. While Ippo himself is a pretty one dimensional character, he is still likeable, and it's easy to identify with his struggles to find the self confidence needed in the ring. His gym mates are genuinely fun and interesting.  Just for an example, there is Takamura, whose monstrous strength and eccentric behaviour makes him not only the star of the gym but also the center of most of the mangas humour, which you could either call archaic or classic. Either way it is funny.\
Most of the time the opponent of Ippo are rather well written characters with their own motivation and a lot of them reappear either as recurring enemies or as new found friends or rivals. More than once I found myself conflicted who I wanted to win in a fight, Ippo or his opponent, which really shows, how much you can relate to these characters.\
The only weak point within the casts are the opponents of Ippos gym mates. They are often just there to provide a match, but rarely get much of a backstory. While I can understand that most of the panels should focus on Ippo and his matches, a few more fleshed out fights for Aoki or Kimura would have been nice.\
Then lets focus on the art for now, which is probably one of the most polarizing parts of the manga. You really see, that this manga is from a different era. Even with the slight variations in the style that the manga went through, it style can again be described as either archaic or classic. For fans of old school mangas this might be a plus point, but for me it wasn‚Äôt. I found the art to be functional but the character design is not my thing. Even more so I think a lot of the characters look bland, and more often than it‚Äôs tolerable I had problems remembering who a recurring character was just based on his face. \
That doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt good parts in the art however. The fights are exceptionally well done, the perspective used and the generous use of speed lines really makes certain scenes stand out. Especially whenever powerful moves are used, a turning point in a match occurs or the manga shows a knockout scene, you can really feel the impact of the attacks through the art alone.\
\
Hajime no Ippo is definitely a good manga. While it might not have reached the expectations I had for its long running record, it is a good read and even non sport fans will probably enjoy the characters and their struggles. If you can cope with the archaic art style or even like it more than the current ones, you should try it out. If you start it you‚Äôll have something to read for quite a while.\

    There are battle mangas, and there are sports mangas. Hajime no Ippo falls in the latter category. Boxing isnt fighting, its a sport. Two sportsmen getting in a ring for a regulated professional athletic match. For that reason, with only one or two real exceptions, there are no antagonistic evil boxers. The story starts off following Makunochi Ippo, a young bullied boy who, after meeting a pro boxer, is inspired to become one himself. with a style reminiscent to Mike Tyson (without Ear Biting), we see Ippo climb the ranks of the featherweights. At a certain point, the story becomes less about Ippo (though he\
          \
        is the primary focus) and become an ensemble, as the mangaka George Morikawa said \"Everyone in Hajime no Ippo is a main character.\" Additionally, it isnt solely about the sport. One of the biggest reasons why Hajime no Ippo has been as long running as it has is because of its humor and character development, both of which are to be praised. due to the fact that this is manga, the matches are obviously slower than what they really should be, considering a round lasts 3 minutes. This actually serves as an advantage for a number of reasons. The blows and patterns are shown in greater detail to be easier to understand, and we can see the thoughts of the boxers and their seconds as they strategize. These two things serve a very important purpose. The amount of strategy and mental planning show that boxing isnt simply two guys punching each other, but is a sport that requires a lot of strategy, instinct and intelligence. One of the most prominent things to mention is fighting spirit. Yes, one of the most common and overused tropes in shonen manga is in here too. And not only does it work, it fits absolutely perfectly and is a major symbolic theme in the series. Such masterful use of the fighting spirit trope is amazing and is on par with that of Gurren Lagann. Analysis of the series and a couple rereads would show that the series actually shows the cultural symbolism of fighting spirit and the origins of the trope. In fact, it is possible to interpret the series as being somewhat metaphorical of Japan's conflict between its traditional culture and the post-war westernization. I wont explain more, i dont want to spoil anything else, so I'll just conclude with this being a masterpiece.\

    I have been following this series for about 13 years now and found it when I was a little girl. I'm a sucker for the whole \"never give up\" motto and this story is ALL about getting back up again after you've been kicked to rock bottom. Would recommend it to people who love motivational sports manga's, character building/ growth, and who enjoy in-the-moment suspense. \
The intended important characters in this story are all carefully and continually being developed by the author, although the main character has been lagging slightly in his character growth. This does not take away from the enjoyment of the series.\
This\

        has been one of the only stories that I have religiously followed for so long because it motivates me to keep trying my hardest and to not shy away from taking chances! Hajime no Ippo really leaves a positive lasting impression which is why it is one of my top favorites if not my #1. \

    Disclaimer: I watched the anime first, then picked up the manga where it left off. They aren't very different at all though. I fully recommend the anime as well.\
This manga is an amazing feel good story about a bullied boy named Makunouchi Ippo who joins a boxing gym after being saved from a brutal beating by a strong boxer named Takamura Mamuro. The story then mostly follows Ippo and Takamura through increasingly difficult tests in their pro boxing careers. \
The cast is not limited to only these two, in fact there are many other important rivals, and three other gym mates that all have expansive\
          \
        and very realistic motivations for what they do. In fact there are at least two fights in the story where I actually rooted AGAINST Ippo because his opponent was either way cooler, or had much more at stake. \
If you like action, read Ippo\
If you like realistic love storys, read Ippo\
If you like amazingly fleshed out characters, Ippo is for you.\
Even if you think boxing is a boring sport, i can wholeheartedly recommend you this manga, as it has a certain spark that you don't see too often these days ",

-Hajime no Ippo, an anime / manga well known for its great story, its charismatic characters and ...... Just Kidding, now I start the manga review.\
\
Story:5/10 (1-268) 3/10 (269-???)\
The story begins with a world conveniently armed at the convenience of the protagonist, parents with a tragic past, enters boxing in a way NOTHING casually (\"casually knew a boxer at a convenient time) and wants to box because he saw a video (an excuse to get him to box without complicating too much).Besides this,the plot does not have much more, just wants to know\
          \
        that it is strong, through boxing (In addition to being an excuse, the protagonist is already strong), This could be passable until the 268th chapter, would have ended up as your typical history of action and self-improvement, but not the author extended it (to earn more money), But no, it has lengthened, this would not be a big problem if the character changed or showed the relationships between the characters (which happens in a limited way) Is exactly the same, the character trains fight, wins and from time to time interact between them, for a mangan of 100 chapters or 200, but for one of more than 1000? no thanks.\
Characters:5/10\
The protagonist is a gary stu, kind, energetic, kind, without fail and besides that his family has a very convenient tragic past.One reason why Ashita no Joe works so well is because the characters change, progress and evolve,In addition to not only training and boxing, the characters feel human,change their way of thinking while here in +1100 chapters does not change ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, although now seems to change a bit, I doubt it is a big change Of trancendence for the manga,   The villains follow the same pattern, they appear reckless, and then they present them as tragic (with the exception of one or two), in the end fatigues is continued pattern, The secondary ones are the best for much of the manga, a more adequate past and with a greater motivation than \"knowing that it is being strong\" and each time the series is presented, it improves even if they only give it small bows every so often.\
\
PS: The relationship between ippo and kumi is one of the least credible I have ever seen.\
Art:10/10\
Every action series that wants to succeed has to have a great quality of drawing, and this is not an exception, although at first it is a dirty drawing, it ends up improving at an incredible level, the best point of the manga for a lot, nothing negative I have to say.\
Enjoyment:5/10\
Although at the beginning I was surprised, at the end of the chapter 300 to 400 begins to decline and from before half of the manga is already boring, predictable and others.\
Overall:4/10\
I do not recommend it, there are many better action sleeves, but if for some reason you get to read the manga you should not see much beyond the 300 or 400 chapter since the rest is more of the same, repetitive, boring and static.\

-Hajime no Ippo,un manga bastante conocido por su gran historia sus personajes carism√°ticos y.....era broma,ahora empieza la rese√±a del Manga.\
\
Historia: 5/10 (del cap√≠tulo 1 al 268) 3/10 (desde el cap√≠tulo 269 en adelante)\
La historia comienza con un un universo construido a conveniencia del protagonista,familiares con un tr√°gico pasado,entra al mundo del boxeo de una manera NADA casual (conoce a un famoso boxeador en un momento conveniente)  y quiere boxear porque vio un video (una mera excusa para meterlo al mundo del boxeo sin complicarse demasiado) adem√°s de esto quiere saber que es ser fuerte a trav√©s del boxeo (adem√°s de que es una excusa,el prota ya es fuerte desde el comienzo).\
Esto podr√≠a ser pasable hasta el capitulo 268,habr√≠a terminado como tu t√≠pica historia de acci√≥n y autosuperaci√≥n,pero no,el autor lo alargo sin motivo alguno (para hacer mas dinero) esto no seria tan grave si los personajes evolucionaran o cambiase algo,pero no,es como ver un v√≠deo en bucle y el mejor ejemplo es el Mashiba vs Kimura,cuando parece que algo va a cambiar vuelve a su status quo,esto no seria tan grave para un manga de 100,200 o 300 cap√≠tulos,¬øpero mas de mil?no gracias.\
Personajes:5/10\
El protagonista es un Gary Stu,amable,en√©rgico,altruista,sin fallos y adem√°s de eso su familia tiene un pasado tr√°gico (nada conveniente)\
Uno de los motivos por los que ashita no joe funciona tan bien es porque hay una verdadera interacci√≥n ente los personajes que afecta mucho a la trama,adem√°s que no solo es entrenar y boxear,los personajes se sienten humanos mientas que aqu√≠ se sienten de cart√≥n osea (planos y blandos)adem√°s de que en +1100 cap√≠tulos no cab√≠a nada,aunque ahora parece que vaya a cambiar algo no lo har√°,seguir√° manteniendo su estatus quo.Los rivales siguen un arquetipo,aparecen temibles y luego te los cambia con su pasado tr√°gico (a excepci√≥n de uno o dos) y al cabo del tiempo fatiga esto.Los secundarios son lo mejor del manga,su pasado y justificaciones son mas adecuadas que las de el prota y cada vez que aparecen el manga mejora aunque solo le den un arco cada cierto tiempo.\
Arte:10/10\
Si quieres hacer un manga de acci√≥n de √©xito tienes que hacer unos dibujos de calidad y Hajime no es la excepci√≥n, si bien al inicio del manga tiene un trazado algo sucio,con el paso de el tiempo mejor much√≠simo hasta un punto incomparable con la mayor parte de mangas de acci√≥n,la verdad es que en este apartado no tengo quejas.\
Disfrute:5/10\
Si bien al principio me gusto,sobre el capitulo 400 ya empieza a aburrir y ya antes de la mitas es los mismo,ver peleas que no cab√≠an nada con un patr√≥n repetido y dem√°s.\
En General: 4/10\
Hay muchos animes de acci√≥n mejores,pero si un d√≠a te da un ataque de inspiraci√≥n y por alg√∫n motivo te lo quieres leer no deber√≠as mas all√° del capitulo 268 o como mucho mas all√° de su pelea contra Sawamura ya que mas all√° de all√≠ no hay nada mas destacable y es una completa perdida de tiempo.\

    When first looking at this series the sheer length might be ta turn off, which I can understand, but if you choose to give this a shot I guarantee that you will enjoy this adrenaline packed ride. This was the series that first got me into reading sports manga. I judge the quality of a sports manga on if it can make me interested in a sport that I previously did not care about before. Hajime no Ippo does this extremely well.\
The story arcs are formulaic, but it works. I equate it to watching a good Rocky movie, over and over again without it getting\
          \
        boring. This series has a lot of comedy and a bunch of hilarious moments as well.\
The art in the beginning is a little off, but later on it becomes more polished and detailed.\
If you like sports manga this is a must read, the time investment is great, but it will be well worth it. \

 Aoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.\

 In a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.\
 \
 Aoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for \"ugly\" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.\
 \
 For the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.\

 \
 The most recent addition to the roster, the charming Manabu has a prodigy's talent and was the captain of his high school's boxing team. Cheerful and a lover of bad puns, Manabu is a fierce outboxer with extremely high speed and reflexes and whose fighting style is uncanny in its resemblance to Miyata's. His most powerful technique is a furious hail of mid-power blows known as the Hedgehog or Porcupine, which was employed in an East Japan Rookie Kings showdown with his longtime nemesis, Kyosuke Imai. Outside of boxing, Manabu is employed as an assistant at the Makounouchi family's fishing business. Itagaki's character is based on former world champion Oscar de La Hoya for his prodigy-like natural ability and good looks, whom Itagaki has admitted to idolizing in the manga. \
 \
 He is a Featherweight out boxer renowned for his speed and genius boxing talent. His trainer is Shinoda Tomoyuki. He, along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Kimura Tatsuya, round out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym.\
 \
 Itagaki originally tried out and prevailed at many sports, but when he tried boxing he came across Imai Kyousuke and was defeated by him 3 times. In order to defeat him no matter what, he skipped college and instead joined the Kamogawa Boxing Gym, where his idol, Ippo, trained.\
 \
 After Umezawa Masahiko retired from the Makunouchi Fishing Boat in order to pursue his own dreams, Itagaki took over his job and started receving the same kind of work training that Ippo goes through. He achieved revenge on Makino Fumito, who had defeated him in his debut match with a foul, in the opening round of the East Japan Rookie Kings. At the finals, after a tough fight with Imai, Itagaki captured the East Japan Rookie King title and seemingly tapped into his true fighting potential; his speed, reflexes and timing are now said to be at genius levels.\
 \
 With Ippo relinquishing his title to take on the world, a rematch with number 2 ranking and long time rival Imai was scheduled to decide the new JBC featherweight champion. Although it was a title match, because Itagaki had conquered his goal in the Class A tournament to beat Ippo's KO times against Saeki and Karasawa, as well as because he had defeated Imai before, he went into the match extremely overconfident. With a dazzling strategy, Kyousuke trapped Itagaki in the corner and wore him out with various body blows, eventually KOing Itagaki in the first round. Afterward, Itagaki acted like a good sportsman, but in truth he was disappointed in himself for letting down Ippo and dropping Date's baton.\

 \
 Kamogawa Genji is a deuteragonist in Hajime no Ippo. His influence on the story rivals those of Takamura Mamoru's and Miyata Ichirou's; all three inspire Makunouchi Ippo to continue boxing.\
 \
 Kamogawa is the head coach of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym and is close friends with Nekota Ginpachi and Hama Dankichi. As a coach he is strict and holds high expectations for his trainees but is also shown to genuinely care for the well-being of his fighters (albeit in a more silenced, aloof way), forging a strong bond with each and every one of them through trust and spirit. He possesses an extremely sharp sense for boxing and a large wealth of knowledge in regards to boxing, able to give strategies to his fighters that often cause turnabouts in matches. He is shown throughout the series to be most proud of his two most prominent boxers: Takamura Mamoru and Makunouchi Ippo.\
 \
 He is a retired boxer who founded the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He acts as the trainer of both Ippo and Takamura,as well as a cornerman for the boxers under Shinoda Tomoyuki.\
 \
 Kamogawa worked as a prizefighter in Japan shortly after the end of the Second World War. He has exchanged blows with former prizefighter Nekota Ginpachi multiple times. He was also friends with fellow prizefighter and future trainer Hama Dankichi. During the American occupation of Japan, Kamogawa harboured strong feelings of national pride, refusing to accept food handouts.\
 \
 Sometime later, Kamogawa opened his own boxing gym, where he trained the future manager of the gym Yagi-chan, the then-OPBF Featherweight champion Miyata-san, and the budding counter specialist Miyata Ichirou. By chance, he encountered Takamura Mamoru and convinced him to enter the world of boxing under his tutorship. Takamura then scouted Aoki Masaru, Kimura Tatsuya, and Makunouchi Ippo to the gym.\
 \
 Though he chose not to train Itagaki Manabu, he is present in his matches as a cornerman. He is equally as surprised at Itagaki's speed and boxing skills as he is at the talents of his own trainees. \

 \
 Ippo's senpai and Aoki's best friend. He is the smooth, collected type and a romantic at heart, but trains as hard as anyone. His style incorporates a fast left and faster footwork. In the past, he and Aoki were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Tatsuya's real job is at his family's flower shop. He is a junior lightweight boxer. Along with Makunouchi Ippo, Takamura Mamoru, Aoki Masaru, and Itagaki Manabu, he rounds out the core members of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. His main fights in the series are against Mashiba Ryou and Eleki Battery.\
 \
 Kimura and Aoki Masaru were best friends since kindergarten. In high school they began brawling and causing trouble with students from rival schools, namely North High, which eventually led to their expulsion. Kimura was the most affected by this because he was worried he had disappointed his mother. One day the pair attacked North High's Takamura Mamoru and lost miserably. Seeing Takamura's strength as a boxer, they decided to join the Kamogawa Boxing Gym to try and become strong too.\
 \
 Kimura became a delincuent beacuse he was bullied by an older boy, and when his father went to confront the boy's father, he was pressured and ended up apologizing, this made Kimura lose all respect for his father, becoming more violent in both his house and in the outside, and decided to quit highschool without his parents knowing.\
 \
 Like Aoki, his boxing ability is also downplayed for much of the series (albeit not quite as badly). Despite this, he has proven to be a good boxer with solid all-around ability. Miyata stated that as a boxer, Kimura had no weaknesses (despite also not having any strengths) and Miyata's father said that although he was only ranked third before his fight with Mashiba, his talent surpassed that ranking. Mashiba himself admitted that Kimura was his strongest challenger. He shows strength around the level of a national champion, as he was able to draw with Eleki Battery twice and only barely lost to Mashiba.\
 \
 As fast outboxer, Kimura is often asked to be a sparring partner for as Makunouchi and one time for Miyata, though Kimura benefited more from Miyata's sparring.\
 \
 After losing to Ryo Mashiba, he announced his retirement from boxing.Shortly after, unable to stay away from boxing, he returned saying he would spell his name in katakana („Çø„ÉÑ„É§) instead of kanji (ÈÅî‰πü).\
 \
 Kimura's main role in the story is that of a supporting character, but upon his and Aoki's second entry into the Class A Tournament, they became directly antagonized by Iga Shinobu and his trainer, Baron Kurita. They are now both aiming to settle their grudge with the duo.\

 \
 Ippo Makunouchi is the main protagonist of the series. He lives with his mother, Hiroko Makunouchi, and helps with the family charter boat fishing business. Ippo is a classic power in-boxer and is well known for his Peek-a-Boo style of boxing and hard punches which include three signature punches: a rib-cracking liver blow, Gazelle punch (an uppercut variant), and the Dempsey roll technique. His signature punches appear to be modelled after Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson and Jack Dempsey respectively.\
 \
 Ippo is bullied throughout most of his school life. After being rescued by Takamura, he ends up being brought to Kamogawa Gym, where he displays an explosive punching power. After seeing a video of Mike Tyson, he becomes inspired to take up boxing to feel reborn with strength. He soon proves himself to Takamura and Kamogawa, and starts on the path to being a pro boxer.\
 \
 His Pro-Debut Match was against Oda Yusuke, He was largely regarded as a lazy and unmotivated boxer, but when his girlfriend threatened to break up with him, he committed himself to training. From the first time the boxers met, there was tension between them, as a misunderstanding led Oda to believe Ippo made fun of him. On the actual fight, Ippo seemed to have the advantage from the beginning of the match, but was saved by his coach from losing the fight due to a cut. Ippo managed a comeback by knocking Oda out with a series of jabs, thus winning the fight.\

Ippo also had his personal goal in the tournament to fight with Miyata in the Pro Ring for their tie-breaker match. With this promise in mind Ippo aims to reach the East Japan finals.\
 \
 First Round: Jason Ozuma Ozuma is a black officer from America who was stationed in Japan, and the only black boxer Ippo has faced so far. Jason is a very polite and kind man who cares greatly for his gym and friends. His most revered attacks, his devastating Hooks, are comparable to Takamura's in terms of speed. Ippo had to enter an in fight to win the first round. Ippo took major hits, but managed to turn the match around by pressuring Ozuma with his power. After an intense round, Ippo managed to take advantage of Ozuma's wide swing and his delayed punch, due to a broken rib, to deliver a second down and win the match.\
 \
 Second Round: Kobashi Kenta Kobashi Kenta is a boxer that depends on winning with points. Ippo is annoyed by Kobashi's technique, which is to clinch often; eventually Kobashi's strategy, to rob Ippo of his stamina, takes effect. However, in the final round (the 4th round), Kobashi punches Ippo with a counter and becomes excited at the prospect of landing a KO on Ippo. Even though his second disapproved, his desire to gain a KO victory lead him to fight head-on, but Ippo took his chance the instant Kobashi stepped outside the pure, no-risk outboxing and KO'ed him.\
 \
 Semi-final Round: Hayami Ryuuichi A pretty boy boxer who held the title of Inter High Champion with his fast barrage of punches called the Shotgun and Ippo's first opponent as an out boxer. Hayami looked down upon Ippo, and dismissed him since he felt Ippo was an unworthy opponent. Hayami's strategy uses a short uppercut against dashing infighters and finishes them with his Shotgun. Ippo, however, manages to counter him by using a cross hook counter against his short uppercut, and sees through the storm of punches. Having finally mastered bobbing and weaving at the training camp, he was able to avoid and get close to Hayami. Ippo finished the fight with a rush followed by an uppercut to win the fight in 1 round moving to the finals.\
 \
 East Japan Final Round: Mashiba Ryou Ippo's final opponent in the East Japan Rookie King tournament defeated Miyata with a controversial foul and seemed poised to take the Rookie King Title. Ippo met Mashiba at his pro license exam, and has since been afraid of his dark demeanor throughout most of the series (albeit comically), but after witnessing Mashiba's foul, Ippo goes into the match determined to win. Initially, Mashiba's flicker jabs exploited Ippo's short reach by keeping him at bay, but Ippo eventually slipped in, broke Mashiba's elbow (at the expense of his right hand), and slugged it out with him. Ippo gave Mashiba his first and only legitimate black star in the form of a heavy and painful K.O victory.\

He received therapy from Doctor Yamaguchi which allowed him to fight with a proper hand. The match was an intense slug-fight which ended abruptly before the fourth round when Sendou turned out to be unconscious in his corner, despite still sitting upright looking ready to continue.\

Ippo was left with no current goal to motivate him. Rehabilitating his hand injured from his previous fight, Ippo breaks from training and starts supporting his fellow boxers at Kamogawa Gym in their fights. He then meets the current National Feather Weight Champion Date Eiji, who hints that in the future they may face each other since Ippo is already ranked number 10 upon winning the Rookie King Tournament. Ippo realizes that he wants to fight the Champion and trains for his new challenge. And he proceeds to do this by entering an A class tournemant and defeating Okita Keigo,  Saeki Takuma and  Alexander Volg Zangief.   Date Eiji After earning his right to challenge Date Eiji, one of Japan's most revered boxers, Ippo went into the match bringing everything he had learned in his past 10 matches with him. For the first few rounds he succeeded in pushing the champion to his limits. However, when Eiji began using the high-level Neck Spin to negate most of the power behind Ippo's punches, Ippo becomes disoriented. Eiji gradually returns to his style of fighting from his younger days. He delivers a powerful Heart Break Shot that stuns Ippo, then prepares to deliver the finishing blow. But the referee stops the match because Kamogawa had already thrown in the towel. Victory goes to  Date Eiji. Thanks to this match, Date regains his confidence in challenging the world champion, Ricardo Martinez. He relinquishes his belt, leaving Sendou Takeshi and Alexander Volg Zangief to fight for it. Sendou wins by a controversial decision and becomes the new Japanese Featherweight champion. Ponchai Chuwatana A Thai fighter ranked 3rd in Thailand who faces Ippo following his 5 month break against Date Eiji. Ponchai had a very well-built physique and a strong determination to win in his boxing matches.in the second round, Ippo starts to land small punches while swaying left and right, before speeding up and finishing Ponchai off with his new finishing move, the \"Dempsey Roll.\"After this match, Sendou, the new featherweight champion, challenged Ippo to a match personally. Sendou Takeshi The continuation of the unfinished match between the hard punchers of East and West. Ippo and Sendou had been looking forward to a match since the All Japan Rookie Championship was unfinished in their minds. To prepare for the match they both strengthened their weaknesses through new training methods, Sendou improving his lower body and Ippo his upper body.\
 \
 This match is considered to be one of the most intense since both fighters had roughly the same amount of punching power resulting in numerous slug fests and a footstomp from the audience that shook the hall. Ippo originally had problems since he had a smaller body, meaning he had a little bit less muscle and was going to lose unless he started to connect more punches than Sendou did. But with encouragement from his friends and remembering his training he managed to continue his match against Sendou. The match turned into a mix up, where both fighters drew out the others' potential and helped each other grow stronger. With one final showdown between their signature finishers, Ippo managed to pull through and finish Sendou off by inventing a combo of his 3 strongest techniques to take the belt and title. Sendou then personally congratulated Ippo.\
 After obtaining the National Japanese Feather Weight Belt from Sendou, Ippo defended the title successfully for eight consecutive times.\
 After yet another canceled fight with Ichiro Miyata, Ippo lost his drive and thought of retiring from boxing. However with the help of Iimura Mari and the words of his friends and previous opponent, he was able to find his true goal which is to become strong and went back to Kamogawa Gym to continue Boxing. Kamogawa then tells Ippo to aim for the World, but having them cut off the shortest route of getting to the top rankings by beating the OPBF Champ Miyata, Kamogawa tells Ippo that he will take a different path, which is to defeat all of the OPBF National Champions, obtaining their WBC rankings and becoming an unofficial OPBF Champion.\

His first match as a world contender is against Alfredo Gonzales, the 2nd ranked Featherweight in the WBA and 3rd ranked Featherweight in the WBC.  in the 7th round, the boxers enter yet another exchange which Ippo wins, but as he goes for the finishing blow, Alfredo lands a powerful right counter and sends Ippo to the canvas, where he lays motionless. Kamogawa runs into the ring to help Ippo and the referee declares a TKO.\
 \
 As of this fight, Alfredo is the second person to knock Ippo unconscious.\

 Trainer: Kamogawa Genji\
 \
 He is a multi-weight class (currently middleweight) hybrid boxer affiliated with the Kamogawa Boxing Gym. He is the current unified WBC and WBA Middleweight champion and strongest known character in the series.\
 \
 Takamura is very hearty, rude and often behaves vulgarly. He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.\
 \
 Takamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.\
 \
 As the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.\
 \
 He is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.\
 \
 Takamura's one weakness is his arrogance and temper, as he is able to be easily provoked by many of his opponents, he also has in two occasions felt the compulsive need to finish his fights with 1-Hit KOs (Due to Miyata getting too much attention, and Ippo scoring a 1-Hit KO), which led to him almost losing against opponents a lot weaker than him.\
 \
 Like Miyata, Takamura is constantly struggling with weight control, so he is prone to losing stamina slightly quicker due to fighting in weight-classes below his natural weight. Aside from that the only times Takamura has been in trouble is when an opponent reads his attacks, but he just keeps trying until he finds a way to connect.\
 \
 In both his matches with Eagle and Bison, Takamura's right eye (or at least his field of vision on his right side) played a key role in his opponents gaining the upper hand. This suggests he may have a detached retina in his right eye, though this is not confirmed by the manga.\
 The character for Taka (È∑π) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his boxing belts. His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark.\

Years ago, he lost his World Title Match to the champion, Ricardo Martinez, who was defending his title for the 2nd time. He was knocked out in the 2nd round, and among other injuries, got a scar on the bridge of his then-fractured nose. \
 Date gave up boxing after that in order to settle down with his wife Aiko (a woman from a rich family who sacrificed a lot to be with him, and who just had a miscarriage at that time) and raise a family. But Date was a born boxer&mdash;he found he could not contain his combative nature for long, and after Aiko told him that she wanted their son Yuuji to see his dad fight, he picked his career back up to the top. Date is strong in every way, but his greatest weapon is the Heartbreak Shot, a corkscrew blow to the heart that immobilizes the opponent. \
 \
 He is the first boxer to have defeated Ippo in the ring, making Kamogawa throw the towel.\
 \
 After this fateful match, Date went after the WBA title&mdash;a rematch with Ricardo Martinez, who was making his 18th title defense&mdash;but lost by K.O. in the 10th round. The injuries he received in this fight included broken hands and a fractured jaw, and seriously limited Date's chances of making a return to the ring. He has, however, passed on his dream to Ippo. Currently, he trains other boxers at the Nakadai Gym. Morikawa Jouji stated in an interview that Date was modeled after former OPBF Champion Ozaki Fujio.\
 \
 At the time of his retirement, Date held a record of 23-2-0 with 17 KO's. He was the former OPBF Featherweight Champion as well as a two-time JBC Featherweight Champion and has twice been the #1 contender to Ricardo Martinez's WBA Featherweight Title.\

 He is an American boxer and the former WBC Middleweight Champion as well as Olympic gold medalist. He fought the Japanese KO king Takamura Mamoru for the Middleweight title.\
 \
 Eagle was an undefeated Olympic gold medalist prior to the start of his successful pro career. Barreling through a mere fifteen fights before reaching world champion level, Eagle is said to have never tasted defeat due to his dedication and tactical skillset.\
 \
 As opposed to fellow American (former) boxer Bryan Hawk, Eagle comes off as polite and easy-going, willing to overlook his schedule to answer a question from the Japanese press. He is disciplined and serious despite being undefeated, remaining modest and unpretentious of his boxing abilities. Against strong opponents Eagle shows a fiercely competitive, spirited, and strategically observant side, claiming he has never been able to show his true potential in any fight until his match against Takamura.\
 \
 David Eagle is easily one of the strongest characters in the series, evident from the fact that he brought Takamura Mamoru to the verge of defeat, being the second person to do so after his compatriot Bryan Hawk. David is an all around by the book boxer, using basic boxing techniques and strategies which are polished to the highest level. His most deadly \"weapon\" is a sharp, solid One-Two that Coach Kamogawa has even stated to be near perfection.\
 \
 Despite his hard work and determination, Eagle loses to Takamura after their lengthy match, remarking that Takamura's strength is phenomenal having experienced it himself. Regardless of his loss Eagle is viewed as an excellent sportsman and leaves with the favor of the Japanese.\
 \
 He was last seen in Las Vegas, watching the match between Alexander Volg Zangief and Mike Elliot.\

 Bryan Hawk is the former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion.\
 He played the main antagonist during New Challenger, in which he fought  Takamura Mamoru in his first WBC Junior Middleweight championship defense.\
 \
 Growing up in the slums of New York has given Bryan a 'survival of the fittest' view on the world around him. He is a natural street brawler and displays one of the more bloodthirsty antagonistic attitudes seen in the series. When in pinches, he displays an ecstatic love of violence and killing characterized by a sudden 'burning' in his body that can only be pacified with continued violence or sexual intercourse with women. Impulsive and judgemental, he enjoys provoking others and underestimating Japanese boxers.\
 \
 His long string of victories against boxers has given him a most arrogant and ignorant personality. During his WBC Junior Middleweight Championship press conference in Tokyo, Japan, he openly declared his willingness to give genes to Japanese women (whom he refers to as 'delicacies') in order for Japan to breed boxers strong enough to surpass him. He is notorious for his flippant attitude towards boxing and is known to barely train before matches.\
 \
 Shown to care only about women and the time he spends with them, Hawk has a group of female fans known as the Hawk Girls that cling to him during his visit to Japan. He intentionally draws a sparring match against a Japanese boxer longer so as to wait for his Hawk Girls to arrive, later leaving the boxer in a bloody mess after mere seconds upon realizing that his fans have arrived.\
 \
 Hawk is not seen after that until the match against Takamura. Gaining the upper hand in the preliminary rounds, Hawk is constantly surprised by Takamura's speed and precision. Due to his lack of knowledge on boxing basics, Hawk begins to lose against Takamura's boxing spirit and guts in the later rounds despite his 'ecstasy'. The fight ends with Hawk spewing blood and collapsing into the canvas, officially crowning Takamura the new WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. It is later mentioned that Hawk's fight with Takamura ended his career as a boxer. It is unknown where Hawk is now after retirement. Later in the David Eagle arc, Bryan Hawk can be seen in David's flashbacks as the one person David trained hard and even developed a strategy to defeat, first one being David's visiting Bryan Hawk's residence to find out why he lost to Takamura and second was during David's flashback where he was at a live match witnessing Bryan Hawk's rise to the top of the boxing world.\

 Ricardo Martinez is a semi-recurring character in Hajime no Ippo and the current WBA Featherweight Champion in the series. He is the main antagonist of the series.\
 \
 Ricardo seems to be quiet and taciturn, choosing not to speak unless directly spoken to. In media, he speaks with his trainer (Bill Stewart) before speaking to the press and is shown to be a confident, but at the same time analytical man.\
 \
 Famous for being a super champion (undefeated with many title defenses), it is said that even Mexicans who don't recognize their political leaders know Ricardo's name. He is also the boxer who gave Date Eiji his iconic scar.\
 \
 Ricardo Martinez is currently the only 'Super Champion' in the series. He has the longest title run in the series, with 21 defenses of his WBA Featherweight Title over a decade. He became WBA Featherweight Champion at the age of 21. His fame is so great, even those in Mexico who don't know the President's name knows his name. Ricardo's strength far exceeds that of the other known featherweights. His power is on par with Ippo's; his damage retention allowed him to take several heavy blows from Date without any lasting damage; his jabs are able to stop Ippo's Dempsey Roll and knock him unconscious on their own. For reasons unknown, he has always stayed in the WBA and never tried to become undisputed champ, leaving the massive number of World contenders avoiding him to scramble for the WBC belt. \
 \
 Ricardo Martinez is the most powerful featherweight in the world. His speed, power, stamina, and reflexes are described to be otherworldly. His jab is notable for having no shoulder movement, making it impossible to predict. It is implied during his world title match with Date Eiji that his punching power is on par with Ippo's.  In his spar against Ippo, he proved capable of knocking Ippo unconscious in less than one round when he was the JBC Champion with only one title defense, using only his left jab. He is even described by Takamura being \"out-of-this-world\" and on a totally different level, insinuating that his strength can't be measured because other boxers who challenged him have no idea of how strong he really is.\
 \
 fighting a rematch against Date Eiji once again for the WBA Featherweight title. It is during this match that Ricardo breaks Date's jaw, ribs, and subsequently his fist by performing an elbow block on Date's Heart Break Shot. Winning without a single prominent injury on his body, Ricardo once again defends his title. As of current events, Martinez holds a record of 68-0-0 (64 KO).\
 \
 George Morikawa listed Martinez as the second strongest character in the series (behind Takamura). Ricardo Martinez is based on Ricardo Lopez, one of the few boxers to retire undefeated.\

You hardly ever see the guy smile because he thinks  that he doesn't have the privilege to smile unless he wins a boxing match. \
 \
 He had worked his way up to almost the top of the featherweight Rookie King championship, until Ryo Mashiba beat him in a match. Miyata ended up in the hospital with a broken foot, as well as some other injuries.\
 \
 Miyata then left Japan to fill the gap between himself and Ippo. He now holds the OPBF Featherweight title and has defended it five times.\
 \
 Due to his promise with Ippo and his determination to prove his father's boxing to the world, Miyata restricts himself to the Featherweights and as a consequence suffers from severe weight control, which lowers his match stamina and strength while making him more susceptible to damage.\
 \
 He was supposed to fight Ippo as promised at that point, but due to a series of events that would come to be called fate, the match didn't happen. Miyata broke his fists in the fight preceding his match with Ippo and took three months off to recover. During that interval, Randy Boy Junior became the Interim Champion. Miyata then cancelled his match with Ippo, much to everyone's confusion.\

 Miyata himself shattered his jaw in the last round despite leading in the score cards, so he chose to retire despite having the chance to make a comeback.\
 \
 As a witness of his father's fall from grace, Ichiro decided to take on his style and become the best with it. Also during his reign as the champion of Japan, he defeated Sendo's trainer, Yanaoka.\

 Sanada Kazuki is a recurring character in Hajime no Ippo. He was the antagonist of the television special Champion Road.\
 \
 Sanada was the Junior Featherweight Champion before relinquishing the title to conquer another class. He is a boxer who relies on science to win his fights. In his title fight against Ippo he used science to calculate how many seconds he will be immobilized (even though Ippo's fighting spirit kept him going and proved his theory wrong). He can reduce his pulse rate between rounds which helps him to fight at his full potential again.\
 \
 He is known to be very close to Ippo as he didn't hesitate to help him when Ippo thought that Takamura had a detached retina.\
 \
 Being a former Japanese champion Sanada was a highly skilled boxer. His fighting style focuses on skill and strategy rather than overwhelming strength or speed. Sanada's boxing involves his knowledge of the human body to drive in major attacks at pinpoint precision to stop and breakdown his opponent from the inside rather than attacks to the body that do major external damage. His techniques allow him to drive in major attacks with even the slightest opening in an opponent guard. His understanding of anatomy also allows him to target the 4 vital organs of the body, which would lead to cyanosis.\

 Sawamura is a lonely, violent individual who had gone through a very painful childhood. As a child, his stepfather was an alcoholic who regularly physically abused Ryuuhei and his mother, and eventually the child Ryuuhei stabbed his stepfather with a knife in order to protect his mother. Soon afterwards, his mother places him in the care of the state while telling him she is looking for a job, when in reality, he is being abandoned by his mother as well (something that takes Ryuuhei 3 years to realize). His isolation and bitterness is only amplified when he is falsely condemned for killing doves that he had fed. His only friends are his old teacher from middle school and Sendou Takeshi, though he treats neither of them as such.\
 \
 Sawamura is a boxer and counter-punch user who is naturally talented, but likes to cause his opponents pain in the ring, which often disqualifies him. He was the former JBC Junior Lightweight Champion and has since retired from boxing. His main fights in the series are against Makunouchi Ippo and Mashiba Ryou.\
 \
 Mashiba challenges him to a title match because Sawamura had attacked his sister prior to the Ippo match. After he wins his fight against Mashiba (due to the fact that Mashiba was disqualified), he refuses to accept the belt, and instead rides away on his motorcycle. However, due to the massive head damage he suffered during the fight, he accidentally rides straight into oncoming traffic. His injuries are so bad that he is forced to retire from boxing forever.\

 Trainer: Yanaoka\
 \
 He is a Featherweight boxer from the Naniwa Kentou Boxing Gym and a former JBC Featherweight Champion. He played the main antagonist during the events of championship road, serving as the second Japanese champion Ippo faced for the title.\
 Sendou's father was a fireman who died while saving the life of a child. Like Ippo, Sendou looked up to his father greatly, and this loss inspired him to try to be as strong as his father.\
 \
 Sendo is an In Fighter with arm strength on par with Makunouchi Ippo. To date, he is the only boxer to face Ippo more than once in the pro ring and is his chief rival. Sendo is a featherweight and his most well known move is his powerful smash. He greatly admires boxer Rocky Marciano, to the extent that he will personally point out that he is not the same \"Rocky\" from the film of the same name. He is also a fan of Takamura Mamoru. \
 \
 He is first introduced watching a tape of Makunouchi Ippo's spectacular KO victory against Mashiba Ryou and, fired up by the tape, decides to go visit Tokyo for a match against Ippo. He leaves half-disappointed however when he learns of Ippo's broken fist, but declares hopefully to Ippo that he would be \"waiting for [him] in Osaka'\" when the time comes for their match, accidentally leaving a bag of souvenirs at the station upon his leave.\
 \
 Since young, Sendou was known to be rude and problematic, having lead his own delinquent gang in the streets. However, it is mentioned by his grandma that Sendou did so to protect innocent civilians from other delinquent gangs. He and his grandmother run a market place.\
 \
 Disheartened, Sendou does not put much effort into his training until a package arrives in the mail, along with a letter from Ippo stating that they may be able to have their match after all. Renewed by the prospective match Sendou quickly jumps back into intense training, waiting for the day of his match against Ippo.\
 \
 Despite all his training for the match, Sendou ultimately loses consciousness in his own corner before the start of the fourth round. However, both fighters agree that unless one collapses in the ring, the fight remains unfinished. The two fighters then anxiously wait for the day of their rematch.\
 \
 Sendou is seen again after Date Eiji's relinquishing of the JBC Featherweight belt. He wins a very close, and controversial, victory by decision against Volg Zangief to acquire the vacant title. His first title defense is against Saeki Takuma, whom he KO's with little difficulty. Afterwards, he is pitted against Shigeta Akira, whose provocations of his and Ippo's style of boxing led Sendou to beat Akira so ferociously that he contracted a fear of being punched (and presumably retired) thereafter. Sendou and Ippo then have their promised rematch for the belt. He once again loses, this time by way of knockout from his 'rival'.\
 Sendou has a semi-final match before Takamura's world title unification bout against Richard Bison. Because he brawled with Mashiba in the waiting room before the fight, he enters the ring with bruises on his face. He is up against a Mexican World ranker once again, Jose Nargo who is fairly strong as he is ranked 5th in the WBA, who is already called a champ. Also this time to defend his position of being ranked 4th in the WBA. Jose Nargo dominated Sendou for most of the match because of his experience with sparring Ricardo Martinez. After the 8th round, when Sendou saw Ricardo's Manager, Bill Stewart as his second, he then pushes Jose to the corner and using his knuckles started to press into Jose's stomach aggressively, causing extreme pain and giving Sendou the opportunity to knock Jose out. Sendou defends his ranking of being 4th in the WBA, and might proceed to a title match. After defeating Jose Nargo, he then speaks to Bill Stewart, telling him to give a warning to Alfredo Gonzalez, which shocks Bill as he expected the warning to be given to Ricardo. He then goes back to the room, to watch the match of Takamura with Mashiba. To this point they seem to be okay with each other and not fighting as they discuss how tough Richard Bison is, but they will continue after this match as they say with each other silently...\
 Sendo is modeled after the real-life \"Naniwa Rocky\", boxer turned actor Akai Hidekazu.\

      description = "The World Amateur Champion is a handsome boxer from Russia who excels at outboxing and taking points, but adopts a vicious infighting style when he moves to Japan (Ippo notices how depressed he looks after this happens). Raised by a single mother in a small town near to St. Petersburg, Volg originally takes up boxing in order to provide medical assistance for his seriously ill mom (who coincidentally looks a lot like Hiroko Makunouchi, but with longer and reddish hair), but after consecutive losses to both Ippo and Sendou, he is forced to leave the Otawa Gym and return to Russia, staying by his mother's side until her death. Besides his incredible outboxing technique, Volg's greatest weapon is a vertical combination called \"White Fang\" (a short, quick left uppercut, followed by an incredibly fast and powerful chopping right). Volg later returns to Japan to get his old boxing gloves from Ippo before he goes to America, and ends up helping Ippo train for his upcoming match against Sawamura Ryuhei. Later Volg went to America fighting at the world stage and, under the training of Dankichi Hama, became the 4th ranked IBF Jr. Lightweight fighter. His personality is very humble and polite, though he's a very good boxer, Volg admits that he doesn't really like boxing as it hurts other people (his coach even stated that his greatest weakness is his kindness that made him hold back in matches) but only does it so he can help his ill mother back home but finally comes to realize he has passion for boxing. There was also a running gag at the beginning, related to his rusty Japanese. When Ippo met Volg when he couldn't read kanji in the subway, and few minutes after their first conversation he got in trouble with other native Japanese people for the very same reason. \
 In chapter 1007, he becomes the World Champion of the IBF Jr. Lightweight\

  synopsis = "Makunouchi Ippo has been bullied his entire life. Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo‚Äôs classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo‚Äôs journey to the top of the boxing world begins. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
