Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo’s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo’s journey to the top of the boxing world begins. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=115,  ["text"]="              \n    What can I say about Hajime No Ippo other then it's a great story that gives otaku everywhere some self confidence to be strong.\nThe story consists of one Makanouchi Ippo, a social outcast who is picked on because he is passive, poor and smells bad because of his family fishing shop. One day Ippo is being bullied out in the open and a man jogging by scares off the kids. Ippo asks the man to teach him how to be strong and thus begins Ippo's run of determination.\nThe theme of this manga is \"What is it like to be strong?\" and pure determination and hard\n          \n        work. It has very good character development showing every last spec of emotion that all the characters feel at every moment, as well as epic fights (although I do admit the fights wouldn't be like that if they were real) \nThere is a good bulk of training in this series and it takes up a good chunk of the series but is more then made up for when the fights roll around. And you know what? I don't mind all mind that much because that's what boxers do. Train, fight, train, fight. Very good insight on what a boxers day to day life is like.\nThe comedy in this manga is great. Usually in manga when there is filler people dread, but Hajime no Ippo delivers the most hilarious filler I have ever seen in my days.\nAll in all Hajime no Ippo is a great long running story with a mangaka that has as much stamina as his protagonist when it comes to writing. (And I'm not sure about all of you but Hajime no Ippo has motivated me to start working out more and become more  active)\nOverall Rating\n10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=53,   ["text"]="           \n    Summary Scores\nStory: 9\nArt: 7\nCharacter: 10\nEnjoyment: 9\nOverall: 9\nThe reason for the submission of this review is that I thoroughly enjoy the series (so much so that I read 870 chapters in 2 weeks, whilst going to school), and that the other half caps review is trash.\nFirst off, the premise of the story is very similar to any other shounen manga, Eyeshield 21, Naruto, etc. I could go on. However, it is unique in the fact that boxing is a blend of both the action and the sports genres - leading to none of that ridiculous superpower crap, yet not sounding completely unrealistic and solely created to\n          \n        maintain interest I might add, when a new ability or move is created.\nIn the first few hundred chapters the story progression is relatively quick, with Ippo advancing through the Pro Test, the Rookie Tournament, Japanese Rankings, and finally the Boxing Championship. \nHowever, past this point it is simple title matches - that is not to say the enjoyment is greatly diminished. I still enjoy it to this day, definitely one of the higher rankers of shounen manga.\nThe art is pretty archaic, not so much so that it is downright unattractive; but, it still maintains that aged feel of classic manga. Although it has somewhat progressed throughout its publishing the overall feel is still there. I personally don't mind it, but to say I prefer it to the the standard of modern art styles would be incorrect. Although, the actions scenes are brilliantly illustrated, utilizing in full huge swishes of wind and the like.\nCharacter design is, again, good, but nothing amazing. \nCharacters, the part where this manga truly shines - Takamura is undoubtedly the most popular character; his antics make him a very likable chap. However, he is not simple comic relief. He carries an aura of idolization, with all boxers in Kamogawa Gym, save Ippo's eventual kouhai - looking up to him. This admiration is not unwarranted, Takamura's record is superhuman and he is an absolute beast in the ring.\nIppo, somewhat standard fare, the young, naíve boy unhappy with his current life experiences a contextual epiphany and suddenly desires to become 'stronger'. However, Ippo is unique in that he does not start off as a complete wimp, containing power equivalent to those several weight classes above him. \nThe rest of the support characters are sufficiently likable, one may find themselves sympathizing with Aoki and Kimura's plight, being overtaken by their kouhai and never being able to retrieve the Champion belt. \nI also found the Itagaki puns hilarious.\nEnjoyment was very high, the fights keep ones testosterone at its peak, at least with what a manga can achieve at any rate. The training is amusing, the large amounts of manliness, guts, effort flying around is enough to get one's posterior on the edge of their seat.\nOverall, Hajime no Ippo is one of my favourite mangas to date, and a shining example of a good shounen sport manga.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="           \n    Since the author realized that he's going to make this run as long as he lives (or as long as there's interest) it has become a formulaic, and repetitive story. It basically runs like this:\n-Training\n-Fights\n-End fight filler\n-Rinse and repeat... FOREVER!\nOf course there are good fights with the occasional serious Takamura title match. However, there are too many filler fights (Ippo title defense and Kamogawa gym underling matches) to keep things interesting during volume 50+. With how things are going, this manga will stretch forever.\nIt is likable though since I have lasted up to v60 and still going but I have found myself scanning the post\n          \n        and pre-fight fillers as well as the filler matches in hopes to get to the more important matches. This basically sums up how HNI is going.\nUnless the author keeps things interesting, I will simply skim through the repetitive and formulaic discussions/fights and go through the important matches.\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=31,   ["text"]="               \n    Ever thought of reading a good sports manga which combines quality and quantity? You need something to feel and dive into? Then Hajime no Ippo is the best manga for you. \nIt may be that you discovered the Ippo anime and are not sure whether to start reading the manga or not because of the huge amount of chapters (1000+). Well, it's definitely worth the time. But let's review this manga as if you had no knowledge of it. \nStory:\nThe story begins rather simple, a boy named Makunouchi Ippo is getting bullied and to grow stronger, he starts with boxing under the very strict trainer\n          \n        Kamogawa Genji, an old but very experienced man. \nThere he meets his idol and competitor Miyata Ichiro who becomes Ippo's motivation to train harder and harder. \nSounds rather simple and you might think it'd get repetitive after over 1000 chapters, but it doesn't. The story shifts from character to character in the Kamogawa Gym and even from former challengers which become part of the ongoing story. \nWhere the story shines is that it combines multiple genres and subplots into one huge ongoing storyline. You have extremely hilarious comedy (most times about genitals, stupidity and later puns), dead-serious boxing matches with immense tension, drama, slice of life (combined with comedy or things to think about, so no boring stuff) and some love life, most characters are adults after all. Build-up and pacing are very well handled, you don't even notice little time skips. \nEverything is connected to each other so you often see friends/former challengers appearing in the story even after their fight with the main cast either for plot or comedy purposes. So it's no \"enemy appears-loses-next enemy suddenly appears\" pattern, it's dealt with great story telling, build-up and characterization skills. The crazy thing is that you never know who wins which is an ongoing phrase in the story (\"you never know what can happen in boxing\"). It's not rare in this show to cheer for the \"enemy\", because they're do well written. \nArt:\nNow, you have to consider that this manga started it's serialization in '89, so don't expect too much in the first hundred chapters.\nI have to admit, when I first encountered this show, I didn't like the art at all, but that was because I was used to the generic shonen art style which doesn't need time to adapt to. \nThis art is really great. You have wonderful double pages of either the park with the sky where Ippo & co. are always jogging or epic boxing matches with perfectly drawn shadows and motions; even the faces of the crowd have emotions drawn into them. You can tell from this description alone that this is drawn with a lot of passion and love. Character designs and overall world building are rather retro but it is really cool and fitting. I couldn't imagine Ippo with flat screens and smartphones. \nWhat makes \"Ippo\" a relaxing read is also the pattern of the panels. It stays retro by having strict panel borders, not like most new manga where you have to find out what's actually drawn there with characters out of their already screwed up panels. So the art looks simple but is drawn with lots of love for detail. Even after 25 years of serialization it never disappoints to stay fresh. \nCharacter:\n\"Ippo\"'s characters are so unique in their respective way. No fight is random because we get introduction and characterization of new challengers to an extent that you sympathize with their determination to win which ends in very dramatic and breath-taking matches. \nSpirit is a key point in every character in \"Ippo\", there are fights when someone even being unconscious keeps on fighting for his goal which speaks for the character's determination. \nSome early beaten characters appear later on in the story where we get to see how their boxing career unfolds which often crosses with other former introduced characters. The characters' growth is immense as you could expect from this long running sports manga. \nEnjoyment:\nIt really never gets boring. Between the serious fights you have light-hearted, inspirational or funny moments and even detours from boxing like cooking or baseball matches - always ending in a hilarious way or benefiting to further events. Even our beloved Ippo has a really funny and cute \"love\" which is often held back by a certain someone or other occurrences, but always really funny and cute. You will even cheer for Ippo to be as strong minded and confident with women as he is in the boxing ring, haha. When you're into a long exciting match you will have read 30 chapters before you even noticed. The pacing slows down remarkably during fights to thoroughly explore the way the competitors are fighting which really is necessary and a good point. \nYou get to learn a lot about real life boxing when some real boxing strategies or punches are being introduced which is also a huge plus. It never ceases to amaze me how well the mangaka George Morikawa combines boxing punches or strategies with each character's personality. \nOverall this manga is recommendable for everyone open to read a longer project and not searching for one-shots to add to their finished manga list. You don't even need to like boxing or sports, this manga is so thrilling, inspirational and funny. Most people I know who saw the anime (yes, they're too lazy to read the manga, but I'm working on that) got the extreme urge to work out or start jogging because this manga portrays how hard work pays off over and over again. \nDon't feel scared because of the huge number of chapters, see it as a blessing that you don't have to wait weekly for one chapter but instead read as much as you want for the first weeks or months until you caught up. :-) \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="          \n    So this Manga starts off absolutely Amazing and is thoroughly incredible throughout about 900 or so chapters.  EVERYTHING AFTER THAT IS ABSOLUTE TRASH PLS DON'T READ IT I AM DOING YOU THE GREATEST FAVOR. This manga is as bad if not worse than the way Fairy Tail went out towards the end and i do not make that statement lightly. Essentially what i mean by this is the whole entire last arc is the worst thing to ever grace the medium that is manga. Ippo our MC goes on a large training montage and road to redemption which is all great and dandy but\n          \n        after that man......after that i can't even say without raging. Its bad guys, real bad. Like so bad i feel like my best friend of 18 years stabbed me in the back and stole my wife from me (if i knew what that was like i imagine it'd be the same feeling as this). Just dont read this after around Chapter 900 or you might break your laptop in anger and disappointment as so many other people have. Specifically chapters 1199-1202. Skip those or risk my voice in the back of your head saying \"I told you so\". Unfortunately this is just a Manga that went through the all too classic downfall of having gone on for too many chapters and eventually lost everything that made it so great from the start. After all 1200+ chapters is quite a lot and this was almost to be expected but just the way this manga falls apart is heartbreaking. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="          \n    For a long time I succesfully avoided reading Hajime no Ippo, allthough knowing, that it is one of the longest running current mangas and widely regarded as a great sports manga. However after exhausting my backlog of mangas to read, I finally started it and read all 1000+ chapters in under two weeks. That alone should tell you, that I enjoyed Ippo.\nI won't get into detail about the story, there are probably more than enough ressources to read about this. Basically it's about Ippo, a weak and shy boy, who gets bullied a lot. Through chance he meets the rising boxing star Takamura and joins\n          \n        the Kamogawa gym. He then starts his journey through the ranks of the boxing world in a quest to find out, what it's like to be truly strong.\nAfter a while most of the time the manga follows a pretty strict formula. First a boxing match is announced and/or a new enemy is announced, then follows training and pre match strategy meetings, followed by the fight, followed by some \"filler\" like chapters that depict the every day life of the Kamogawa boxers in a generally humorous way.\nWhile the story is mostly predictable, it is presented well enough to be interesting and continuing reading. The true strength of Hajime no Ippo lies in it's characters. While Ippo himself is a pretty one dimensional character, he is still likeable, and it's easy to identify with his struggles to find the self confidence needed in the ring. His gym mates are genuinely fun and interesting.  Just for an example, there is Takamura, whose monstrous strength and eccentric behaviour makes him not only the star of the gym but also the center of most of the mangas humour, which you could either call archaic or classic. Either way it is funny.\nMost of the time the opponent of Ippo are rather well written characters with their own motivation and a lot of them reappear either as recurring enemies or as new found friends or rivals. More than once I found myself conflicted who I wanted to win in a fight, Ippo or his opponent, which really shows, how much you can relate to these characters.\nThe only weak point within the casts are the opponents of Ippos gym mates. They are often just there to provide a match, but rarely get much of a backstory. While I can understand that most of the panels should focus on Ippo and his matches, a few more fleshed out fights for Aoki or Kimura would have been nice.\nThen lets focus on the art for now, which is probably one of the most polarizing parts of the manga. You really see, that this manga is from a different era. Even with the slight variations in the style that the manga went through, it style can again be described as either archaic or classic. For fans of old school mangas this might be a plus point, but for me it wasn’t. I found the art to be functional but the character design is not my thing. Even more so I think a lot of the characters look bland, and more often than it’s tolerable I had problems remembering who a recurring character was just based on his face. \nThat doesn’t mean there aren’t good parts in the art however. The fights are exceptionally well done, the perspective used and the generous use of speed lines really makes certain scenes stand out. Especially whenever powerful moves are used, a turning point in a match occurs or the manga shows a knockout scene, you can really feel the impact of the attacks through the art alone.\n\nHajime no Ippo is definitely a good manga. While it might not have reached the expectations I had for its long running record, it is a good read and even non sport fans will probably enjoy the characters and their struggles. If you can cope with the archaic art style or even like it more than the current ones, you should try it out. If you start it you’ll have something to read for quite a while.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="               \n    There are battle mangas, and there are sports mangas. Hajime no Ippo falls in the latter category. Boxing isnt fighting, its a sport. Two sportsmen getting in a ring for a regulated professional athletic match. For that reason, with only one or two real exceptions, there are no antagonistic evil boxers. The story starts off following Makunochi Ippo, a young bullied boy who, after meeting a pro boxer, is inspired to become one himself. with a style reminiscent to Mike Tyson (without Ear Biting), we see Ippo climb the ranks of the featherweights. At a certain point, the story becomes less about Ippo (though he\n          \n        is the primary focus) and become an ensemble, as the mangaka George Morikawa said \"Everyone in Hajime no Ippo is a main character.\" Additionally, it isnt solely about the sport. One of the biggest reasons why Hajime no Ippo has been as long running as it has is because of its humor and character development, both of which are to be praised. due to the fact that this is manga, the matches are obviously slower than what they really should be, considering a round lasts 3 minutes. This actually serves as an advantage for a number of reasons. The blows and patterns are shown in greater detail to be easier to understand, and we can see the thoughts of the boxers and their seconds as they strategize. These two things serve a very important purpose. The amount of strategy and mental planning show that boxing isnt simply two guys punching each other, but is a sport that requires a lot of strategy, instinct and intelligence. One of the most prominent things to mention is fighting spirit. Yes, one of the most common and overused tropes in shonen manga is in here too. And not only does it work, it fits absolutely perfectly and is a major symbolic theme in the series. Such masterful use of the fighting spirit trope is amazing and is on par with that of Gurren Lagann. Analysis of the series and a couple rereads would show that the series actually shows the cultural symbolism of fighting spirit and the origins of the trope. In fact, it is possible to interpret the series as being somewhat metaphorical of Japan's conflict between its traditional culture and the post-war westernization. I wont explain more, i dont want to spoil anything else, so I'll just conclude with this being a masterpiece.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="               \n    I have been following this series for about 13 years now and found it when I was a little girl. I'm a sucker for the whole \"never give up\" motto and this story is ALL about getting back up again after you've been kicked to rock bottom. Would recommend it to people who love motivational sports manga's, character building/ growth, and who enjoy in-the-moment suspense. \nThe intended important characters in this story are all carefully and continually being developed by the author, although the main character has been lagging slightly in his character growth. This does not take away from the enjoyment of the series.\nThis\n          \n        has been one of the only stories that I have religiously followed for so long because it motivates me to keep trying my hardest and to not shy away from taking chances! Hajime no Ippo really leaves a positive lasting impression which is why it is one of my top favorites if not my #1. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="             \n    Disclaimer: I watched the anime first, then picked up the manga where it left off. They aren't very different at all though. I fully recommend the anime as well.\nThis manga is an amazing feel good story about a bullied boy named Makunouchi Ippo who joins a boxing gym after being saved from a brutal beating by a strong boxer named Takamura Mamuro. The story then mostly follows Ippo and Takamura through increasingly difficult tests in their pro boxing careers. \nThe cast is not limited to only these two, in fact there are many other important rivals, and three other gym mates that all have expansive\n          \n        and very realistic motivations for what they do. In fact there are at least two fights in the story where I actually rooted AGAINST Ippo because his opponent was either way cooler, or had much more at stake. \nIf you like action, read Ippo\nIf you like realistic love storys, read Ippo\nIf you like amazingly fleshed out characters, Ippo is for you.\nEven if you think boxing is a boring sport, i can wholeheartedly recommend you this manga, as it has a certain spark that you don't see too often these days "},

no thanks.\nCharacters:5/10\nThe protagonist is a gary stu, kind, energetic, kind, without fail and besides that his family has a very convenient tragic past.One reason why Ashita no Joe works so well is because the characters change, progress and evolve,In addition to not only training and boxing, the characters feel human,change their way of thinking while here in +1100 chapters does not change ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, although now seems to change a bit, I doubt it is a big change Of trancendence for the manga,   The villains follow the same pattern, they appear reckless, and then they present them as tragic (with the exception of one or two), in the end fatigues is continued pattern, The secondary ones are the best for much of the manga, a more adequate past and with a greater motivation than \"knowing that it is being strong\" and each time the series is presented, it improves even if they only give it small bows every so often.\n\nPS: The relationship between ippo and kumi is one of the least credible I have ever seen.\nArt:10/10\nEvery action series that wants to succeed has to have a great quality of drawing, and this is not an exception, although at first it is a dirty drawing, it ends up improving at an incredible level, the best point of the manga for a lot, nothing negative I have to say.\nEnjoyment:5/10\nAlthough at the beginning I was surprised, at the end of the chapter 300 to 400 begins to decline and from before half of the manga is already boring, predictable and others.\nOverall:4/10\nI do not recommend it, there are many better action sleeves, but if for some reason you get to read the manga you should not see much beyond the 300 or 400 chapter since the rest is more of the same, repetitive, boring and static.\nESPAÑOL\n-Hajime no Ippo,un manga bastante conocido por su gran historia sus personajes carismáticos y.....era broma,ahora empieza la reseña del Manga.\n\nHistoria: 5/10 (del capítulo 1 al 268) 3/10 (desde el capítulo 269 en adelante)\nLa historia comienza con un un universo construido a conveniencia del protagonista,familiares con un trágico pasado,entra al mundo del boxeo de una manera NADA casual (conoce a un famoso boxeador en un momento conveniente)  y quiere boxear porque vio un video (una mera excusa para meterlo al mundo del boxeo sin complicarse demasiado) además de esto quiere saber que es ser fuerte a través del boxeo (además de que es una excusa,el prota ya es fuerte desde el comienzo).\nEsto podría ser pasable hasta el capitulo 268,habría terminado como tu típica historia de acción y autosuperación,pero no,el autor lo alargo sin motivo alguno (para hacer mas dinero) esto no seria tan grave si los personajes evolucionaran o cambiase algo,pero no,es como ver un vídeo en bucle y el mejor ejemplo es el Mashiba vs Kimura,cuando parece que algo va a cambiar vuelve a su status quo,esto no seria tan grave para un manga de 100,200 o 300 capítulos,¿pero mas de mil?no gracias.\nPersonajes:5/10\nEl protagonista es un Gary Stu,amable,enérgico,altruista,sin fallos y además de eso su familia tiene un pasado trágico (nada conveniente)\nUno de los motivos por los que ashita no joe funciona tan bien es porque hay una verdadera interacción ente los personajes que afecta mucho a la trama,además que no solo es entrenar y boxear,los personajes se sienten humanos mientas que aquí se sienten de cartón osea (planos y blandos)además de que en +1100 capítulos no cabía nada,aunque ahora parece que vaya a cambiar algo no lo hará,seguirá manteniendo su estatus quo.Los rivales siguen un arquetipo,aparecen temibles y luego te los cambia con su pasado trágico (a excepción de uno o dos) y al cabo del tiempo fatiga esto.Los secundarios son lo mejor del manga,su pasado y justificaciones son mas adecuadas que las de el prota y cada vez que aparecen el manga mejora aunque solo le den un arco cada cierto tiempo.\nArte:10/10\nSi quieres hacer un manga de acción de éxito tienes que hacer unos dibujos de calidad y Hajime no es la excepción, si bien al inicio del manga tiene un trazado algo sucio,con el paso de el tiempo mejor muchísimo hasta un punto incomparable con la mayor parte de mangas de acción,la verdad es que en este apartado no tengo quejas.\nDisfrute:5/10\nSi bien al principio me gusto,sobre el capitulo 400 ya empieza a aburrir y ya antes de la mitas es los mismo,ver peleas que no cabían nada con un patrón repetido y demás.\nEn General: 4/10\nHay muchos animes de acción mejores,pero si un día te da un ataque de inspiración y por algún motivo te lo quieres leer no deberías mas allá del capitulo 268 o como mucho mas allá de su pelea contra Sawamura ya que mas allá de allí no hay nada mas destacable y es una completa perdida de tiempo.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="           \n    When first looking at this series the sheer length might be ta turn off, which I can understand, but if you choose to give this a shot I guarantee that you will enjoy this adrenaline packed ride. This was the series that first got me into reading sports manga. I judge the quality of a sports manga on if it can make me interested in a sport that I previously did not care about before. Hajime no Ippo does this extremely well.\nThe story arcs are formulaic, but it works. I equate it to watching a good Rocky movie, over and over again without it getting\n          \n        boring. This series has a lot of comedy and a bunch of hilarious moments as well.\nThe art in the beginning is a little off, but later on it becomes more polished and detailed.\nIf you like sports manga this is a must read, the time investment is great, but it will be well worth it. \n        "},
