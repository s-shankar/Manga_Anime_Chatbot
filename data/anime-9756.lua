Take a look at Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and you might find the answer to that question.\nI'll start this review by pointing out that I was not expecting much from this show. I didn't really want to watch it, either. The Mahou Shoujo genre has never interested me, so when a friend of mine, who in the past suggested things like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, Death Note and Psycho-Pass to me, told me to watch Madoka Magica, I thought he was kidding and I ignored the series for a while. Once a month had\n          \n        passed, my friend insisted, and I ended up watching the first episode with my sister.\nThrowing all my prejucide aside, I sat quietly and watched the first episode. I found it oddly entertaining, so I proceeded to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd. After the 3rd episode ended, I was completely hooked. And by the end of the 12th episode (or the last episode, if you prefer), I was blown away. Gen Urobuchi had done it again.\n[Story] \n	–  “Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl!”\nThe main character, Kaname Madoka, is a normal 8th grader. Albeit very shy, she is happy, and her family and friends love her exactly the way she is. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when, on a trip to the mall, she rescues Kyuubei, a cat-like being that was being chased by a mysterious black-haired girl. Kyuubei, as a reward, offers Madoka and Sayaka (one of Madoka's friends) a unique deal: he'd make any of their wishes come true, and in exchange,  they would become Magical Girls. And that is how Madoka, and the viewers, are introduced to a world of magic and witches.\nNot much else can be said about the story without spoiling anything. However, I have to point that this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, and it's target audience is NOT little girls. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a very dark anime, please keep that in mind.\nThe way the plot begins to unveil is simply magnificent. The build-up of tension, the plot twists, the drama, the (really heavy) psychological atmosphere-- all contribute to create a story that will keep you on your toes at all times.\n[Characters]\n	 – “If someone says it’s wrong to hope, I will tell them that they’re wrong every time. I could tell them that countless times!”\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has a pretty small cast of characters. Because of this, each relevant character grows and changes throughout the series in ways you wouldn't expect. We get to know a lot about the past of some characters, the reasons behind their actions, their feelings, amongst other things, and that makes each character feel unique-- they don't follow any usual patterns.\n[Art & Sound]\n 	 – \"Is she some kind of anime character or something?\"\nAs usual with Shaft (Bakemonogatari, Maria Holic, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Madoka Magica has a very original/weird style of animation. The design of the characters is rather simple and features very light colors. However, the animations are good and fluid, specially during action scenes (more on that in a bit). Buildings, on the other hand, are very futuristic and look pretty cool. The use of glass and fluid decorations makes me think of a very peaceful futuristic world. Nature, on the other hand, doesn't stick out of the norm, but the mixture of green + the futuristic monochromatic buildings is a very neat contrast.\nHowever, this wouldn't be one of Shaft's best works if they didn't add their “touch”.  When Kaname Madoka and her friends enter the realm of the witches, one of the coolest styles of animation I have seen in anime to this day steals the spotlight. It's very hard to explain, since it varies from witch to witch, but it's definitly intriguing. And of course, Shaft's signature: weird cam angles during dramatic scenes. Both of these add to the overall chaotic feel of the series, so I have to applaud their use.\nMadoka Magica's opening is “Connect”, by ClariS. Although it's nothing out of this world, I feel that it fits the “Mahou Shoujo” theme perfectly. The show has 4 different ending songs, but “Magia”, by Kalafina, is regarded as the “real” ending, since it plays in the most episodes, and denotes the dark nature of the anime. As for the background music, everything fits right into the scenes; whether it's to add intensity to fights or dramatic moments, the music helps and doesn't feel out of place.\n[Overall]\n	 – “With kindness comes naïveté. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.”\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has got to be the best anime I have ever watched. The way the producers trick the viewers into thinking that this anime is just another Mahou Shoujo is simply brilliant. The characters are interesting, the art managed to catch my attention, and the music is good, but this series' biggest selling point is definitly the plot. Plot twists, drama, heartbreaking AND heartwarming moments... all of these converge into a brilliant plot with a really good ending.\nPS: Do not judge a book by its cover!\n[Final score: 10/10]\n        "},

So when I first read about SHAFT's first original anime production entitled \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" I was a bit skeptical at first, seeing how I usually don't watched the genre but at the same time curious on how SHAFT and Shinbou Akiyuki will gonna make one with their very unique visual style that defines SHAFT animated works. After watching their previous magical and supernatural series like Bakemonogatari, Dance in The Vampire Bund, Negima, and Natsu no Arashi, I'm convinced that I should at least try the series. \nIt’s a magical\n          \n        girl series by definition that for quite some time I’ve been avoiding because frilly clothes and magic wands is not something a young adult should be watching or so I believe. But after completing it, I felt fortunate and privileged that I tried it, rarely is a series that can be considered a game-changer, at least in my viewing experience as it convinced me that the magical girl genre can still be enjoyed by young adults like me. The end result is that I’m willing to watch more of this kind of animated works from the past and future.  \nIt all begun with a strange dream followed by the introduction of the main character and the world she lives in. Then it was the usual setup in most anime, a new transfer student in the class that will call the attention of the main heroine, followed by a setup that will lead her to a world that she never dreamt existing – the world of magical girls and witches. The subsequent episodes will document the heroine’s journey meeting people, experiencing different events, journeying bizarre worlds, discovering the truth of the magical girl system and its purpose – all that will cultivate the one wish she will want granted.  \nThe story is introduced into the audience in a well planned and carefully executed series of events that will reveal important elements of the plot to move the story forward. Every time it is done, it leads the viewers in the edge of their sit as they ponder what exactly is going on. New characters are eventually introduced along the way, each has an important role; their back story examined and will have their very own moments in the series. The pacing is excellent, never a dull moment in here as each episode is packed with excitement and the right amount of details to keep the viewers looking forward the next episode. It doesn’t help that some episodes ended in a cliffhanger, which lead the viewers particularly me dying from wanting to watch the next episode immediately and hope that it is already the next week. The series ended with a satisfying conclusion; it feels complete but still leaves the viewers wanting for more.\nKnowing SHAFT’s notorious past regarding their animation works, in Madoka Magica there is a welcome change, no longer is the “NO-ANIMATION” as very evident in Bakemonogatari episode 10  will be seen in here, or the character only animation and simple colored background as seen in Hidamari Sketch. For this particular series, SHAFT has produced a world that is engaging with a futuristic approach in their architectural designs from the very spacious, technologically sophisticated, modern design of the main character’s house and the school where she study completely devoid of tight physical space. The background animation is superb, very detailed and probably rivals their other previous best background works in Bakemonogatari (provided there is an actual animation, not the random flashing wallpaper text thing). The color tones are dark and sometimes movie quality indicating how SHAFT probably gave everything they got to animate this one. \nThe modern architectural structures some of which are based on real life building designs used to create the cityscape of Mitakihara are very imaginative. The witch’s realm showcases a different kind of creativity in background designs, each realms are carefully designed to evoke emotions from the viewers. “Bizarre and surreal” are the proper terms in describing those otherworldly places which offers a hint of the witch’s past before being consumed by despair. \nAs for the characters, I like Aoki Ume’s “wide face” designs which gave the characters these “nice and cute” facial features, at the same time able to evoke such powerful expressions e.g. when the characters are sad, happy, annoyed, or worried, the wide face design allows the viewers to clearly see those expressions making it possible for them to relate and feel attached to the characters. The character designs used for the witches is a different matter, some look cute and very stylish (e.g. Witch Charlotte), some looked terrible and will give this unsettling feeling of being too real compare to its surroundings (e.g. Witch Gertrud), while some simply look too ugly and has a design that probably only a mother can love (e.g. Witch Oktavia von Seckendorff). \nThe transformation sequence are something to look forward also, Tomoe Mami’s transformation sequences are probably the most impressive transformation sequences I have seen to date, thanks mostly to the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies it. The transformation sequence from the other magical girls is all unique looking but not as equally impressive as the one above. The fight animation is also something worth mentioning about since the animators doesn’t cut corners on this one; the fighting scenes are very good and pleasing to the eyes. \nLastly, while I say a lot of very good things about the animation, it comes with minor flaws, one is about the character faces specifically the animation of the eyes appearing a bit off or distorted in distant camera shots and the animation in general is not very smooth for motion. There are also some production errors that are worth noting. Overall, despite the noticeable changes in the animation of Madoka Magica, the series still retains many characteristics that define the unique visual style done by SHAFT like the head tilts, close facial shots, and creative camera angles among others.\nMusic is one of the highlights of Madoka Magica. The OP theme “Connect” by ClariS is very catchy and pleasant to the ears, makes you want to become a magical girl and currently one of my favorite OPs. The ED theme “Magia” by Kalafina, meanwhile has this very eerie feel on it which is very good in expressing the dark undertones of the story. \nThe soundtracks created by the much famed “Kaijura Yuki” (which is also the behind the awesome soundtracks of Kara no Kyoukai, Gundam SEED/SEED Destiny, and Tsubasa Chronicle) confirmed that feelings I have, that when you listened to it, the music simply gets into you and all you can think about are magical girls, frilly costumes, and awesome transformation sequences. All the soundtracks are so memorable that I can immediately associate those to the events in the series where it is used as the background theme. My personal favorites in vol.1 and vol.2 are the “Sis Puella Magica!” (You Should Be a Magical Girl!) from the scene where Madoka finally said her wish, “Decretum” (Decision) Sayaka’s main theme, and “Credens Justitiam” (Believing in Justice) which is played during Mami’s transformation sequences. Equally impressive though are the soundtracks in vol.3 that are present in the final two episode of the series, the “Surgam Identidem” (I Shall Always Rise) during the battle of the hour, and the “Sagitta Luminis” (Arrow of Light) which can also be called the Goddess soundtrack, it is a very heartwarming theme created specifically for the events in the final episode. \nFeaturing the voices of Yuuki Aoi as the heroine Kaname Madoka, with Saitou Chiwa, Mizuhashi Kaori, Kitamura Eri, and Katou Emiri as support characters, the voices behind the characters in Madoka Magica is an all-star cast that made the overall viewing experience much fun just listening to everyone speaking. \nMadoka Magica has a small amount of characters, mostly girls that are very cute in my opinion. Kaname Madoka, the heroine of the series is very convincing as a female lead, her struggles that results from the events leading up to her finally saying her wish as well as the measures that she used to counter it are very well portrayed. The other main character that is really well portrayed is Akemi Homura, just like Madoka, her descent to what she have become up to the very end is very well told, her actions justified. Tomoe Mami’s appearance is short but has a very lasting appeal, I always remember her as the “What a Magical Girl should be”, her performance, confidence, and graceful movements especially in her fights are very elegant to watch. Then, there is Miki Sayaka, whose story is just sad to watch. The other main character that is introduce late in the series is Sakura Kyouko, initially I hate her character only seeing her as a jerk and a warmonger, but as the episode progress and her past eventually revealed, I believe her actions are justified and I eventually liked her character. Lastly amongst the main characters, I’ll talk about Kyuubey, as a familiar, he is like no other, his performance as the acting villain is really a very wild ride, his words are very evil at the same time not really evil, and his trickery into convincing the girls to make a contract with him makes you want to curse him and shot him with weapons till his body broke into smithereens deserves a high praise and probably an award for doing so. In the end, when all is said and done, especially when he explain the purpose of his existence, I eventually seen him in a good light.\nThe minor characters which represents the rest of the cast like Madoka’s parents, brother, teacher, as well as Sayaka’s love interest and rival also added very important contributions that leads to the development of the main characters. Worth noting is Madoka’s mother Kaname Junko, her conversations and closeness to Madoka as mother-and-daughter is very touching and very refreshing to watch. Also is Shizuki Hitomi, as she did an important role in the middle part of the story. The Witches, while having no real character, with the only hints given about them concerning their past is the design of their realm also added a different form of storytelling. \nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the most outstanding series I have seen in recent times. Rarely is a series that has its contents in the form of story, visuals, music, and characterization that are all equally impressive that results in me enjoying the series so much. Even more impressive is the fact that Madoka Magica is a “magical girl genre,” something I already avoided years ago thinking that there is nothing about the genre that will interest me anymore. After all, the notion about the genre is that it’s “too girly” and a “kid’s show”, this series proves that it is not, that it can touch audiences outside its main target audience. It also assures that the genre is something I will be looking forward with enthusiasm and eagerness. Appropriate also to say is that Madoka Magica is the kind of series that appears once every few years that really hit the right marks, the things that makes an anime very great. \nAs for my final note, I would recommend this series for viewers who like anime in general. Most recommended to individuals who like a magical girl theme anime that is geared towards the more mature young audiences as the series contains drama and dark themes that is not really very unusual to the genre, it’s just that the series used it correctly, and intricacies that could either make the viewers like or dislike the series.\nNote: Updated, added additional impressions after completing BD release\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=977,  ["text"]="\n                          \n    I am the juice of my acid.\nSHAFT is my body, and drugs are my blood.\nI have created over a thousand seizures.\nUnknown to DVD sales.\nNor known to stream on time.\nHave withstood food to create many anime.\nYet, those hands will never hold money.\nSo as I pray, “UNLIMITED SHAFT WORKS”\n-a rewrite inspired by those thousand freaking awesome muskets shooting at moustachioed dandelions during the end sequence of the first episode.\nYou have just stumbled upon the ultimate Mahou Shoujo, one that doesn't care if it's morally ambiguous or not, one with no stock footage, and one where the magic used substitutes candy for bloodbaths.\nStory: Magical Girl overtones combined with\n          \n        the trance-like aesthetics of SHAFT and the glorious character designs by a small green man who lives on top of an all-girls Japanese high schools dormitory (see Hidamari Sketch). The script is written by Urobuchi Gen, known for his work on Fate/Zero (hence the poem) and the highly-acclaimed (and crazy good) visual novel Saya no Uta. He's also noted for making me rub out to a pile of sludge. I really like Mr. Urobuchi.\nThe story is a dark Mahou Shoujo. Not like Nanoha at all. Nanoha had some seinen elements in it, but Madoka is a seinen. It takes all the elements of Mahou Shoujo, chucks them in the trash, and completely rewrites the genre. I should note that I have watched a fair amount of anime tagged Horror here on MAL, and not a single one has actually instilled fear in me like Madoka has. This is the only Mahou Shoujo I have come across that actually covers events like suicide, murder, and death in a serious manner and keeps them believable. There is a heavy amount of psychological elements in this anime, too, I should warn. In congruence, I want to laud how the characters mental states and characterization pushes the plot forward unlike many productions. The psychological aspect is so crucial to the story, that without it, the story would be nonexistent. \nA slight digression on becoming a magical girl: (minimal spoilers)\nEven after a couple of episodes Madoka does not become a Mahou Shoujo. I've heard a lot of complaints that \"she isn't even a magical girl yet, this is stupid\" etc. If you're part of this group, please enlighten yourself with this knowledge; Madoka takes a spin on many magical girl aspects. Thus, gaining magical powers, which usually occurs in the first or second episodes of most magical girl series is an event that is pushed farther off in Madoka. Don't get me wrong, the anime doesn't just do this to be nonconformist. Madoka utilizes the obtainment of power as a driving part of the story and character development. What Madoka factors into it's execution that other magical girl anime don't is the risk of death, and how gaining powers makes you even more susceptible to it. That is why I believe the anime didn't just give the girls powers very early in the series, and I hope this short blurb clears up this little misunderstanding.\nArt: SHAFT WAS HERE (insert every other company name here) IS A LOSER\nThe dreamscapes in this anime are stupendous and the frightening nightmarish worlds that appear are undeniably scary. The expansive frontier that the cast is thrown into really delivers the sense of isolation that I believe the staff wanted to present. As for the normal world, SHAFT works it's magic on the buildings and rooms - applying an almost futuristic setting while still within the boundaries of reason. The skyline shots and the pans over wide areas are notably beautiful and quite reminiscent of Ef - a tale of memories (another SHAFT work). There has been some complaint about the character designs, but I would say that they're used in this anime the same way Higurashi used theirs. With the lure of a peaceful and happy scenario, fleshed out with a goofy looking set of characters, the anime seems so innocent. That is until you watch a little of it. Don't create a predisposition on this anime by it's naive appearance, this is one scary anime.\nI would also like to praise the transformation scenes. They are never extensively erotic, as that aspect tends to be abused in anime such as Moetan or Nurse Witch Komugi, and they are always different. The second time a transformation scene happened I double took the scene and watched it again to make sure that my eyes weren't deceiving me (so I guess I ended up watching the animation twice anyways, but regardless). That's right, a magical girl transformation sequence that is different every time and isn't overused to consume air time.\nSound: The opening is like this fabulously intense orchestration that just makes you feel LARGE. The opening animation accompanying the sound definitely contributes to the song and I find it very fitting. One thing to note about the OP is that there's a larger portion of crying than there is of laughter, which should be hint enough to prepare you for an experience that doesn't want to make friends. The ending preformed by Kalafina (Kara no Kyoukai, Sora no Woto) is eargasmic. It has a brutal and rough distorted sound, and isn't full shown until the ending of the third episode. It's stark contrast with the opening really works. The animation set to the ending is a bit spooky if anything, and the hard angry vocals of Kalafina make it all the more intense. The sound track throws in some \"acid music\" (there's not a word for what SHAFT has done here) so just watch out for that music. Word on the street is that side effects include chronic arousal and aviator application. I can personally vouch though, that the soundtrack is varied and creative, and that it's hard to remove your sick shades for more than a few seconds while watching.\nCharacter: Madoka Kaname is the average personality-less protagonist who is best described (by herself) as \"kinda dumb\" and \"has no special skills.\" She leads an average life with a loving family. Her friends are a tomboy and aradere that at first prospect have no impressive qualities. Then Madoka learns about Mahou Shoujo who fight in secret to defend society. They fight entities called \"Witches\" that spread distress and anxiety. If you're expecting a happy-bubbly slice-of-life, you couldn't be anywhere further away from the mark. Mahou Shoujo Magica Madoka is a very dark anime. It quickly shifts from drinking tea to suicide's with unsettling skill. The characters are a whole lot more complex than the average Mahou Shoujo - where the characters often don't develop at all, within the first few episodes so much development occurs that you might be wondering if you're watching the same anime (and the development is presented incredibly believable). With Urobuchi Gen on staff mind shattering moments are abundant. Gen has even come out straight and said this is an anime that can be understood even better re-watched. The characters are a lot more in depth than you would expect from a Mahou Shoujo, and are surprisingly realistic. If you want moe~moe~ magical girls, then please refrain from watching Mahou Shoujo Magika Madoka, because Madoka deals a lot more with relationships and human issues than it does try to be cute and funny. Yoshinoya-Sensei also plays a cameo (but she's wearing a wig so watch carefully).\nEnjoyment: This is your brain on drugs. Cue Freezepop's song Brainpower.\nOverall: Madoka has an uncanny knack for going from quaint to disturbing incredibly fast. It also has the ability to BLOW YOUR MIND. So go watch it, okay?\nAfter the final episodes have aired, I can say with confidence, if you're willing to brave through the first three episodes that totter between \"cliche Magic Girl anime\" and \"mysteriously dark\" then you'll be pleasantly surprised that the latter is what you'll receive throughout. Madoka ranks with very few anime. It is one that start with a whimper and ends with a whimper, but is packed with bangs throughout.\n\nThe following are notes I added after each episode aired between January 7th, 2011 and April 22nd, 2011:\nPS: I WISH MY MOM GAVE HI FIVES LIKE MADOKAS DOES\nWHAT AN EXECUTIVE\nPS2: GIGA MUSKETTT BUREEAKKKKERRRRRRRR... and imma sip some tea now.\nPS3: Needs a hardware update.\nPS4: I cry out of fear watching this.\nPS5: fat chicks yum\nPS6: DON'T PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS LIKE THAT HOMG\nPS7: I can see Kyouko being all like \"GIMME ALL YO FOOD, OR I WILL EAT YOU\"\nPS8: Fried Kyubey on a Stick - A southern American delicacy\nPS9: I think I'm watching a Darren Aronofsky production\nPS10: I liked this episode because they explained Homura's hair.\nPS11: Battler would approve of this end\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=886,  ["text"]="                          \n    It's long been the case that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on certain genders and age groups, and this fact is most apparent when one considers the mahou shoujo category. From Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew to Pretty Cure and Shugo Chara, the titles on offer that feature the exploits of one or more magical girls all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, cute outfits, cute sidekicks, \"cute\" costume changes, twinkly/sparkly/sugary atmospheres, and a penchant for appealing to the sensibilities of 7 to 14 year old girls.\nThen there are the anomalous titles that deviate from the tried\n          \n        and tested approach as they attempt to broaden the horizons of the genre, the most successful example being Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha. The franchise gave audiences a chance to see Takamichi Nanoha grow from a very young and naive magical girl into the Ace of Aces for the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and combat instructor to the next generation of heroes. The surprising thing though, is that somewhere along the way the series managed to successfully bridge the shoujo-shounen divide, which is a difficult thing to do in a genre that's generally aimed at girls who still think bright (sometimes almost fluorescent), pink is a good colour to wear.\nUnfortunately there are only a few good titles on offer that have broken with the traditional mahou shoujo mould, which isn't surprising if one considers the difficulty of the task in question - take something for young girls and make it appeal to as broad a fan base as possible. Then again, Shaft seem to relish that sort of challenge, and while their take on magical girl anime retains a certain \"fluffiness\" that is prevalent in the more stereotypical shows, Puella Magi Madoka★Magica is an altogether different beast.\nThe story begins with a young girl looking for and exit with which she can escape a strange black and white checkered area, but instead of finding the outside world she finds that surreal destruction has come to Mitakihara City as a dark haired girl fights a very odd creature in the sky. A small white animal named Kyuubey advises her that she has the power to help the dark haired girl, to change this fate of grief and destruction, to be granted her heart's desire. All she has to do is make a contract and become a Puella Magi ...\nAnd then she wakes up.\nAfter the rather dramatic first few minutes the storyline takes on a fairly staid measure as the main plot is laid out and the characters are introduced, but while the narrative is relatively well constructed, it's not without its flaws. The series has a tendency towards melodrama that can sometimes slow the pace of events, and this brings into focus certain aspects of the plot which are very clearly designed to evoke a sympathetic reaction from the audience. In addition to this, while the rather obvious influence from Buddhism (the whole deal with maintaining balance, karma, etc), is prevalent for much of the show, the decision to broadcast the final episode on a specific date only serves to highlight the reference to Christian beliefs that forms the grand finale. That said, it's easy to overlook these as the main thrust of the storyline is entertaining , and much darker than one might initially expect, especially when one considers the character design and everyday scenery.\nOne thing that is interesting is the manner in which the writing team have tied in the importance of the third wish to the whole concept of resurrection (ask me if you want an explanation), which may sounds a bit strange at first but it actually works rather well, especially as the traditional \"deal with the devil\" scenario generally doesn't have any kind of achievable escape clause.\nUnfortunately there are two problems with the storyline, both of which aren't immediately obvious. The first is the assumption that only girls of a certain age are ideal for becoming Puella Magi, with all that entails. The justification for this is debatable, and brings up the whole idea that \"boys don't cry\". The storyline is built upon the concept that adolescent girls are more emotionally unstable than boys of that age, yet this is an untrue statement for two reasons, the first one being that boys are also undergoing physical and emotional changes. The second reason is that boys are taught from a very young age that they shouldn't cry or show certain emotions, and the continuous bottling up of all those feelings more often than not manifests itself during the adolescent years.\nThe simple fact is that a race as advanced and intelligent as the one in Madoka★Magica would have known this, and would have experimented with male Puella Magi as well, yet the story makes no reference to this. Quite the opposite in fact, and the explanation given states very clearly that all Puella Magi throughout history have been female.\nAnd before you ask, there are such things as male witches in the realm of the occult. They're called Warlocks.\nThe second flaw is the explanation given as to why Kaname Madoka has more potential than anyone else, which again makes a major, yet highly debatable assumption. The simple fact is that if one follows the idea to its rather logical conclusion, the most powerful Puella Magi should actually be Akemi Homura. It's a far more conceptual plot hole, but given the usage of the many worlds theory, especially at the end, it quickly becomes a major issue that could destroy the foundation of the story.\nSo it's a good thing the series is as entertaining as it is.\nNow given that this is an anime by Shaft one might well expect a degree of experimentation with the visuals, and the opening sequence gives viewers some very clear signs of things to come. The character design is very similar to that of Hidamari Sketch, and while this adds a degree of cuteness to the show, it also emphasises the stark difference between the Puella Magi and the witches, especially in terms of their humanity.\nThe experimental nature of the series is prevalent during the combat sequences, and Shaft really have gone to town in creating surreal, mind bending environments that serve as a home for the witches, and the arena in which the Puella Magi must fight. The mixture of animation techniques on display during these scenes is surprising, not only in terms of application but also in quality, which is why it's somewhat disappointing that there are occasions where entire frames have been left out of the animation during everyday events.\nThat said, Madoka★Magica is a good looking anime for the most part, even though much of the effort has been expended on crafting imaginatively unusual other world settings and surreal enemies for the girls to fight. Strangely, this may actually be purposeful as while the everyday environments are colourful yet mundane, like the character design these emphasise the difference between the real world and the one in which the Puella Magi must combat the witches.\nThe opening theme, Connect by ClariS, is a fairly uplifting J-pop song that's set against a surprisingly routine (for mahou shoujo anime), sequence, all of which belies the darkness of the story proper. Thankfully the ending theme, Magia by Kalafina, is more in keeping with the atmosphere of the anime, especially with the ephemeral approach to visuals. The series is also littered with a variety of background tracks that are generally appropriate in their usage, and one of the high points of Madoka★Magica is the quality of the audio choreography.\nAs for the acting, the cast is made up of experienced seiyuu who add depth and nuance to proceedings, for example Kato Emiri's role as the amorally enigmatic Kyuubey really is something to see, especially with her off hand explanations and her ability to make the character sound devoid of emotion. The rest of the cast also perform very well, except for one, but the issue isn't actually with her skills. Yuuki Aoi (Kaname Madoka), generally works well with the other seiyuu and delivers her lines with a decent amount of passion, but she's unable to express the true depth of emotion that the character feels because the script simply does not allow for it, which is a shame as it's a minor blemish on a very good performance.\nScripting issues aside, it's interesting to note that the series seems a bit lacking in core characterisation, especially as Madoka, Sayaka, and Mami have personalities that verge on the mundane. It's this averageness that makes the story that little bit more accessible to audiences, even though some rather fantastic back stories have been used to justify the actions of one character or another. Which brings up an interesting issue with the developmental process as rather than try for an intuitive approach, Shaft and Aniplex have applied the \"growth by numbers\" method. Each character is given the opportunity to adversely affect Madoka in some way, and the order in which this occurs is dependent on the relationship between the two. The problem is that this methodical approach is in clear conflict with the experimental nature of the series, and while it can easily be overlooked or forgiven due to the entertaining nature of the story, it's still not what one would expect from a studio like Shaft.\nNow I will admit that at first I was expecting nothing more than another cutesy mahou shoujo anime, so finding something that was more to my tastes was a bonus. That said, the series isn't without its flaws, but these can either be ignored outright or forgiven as the story is a very interesting and unusual take on what it means to be a magical girl.\nIt's just not as groundbreaking as some might believe.\nWhile Madoka★Magica may at first seem like a totally unique concept, it should be remembered that the Nanoha franchise possessed some dark themes, Black Rock Shooter featured a young girl's alter ego fighting strange creatures in a surreal other world, and Uta Kata tried to show the breakdown of a person who becomes controlled by their power. There are other shows that explore some of the themes of the series, sometimes in more detail, but in truth these are only minor niggles as Shaft have managed to create  a mahou shoujo anime that, like those that came before, successfully displays the true potential of the genre.\nWhich leaves only two questions. If Shaft wanted to experiment with the genre, then why not go the whole hog and have a mahou shounen? Why leave that sort of thing to comedy anime like Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka?\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=538,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Puella Magi Madoka☆Magica managed to do what I thought was impossible - took over the position of my favorite TV anime series from the first Suzumiya Haruhi series, while still airing. And my rating of was only rising with every subsequent episode.\nEven though the story starts like any typical magical girl anime, you can clearly see it is going to be different from the very beginning - it is the girls' choice, not fate, to go on the path of magic. Being a magical girl is rather a cold business deal rather than a divine blessing. And magic is not a perfect cure for everything\n          \n        - using it can cause a strong and hard-to-predict backlash. All that is there as early as in the first two episodes. And then episode 3 happens, and while trying not to spoil the story, I must say that all hope of this series being a normal magical girl show is lost since then. Beginning with episode 3, Madoka★Magica follows the Hitchcockian principles of storytelling - with every following episode there is some unpleasant surprise, we can't wait to see what happens next - oh, how convenient it will be for all those watching Madoka after the whole series' original airing...\nI can't really decide if I should call the story predictable or not. As you may know, the show has spawned an enormous amount of speculation and discussion on 2ch, 4chan and throughout the anime fandom in general. As the story went on, many of these speculations turned out to be true. When following the discussions on the Web, it's hard to tell if the story would be predictable to a lone viewer or not. But one thing is certain - Urobuchi and Shinbou managed to tell the story in such a way that even when you know what's going to happen, everything is still exciting and makes a huge emotional impact.\nAll of us fans were anticipating the finale, with much speculation about the ending going on. Since the actual last episode aired, opinion about the ending varies greatly between the fans - but my personal opinion is that the ending is as great as the whole show. Of course I won't go as far as to explain the ending, but what actually makes the ending good is its... well, I'd say ambiguity, but it's on a meta-level. There are ongoing discussions even whether the ending is ambiguous or not! It makes you think, interpret it your own way, and no thought is better than any other - but at the same time, it is not an open ending, the story is completely concluded. It is truly a sign of very good writing by Urobuchi Gen. It's often said that Madoka is the same to the magical girls genre what Evangelion was to the mecha genre years ago. And I won't be surprised if it'll end up becoming a cult classic of comparable caliber.\nThe story is heavily character-driven, with many events happening because of the characters revealing their feelings to each other. Even though many characters are quite clear from the beginning, nothing is certain, as the world - and other characters - constantly turn out to be different than we all thought. There is no white and black, characters are deep and believable, which is certainly one of the key factors of this show's enjoyability.\nThis show is quite unusual for Shaft, because it is very serious in atmosphere. There is not much comedy, and when there is, it's very subtle and natural in tone. This also means we won't be seeing Shaft's signature walls of flashing text and pushy creative typography (it's still there, though, in much less obtrusive form of runes). The art still manages to be very \"Shafty\" in tone, however. Slightly futuristic backgrounds, heavily inspired by recent architecture of the real world, look quite similar to what we've seen in Bakemonogatari - but are usually less symbolic and significantly more polished. The characters were designed by Aoki Ume of Hidamari Sketch fame, and bear significant resemblance to that series. Such bright and happy character designs may feel out of place for a series so dark in tone, but it's aiming for an effect much similar to what Higurashi did few years ago - and it actually works here, too. Unusual proportions of Aoki's drawings feel a bit strange at the beginning, but it's easy to get used to it after an episode or two, and then both background and foreground art blend well together.\nThe closed worlds where witches reside, deserve a separate paragraph. Shaft employed Gekidan Inu Curry for this part, and their creative potential truly shines there. The art is very abstract, animated with stop-motion and similar techniques, feeling considerably out of place, while still working out well. These visuals are often compared to opening animations of Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei seasons by fans, and Shaft's fans should recall this kind of art in other works of this studio, too.\nTalking about voice acting is not really much necessary - there are many well-known and popular names in the cast, which alone gives some degree of warranty for the quality. The voices match respective characters' personalities well, too. There's nothing much more I can say about that. The music, on the other hand - it really adds up to the overall feel. The opening theme by ClariS (known for OreImo OP) builds up a nice innocent atmosphere... soon to be brutally broken by the plot and BGM, composed by Kajiura Yuki, best known as the founder of Kalafina - who also performs the outstanding ending theme - and for Kara no Kyoukai's soundtrack. Her instantly recognizable style fits astonishingly well with Madoka's atmosphere, and builds both a considerable tension and atmosphere of mystery.\nThe BGMs, though well-fitting, didn't stand out much for me at first. But with the progress of the story, with the mood getting darker and story more absorbing, the music also started to make more impact and I can even say that it has become catchy. The style of the soudtrack also shifts significantly during the finale, which makes it feel even more epic. Overall, I don't know if the whole OST will be worth owning, but there are few tunes which I'd really like to have is my music collection.\nTo sum up, Puella Magi Madoka☆Magica has got everything a good visual entertainment should have. I can only deplore that anime is somewhat looked down on outside the otaku community, because I truly believe that anime non-fans would also enjoy it. And the title sounds somewhat embarassing, too - but it's a perfect proof for that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\nEdits:\nMarch 12th - updated after episode 10.\nMarch 14th - reworded some fragments according to a reader's notes.\nApril 23rd - updated after the final episodes.\n        "},

We tell ourselves that we will do everything in our power to preserve them, that we would never risk betting and losing them. But what, one day, you were given the opportunity to be granted a wish? A miracle, with no limits, that could give you something that you always wanted. Would you be willing to risk losing everything, the things you treasure, your humanity, and even your life, to have that one wish granted? If you would, would you regret it,\n          \n        would you curse it, or would you fight to protect it? Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Puella Magi Madoka Magica, whichever you prefer, centers around these questions and gives us an outlandish tale of love and friendship, and how it can all disappear in the blink of an eye. Madoka, or \"Dokes\" as the internet now loves/hates to call it, has become a phenomenon in the anime community since it's release in 2011, garnering endless praise and a massive fandom in Japan and in the West, and like all popular works, the question that always arises is, does it deserve it? Well let's find out.\nStory (10/10)\nIn a vague futuristic city in Japan, lives a girl named Madoka Kaname. She's entirely ordinary, and not very talented, but she treasures her life nonetheless and loves her family and friends entirely. But one day a mysterious transfer student named Homura Akemi gives her a warning, that if she truly loves her life and the people around her, that she shouldn't do anything that would change it. Her warning quickly becomes prevalent as she meets a mysterious being in the shape of a cute fuzzy entity named Kyubey that offers to turn her and her friends into magical girls. They will be granted one wish to gain these powers and in return they will be obligated to fight the witches that hide in the shadows of their city. Then..... well i can't really say. Basically everything that follows that basic description could be labeled as a spoiler, so if you want to know more, i suggest you watch the series for yourself. Hint though, if you're familiar with the works of Faust and Hans Christian Andersen, you might get some kind of clue as to what goes on.  After 3 years since its premiere, it's common knowledge now that Madoka is not the moe fluff that it appears to be. There are many fans out there that will describe the show as a dark subversion that deconstructs the magical girl genre, and to this claim, i say that it's true. In the first two minutes of the anime, Madoka shows that it's not the happy-go-lucky magical girl anime from our childhoods, but a dark story that, along the way, points at some of the flaws and inconsistencies of the magical girl genre. But the thing is, Madoka is not good because it's a dark subversion. Madoka is good because it's terrifically written and has ended up being one of the few good modern tragedie. Nothing the show presents to us feels arbitrary or manipulative, but it feels inevitable, as though there was no way around it, even though our own ideals hoped that reality would stop crashing down on these girls. Of course this only works because the writing in the show is airtight, filled with foreshadowing, both subtle and obvious, and not wasting a single moment on scenes that could be considered meaningless filler, there is purpose to every interaction and every conversation. In fact there's so much detail in these short 12 episodes, that it doesn't just give it rewatch value, but it practically demands to be watched more than once, and from personal experience, it just gets better with each viewing.\nArt (9/10)\nThe art and animation in Madoka was done by Studio Shaft, a studio known for it's high animation quality and obtuse visuals, and who i personally dislike for their vanity. Yet, i acknowledge good work when i see it, and to say their work on Madoka is just good is an understatement. Madoka's design has one thing that most moe shows lack, distinction. Their color palate, their ordinary pastels made extraordinary by crayon tones, and a certain flexibility that makes you really appreciate the work put into it. Not to say anything about the ever present city itself, large in scale, and containing areas both lavish and hollow. As the series progresses, the city continually gets more bleak and ill-boding to fit the tone, yet never losing the presence that it's had since the first episode. Still the highlight of the shows visuals is easily the witches labyrinths. Each of them is abnormal, outlandish, and unique with different themes and designs for each one, like one is designed after a hospital, another looks like a scrap book, and my personal favorite is where everyone in the labyrinth is depicted as a silhouette. It's unorthodox to it's core, and like the city, only gets more grim and uncomfortable as the series progresses. Not to say anything about the animation which meets the usual Shaft standards of high quality, with fluid and fast paced action scenes, and the notorious “sideways glance” that we see in every single Shaft anime. Madoka is art from anyway you look at it, and it's visuals to good to match it. \nSound (9/10)\nThe score for the show was done by, Yuki Kajiura. Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks are well known for shedding a tear or two, and Madoka is no different. With a glorious blend of synths and electric orchestra's, weeping strings and piano, and, of course, a towering choir, the soundtrack to Madoka is attention getting to say the least. Haunting, mysterious, and at times sad, needless to say, the OST is good, almost too good in fact. It's actually kind of hard to talk about the soundtrack because it's, honestly, just something you have to listen to for yourself. As for voice acting, i'll have to go sub over dub. It's kind of hard for me to judge Japanese voice acting since, I myself, do not speak Japanese, but still, it's not hard to notice a great performance when you hear one. In Madoka, it just so happens, that all of the actors are equally great, both subtle and overwrought for whichever situation. As for the dub, well, it's listenable. To be fair, it's not a bad dub, but it's not very natural sounding and very wooden on places. I will give special props to Cassandra Lee Morris for her performance as Kyubey. She obviously got what kind of character it was and captured its essence enough to rival its Japanese counterpart. If you prefer dubs then go ahead, the dub doesn't really do anything to hurt it, but i recommend the Japanese track. \nCharacter (10/10)\nAs a tragedy, Madoka only works to it's fullest with the stellar cast of characters they provide, although it may not seem that way from an limited standpoint. By limited standpoint, i mean those who follow a formula to judge what makes a character, one such as \"background A + situation B = reaction C\" characterization\", rather them what's in front of you. The characters are humanized beyond their archtypes and over time, things like motivations change and the characters are corrupted by a situation that, despite being ideal candidates for, none of them were mentally, physically, or emotionally prepared for. Of course, in classic tragic fashion, the situation was a near impossible one that could've been avoided, if not for their own personal flaws. Their naivete, their desperation, their love, their desire, even things that seem like good attributes like kindness and courage prove to be more harmful than they seem. This is brought out through the contrast of the rookie magical girls and the veterans, those who went in with hope and the best of intentions, and those who have learned the hard way about the price of being a magical girl. Of course this applies to all the main cast, except for two. The first being out ordinary protagonist, Madoka, who consistently goes through the series with a justified indecisiveness towards becoming a magical girl, feeling the guilt of not doing her part, but fearing for what will come when she makes her wish. Her natural sense of what's right and what isn't, her own insecurities, and being witness to the consequences that unfold is what ultimately drives her character throughout the series, slowly building her up until the climax, and while she isn't the best of the characters, she is the one most suited for being the main protagonist. Then there's Kyubey, who i sadly can't go into much detail over, so i'll just give you the gist of it. Kyubey is the representation of logic versus emotion, and the needs of the many versus the needs of the one. It's indifferent towards the ideas of good and evil and acts however it feels is necessary to get what's needed. The mere fact that i've been using it for Kyubey, over him or her, should be indication that Kyubey is more than it originally seems. There's not much to talk about outside of the main cast, as there's only 6 other characters that aren't just nameless background fodder, but they still contribute their fair share to the story. The conversations between Madoka and her mother Junko often reveal a lot, how close they are, how much Madoka admires her, and often works as vessels for foreshadowing, and were always interesting to watch. Madoka and Sayaka's friend Hitomi is another story. She's not a bad character, but her switch from comic relief to super serious seemed a bit sudden, but even that's just a nitpick. The characters is Madoka are surprisingly complex and give off more than enough humanity to make this series exceed expectations. \nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10)\nGen Urobuchi has stated in interviews that his intention with Madoka was to make an interesting, thought-provoking, fantasy set in an established genre. Did he succeed? More than i could've ever expected. Madoka is a masterfully written modern tragedy that works on par with classic european literature. Some may claim that Madoka is nothing more than shock factor with cute girls designed to be an instant hit, to which i recommend you rewatch it since you missed the point of what the series is about in the first place. As for others, while i can't guarantee that you'll like the series as much as i do, as with any other work, but i recommend you watch it, sooner than later. Few series seems to hit every target, from characters, to story, to themes, and work every way, inside and out, to make a series as, for lack of a better word, perfect. Anyways, that's all for now, til next time.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=299,  ["text"]="                          \n    I feel like I'm in the minority here on MAL, and that's kinda depressing. Madoka Magica by and large is one of those programmes which receives no shortage of praise that I simply can't agree with one way or the other. I wouldn't mind it so much were it not for the fact that any sort of valid criticism or complaints anyone has with this series is instantly lost in a sea of downvotes and angry rants made by rabid fans who're breathing heavily whilst typing on their keyboards rapidly. Regardless, I'll make a feeble attempt at getting my voice heard. Will it work? Probably\n          \n        not, but it's still worth a try.\nWhat really baffles me is how Madoka Magica is a moe drama along the lines of Elfen Lied and yet people praise Madoka ad nauseum whilst talking shit about Elfen Lied at every available opportunity. Even people like JesuOtaku who generally have no patience for moe dramas ended up giving this programme a glowing review despite the fact that Madoka Magica and Elfen Lied end up trying to accomplish similar goals. It's amazing as to how much the power of emotions can override one's better judgement but then again, maybe that's why I couldn't get into it in the first place.\nLet's just get this out of the way first: moe drama by and large is an extremely manipulative genre at its core that's rather poorly written in general. Why is this the case? Well, the writers know all too well that most viewers will gladly put up with all this shit so long as they get their cute girls in anguish that they can fantasise about consoling and/or fucking. Obviously, Madoka Magica has quite a way's worth of better writing put into it than Elfen Lied does but it still falls prey to the same traps that plague moe drama when it comes down to the writing.\nThe first biggest problem that Madoka Magica has is the fact that the pacing is horrendously rushed. I don't care what you have to say about the pacing, because quite frankly... it's shit. The 12 episodes we were given did not allow for the events taking place in the story to flow naturally and instead make this programme come off as a rather forced melodrama. Something is horrendously wrong with your programme if I cannot bring myself to feel even the slightest modicum of emotion for what transpires despite the characters making a big deal of it all.\nAside from the rushed pacing, another glaring flaw that Madoka Magica suffers from is the fact that it's heavily reliant on shock value, which is probably another big reason as to why this anime is so lauded in the first place. Shock is a powerful emotion indeed and it can definitely work to great effect to further strengthen the writing whenever necessary. The problem is that Madoka Magica goes out of its way to shock the viewer and then ultimately relies on manipulating your emotions to keep you invested and distract you from the flaws in the writing. People are definitely going to disagree with me on this one but please hear me out.\nThe way Madoka Magica's been marketed in the past by Aniplex is a dead giveaway that shock value is a major cornerstone of Madoka Magica as a whole. The trailers, the OP, and even the blurb on the back of the Aniplex DVD release basically paint this show out to be your typical magic girl show despite the fact that it couldn't be further from the truth. Granted, a lot of the punch has been taken out of that sort of marketing tactic given that Madoka has become so popular to the point where it's essentially common knowledge that this is a dark, angst-ridden magic girl melodrama but the point still stands.\nIt seems like Madoka Magica was fundamentally designed to be a smash hit. The very combination of shock and moe drama has been a proven formula for success (look at Elfen Lied if you want an example). However, Madoka Magica takes this a step further by being a magic girl show. Magic girl programmes (and battle shonens to a similar extent) suffer from this \"image\" that exists in the minds of most people as nothing more than childish drivel about friendship and idealism that can't grow the fuck up. Given the fact that Madoka Magica is a shocking moe drama as well as a magic girl show, the end result is basically having thousands of fans saying that Madoka isn't like other magic girl shows and is a definite must-watch.\nYes, Madoka isn't like most other magic girl programmes but then again, neither is Kill la Kill or Princess Tutu. A series doesn't automatically become a masterpiece just because it \"breaks the mould\" as the saying goes. If that were the case, films like \"The Room\" would have to be considered masterpieces of drama despite evidence to the contrary. Don't get me wrong: individuality in anime is a good thing, especially given all the repetition going on in the industry. What isn't good is relying on being different to be your main selling point. This isn't to say that Madoka doesn't have any other merits to stand on, rather the very merits it does have are flawed to high heaven.\nMadoka Magica is often praised to no end as a deconstruction of magic girl anime. Yeah... I don't buy it. You mean to tell me that all it takes to be a deconstruction is psychologically torturing your characters whilst going out of your way to be as dark and edgy as possible? I thought there was more subtlety involved with the writing when it comes down to deconstructions. Say what you will about Evangelion, but one thing that Gainax has that SHAFT lacks in its entirety is tact. Don't get me wrong, subtlety isn't exactly Evangelion's strong suit either but it certainly has more than Madoka does, that's for sure.\nWe got to spend a good deal of time in our typical mech setting before shit got morbid and we realised that being a mecha pilot in the world of Eva isn't a walking sex fantasy. Sure, Evangelion sends us flying head-first into the plot like Madoka does, but once again: we're given time to actually connect with the characters which is something that Madoka's 12-episode runtime simply doesn't allow for. I understand that the length of a show isn't necessarily indicative of whether or not the characters are good because there definitely are 1-cour programmes that deliver quite a bit on the character front (i.e. White Album 2, OreGairu, Usagi Drop, etc). At the same time, this story contains far too much content for it to actually work with the 1-cour length.\nI know that some people like to tout this 12-episode length as a strength, saying that it's free from all the unnecessary bullshit that plagues other magic girl shows and goes straight into the good stuff. While I can certainly reciprocate that praise to a certain degree (especially given that Madoka Magica is far more engaging than Sailor Moon is), people fail to understand that without the boring parts of a show, the good bits wouldn't be nearly as good and would instead become mediocre. Princess Tutu understood this concept quite well as it was able to balance out the otherwise boring bits about ballet with the deliciously macabre moments involving Drosselmeyer. Madoka has no such balance.\nAnother problem that the 1-cour length brings up is an over-reliance on plot twists. Now, plot twists aren't inherently bad and can definitely work to the show's advantage if it was given proper foreshadowing. Unfortunately, the short length doesn't allow for foreshadowing of any kind to really happen so they just take you by surprise (oh look, more shock value!). I don't know about you, but these plot twists don't do much of anything for me. In fact, it made me question the logic behind this show even more. I'd question why shit had to constantly get worse for the characters in every episode, but then I remember that this is moe drama and that it doesn't matter how nihilistic the world actually gets so long as we still have our cute girls writhing in anguish.\nWhat really surprises me about Madoka is the fact that despite being a sadistic viewer who loves seeing cute things being crushed by nihilism, this show was enough to make *me* do a double take on what's being shown. Make no mistake: I couldn't find myself feeling any modicum of emotion (not even pity) for Madoka, Homura, Sayaka, Kyoko, and Mami but at the same time... there was just something rather unnerving about how their circumstances just kept getting worse by the minute. It doesn't help that the short length also brings up stuff that may very well qualify as fridge horror or unfortunate implications (I don't know which trope it is, so bear with me).\nFor example, the fact that magic girls have to be adolescents because apparently, they're emotionally volatile at that age range brings up so many questions that just don't get answered. For one thing, does this mean that boys that are of the same age don't go through emotional turmoil like teenage girls do? What of teenage girls who happen to suffer from psychological disorders/trauma? Why does Kyubi opt to only focus on teenage girls when there are many other people of both genders across all age ranges that are just as emotionally volatile if not moreso? There's also the concept of power with a price.\nThe whole \"power with a price\" concept is not uncommon in TV, film, manga, comics, literature, etc and there have been many twists on the same formula. Madoka tries to do this concept but it doesn't go all the way with it because of the lack of world-building. Because of that, it would seem that the price the girls have to pay is unending psychological torture which is all somehow the girls' faults by the end of it all. Basically, Madoka's flat-out telling you that you're fucked if you decide to remain a Muggle because you're going to die regardless and yet you're fucked if you become a magic girl because it means you'll go through continuous psychological torment. At the same time, it's also telling you that you'd be much better off as a Muggle because of the fact that you're going to die a lonely, merciless death where nobody's going to remember you if you choose to be a magic girl.\nNow I could bring up the whole wish fallacy argument that plagues other shows that involve wishing, but then you have to remember that all the wishes that the girls made in Madoka horribly backfired because apparently, the wishes that the girls made were really selfish even though they seemed selfless at first. Even if Madoka herself was to make a wish like being able to grant her own wishes exactly as she intends for them to come out, there's no telling how horribly it can backfire because the world this show takes place in is an extremely cruel and nihilistic one. This actually brings me over to another problem I have with the show: how sexist it actually is.\nI don't consider myself a feminist of any flavour, nor can I say whether or not a specific programme is female-positive media because I'm a guy. At the same time, I don't understand how people can just let all this bullshit slide. Have people forgotten that women have been pressured for millennia to be as selfless as possible and to put their own desires to the side? What's so wrong about wanting to be with the person you love? What's so wrong about not wanting to die or to actually eat something for dinner? Madoka's logic in and of itself is something that really just doesn't sit right with me one way or the other.\nAm I reading too much into Madoka? I don't even know at this point, but there's no denying that there are many fundamental flaws that exist within Madoka Magica as a whole. However, there's this one aspect of Madoka that never ceases to piss me off more than anything else and that's how it ends. For a show that spends 11 episodes psychologically torturing its characters, I'd expect for the show to at least end on a downright depressing note but that's not the case at all. In fact, Madoka Magica's ending couldn't be happier. Fans like to say that the ending wasn't completely happy, but we all know that the circumstances the ending presents to us are infinitely better than what Homura et al had to put up with for the bulk of this show's run. \nI don't understand how a show can simply spend 11 episodes saying that ideals will only result in permanent suffering only to do a complete 180 at the final episode and say that hope, happiness, and whatnot will always prevail. Then again, Madoka Magica IS a moe drama and we all know that moe dramas wouldn't be as successful if they don't end on *some* semblance of a happy note (I'm looking at YOU, Clannad: After Story!). One thing's for certain though, this ending is something that I take umbrage with on so many levels because it just forces a happy ending out of nowhere, which is the kind of ending that I really just can't stand.\nAll things considered, Madoka Magica is certainly an interesting beast to tackle indeed. I wouldn't call it average in the slightest because it managed to evoke this much of a reaction out of me and it's definitely a cut above the more typical entries of the magic girl genre. At the same time, this show gets far too much praise than it actually deserves. I'm not saying it's terrible, because it really isn't and I suppose you'll have a good time watching it if you don't read too much into the story. Regardless, I don't think Madoka Magica is a \"good\" show. Feedback is always welcome, so with that... I'm gonna start barricading my house so that you rabid Madoka fans don't come at me with the intentions to kill me. Peace. \n        "},

That’s how the story of a magical girl goes…”\nI finally understand why one should not judge a book by its cover.  To be honest, I never liked the design of the characters in Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica and I’m sure there are those out there (like me) who may be skeptical with this show due to that fact alone.  I mean … doesn’t the swollen, flattened, wide, and overblown faces turn you off?  It sure did for me.  But boy, I cannot describe how glad I\n          \n        am now after marathoning Madoka★Magica in two days (despite all the assignments, projects, and exam deadlines)!\nSo what can you expect out of this show?  Certainly not the typical magical girl story one would be expecting.  Taking place in a futuristic world, the story started off like most other magical girl series.  School setting, bunch of young girls hanging around together, the typical “happy care-free” life.  But that quickly changed as the pace of the story drastically increased as well as the mood darkens at the same time.  Soon the viewers are engulfed with deep hatred and sorrow and a wide range of emotions that will only leave one hanging and lust for more.  To say Madoka★Magica is an emotionally driven show is not an overstatement.\nThe sound department is just as brilliant as the story itself.  With the new junior high duo ClariS doing the opening theme and Kalafina doing the ending theme, that should automatically ring some bell for some hardcore anime followers.  But putting the fame of these singer groups aside, both the opening and ending theme songs for Madoka★Magica are just splendid in itself.  You know how some songs have to grow on you; where you need time to get used to it and even then, it might not be catchy enough for you to fell in love with?  Rests assure there is no such problem with neither the opening nor ending themes for this show.  As if that is not enough, Yuki Kajiura-sama herself is responsible for the BGM, theme song lyrics, and composition!  We all know how emotionally driven her music can be, certainly one of the greatest musician in the industry to date.\nCharacter. Can’t really say there is a lot of character “growth”, BUT, I can safely say they have enormous depth making them more believable and lovable.  The depth mainly comes from the background stories of the girls.  Viewers will find out why each girl chose to become a magical girl and how they live with their choice afterward.  If you are a keen viewer, perhaps you may even be able to see through what each girl represents symbolically and relate their experience throughout the show with our own daily lives.  On that note, I have to give the production studios (SHAFT and Aniplex) credit for a job well done as well as finding the appropriate seiyu to voice cast the respective characters. \nOn to our last topic, it’s also one that I have briefly mentioned in the beginning.  Yup, it is regarding the animation of Madoka★Magica.  Surely most of us are familiar with SHAFT and its style of production, but not everyone accepts the way SHAFT handle its own anime.  While one can argue that SHAFT is being creative with their work, which certainly differentiates them from other studio, but for the everyday norm like my humble self I cannot say I appreciate their work of mixing reality into anime to create something nightmare-ish.  By that I do not mean the incorporation of real city sceneries into the anime, but rather, I am referring to the infrequent random usage of flowers, candies, or butterflies that takes away any seriousness to the show.  Perhaps I just don’t understand “art”.\nLastly, I wish to say that as an anime original work (not adapted from light novel or manga like many anime these days), Mahou Shoujo Madoka ★Magica certainly deserves some praise.  If I were to describe the excitement level of this show, the closest I can think of is a mathematical exponential curve.  The early episodes serve as the typical story foundation blocks, but right after that is done, you can sure as hell expect an emotional rollercoaster ride =D\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=259,  ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica is a smart and yet cursed show. Many including myself have applauded the show for being a brilliant take and twist on the magical girl genre, a genre that is usually meant to be an inspiration to kids. Madoka Magica changes this concept of Magical Girls by making it realistic. Fighting monsters (or witches in this case) would be a dangerous task in our reality and that is the case in point Madoka Magica tries to bring forward. A great idea on the part of the creators but unfortunately some great ideas can only go too far and the story suffers a bit\n          \n        as a result.\nThankfully, it is the characters that are the best part of the anime. Sayaka, Homura, Mami, and Kyoko are all fascinating to watch and each have their own layered characterization and moral philosophical themes that drive the story forward. Themes such as individual dreams, wishes, societal views and conflicts, relationships, etc... It's all so fascinating and brilliantly told. What is even more amazing about the characters is that they develop not only through great dialogue but also through visual means as well. Characters will change stance and opinions but the audience needs to pay attention to facial expressions and character actions throughout the show in order to determine where and when these amazing characters grew. The main protagonist Madoka is probably the most straight forward character of the bunch. She's definitely less fascinating than the rest of the cast but she is still fun to watch due to her kind nature and expressive personality. She believes herself as being a coward who can't help people, but low and behold she ends up being the smartest, wisest, and bravest of the show. She's a fine character and role model, but not a very deep one. Another little problem I had with the show is the adults of the world are all morons. How come the teenagers are the ones talking smart and philosophical while the adults are the unbalanced irresponsible weirdos who have no clue about anything? Also, there is some questionable character morals that will make you scratch your head and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to be frightened/traumatized, but they are still interesting to ponder about none the less.\n*MINOR SPOILER*\nFinally we must talk about Kyubey, who is probably one of the greatest villains ever to appear in an anime. This little cat like alien is fascinating in so many ways. He deceits, plots, scams, and lies all the way through the entire series all the while always having a permanent smile on his face (creepy). He tortures and plays around with the lives of these little girls all to further his plans, plans that are a bit understandable but completely unacceptable in the method that he's doing it in. He is the stark contrast of the usual talking cat side kick character found in magical girl shows which is once again the writers trying to play with our expectations. I love this villain yet hate him for being such an awful manipulator. This is exactly how amazing villains should be written.\n*END OF MINOR SPOILER*\nBut now unfortunately we must talk about the curse of the show and how the magical girl theme while being its strength is also its weakness. The reason the Magical Girls genre is targeted to kids is because the premise is meant to make kids feel like they can be heroes with good moral values, but in a realistic premise it is simply ridiculous and implausible. It is also at points very silly because intricate plot details and philosophy concepts are being discussed by teenage girls, girls who have probably only recently been through puberty. There are many times when I simply laughed at serious smart plot discussions because I couldn't believe little girls were talking about such things. Just the concept of Magical Girls itself is ludicrous and yes, the story does try to explain why an alien cat would give little girls powers of incredible strength but it unsurprisingly doesn't make any sense and feels forced. The conclusion as well is a very lame and predictable anime plot ending. I don't want to spoil it but all I got to say is, \"I bow down to our lord and savior Madoka, the perfect moral being!\".\nA part from these main gripes in the story, the rest of it is very good. The plot moves along with the character development very well and the main themes of the story are well handled. Themes such as natural order, space and time, etc.. all come together exceptionally well with the themes of the characters in order to create a very fascinating 12 episode anime series. The art is also very good but nothing too exceptional. It does its job well by showing us the character feelings and expressions, but it never \"wowed\" me in any way. I also never got used to the casts chubby looking faces (but that's just a bias opinion). I will say that the art style works well in order to create a magical girl feeling and the action was very well handled. The sound was also amazing in the show. The openings and endings of Madoka Magica worked in with the themes and moods of the series, and I found it very intelligent in how they used it. For example, the ending song of the first two episodes are very happy sounding melodies, which fit in with the happy magical girl mood the show first puts on. But then the third episode is where the series becomes serious and violent, thus it plays with the audience by having the ending song sounding dark and depressing as if it is stating, \"prepare yourselves people because things are about to change\". I like it when shows play around with music like that. \nI definitely recommend Madoka Magica to any anime fan. It is a brilliant and adult like take on the magical girl genre. It takes the stereotypes and reverses it. As I explained before, there are limitations to the reversing of this genre, but it is none the less a brilliant effort that deserves praise.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=248,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Forget everything you thought you knew about the magical girl genre, because Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or MSMM as I'll call it from here on for simplicity) is here to turn the genre upside down.\nAt its core, MSMM is a--like its title says--mahou shoujo.  But it's what the series does with the genre that makes it something truly marvelous; the magic is in the execution.  In the beginning, it may seem like any other, set up to be generally innocent, light-hearted, nonchalant, and fun; but by the time ED begins at the end of episode 3, the monster will be revealed for what\n          \n        it truly is, and its true nature will be fully in the light.\nI imagine MSMM's story like a tightly-woven rope kept perfectly taut:  There are multiple sub-stories and issues going on at the same time, but they stay so close together that it may be difficult for one to discern them as individual pieces of the overall work.  Unlike anime whose rope is loosely-woven or frayed (divided into clearly discernable arcs or things don't tie together well) or that curve or coil (ones that lose their way and stray from their path), MSMM stays concise, linear, and tight.  Everything stays together, and it knows exactly where it's going; it's ultimately all the same story.\nThe pacing is consistent and fast; you will definitely be riveted to the edge of your seat.  To some, it may be a tiny bit *too* fast, but I pose that this is because of the distinct lack of \"fluff\": everything is significant--nothing is pointless.  The story is lean and completely free of excess fat.  It picks its direction and chugs there headlong.  It does a perfect job balancing the crucial elements of character development, plot progression, dialog, psychology, action, and emotional tension.  Balancing this many aspects is no small feat, and MSMM is second to none at the job.\nEqually as strong and as critical to the series is the cast--also free of excess fat.  It is compact and devoid of unnecessary characters; all of them have a clearly defined role and bounds they do not overstep.  The screen time is allotted appropriately between them.  Each character has a distinct personality and already has depth to them before any development even needs to occur, and the personality that is set up beforehand helps the development they undergo stand out.  Each of the magical girls are unique and go through their own trials and ordeals, which also affect each other; each plays integral roles in shaping other characters and progressing the story.\nThe tribulations the magical girls are subjected to is what MSMM is really all about.  They--and you as the viewer--are revealed truths about what it means to be a magical girl that you never would've dreamed of.  The psychological trauma they endure is painted on a dark and cynical canvas of reality for you to experience along with them; the joys and pains as the bonds of friendship are created and strengthened, strained and broken, will play with your heart strings.  If you didn't know what it meant to be sympathetic before, consider this your crash course.\nComplementing the anime is a beautiful and stunning OST composed by Yuki Kajiura.  There is always the perfect track to accompany every scene--whether the mood be light-hearted, sad, ominous/foreboding, or exciting/thrilling, you can be guaranteed that the music will be there to help burn the feeling into your heart.  The OP (\"Connect\") is great and serves as a constant reminder of the false sense of security constructed in the early episodes; the ED (\"Magia\") is phenomenal and much more accurately reflects MSMM's true nature (it's also used strategically during a couple scenes in the series, to great effect).  There are some pretty intense sound effects utilized--particularly noteworthy are crashing noises and explosions.  The seiyuu do a stunning job delivering their lines with the perfect levels of emotion and energy.  They make their characters come to life so much so that one may think they've BECOME the character.\nSome people may be slightly put off by the somewhat different character designs with their wider faces, but you'll get used to it easily.  The animation in general is pretty spectacular, except for a few scenes where characters are shown coming \"towards us\" and end up looking like they're walking in place.  Other than that, motions are fluid, and action flows wonderfully.  The cinematography is definitely above average, with some pretty creative and interesting camera angles and close-ups.  There is some particularly stunning artwork shown briefly, usually in transitioning from one scene to another--dank, cold alleys; bright blue and green neon bus stops; vibrant, warm, orange sunsets; the glow of lamp posts in the twilight; sprawling gray cityscapes under the shadow of a gathering storm.  One thing I found particularly outstanding was the brilliant use of low-key and ambient lighting:  The lighting harmonizes with the background music to create truly engrossing and vibrant scenes.  Indeed, the manner in which the sound and visuals syngergize with each other creates an immersive and dark stage for events to play out upon.\nIn case you haven't caught the drift already, MSMM is an extremely enjoyable experience with substantial rewatch value.  It's one of those rare works that get MORE enjoyable the more you watch it, unlike many whose flaws become more evident, or eventually get old.  Genius incorporation of foreshadowing is so tactful and subtle that you might not even realize it was there until you watch it again.  (Like I said, everything is significant.)  I personally found the entire cast growing on me more and more each time through (except for Kyuubey, because he's a manipulative bastard, but still well-done nonetheless).\nMSMM offers much: friendship, drama, psychology, action, story, character development, emotional involvement, and even music and animation--like I said, all working together and balanced beautifully, with no one aspect ever dominating the others: complete harmony.  It's the only anime I'm able to honestly give perfect scores across the board for.  But does that mean YOU will like it?  As I've stated, it's mostly a dark and edgy series with characters enduring intense psychological strain and hardship, and there are times when happiness and hope seem impossible.  The night is darkest just before the dawn, but if you don't think you can take the night, then MSMM probably isn't for you.\nIf you think you CAN handle it, though, by all means:  WATCH THIS SERIES.  It's a deep, exciting, shocking, and powerful ride from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it.\n        "},

However, this had to be purposely orchestrated, as the show is nothing like that and it is clear from it's marketing that Aniplex wanted to surprise people with it, and they did a hell of a job.\nThis anime takes everything you know and love/hate about the magical girl genre and flips it 180. The plot starts off with your typical 'Magical Girl' traits and cliches, but soon takes\n          \n        a turn for the dire. This anime's story is dark, really dark. It tackles issues and questions that should, but never really do, arise in other magical girl anime. Though previous magical girl anime have had dark aspects to them, all in all those aspects have never been dark to this extent. The darker than average plot comes as a shock to the viewer that was expecting another cutesy moe anime, but got something totally different. The story is rather complex, and the answers are not given to you. Meaning that you have to figure everything out for yourself, this might be a good/bad thing, depending on your taste. I personally found the story very enjoyable and intriguing. I was not all that fond of the ending mind you and I felt that they could of done a better job with it, but I think that's up to personal preference if nothing else. And it did not break my experience. \nThe characters are arguably the show's weakest aspect. They get plenty of development, but as the show goes on, their actions just become more and more unrealistic. I personally liked all the characters, and didn't find anyone annoying or not needed. I also liked their development, and didn't really care for their unrealistic actions. This again depends whether or not you let this kind of thing affect you. Seeing as I'm a sucker for messed up characters, I found Miki Sayaka to be highly enjoyable, and definitely my favorite character of the series. \nThe animation for Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is great, studio Shaft did a splendid job with the character design and how they contrast the otherwise dark story. Although for some it might be the total opposite, and the characters might reduce your enjoyment of the show. This again is up to personal preference though. The anime gets really gorgeous if you watch it in BD quality. Shaft are known to rush out their products, but they are also known for polishing them up for the Blu-Ray release. So, if possible, do try and watch this show on Blu-Ray, as the animation is vastly improved and adds a lot to the anime. \nThe music is composed by none other than the masterful Yuki Kajiura. It contains pieces that range from cutesy moe-like themes, to intense battle choruses. And the ending song in particular is very memorable. One thing to note though is that parts of the OST sound really similar to other Yuki Kajiura works. So for instance if you've watcher Kara No Kyoukai, you will hear a lot of similarities, to the point where you can replace songs with one another from both shows, and it wouldn't matter. A minor nitpick. \nAll in all  Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is a great anime, and a must watch for anyone that is interested in the psychological genre. It's not the best at what it does, but it comes close to the heavy hitting contenders. \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=208,  ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica wants be an outstanding show, something that wasn't delivered before, but fails at this feat in pretty much all departments of animation.\nIt's commonly conceived as a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre. However Madoka Magica merely twists some aspects of the mahou shoujo genre to give them a dark edge, but does not critically point out any potential flaws of the genre to make its audience question the genre's substance.\nStarting off with the most obvious aspect, the visuals, Madoka Magica presents us with a  lot of dark alleys and conversations without much animations going on. The few battles going on during\n          \n        the show do provide us with some rather good animations, although the many immersion breaking paper cut-outs are rather forgettable in those scenes.\nThe plot of Madoka Magica really wants to be a strong point for the series, often creating a feeling that \"something interesting may happen sometime\" to the audience. The problem is that nothing out of the ordinary actually ever happens. Virtually every single part of the show's story is forseeable, to an extend that a lot of people had actually thought up the show's major plot points much earlier before they had come up during the original airing.\nFor an ending that feels like the author was not exactly sure on what it should be like, while not delivering anything new or exciting, Madoka Magica also does not deserve much credit.\nHaving spawned dozens of character fan arts, the characters should be the shows strong point, but even here it is lacking substance. Over the course of all 12 episodes, the characters are very hesistant on making decisions and moving on, reducing the show's story to a few stretched out, sometimes very forced key plot elements. Due to this behavior the characters appear very one-dimensional, although the writer's intend on making these characters feel like actual people does shine through occasionally.\nTaking all of its flaws in consideration it, I find Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica to be a rather boring show to watch. The action is good and enjoyable, but the characters talking and bitching about the same problems for episodes, and not coming to any interesting conclusions, really wears down on the enjyoment of this anime.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=201,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka! An anime that has gotten tons of hype before its initial airing, even more hype once it started, and said hype went through multiple figurative roofs after everyone had watched the first three episodes. Truly this anime has become a phenomena and its just as interesting to watch everyone clamor around it as much as watching the show itself. A little context first though, a while back everyone was whispering about a possible Shaft Mahou Shoujo project with Akiyuki Shinbou attached as the director. In of itself, it wasn't too eyebrow-raising asides from the fact that Shinbou had directed the first season of Nanoha\n          \n        (another Mahou Shoujo series that subverts a lot of the genre's tropes). Nope nobody was really interested until it was revealed that Gen Urobuchi was doing the writing and series composition, Ume Aoki was doing the original character designs and Yuki Kajiura was composing the music. Ignoring Kajiura and Shinbou, simply mentioning that Urobuchi and Aoki were attached was absolutely baffling. I mean one is famed for his grimdark writing style and the other is known for her disgustingly cute drawing style, it doesn't really take a genius to figure out that this anime would be something different. So the hype machine took off and here we are months later all caught up in the veritable frenzy this anime has left in its wake week after week. Does it deserve all the love and the praise it gets? Let's see! \nGen Urobuchi is known for a lot of crap, mostly for being one of the writers for Nitroplus and by proxy the brains behind Saya no Uta (a Visual Novel). Now if you haven't read it, I strongly recommend you do. It isn't particularly long so take a few hours out of your schedule and just read through the whole thing in one sitting. You'll thank me for it later. I'm mentioning this because there are a lot of similarities between SnU and Madoka, particularly in the overall themes that are presented in both works. The particular things I'm looking for are mainly subversion and corruption/perversion, which Madoka is rife with. Urobuchi's style really shines when he takes something that is considered sacred and paints in a horrific manner. In this case, he's taking Mahou Shoujo and painting it in the same colors or...dementia he used to paint SnU. Now don't get me wrong, Madoka isn't good because it's a piece of dark fiction, but because its a well-written piece of dark fiction. A lot people get too caught up in its grittiness and play up on how its a revolutionary anime because its DARK AND BROODING. But that's not really the case, it's more like Urobuchi's inherent style melds so well with the genre he's working in. Mahou Shoujo already some entries that take darker approaches to its cliches (the aforementioned Nanoha) and its even got some good deconstructions (Revolutionary Girl Utena and the second half of Princess Tutu). What Madoka does is twisting the guts of the genre only to to pull out every organ slowly and concisely, getting its hands completely bloody in the process while showing the audience the rotted  flesh in its hands. It's plot follows the generic magical girl fight monsters scenario but the actual execution is very different. So much so that it gives off a distinctly different vibe from even the triple A anime in this category. \nA good story generally is split up into 3 different Acts, the first is setting the stage, and the third is climax and resolution. The dramatic question comes up in the first act which is pretty much the goal the protagonist must achieve by the third act, and the second is about the protagonist doing what they must to answer the dramatic question. The importance of all that highbrow BS is simply that Madoka has a completely different dramatic question compared to the norm of the genre. In Mahou Shoujo or even Fighting Shounen, the protagonist gets power of some sort of power in the beginning and is asked by the plot whether they can/will defeat/save/restore something of importance. The question posed to Madoka is \"Will you become a Puella Magi (Magical Girl)?\". First things first, we know by definition that if this is the dramatic question, than we know for sure that we won't see Madoka become a Magical Girl half-way through the series or anytime soon for that matter. We know damn well that its going to part of the climax. Dramatic questions usually force the protagonist to be proactive: to change themselves so they are better equipped to tackle the question. Madoka's as you guessed, commands more a reactionary response. This in turn changes the focus to inwards instead of outwards so its fair to say that this is a primarily character-driven anime. Now that's not to say that the plot remains on the backburner for most of show, in contrary it keeps going with or without Madoka driving it. In that regard, both plot and characters are well done, and one isn't really sacrificed for the other. Both work together concisely to drive the experience home. \nOne thing Madoka manages to pull off consistently well is the feeling of uncanniness through out the entire show. In good horror/thriller stories, fear is either presented to the audience in three ways: through the \"self\", through \"uncanniness\" and and through the \"other\". Madoka employs all three to startling good effects. The \"self\" aspect really brings out the psychological aspect of the characters, its the parts where they sit down and sort of think aloud to themselves accentuating their thought-process and presenting it to the audience. This happens a lot, and more importantly each character has their own monologue. Its effective because the girls really convey their own fears to the audience and not only that but a lot of that fear is something most of us can relate to. The \"other\" is basically the unknown and things that we cannot understand. For example, all witch scenes and FX that are done by Genkidan Inu Curry. These scenes are very surreal and abstract which is meant to evoke an otherworldly feeling. Or better yet, Kyubey is a very good personification of the \"other\" simply because the audience cannot understand him or his actions with human perceptions and concepts. The final piece is the uncanny, or the feeling that something is slightly off. This is the one horror aspect that is present in Madoka all the time and its there to unsettle the viewer. Its not the direct kind of \"Boo\" horror, but its a more subtle variety which is designed to peeve the audience and to keep them thinking about it long after they've stopped watching. In this anime, there's always something off, and it really adds a lot to the atmosphere. And if I had to pick only one good thing about Madoka, its the atmosphere. Its essentially draped over the viewer like an enormous blanket and can very well become almost suffocating at times. Its something that made Silent Hill 2, and in my opinion also becomes the driving force behind Madoka. Its the one quality that really separates from it from other good anime and pushes it up there with the best of the best. \nThe music is really incredible and is probably my favorite soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura. The tracks are very beautiful and melodious, and also border on haunting at times. I really cannot describe how important the music is, because it really is the atmosphere at times. If you were to take the soundtrack away from Madoka, it would substantially worsen the final product. It really just draws the audience into itself and the show. While in some other anime the music can be mediocre and even forgettable, over here its absolutely pivotal. The audio design is also great, the right tracks and used at the right moments and are always in sync with the direction or composition of a scene. One thing I'd like to bring attention to is the script which I actually liked a lot. There's not much filler in the dialogue nor are there any meaningless lines. All of it is put to good use which is really pretty rare to see, most anime these days are rarely efficient with the allocation of lines or script writing. Shaft is especially a bit lenient with this quality and most of the dialogue in their anime can be rather gratuitous at times. \nHowever if Madoka can be criticized for anything in its presentation, its definitely the animation. The art style itself is good and contrasts heavily with the subject matter, but the animation often leaves something to be desired. While there are some good action scenes and generally the animation fidelity is actually much higher than in other Shaft anime, it's still a bit choppy. There are also a bunch of art errors in every episode (Meduka Meguca anyone?). This does get better as it goes a long, and its apparent that Shaft saved much of the animation budget for later episodes which do look very impressive from an animation stand point (espeically episode 10, GoHands helped out with that one). Hopefully if Shaft ever decides to do a sequel, they'll budget this appropriately and save up all the money, hookers and blow made from the Madoka BD sales. \nOverall, Madoka is one the best anime to come out in a few years. It's not based off of a manga which is based off of a light/visual novel, it's not a fanservice-ridden sack of crap, its not utterly and completely generic and most importantly its a big breath of fresh air compared to a lot of the anime that have come out recently. If you're not out to hate it the second you start watching, than you should be able to take away a lot of enjoyment from it because like I said in the beginning, it's a hell of a ride. To all the people who have already seen it, I strongly recommend just marathoning the entire series again after a couple months. Because honestly, Madoka will be an entirely different beast when marathoned compared to being watched weekly. The atmosphere practically begs the audience to watch the entire thing in one go and it'll definitely be an experience worth the trouble. For all those who haven't watched it yet, what exactly are you waiting for? More importantly, why are you reading reviews instead of watching this anime? It's a no-brainer, don't make me beg you all to watch it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=175,  ["text"]="                          \n    Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Goethe. Voltaire. William Shakespeare. Charles Dickens. Oscar Wilde. These are some of the most critically acclaimed and influential authors the world has ever seen. They have written texts that have shaped way we perceive the world. They have introduced ideas and philosophies that were previously unimaginable, and as a result left a deep imprint on the Western and Eastern worlds.  But alas, none of them compare to Urobuchi Gen's magnum opus, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Never before was there such a profound piece of art on this level of brilliance. By comparison, all of the other authors mentioned seem like amateur fanfiction\n          \n        writers. I had a hard time writing that with a straight face, but anyway onto the review.\n Madoka Shoujo Madoka Magica is a supposed, \"deconstruction,\" of the magic girl genre. I use the term deconstruction loosely. It gained popularity, or rather notoriety, due its \"deep,\" themes, \"symbolism,\", \"complex\" characters, and of course Urobuchi's trademark cruelty. All of these factors combined should be the recipe for success, correct? Not in this case. Madoka isn't a bad show by any standard. It is a show that reaches for the stars and falls drastically short. \nStory(6/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica starts off misleading the viewer into thinking it is just a regular magical girl show. You have a pink haired protagonist with low self-esteem, a blue haired tomboy-esque chick who serves a foil character, and a magical creature that basically grants wishes. This has been the formula for any magical girl anime released in the past decade. However, this is all a facade to mask the fact that Madoka is a relatively dark show. The titular character, Madoka, comes into contact with a strange creature called, QB, who makes her an offer that is hard to refuse. You will be granted one wish, and in return you will become a Magic Girl who has to fight these monstrosities called, \"witches,\" to save the world. Sounds like any young girl from Japan's dream right? However, little does poor Madoka know that their are huge consequences that come with this contract. Very early on in the show, we witness the hardships of being a Mahou Shoujo. Death, loneliness, despair. These are all that await these young girls. Sounds enticing right? Well, the show's execution is flawed and I will explain why.\nFirstly, the show's pacing is off. The viewer is quick introduced to events without sufficient foreshadow or buildup, thus all the plot twists come off as contrived. Madoka would have benefited from being a 24 episode show as opposed to a 12 episode series. Everything comes off as rushed. There is not sufficient world building or anything that makes the show come off as organic in terms of the narrative.\nSecondly, there is an over reliance on plot twists but most of these plot twists are simply just shock value. You thought what happened to Character A was awful in every way? No, that was just the beginning, THIS is much worse. And what lessons do we learn from all this suffering and cruelty? Nothing. There is no greater insight in seeing horrible things happen to these girls aside that Urobuchi's sadistic tendencies manifest themselves in interesting ways. The central theme in Madoka is to, \"be careful what you wish for,\" and it is made obvious the first couple times bad things happen to the characters. But constantly adding new twists every couple of episodes to make the main characters lives increasingly harder becomes borderline ridiculousness. It doesn't help that most of these twists seem to come from thin air aside from a few that were alluded to.\nThird, it is advertised as a deconstruction but it is anything but. Madoka may be a dark show but dark does not automatically mean deconstruction. At its core, Madoka is the same as every other Magical girl show out there only more edgier. It does nothing to point out the flaws of the magical girl genre and give us deeper insight into what it truly means to put your life on the line for an empty cause. Side point, the show also has underlying misogynistic themes. If you look closely, QB says that many of the great women in history were magical girls but all failed or messed up in some way or form. Is this to say that women are incapable of handling any sort of real power? Who knows, but that is my take on it.\nArt (8/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka was animated by Studio SHAFT, a studio best known for their eccentric animation style. Madoka is a beautiful show. The backgrounds are very detailed and are laden with symbolism. The lighting gives Madoka this dark and ominous feel which adds a lot to the immersion. It makes it very hard to take your eyes off of the show. The character designs are a bit off putting to me though. The faces of the characters are square and a bit pudgy. Pretty weird in my opinion.\nSound(8/10)- The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kaijura, famous for her works on The Garden of Sinners and .Hack series. This is probably one of her greatest efforts to date. The soundtrack is composed of melancholic soundscapes with occasional orchestrated high energy tracks that suit the more tense fight scenes. The sound direction for this show is truly impeccable as each track captures every moment appropriately.\nCharacter(4/10)- The character aspect is arguably the show's Achilles Heel. The title character, Madoka, has to be the worst character in the show. She starts off with low self-esteem, leading me to believe there is going to be some interesting character development but surprisingly she never changes. The entire show literally revolves around her and yet she does nothing of interest for most of the show. Madoka is a character defined by her environment, a reactionary character if you will. She cries and moans over the bad things that happens to her and her friends, but we rarely ever get a deeper look into her character.\nHer best friend, Miki Sayaka is hardly any better. She starts off as brash and bold, but we slowly get to learn more about her character. However, her backstory isn't fleshed out sufficiently to the point where I feel like she is an actual person. Her wish, although understandable, lacks any substance behind it. What I mean is, there wasn't a sufficient explanation as to why she made this wish aside from, I like this guy. As far as we know, there is no deep history between the characters so the wish comes off as stupid to me. Although she does, develop throughout the show, it hardly makes her likable or a better character. Her character developments seem inorganic because once again, they rely on shock value via plot twists. \nThe other characters such as Akemi and Kyoko are only slightly better but their motivations and reasons behind most of the things they do, don't make sense within the time frame it occurs. Kyoko goes from hating Sayaka in one episode, so much so that she wants to kill her, and in the very next she is revealing to her a sad sob story about her origins. There was no build up. What made her change her mind so quickly? Yes, she did say Sayaka reminded her of herself, but that isn't an adequate reason to change your mind about someone you were going to kill the episode before. Their \"friendship,\" was rushed to the point of disbelief, and didn't make sense. Akemi is the same way, although her situation is slightly more understandable.   But the extent to which Akemi would sacrifice herself for Madoka didn't make sense because they haven't even known each for a year and barely even a month. It does not make sense. Nobody would go through so much turmoil for someone they just met. And Akemi also has a power that was poorly explained and comes off as a plothole but due to spoilers I will not say what it is.\nMy favorite character is QB. I felt as though he was the easiest person to empathize with and his reason for making girls sign the contract was understandable aside from a few gripes I have with his reasoning behind it. But I don't think the show wanted me to empathize with someone they painted as a villain, but I felt he was more realistic than the aforementioned characters.\nConclusion (6/10)- So in conclusion, is Madoka the masterpiece it was hyped up to be? Not at all. It did not do to the Magical Girl genre what Evangelion did to mecha, and at it is core it is the same as all the other anime in its genre. The comparisons made with it being similar to Faust and European literature are superficial and borderline offensive to the authors. Madoka does not match the quality of most literature so I thought I should just put an end to that notion. The reason I am so harsh towards Madoka is because I look at what it could've been and what it is, and I am deeply saddened it turned out this way. However, Madoka is not completely without merit. It is an interesting take on the magical girl genre, and has some phenomenal production values. I would definitely recommend a watch but don't go in with high expectations because they are bound to be crushed.\n        "},

However, the first thing I’ll tell you is that if you haven’t seen this show (or had it spoiled for you), and you have any intention whatsoever to actually watch it, then my tip would be to actually not read too much about the series before watching it...\nNow then, let’s get\n          \n        down to it... I was very much on the fence (and still am) about some of these scores, and whether they should actually be a 9 or 10, so take it with an additional pinch of salt (and remember, a perfect score does not mean it’s all perfect).\nStory: (9 / 10)\nIn all its simplicity, Madoka★Magica is a breakdown and reconstruction of the “Mahou Shoujo” genre, in an attempt to make it more realistic and mature. And to be totally honest, they did a fantastic job with this. \nThe buildup, plot twists and all the emotional moments in this series really come together to make it all a wonderful experience. Now, I’m aware (and have been told by several people) that the start of the series is quite slow, but I really think that adds to the whole “psychological” effect of the anime. This isn’t your standard, fast-paced good vs. evil action series with a dash of romance and comedy (as many “regular” magical girl shows tend to be). No, this series is about following the struggle of a few select girls who can have anything they want, in exchange for everything. \nAt first there’ll be a lot of questions raised, many left unanswered until almost the end of the series, but thankfully there don’t really exist any gaping plot holes, nor are any questions really left unanswered in the end. \nArt: (10 / 10)\nAnimation is done by Shaft, and if you’ve seen any of their other works (Monogatari series, Zetsubou sensei etc) then that should be all you need to know. The art is absolutely amazing, which you’ll see from just the first 10 or so seconds of the opening sequence. Aside from the great quality of the art, I really enjoyed the “clean” aesthetics of the environment/backgrounds, and the use of light colors for many of the characters.  \nCharacter design is well done, but nothing overly amazing, tho it certainly distinguish all the characters, and makes them more memorable in a way. As for fan service, well... There is none. I mean, there’s not a single indication of fan service anywhere... at all...\nThe animation isn’t anything to scoff at either. Fluid both during fighting scenes and... well, non-fighting scenes, some good animations really help a lot in the portrayal of characters and their feelings.\nAs for the opening/ending scenes, there isn’t all too much I can say. The opening really shines at portraying that “advertised” feeling of “this is a happy show about cute girls” that the creators wanted to convey. The ending sequence however, is more or less just a silhouette of the main character walking away to music... \nSound: (10 / 10)\nLet’s talk about the musical score first. The opening theme, “Connect” by ClariS, is quite a happy song, and just like its accompanying opening sequence it does a great job of portraying that aforementioned “happy” feeling. Now, previously when I talked about the ending sequence, I was more or less referring only to that in which Kalafina’s “Magia” play, as this is the most “prominent” or well known of the 4 ending songs. The other 3 consist of the opening theme, “Connect”, a rather sad song called “Mata Ashita” by Aoi Yuuki, and finally a not so sad, but not really happy song called “And I’m home”, by Ai Nonaka and Eri Kitamura. \n“Magia” however, receives quite a bit more credit because not only is it played in 7 of the 12 episodes, but it’s also the most outstanding of the songs. Aside from being the ending theme of the series, it’s also used quite frequently during some of the more “epic” moments of the series, such as fighting scenes, and it really helps bring out the feelings of certain scenes.\nSpeaking of background music, Madoka★Magica features quite an amazing soundtrack. It’s overall pretty varied, ranging from happy themes such as “Credens Justitiam”, to darker songs such as “Walpurgis Nux”, there’s always a song which fits the situation, and really helps in conveying the feelings which want to be conveyed. \nCharacters: (9 / 10)\nMadoka★Magica consists of a rather small cast of characters, but interesting ones nonetheless. The characters all felt very real to me, and the amount of character development in this series is just great. It makes the characters feel even more “alive”, and really helps you relate and connect with them. The characters all (mostly) have solid and interesting backstories, however I feel like the reason this part is only a 9, is simply because of the fact that a certain character didn’t have as much backstory or information about her which I felt like she should have (but who knows, maybe that’ll change in the last movie).\nThere really isn’t too much more I can say here, without spoiling anything, to be honest.\nEnjoyment: (10 / 10)\nThis is easily a 10/10 for me. I was lucky enough to not have anything really told to me about this show more than maybe “it’s a bit dark”, or “it’s pretty weird”, so the shock factor and all were quite high for me. All the emotions, and the lingering feelings of this show really makes it an amazing #1 favorite of mine.\nConclusion:\nNow, this is obviously not your regular “mahou shoujo”, nor is it intended for the regular audience of said genre, but rather for a more mature audience. If you’re a fan of darker, slightly psychological shows, then I assure you you’re gonna love this if you can ignore the slightly slow beginning.\nPros:\n+ Amazing plot, with lots of twists and drama.\n+ Outstanding soundtrack.\n+ Great art (as expected of Shaft).\n+ Interesting, fleshed out characters.\n+ Lots of heart wrenching / heartwarming moments.\n-----------------------\nCons:\n- Starts out fairly slow. \n- Shock factor of certain parts may decrease if you’ve read too much about the show.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=118,  ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    In all honesty, I entered this series with optimistic skepticism, for as a general principle, I tend not to like highly rated anime.  Far too often, I see a story with a great concept that misses several key opportunities to expand the plot [Angel Beats], or perhaps one whose characters simply don't seem particularly real to me [Hanasaku Iroha--at least, the first 4 episodes I watched before subsequently dropping the series].  To say the least, I expected this to be one of the same kinds of anime.\nBoy, was I wrong.\nMost reading this will know the story.  Reading other reviews will reveal that\n          \n        this is an anime that makes one think it will turn out one way, only to violently and, sometimes, unexpectedly switch gears.  Since that has been hashed out so much, I'll skip that and cut straight to the ratings:\nSTORY:\nBeginning (15 points):  14\nThe story begins fairly simply, introducing the general plotline in the first few episodes.  As the characters are introduced, their personalities are very slowly (sometimes painstakingly so) revealed as to show their hidden motives and interests, which piqued my interest early on.  Curiously, characters' pasts are not well-documented here, unlike in some of the manga and even the PSP game that exists now.  My only criticism of the introduction is that Mami and Madoka, the main focus of this arc, could have benefited from even a few more minutes of delving into their past and/or present lives, but even in omitting that information, the viewer still has plenty of information to understand the characters.  Even still, this is enough of a flaw to deny the beginning a perfect 15.  The beginning was sufficient in explaining the beginning of the character development, and it amazed me in how it very efficiently shifted the plot into the middle of the story and on into the climax--every single scene had a purpose that became crystal clear as the story progressed.\nClimax (15 points): 15\nThe story continues, throwing plot twist after plot twist at the viewer.  Not only are they true to their name in that many of them are simply unexpected, but they also have amazing cohesion into further developing the characters.  Not only that, in the transition from the beginning to middle, I found the emotion on display during each episode to be so strikingly real, that my emotions matched each character's own feelings with disturbing consistency.  In no other anime has my empathy been that strong and consistent with the characters.  It's common to feel bad for the characters, but it's much more difficult to give a viewer that level of empathy.  As much as I try to think of a flaw for this section, none comes to mind.  As a result, the climax gets a perfect 15.\nEnding (15 points): 15\nAt some points, I got a little misty-eyed towards the end of the climax section.  In the end, I was holding back tears through most of it.  The level of emotion easily eclipses that of the climax, making it very hard to keep a straight face, much less outright sobbing (Clannad After Story, anyone?).  At first, I honestly didn't like how the very last episode worked, but as I looked into it through reading other reviews among other things, I realized that I simply didn't understand it, and then it really grew on me.  I then concluded that there was no other ending I would have liked more than that one--for the dark nature of the anime, it really was a perfect ending in that it wasn't your stereotypical \"Happy ending\".  It had a giant asterisk.  What it was, well...you'll have to find out ;)  Combining the emotional appeal of the episodes leading up to the final one as well as the conclusion of the last episode itself, I would have to say that the ending also earns a perfect score.  If you are easily touched by happy or sad scenes, bring a hankie.  You'll need it.\nCharacter Quality and Development (20 points): 19\nI'm really trying to find flaws here.  In my opinion, it's damn near impossible.  EVERY character has a 3-dimensional personality, and there wasn't a single main character who didn't seem real, human, and likeable, within reason.  The weakest link of all the characters is really Madoka, but even her personality is realistic.  The ONLY flaw I can think of is the lack of history in two of the five main characters (even the Pokemon reject Kyuubey gets his own development) that I mentioned in the \"Beginning\" section of the story review.  One point lost for lost potential, but other than that, any criticism is really just splitting hairs.\nArt (15 points): 15\nThe character art is pretty good stuff.  As you progress through the story, the witch world art is absolutely surreal--the term I used to describe it after my first night watching was \"Alice in Wonderland-meets-LSD hallucination\".  It was so good, and even haunting, that I had a dream where my surroundings were witch world-esque.  The art was creepy at first, but it  grows on you.  I really liked it.  Perfect score.\nSound (10 points): 10\nReally hard to argue with the sound.  SFX were as creepy as the art.  BGM was probably a little thinner than most, but so many scores stuck with you.  Stuff I hadn't heard in a week, I still remembered.  The rest made it on my iPod.  Really hard to criticize a soundtrack that you're listening to in your spare time.\nEnjoyment (10 points): 10\nI never thought I'd watch an anime that I would like better than Clannad.  Till now.  Though it's close, this has to be my new favorite anime, and I doubt that will change anytime soon.  I spent several rewatches staying up until the wee hours of the morning simply because I couldn't put the series down long enough to go to sleep.  With that kind of obsession with Madoka Magica, I can't give it anything other than a 10 for enjoyment.\nTally that up, and the final score for the series is a whopping 98/100, good enough for an easy MAL score of 10.  Outrageous as it sounds, I've never had an anime that made me laugh, cry, and spend sleepless nights awake in a mixture of shock and horror as much as this one.  I truly enjoyed it fully, and if Kyuubey were real, I'd contract with him to let me watch this over and over again for the first time every time.\n        "},

It touches on all the usual tropes as if to prove it's a magical girl anime like any other but then it goes and departs from all of that and gives us something new and unique. The story keeps you yearning for that next episode. As of episode 9 it hasn't lost steam.\nThis is an adult-targeted magical girl show. It's dark, heavy-hitting, suspenseful and the battles with witches are glorious and ridiculous. I'd go so far as to call it Magical Girlin' Lagann.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=100,  ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Madoka Magica is a story of Hope, Friendship, Despair, Evil Fluffy Magical Creatures, Cotton Balls with Moustaches and Parasailing Men in Orange Jumpsuits.It's also the best damn anime Japan has put out in a rather long time.\nI hes­it­ate to use the word ‘sub­ver­sion’ when describ­ing Madoka Magica, as it’s a word thrown around by many, not under­stand­ing what it is Madoka is sub­vert­ing in the first place. What I see is a group of girls, who oth­er­wise would spend their time eat­ing cake, being cute and gen­er­ally being insuf­fer­ably nice to each other, hav­ing great powers given to them and then made to suf­fer because\n          \n        of it. This power is that of hav­ing their wish gran­ted in exchange for being a magical girl, some­thing other magical girl anime, and anime stor­ies in gen­eral, paint as being a glor­i­ous thing. How­ever in Madoka Magica, this wish and power bring each char­ac­ter noth­ing but des­pair. Not only do their lives effect­ively end because they became magical girls and suf­fer in the gruelling battles against the witches, their wishes that are meant to be an equi­val­ent trade off bring them noth­ing but more mis­for­tune as well.\nSub­ver­sion or not, the main appeal of Madoka Magica is what a per­fectly told story it is. There’s a very delib­er­ate and clear path behind each character’s devel­op­ment. I found Kaname Madoka’s devel­op­ment the most fas­cin­at­ing, espe­cially in con­trast with what she could have been. Because of her own wimp­i­ness and not becom­ing a magical girl, she keeps draw­ing more and more into her­self, get­ting increas­ingly depressed with everything that hap­pens to the girls around her. Shaft’s anim­a­tion, often one that is more gimicky than use­ful, add hugely to the story-telling here. The altern­ate dimen­sions of the witches are fright­en­ing and bizarre places. The back­grounds have become increas­ingly dreary as the series goes on, mim­ick­ing the change in tone and depres­sion of Madoka. Also spe­cial credit has to be given for the way they frame Kyubey.\nKyubey is mag­ni­fi­cent. In a show with a cast of rather for­get­table char­ac­ters, if mem­or­able stor­ies, Kyubey stands out as the most fas­cin­at­ing and deadly vil­lain since Johan Liebert of Mon­ster. Again, full credit has to be given to Shaft’s art­work and how they frame Kyubey. How his shad­ows cast over the girls, stand­ing on their shoulders or their win­dowsills, push­ing Madoka into becom­ing a magical girl her­self. How they fre­quently draw atten­tion to his unmov­ing expres­sion, one that doesn’t change no mat­ter what latest cata­strophe these girls he per­son­ally made magical girls face.\nBut what really makes him so chilling is how he simply doesn’t under­stand. What we and the char­ac­ters see as evil is at a level he can­not com­pre­hend. Kyubey isn’t evil, and never was, which is pre­cisely why he works so well. Pos­sibly the best line in the anime came in his con­ver­sa­tion with Madoka and why he made them magical girls, say­ing “if you feel like sac­ri­fi­cing your­self for the uni­verse, give me a call”. The heat death of the uni­verse is so far bey­ond any­thing Madoka her­self can com­pre­hend or care about, entropy not hav­ing any effect for a bizz­lion odd years, but equally Kyubey can’t under­stand why his actions cause the girls to hate him so much.\nThere are some prob­lems with Madoka Magica though. Well, one spe­cific prob­lem. The char­ac­ters are dull. Their stor­ies are fas­cin­at­ing, cer­tainly. I’ve got­ten pretty emo­tion­ally inves­ted in the wimpy­ness of Madoka and Homerun-chan the time trav­el­ling les­bian, but as people they simply don’t have much per­son­al­ity. Without Kyubey, this would just be yet another anime about a bunch of incred­ibly dull girls being insuf­fer­ably nice to each other, except with some occa­sion­ally nice visu­als. Well, not all nice visu­als. I’m rather par­tial to the square-head design of the char­ac­ters, but their facial fea­tures go rather array when the shot of it is any­thing other than a close-up.\nOver­all though, Madoka Magica is pretty fant­astic anime. It’s per­fectly con­struc­ted and very delib­er­ately paced, keep­ing enough rev­el­a­tions with each epis­ode to keep it riv­et­ing while keep­ing to the themes of the story without des­cend­ing into shock tac­tics for the sake of keep­ing out interest. They had to keep the twists com­ing, oth­er­wise the story would flounder when stuck with these bor­ing char­ac­ters, but it hasn’t done that once over the course of the show. Well, per­haps bar the first two epis­odes, but the speed at which it upped the ante after set­ting the scene means I’m will­ing to for­give the show for that.Heck, they even somehow managed to piece together an acceptable ending that fit the plot and themes of the story, something I really was not expecting.\nIn short, Madoka Magica is a bloody fantastic anime. It's not perfect, but damn is it ever entertaining. Highly recommended, perhaps not for a first-timer to the world of anime, but certainly for one who thinks anime hasn't been able to buy an original idea for years."},

There's just a certain art/animation style when it comes to the witches and their strange labyrinths that I didn't entirely care for.  It was too weird and trippy for me, and would have rather had those scenes match the artwork and animation of the rest of the anime, which was very beautiful and nicely done!  Still, I have to admit that the weirdness of the witch and labyrinth scenes did fit with the mood of the story.  8/10\n✿~ Sound ~✿\nTo tell the truth, I didn't notice the music very often during the episodes, but when I did, it was some amazing stuff! But that's one magical quality about music: there comes a point where you no longer hear the music... you feel it.  And when the story gets so powerful and emotional, and the music is equally powerful and emotional, it's a beautiful thing.  The intro song \"Connect\" and main credits theme \"Magia\" are especially good as well, and I'd often listen to them through instead of skipping past them.  9/10\n✿~ Characters ~✿\nI can't speak for anyone else, but my \"favorite character\" switched between each and every main character at some point throughout the anime!  They all have something special about them and have so much to give to the story, and I became deeply attached to them all in turn, which made for quite the emotional rollercoaster!  Any book or movie or show that can make me so emotionally invested in its characters definitely did it's job right!  10/10\n✿~ Enjoyment ~✿\nMy knee-jerk answer is that I most certainly enjoyed this anime!  But giving it some thought and thinking more critically, I have to admit that sometimes I did feel that it was progressing a little slow, or had some issues with certain aspects of the plot and character choices that I felt were unrealistic or just plain didn't make much sense to me, not to mention the wonky artstyle, etc.  So was it 100% perfect?  No, it wasn't, but far more often than not I was on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen!  And I will highly recommend this series to anyone who asks.  9/10\n✿~ Overall:  9/10 ~✿\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=78,   ["text"]="\nOf all the divisive figures in anime, very few can start flame wars like Gen Urobuchi. Most \"elite\" critics here on MAL and over on the bastion of sophisticated intellectuals that is 4chan, hate him and call him the Anti-Christ of anime. I personally find him extremely hit-or-miss. One thing Urobuchi has going for him is that like George RR Martin, he is a crusty old bastard that won't cave to fan demands and make a happy ending, sparing all of the fan favorite characters. When the viewer doesn't know who will live and who will die each week, it adds suspense and keeps things\n          \n        from getting boring and predictable. He also IS actually a competent writer that can create beloved characters and keep a steady tone with occasional bouts of witty and sophisticated dialogue. \"I have long since learned, as a measure of elementary hygiene, to be on guard when anyone quotes Pascal.\" The Achilles heel of Urobuchi is that the man doesn't have a creative bone in his body. ALL he does is rip off other authors, and he barely even tries to disguise it. Sometimes he doesn't even disguise it and explicitly mentions it, like Psycho Pass with the works of Philip K. Dick, notably Minority Report, a copy of which appears prominently in the background of one episode on a bookshelf! This generally means that the quality of the Urobuchi anime is directly dependent on what he is ripping off and if that work lends itself to easy adaptation.\nSo if Aldnoah Zero is a shitty Gundam ripoff and Psycho Pass is a surprisingly great adaptation of Philip K Dick's Minority Report, what is Madoka Magica ripping off? Mostly NGE actually. \"WHAT!? Those 2 series are nothing alike! This reviewer must be on crack!\" Allow me to explain what I mean. In the second half of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Anno decided to make it more of a psychoanalysis project, but during the first half, EVA was supposed to serve as a complete deconstruction of the \"teens pilot giant robots\" Mecha genre. A \"deconstruction\" , at least the way the term is used in conversation online, is when you break down a genre by identifying all the cheesy tropes and cliches, and turn them all around into something new. More often than not, this creates a dark new twist on the genre that basically shows what would happen if that genre happened in real life. For example, during the Gold and Silver Ages of American comics, costumed heroes received immense powers and never let that power corrupt them or isolate them from the rest of humanity. They fought crime without wanting anything in return, delivered cheesy one liners, and helped citizens basically all day out of the goodness of their hearts. This of course sounds completely bullshit and totally opposite of the dark reality that we all know and live in. In response, Alan Moore decided to create Watchmen to absolutely demolish American costume hero comics and show what would actually happen. The government uses super heroes to win wars by slaughtering millions of people, heroes develop God complexes, or are greedy, or are violent sociopaths. All of the cliches are turned upside down and all the bullshit assumptions of the genre were shattered. Neon Genesis Evangelion initially wished to do the same thing to the mecha genre and show why emotionally fragile teenagers suffering the angst that all teenagers naturally feel, would actually be HORRIBLE candidates to pilot giant robots and save the world from monsters. Madoka tries to be complete deconstruction of the \"magical girl\" genre of anime, which if that sounds like a stupid idea, it's because it honestly kind of is.\nWARNING: Some Spoilers!\nSo what does a genre deconstruction of \"magical girl\" anime look like? Exactly what you think it would look like. Little moe girls receive magical powers, but this time those powers always come at a tragic cost and everything is extremely grim and depressing. I won't spoil too much of the plot, but basically magical girls have to give up their souls in order to get their powers and spend their days fighting monsters that they will eventually turn into once they become too tainted. “Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.”-Nietzsche in his book \"Beyond Good and Evil\". \nHonestly, this WOULD have been a decent idea, if EVERYONE hadn't already done it before! Claymore did this back in the early 2000s! Berserk has dealt with this topic. Hellsing has dealt with this topic. Not only has everyone done it, but a LOT have done it better than Madoka did! As for the whole \"brilliant deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre, the freaking magical girl genre has ALWAYS been firmly tongue in cheek, so making a Sailor Moon version of Watchmen wasn't really warranted, it wasn't clever, it doesn't deserve heaps of praise! This anime is quite decent on a technical level with animation, voice acting, music, but I feel it is an insanely overrated series that didn't really even need to exist! EVERYTHING that this anime does and receives praise for, has already been done FAR better by loads of other series. Madoka isn't actually a bad anime, but it is NOT a freaking masterpiece that needs an 8.6 out of 10. If Watchmen in terms of quality as a groundbreaking deconstruction is on the 100th floor and Eva is on the 80th floor, Madoka Magica is somewhere around sub-basement 3. Madoka is basically a mediocre anime that receives absurd amounts of praise from noobs, who have no idea what a genre deconstruction is and think Madoka is groundbreaking and brilliant, when it actually isn't. In summary, FUCK this series! Although I DO love the pun that people keep shouting online: Rusev Madoka, Rusev Magica! It is rather rare to see Bulgarian/Japanese language puns. I guess if I had to pick the most positive thing Madoka contributed, it would be that.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=86,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    You know, I really can't stand it when an anime gets a lot of hype. Not only is most of the hype unnecessary and coming from crazed otaku's, but half the time that leads me to having high expectations and I'm almost always let down. Not to mention overhyped anime is usually the type to attract the harshest of critics and haters, ready to bash on it. So when I first started \"Madoka Magica,\" I was pretty much ready to be annoyed by the so-called \"dark themes\" and went into it with the idea that it was just another anime that can appeal to everyone.\nLet's\n          \n        just say that it deconstructed that whole idea just as well as it did the magical girl genre. \nBy now you probably know that \"Madoka Magica\" starts off just as any other magical girl anime, but then twists into something darker. You should know that the plot of this anime is a very complex thing and does indeed steer off into a darker corner then most magical girl animes. While \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the first mahou shoujo to have dark themes in it, it's shocking twists and turns are what make it so popular and praised, and it deserves a lot of it. The story's true nature is written out and presented in ways that can captivate you. It takes things you thought were true, characters you thought you knew, and is able to change them right before your eyes into something that fits the story's underlying dark side. \nSo \"Madoka Magica\" has a deeply rooted story with lots of sick changes to it's genre and therefore it's story is perfect. Well no. Actually one of the biggest faults in the story is the use of these twists and turns themselves.\nTwo words. Shock value. When a viewer sees something shocking, they'll probably start thinking, \"Wow! This got so cool!\" and the shock value therefore makes the story seem better. \"Madoka Magica\" is guilty of doing this a number of times. It's an easy thing that some viewers may catch onto quickly and could lower your overall viewpoint of the show. \"If the story didn't shock you so much, would it still be good?\" That's a question that \"Madoka Magica\" brings up, and the answer varies on your own ideas and opinions of it's plot, which I personally think would still be worth it's praise even if we knew from the start it would be a dark mahou shoujo. However it's still worth noting that the shock value, for the most part, has a purpose that helps keep the plot moving forward instead of just being there to keep you interested in the show. \nSpeaking of which, the plot moves forward VERY fast. With 12 episodes, the show is paced at a very high speed. The story basically takes you and dives you at top speed into everything, which is exactly why you don't even need the shock value to keep you wanting more. Things happen quickly which will probably excite you and make you want to keep going. Overall, the story is a much darker and deeper tale for it's genre, and is able to make up (but not cover up) its flaws with everything that it leads into and presents. \nThe fast pacing leads into one big problem though, and that's with the characters. The characters more or less fill in typical stereotypes to further the deconstruction of magical girls, but with the show moving at such a high speed aren't given much time for proper development - and in some cases not enough time to grow attached to you - which leads to some of them looking a bit flat. The lack of development in Madoka, our main girl, is one of the more irritating things that can easily get to you as the show progresses. Most of the development was used on the story, mind you - so in return for less character development we get a higher quality story. Despite all of this, the fact that these character types are thrown into this type of situation makes them and their actions far more interesting. \nBecause of the fast pacing, the characters may change a bit too quickly for one's liking, but in the end their changes reflect the very thing that triggered it all very nicely. Basically, the development that does occur matches the girl's current state in this deconstruction which is a plus. All the girls are capable of being likeable (Stereotypes? Likeable!? Yes, it is possible.) which is another high point of the series, it just all depends on your own preferences. In total, the characters were portrayed and played out very well, but sadly lacked in a few things because of the 12 episode time frame.\nOnto the artwork; if you're familiar with the studio SHAFT, masterminds behind the animation in titles like \"Bakemonogatari\" and \"ef - a tale of memories\" then you probably know what to expect from the artwork. While the character designs are given a very cute, typical, moe look, it's the backgrounds and animation that bring up the score to a 10. The setting is one that matches a futuristic background, and the details used to bring this out are outstanding. The quality is extremely high, nearly meeting that of a movie's. The witch's labyrinth's gives off an ominous feeling - equal to the show's true nature as well and have such a unique design to them that can leave you staring in wonder. \nThe only downside to the art is the very \"cute\" designs given to the characters, not to mention since it seems SHAFT put their all into the fight scenes, witch's lairs, etc. the characters sometimes look disproportional or even unfitting in a scene. But hey, that was the goal, right? Remember; deconstruction. Still, everything else that this top-notch animation does right makes up for it without a doubt. Simply put - while character designs are a bit lackluster, everything else around them is animated and designed at such a high quality that it's natural to be left awestruck.\nThe soundtrack is done by Yuki Kajiura, and is like the artwork and animation - top-notch. The OST has some extremely memorable and emotional songs that are bound to grow attached to you. Kajiura's style matches perfectly with this anime's style, which just makes the soundtrack even more amazing. It's pretty diverse and I highly doubt you'll be able to forget about it, even if you end up hating this anime. The blend or orchestral sounds, chimes, all of it is done with such great, notable effort. \nAll the seiyuus fit their roles very well. As for dub/sub, I don't recommend the dub at all. While I'm not a dub bashed, it's simply not good and the voice actors just aren't able to match the characters nor live up to the original Japanese version.\nEnjoyment? Honestly, I didn't think I would enjoy this all that much. Like I said, series that are hyped up with deep stories usually come off flat to me. Not this show, though. No, \"Madoka Magica\" is not a complete masterpiece, nor is it flawless or the best thing you'll ever lay your eyes on. It had flaws just like any anime will, but these flaws are things that can be overlooked if you're able to see the positives and enjoy what \"Madoka Magica\" has to offer you. \nOverall, \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the most perfect anime ever and isn't something that everyone can watch and like, and for good reasons, too. But despite this, it's still possible for anyone to still enjoy and love this distorted take on the mahou shoujo genre for all the positives that it has to offer, just as long as you accept it's flaws, too. I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mahou shoujo, action, the ever-famous horror genre, and who's ready to take off on the twisted and more mingled road of magical girls. \nOverhyped? Yes, but with all the wonderful things that this show has to offer, I can understand why. Try it - it's one hell of a ride on the sinister side of mahou shoujo. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=74,   ["text"]="                          \n    I want to start this review off by stating that I absolutely loved this anime. Very few anime manage to capture my attention enough to compel me to spend time reading wikis and even going as far as doing research. In fact, I loved Madoka so much that I watched it twice within a week, mainly to see if I could pick up on any details that I missed during my first watching. I was particularly interested in all the supposed references and parallels to Goethe's works (namely, Faust), but as I am unfamiliar with German literature, I honestly couldn't discern much. But, I digress.\n          \n        As difficult as it may be, I try to be as objective as possible with my ratings. This task is particularly difficult to accomplish with Madoka, as I would love with all my heart to say that it is an unparalleled masterpiece. But it simply isn't. And I will try my best to explain why.\nI can't say that I'm a fan of or that I've had much experience with the magical girl genre of anime. I've watched Sailor Moon, and that's about the extent of my exposure to this particular genre. Therefore, I feel unqualified to talk about genre clichés and whatnot, so I won't say anything like, \"Madoka Magica redefined the magical girl genre with its twisted and dark plot\" or \"Madoka Magica is a refreshing break from the classic cheerful magical girl animes\".  \nFrom a completely objective standpoint, Madoka had a compelling and intriguing plot.  It starts off not unlike the typical magical girl anime (or so I would presume): we are introduced to the protagonist Madoka Kaname and her friends Sayaka Miki and Hitomi Shizuki in a typical middle/high school environment. The mascot character of the series, Kyuubey, appears shortly and offers to grant Madoka and Sayaka any wish under the condition that they become magical girls and dedicate their lives to fighting malicious beings called witches which, apparently, are the cause for many unexplained accidents and suicides. Sounds like a simple and innocent proposition, doesn't it? But, obviously, there's more to it that. The story, in short, follows Madoka as she gradually learns of the hardships and suffering that befalls all the girls who choose to accept Kyuubey's offer, and truth behind the witches and the seemingly good-natured concept of wish-granting.    \nThe plot definitely introduces one of the more creative concepts I've encountered in my history of watching anime. To be frank, I can guarantee that you will never be bored at any point during the series. The action is fast-paced, the drama is effective but never overdone, and the shock value alone is enough to keep you at the edge of your seat.\nSo where does Madoka fail to live up to my expectations?  \nOne of the biggest issues I have with the series is its choice of Madoka as the central character.  Simply put, she just doesn't have what it takes to be an effective protagonist. Remember what I said about her being thrown into a situation where she is forced to cope with the consequences of becoming a magical girl? In a sense, I lied. She is never really faced with that situation, because she is always on the sidelines, watching the action unfold around her. It is due to this reason that we simply cannot sympathize with her and her story in the same way that would if she had played a more important role. It's difficult for the audience to feel like they are part of the show because, frankly speaking, Madoka isn't part of the show. It honestly feels as if she could be demoted to the role of the narrator, and it wouldn't make a difference as far as the unfolding of the events is concerned. Until, of course, the last episode. \nOn the topic of the last episode, I must admit that I was thoroughly confused throughout the majority of it. Those of you who have seen the anime will probably know what I mean. I also can't say that I enjoyed the way the series ended. It was, by all means, a satisfactory resolution to a series for which I had difficulty predicting an ending, but, in hindsight, it came across as borderline absurd. Madoka's sudden and drastic change of personality was not in the least bit convincing, and, as bittersweet as the conclusion was, I had a hard time believing that a middle school-aged girl could muster up the courage to show such a huge sense of responsibility and selflessness.  \nI would honestly like to discuss some of the plotholes that cause the believability factor of the series to waver, but doing so would inevitable lead to some major spoilers. I suppose some of them are minor enough to the point that they can be overlooked, but as a highly critical person, I found them difficult to ignore. Hopefully, those of you who have watched or are planning to watch the anime will be able to set these flaws aside and not let them affect your enjoyment of the series.  \nIf I were to rate the art of the series on character design alone, I wouldn't be able to give Madoka more than a 5. I simply did not like the way the characters looked. I've heard that the characters look much better in the manga, and apparently not even the animation in the anime did the manga justice. The series has often been criticized for reusing the same bland appearance for all five of its magical girl characters, and this criticism is justified. But it becomes pretty obvious when the witches show up that the characters weren't the major focus of the animation team. \nThe first thing that came into my mind during the first witch fight was that the animation must have been inspired by LSD-induced hallucinations. Although that opinion never really changed throughout the series, I grew to appreciate the witch sequences so much that I was more excited to see the design of a witch's lair than the battle against the witch herself. The sequences feature some of the best examples of surrealist imagery I have ever seen. I guess it's to be expected of a studio that produces art-driven anime like SHAFT. In addition, I love how many elements of a witch's past are (presumably) incorporated into the design of her lair as well, undoubtedly leading to fan speculation on the histories of the many witches featured in the anime. \nThe animation is very fluid and the fight sequences are crisp and well-choreographed. I don't really have any comments or complaints about the non witch lair environments either, although the fact that all the buildings seem to made out of glass really stands out. It gives you the impression that the story is set in a futuristic world. Overall, the series is visually attractive, if one can overlook the mishaps in character design.\nSimply put, the soundtrack is flawless. The background music never once fails to enhance the atmosphere and manages to evoke a wide array of emotions. You know that you've found an amazing soundtrack when you can enjoy listening to it without the visuals presented in the animation. My personal favourite is Sayaka's Miki theme; although it seems like a joyful song on the surface, a melancholic undertone can be detected upon careful listening. Homura Akemi's theme stands as well, because it is quite representative of her character - cold, mysterious, and spine-chilling.   \nThe opening theme, Connect, is a pretty generic J-pop song, suitable for any magical girl anime. The cheerful opening also presents you with images of Madoka engaged in typical magical girl activities, lulling you into a \"false sense of security\". The ending theme is much more consistent with the atmosphere of the series, and I think the decision to not use it until the third episode was justified. Although unrelated to sound, I must also mention that both themes change visually as the story progresses. I won't discuss all the details, but one of the more interesting changes is that the ending becomes darker and darker every episode, reflecting the gradual descent of the characters into despair.    \nThe seiyuus did a great job on the voice acting, and I honestly can't say I have any complaints sub-wise. I particularly loved Kato Emiri's convincing performance as Kyuubey, as her voice remained consistent with his emotionless character throughout the entire series. \nWhile I loved most of the main characters of the show, especially Homura, from a subjective point of view, it's hard to ignore the fact that the series has some problems in this department. \nI have already discussed Madoka's failure as a protagonist in the story section of the review. In addition to this unforgivable \"identity crisis\", it would be an understatement to say that Madoka is one of the least interesting main characters in anime history. There honestly isn't much to her other than the fact that she's your average middle school girl faced with a not-so-average dilemma. Why the writers decided to centre the entire story around her is honestly completely beyond my comprehension. She does, however, change in the last two episodes and develops an independent mindset and sense of justice. Unfortunately, this drastic change in personality is all too sudden and happens too late in the series to rectify her initial shallowness. \nOn the other side of the spectrum is the mysterious Homura Akemi. She's enigmatic, seemingly emotionless, and doesn't say or do much for the majority of episodes apart from the repetitive \"do not become a magical girl\" warnings to Madoka and occasional deus ex machina. We do find out later why she has developed into the type of person that she is, justifying most, if not all, of her actions.  However, it's honestly difficult to feel sympathy for her because her personality is introduced too late in the series in the span of a single episode. Forgive me for speaking the truth, Homuhomu-chan. I still love you, though.\nMy feelings towards the tomboyish Sayaka are mostly positive. I loved how her descent into hopelessness and despair was portrayed in such a relentless manner. I did feel sympathy for her because, unlike Madoka, she had a strong sense of justice from the start, but her childish naiveté led to her eventual downfall. The subplot with Kyosuke, although extremely generic, was also a welcome addition to the series, as it shed light onto her character and motivations and showed the extent to which she was affected upon learning about the 'fine print' of the magical girl contract.\nAdmittedly, I found that Kyouko had the most interesting personality out of the five magical girls. She's cynical, selfish, hotheaded, and even reveals her sadistic side to Sayaka. Not exactly the formula for a likeable character, is it? However, when the story eventually sheds some light on her past, you begin to understand why she acts the way she does and she becomes even more interesting. It's quite regrettable that she is a major player in so few episodes.  \nAs for Mami, there isn't much to say about her, and it isn't exactly her fault. She has a motherly and optimistic character and introduces Madoka and Sayaka to the world of magical girls, but doesn't play a major role in the story.\nFinally, a couple of words on Kyuubey. He doesn't have much of a personality, and once again, it's not his fault. He initially seems good-natured and innocent, but you soon realize that this isn't the case. It isn't difficult to guess that his intentions are not pure and his manipulative side suggests that he has ulterior motives.\nOverall, I think the biggest problem of the series is that the seemingly less important characters contribute much more to the enjoyability of the story  than those who are essentially forced into the spotlight without much depth to offer.\nI will say this one more time. I love Madoka Magica and I enjoyed every second of it. And that's why this review was so difficult for me to write. I wanted to present to the community a completely unbiased view on an anime that has been constantly revered as \"the best anime of 2011\" and even \"one of the best animes of all time\". The verdict? It simply does not deserve the amount of praise it gets.  \nDon't get me wrong. I would definitely recommend Madoka to anyone without a second thought. Don't let this review change your mind about watching Madoka. After all, it isn't fair to judge an anime based on the opinions of another person. At the end of the day, I guess all that matters is whether or not you enjoy the anime personally. \n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=73,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is one of the most deceptive works I have ever laid my eyes on, and that is why it is amazing. From the very start, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" appears to be pretty much what you would expect from your typical magical girl anime. The only difference being of course, the seemingly out of place art style that you would attribute to it being a SHAFT production. This is of course what the show wants you to think, as it prepares to take your expectations and slap you in the face with them. Suddenly, the Salvador Dali style of animation doesn't seem that out\n          \n        of place anymore, and that is when you realize you are watching something special.\nIn this review I am going to limit myself to what I consider to be the two most interesting aspects of this show. The writing, and the art. The review contains moderate amounts of spoilers.\nWRITING:\nThis was the first of Gen Urobuchi's works that I had the privilege to experience and I have since watching it, sought after anything else that he has been involved in. His name only, has become enough for me to check out a work, be it anime, book, or visual novel. He has a very peculiar, unorthodox style of writing. It isn't by any means flawless and I am sure that a lot of people would find it off-putting, but when it works, it is golden. Urobuchi's writing is all about deception through the clever use of turning-points and unexpected, yet logical developments.\nIf \"Madoka\" was a conventional story, it would use the first few episodes to establish a premise (magical girl anime), follow it up by introducing some sort of main direction for the story (defeat bad guys, save people, etc), introduce an eventual villain, end it with a climactic battle, and perhaps wrap it up with an epilogue of some sort.\nInstead, the premise for the beginning of the story is dropped almost immediately, only for the story to head in several completely different directions that are in a similar fashion dropped along the way, either because they were only there to decieve you in the first place, or because they only serve as a foundation for what is to come. The true nature of the story isn't established until it is a bit over half way through. Homura's story is only told right before they are about to head towards the show's climax. To put it simply, if at the start of the show, you think Madoka will become a magical girl by the end of the first or second episode, you will have to guess again... and again... and again... and again... and by the time you have given up playing guessing games, you will find yourself unexpectedly in love with a story that you never would have guessed was coming.\nThere is no real villain as \"Walpurgisnacht\" is treated more as an apocalyptic weapon than as an actual character, and \"Kyubee\" though he may technically be the source of all the destruction, he isn't by any means acting out the role of an antagonist. In the same sense, Madoka isn't exactly the kind of protagonist you would find in a magical girl show. She is powerless, afraid, unstable, and generally helpless to the horrors that surrounds her. Homura on the other hand, is where the heart of the show lies. Her actions, her efforts, her beginning, middle, and end, are the most defining aspect of the show.\nIf you are expecting a more conventional story, this kind of writing might rub you the wrong way, but for me, it was amazing. At the end of the show when I think back on what I have just watched, it amazes me how much it contrasts in where it starts, where it goes, and where it ends up. It really feels like a journey, and it leaves me breathless, staring up at the ceiling in silent awe. Of course, you can never achieve the same experience on a second viewing as you are already prepared for everything beforehand, but that first time you watch it is an experience unlike any other.\nART:\nThis show is absolutely beautiful. If you took away all of what I have already mentioned above, leaving only the art and preferably the music, I would have still loved it. As a big sucker for deranged animation and surrealist art styles, \"Madoka\" is right up my alley, reminding me of works such as Mamoru Oshii's \"Angel's Egg\", Tatsuo Sato's \"Cat Soup\", and even of German expressionism from the 1920's such as \"The cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", or \"Metropolis\". The art itself is very imaginative and vivid. My favourite part is the scene that is done completely in silhouettes.\nMy best recommendation is to watch the enhanced bluray version that even goes back and adds extra changes in the animation throughout the series, creating an even stronger effect, and making the experience all the more complete.\nHowever, just like the story, the real beauty of the animation isn't the art itself, but how it is used. The surreal mode only kicks in when there is a witch nearby, meaning all other scenes are drawn in a relatively normal style of animation. Most notable are the character designs. The characters were all designed by Ume Aoki, author of Hidamari Sketch, who was never told what the show was about. She actually thought she was designing characters for a regular magical girl anime. Thus we have the perfect illusion of an innocent, saccharine, moe, girly looking show for when the art style is in normal mode. More importantly though, it also makes for an amazing contrast when the setting suddenly changes into surreal mode, and the cuteness of the characters make it all the more jarring when seeing the horrible environment that surrounds them. In fact, combining cuteness with horror seems to be a running theme in all aspects of this show, be it art, story, characters, music, etc. Combining opposites in a fictional work is somewhat of a risk but \"Madoka\" manages it exceptionally well, creating something rather unique.\nThere is much more to discuss about \"Madoka\". The Faustian themes of the story, the cosmic horror aspect, the deconstruction aspect (as well as the reconstruction aspect), the amazing soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura, the characters, the production, the story itself, etc. A single review simply cannot bring it justice, as even this one that barely scratches the surface has already dragged on for too long. As for concluding words, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" is an experience that you cannot afford to miss. The story is rich, it is provocative in more ways than one, it is unique, it looks great, it sounds great, it is a must see.\n        "},

I\n          \n        said most likely.\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\n\nStory: (10/10) (SPOILERS)\nThe story starts of with Madoka, a middle schooler of Mitakihara Middle School. One day, she had an encounter with a cute creature called Kyuubey and revealed that he can grant any wish she wants and in return, needs to make a contract with Kyuubey and become a Magical girl. Sounds fun and cute right? Yes, that's what the show wants you to believe. In the first 2 episodes, it starts of as just fun and cute and typical girls life. However, after the 3rd episode, the show starts to show off its true nature and begins to creep you a little bit and makes you wonder what's really going on in this universe. Every episode, the episode gets darker and darker and after the 10th episode, the show reveals the true full nature of the universe. Believe it or not, time travel/time altering is involved here and the show managed to make it work. It's a rare case because most shows today just f*cks up the story line when time travel/time altering is involved but here it was kind of easy to follow and no brainf*cks. Now here's my reasons on why I think the storyline of the show is a masterpiece. Firstly, one of the concepts of the show which is \"Would you do everything just to save your friend's life? Even if it affects your life\"? You wouldn't know that this concept was being used before watching the 10th episode. Why do I like this concept? Because it's an effective and dramatic story telling tool. It really shows how Homura deeply cared for Madoka. So much that she even kept time travelling just to figure out how to save here. She has been doing this for about 100 times and this obviously affected her emotionally and her personality even changed.  Secondly, the quote \"with great power comes with great responsibility\". It fits really well into the story. In the 2nd episode, the show makes you think that being a Magical Girl will make your life a bit easier since you now have magical powers. 3rd episode and further on proves that it isn't. There will be consequences to pay, including your life. Mami and Sayaka died and you know that they will never come back. Finally, the unexpected but happy ending. I thought that Madoka will make a wish, fight the final boss and they live happily ever after. That's not what exactly happened. I don't want to go through the details of the ending but all I want to say is it ended happy and extremely sad at the same time. The ending did feel a little bit rushed but I guess it's acceptable because of the fact that the show only had 12 episodes. \n\nArt/Animation: (9/10)\nThe animation might not be perfect but it was still great. The environment looked great and the labyrinth design looked weird but in a good way. Same goes for monster and witches design. They look weird but in a good way. The main and supporting character's design is what fooled me into thinking that this show was going to be some magical girls crap. I'm usually not a fan of these kinds of character design because they looked....well....unrealistic. Well, as they say, don't judge a book by its cover.  \n\nSound: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\nSoundtrack didn't get a perfect score from me because not every theme I've heard was worth listening to. There are some that gave me a few goosebumps. How about the voice actors? Are they annoying? Nope and I loved every single voices here. I watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to give my opinions on English Dub VA. In my opinion, they were great, considering the fact that I've heard them before and they didn't sound horrible on the previous shows either. 4 of the main characters which is Homura, Madoka, Kyuubey and Hitomi were voiced by the VA who also voiced one of my favourite characters which is Mio, Azusa, Ritsu, and Tsumugi from K-On. One of the main characters which is Sayaka was voiced by the VA who also voiced Lizbeth from Sword Art Online. I absolutely loved her voice as Lizbeth and she was even more glorious to hear here. Now, the OP and ED soundtrack. Only 1 OP was used and I thought it was ok. Although, the opening was misleading (in a good way) and it felt like the 2nd Opening from SAO. By the tenth episode however, my opinions on the opening changed. You find out the lyrics is sung in Homura's point of view and the clips shown in the opening were actually Madoka's past timeline. Now my opinion on the OP song is it's great and very emotional.\n 3 ED's were used. The 1st ED was also misleading and great. However, ED 2 which was sung by Kalafina is one of the greatest ED songs I've ever heard. It fitted the plot twist that happened after episode 3 ended. Never heard the 3rd ending because I skipped it.\n\nCharacter: (10/10) (SPOILERS)\nYou thought the characters are going to be cute and all moe shit? Yea, keep believing that because that's what the show wants you to believe. At least, for the first 3 episodes. After watching the 3rd episode, the show will slap you so hard and that's where the characters faces the reality of being a magical girl. The show realistically depicts the struggles these characters go through each episode and that's what I loved most about the show. It also depicts the bonds and friendship these girls have towards each other. Which character do I like most? I'd go with Homura. If you read my review on the story section then you already know why. The show gave these characters some character development. Especially Homura. It will hit you right in the junk if you watch Homura's past. \n\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\nA perfect score from me. Why? Because of how the show tricked its viewers, making them believe that this was going to be some happy moe crap. Man, the drama and emotions at Ep. 10 and towards the end of the series really hit me so hard. So hard that I even shed a few tears and this is coming from a guy who rarely cries when I'm watching TV shows. \n\nOverall: (9.6/10)\nAs much as I want to give this anime a perfect score of 10, I just can't. When I rate an anime a score of 10, everything has to be perfect. What I mean by everything is Story, Animation, Sountrack, and the Characters. Since the Animation and Soundtrack didn't get a perfect score due to reasons I listed above, the anime will not get a 10.\nOverall, it's an enjoyable anime to watch and earned a spot for my \"Favourite Anime\" list. DO NOT let the cover and the plot synopsis fool you. Same thing happened to me too. I watched the first and second episode and I was like \"People love this sh*t\"? After the 3rd episode, I was like \"Oh Jesus Christ, I see\". \n\nPros:\n-Show tricked everyone\n-Not what you were expecting\n-Outstanding and Dramatic Story\n-Great Animation\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Great Characters\n\nCons:\n-Ending felt a little bit rushed\n\nDo I need a closing sentence? If I do then this is my closing sentence:\nEverything is a LIE!!!! "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=68,   ["text"]="                          \n    [Open your mind cause the reviews are esoteric YO]\nAfter suffering another long absence and subsequently ameliorating my punctuation and grammar(go read my first few reviews), I decided I would spice things up a notch by reviewing a critically acclaimed and popular series from last year. The question is, has Puella Magi Madoka Magica managed to escape the turd train? Read—OBEY!— and find out. That being said, without further ado, I now introduce the long awaited sequel to the perpetually incomplete reviewing saga that is Daimyo.\nStory 7/10\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica, is a seminal anime from the year 2011 directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and written by Gen\n          \n        Urobuchi.\nIn order to gain a proper understanding of this anime, you must first understand the story. If possible I'd like to do without drawing out too many spoilers; but this storyline is such a bucket of shit, that if I don't at least attempt explain some of the finer details, you'll fuck up your galoshes as you tread through my review. Now I must profess, it has been quite some time since I completed this show, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in any of my accounts. Basically, what we have is a story about a bunch of fucking girls doing girly stuff. Drinking tea, designing costumes, discussing boys; or at least that's what the show wants you to believe in the beginning. You're quickly brought to reality —as real as a show about a bunch of girls can get—. We are soon led into a world of deceit, jealousy, paradox, paradox, paradox and more paradox. We're missing a key point here, though. Why is all of this happening? What if I told you, it's because there is some race of super advanced aliens granting little girl's eternal youth and the power to make 1 wish, just so they can feast on the power created by their happiness and misery, thereby, restoring balance to the universe and creating a thermal energy source for future generations to enjoy. Yea you'd probably tell me to stop smoking crack. Who came up with this shit? What ever the original intention of this show, I can confidently tell you that this show is more than hilarious. If you're the right kind of bastard, you'll laugh for days while you watch this. Which is even easier to do with the show's shabby visuals and balls on the wall animation—2011 and they still fucked things up—. Seriously, whoever drew this show can't draw a straight line. Must have masturbated too much to the visuals or something. This is of course emphasized by the fact that almost everything on this show seems spontaneous; like literally they were pulling plot developments and twists out of a hat (Constanza). \nAll of this is kind of bearable, but there's one thing you just won't be able to stand. This is a 12 episode series, and I swear to Jehova they were talking for 5 fucking episodes straight. We don't give a fuck about tea parties, violin players, or any of your shitty lives. I just want to see you guys kill and beat the shit out of things. I mean some would call it character development, but in my opinion, it's more like degradation. Though a show like this does have it charms, it's limited by the fact that once again, it is just about a bunch of fucking little girls. These tough enough girl shows lose credibility. Like that Higurashi show, it's just a bunch of none sense. The only time you need to be afraid of a girl, is if she has a gun pointed at you, poisons your food, tries to kill you in your sleep or proposes to marry you. Actually, those are a lot of times to be afraid. Be very afraid of this show's plot, very afraid...\nCharacters 4/10\nThe show stars the titular character Madoka. Who is, without a doubt, the worst character in the whole series. I don't know of any other series that immediately comes to mind, where the main character gets away with doing almost nothing of importance but somehow has the whole series revolving around them.  The only way to describe Madoka, is as a nuisance that just won't go away. A pain in the ass that never heals, she's there right from episode 1 all the way to the end. There's just nothing to like about her: over optimistic, too damn kind for her own good, cheesy, nosey, you name it. She's everything you hate in a shoujo character cranked to 11.  What makes her even her even worse, is her neh neh neh voice. I mean all characters in this show are guilty of this. Then they have her played out like she's some sort of God. Because all the female characters are like Gods these days or something. If her name wasn't in the title of this show, she'd be completely un- necessary. \nNext up, Akemi Homura, who continues the trend of the quiet emo girl being the strongest. Hardcore dyke though, because behind that tough girl exterior, she can't live her life without Madoka. How this came to be? I don't even fucking know. Didn't make much sense to me even when they explained it.\nSayaka Miki, the next dumbass in this series. I think I established earlier, that when these Alien overlords come to steal your emotional resources, they offer you the chance to make 1 wish. This stupid bitch wishes for some guy who didn't even like her to get healed. You heard that right. This dumb fuck gets 1 free wish, could have been wealth, power, you fucking name it but no she blows it on a whim. That's like some female intelligence and logic right there. If she was going to go that route, why not wish for the power to heal people, then use it to heal him, then become some sort of doctor and use it to scam millions out of people. You know why she didn't think of this? Because all the characters in this show are over-emotional retards. She'd rather mope around and then watch as the man she wasted her wish on to heal and tended to everyday in the hospital, falls in love with someone else. \nMami Tomoe, is like this show's Kamina. But since this show is nothing like TTGL, she's completely full of shit. I mean she's like one of those soft spoken, know-it-all characters that sip tea and fuck knows else.\nKyoko Sakura, is the least obnoxious character on this show. Which really isn't saying much. Somehow, she ends up being the one I detest the least. That does not mean, I like her the best. She has a rough start, though. I mean they introduced her as the new selfish bitch, but unlike the other characters on this show, she actually progressed. \nKyubey is like some evil deranged version of some shitty mahou shojo luna/kerobero type character. He's a no good son of a bitch, is all you need to know. \nThe problem with most of the characters in this show, is that they all make me want to jump in and punch the shit out of them. Yea, yea, yea, I know they're GURLS. But seriously, wasting my motherfucking time like that, that's a low blow, bro. They're lucky anime budgets are so low these days,  that they could only afford 12 episodes. Imagine this steaming pile of donkey shit as a full blown out 26 episode series.\nEnjoyment 7/10\nI enjoyed this show a lot more than I thought I would. Somewhere I must have missed out when they giving membership passes to this show, my little pony and other similar sensation shows. From reading this review, you can tell I enjoyed it for the wrong reasons.\nMusic 5/10\nJust your usual generic j-pop. Nothing special here. No memorable themes even. Or so I'd like to say. I ended up giving this show a pass due to the first opening. Pretty good stuff. \"See You Tomorrow\" by Aoi; investigate. \nArt 3/10\nThey no can draw straight lines. Daimyo no can make sentences...\nOverall 5/10\nOverall, you're just going to put this show in shit territory like Angel Beats. However, where I saw Angel Beats had the potential to be better, I just don't see how this show could get any better. That is, short of an alien invasion and all the characters getting killed. This show is a solid 5.5. While it's not always good to use my previous reviews as a scale —seeing as I gave Hareluya II boy a 9 lol—. To give you an idea on how I view it compared to other shows I've done, it's better than maken-ki but worst than angel beats. Thankfully, I had the privilege and opportunity to watch other shows from 2011, that I deem to be better, fate/zero and kaiji S2 , for example. So if you're still reading this review at this point, go watch those instead.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is one of the most overrated anime ever made. Yes, I said it, attack me fanboys! For heavens sake, please stop worshipping this show, it certainly isn't bad but it is not a religion or something. Maybe I sounded a bit salty, excuse me, Madoka (I'm not going to write down the whole name twenty times) is actually a decent, above average anime. But it's not a masterpiece, thanks to plot holes and poorly written characters. If you want to know what's exactly wrong with it, I suggest that you keep reading, if you are a Madoka-fanboy/girl please stay away, I\n          \n        don't want to hurt your precious feelings. \n~story~ 5/10\nThis anime is praised by a lot of people for being the first and best deconstruction of the magical girls genre, surprise: it's not! Revolutionary Girl Utena and maybe even Princess Tutu did the same thing long before Madoka was created and they did it better. Why? Because these two series did not only rely on shockfactor and (over the top) drama, like Madoka did. Yes, the plot twist is quite good, but your story is not supposed to rely on one plot twist! And there wasn't any foreshadowing. So even though the plot twist is quite interesting, it's certainly not the best moment in anime history. Also, the drama was a little bit over the top, \"look, everybody suffers\", \"look, everybody suffers more\", \"you're supposed to feel for the characters and cry your eyes out\", \"look even more suffering!\" \"WHY ARE YOU NOT CRYING?!\" Yes, I know it, being a magical girl sucks, but I just didn't care for these characters, because they're so bland. And I'm not going to care for them if you make them suffer more, give them an interesting personality instead.\nOkay, I got a bit carried away, let's just start with the story: our cute main character Madoka lives an everyday life with her loving family and best friend Sayaka. She and her best friend meet two other girls, Homura and Mami and an cute looking alien called Kyubey. Homura tries to kill Kyubey and Mami protects him and tells our main character that she is a magical girl and made a contract with Kyubey. Apparently if you make a contract with Kyubey, he grants one wish and you become a magical girl. Magical girls have to fight witches to protect other humans. Madoka and Sayaka are quite interested in becoming a magical girl until 'something' happens. After that the darker sides of being a magical girl appear. And what follows is despair, struggling and crying, oh and another plot twist near the end of the story. Of course I'm not going to spoil everything in case you haven't seen Madoka, but this anime is not only known for the cute looking characters..... \nOne of problems I had with this anime was the pacing, it starts of very slow but after the first half the story seems really rushed. \nAlso, info dumping, Kuybey was supposed to be an emotionless being that did not care about humans, but he starts monologuing out of nowhere to tell the viewers how something works or why. That's really weird because why would he do that? It's not like he cares about the other characters, so why would he tell them random stuff, even if they don't ask for it? It's just a lazy way to explain the viewer what's going on. Also, making important female figures (like Joan of Arc) magical girls was hilarious and really stupid, same thing goes for the idea that the universe can only exist if there is enough teen angst. And my last problem was with the ending, it was weird, not fully explained, but of course a lot of fans loved because it was tragic and sad, and emotions are more important than logic, right? No.\nBut the story is not extremely bad, it had epic fights and the psychological problems of the characters were intriguing, though this could have been way better, if there were more episodes and a little bit less over the top drama.\n[CONCLUSION]\nIt is interesting, but it wasn't half as good as some fans claim it is. Te story had some serious issues with the pacing and there was just too much drama. Also there was a lot of lazy info dumping and the story relied on 'feels' and plot twists, sadly enough the story was really promising, a shame that it turned out like this. And I really disliked the ending, fusing with the universe, what?! So Urobuchi, I know that you're regarded as one of the best writers in the world of anime, but the writing of your 'masterpiece' is not that good. \n~animation~ 8/10\nIn loved the art, everything looks cute at first and because of this, the viewers are (even more) shocked when a certain thing happens. The art during the battles was... weird and really awesome, when the characters battle the witches everything looked very bizarre and surreal. The art was really good, though I personally disliked the way the characters looked at first, too cute and their faces looked like blocks. But it works and after a while I got used to it. \n[CONCLUSION]\nThe animation is great, especially during the battles. Though it gives you the feeling like you're on drugs. The character designs were certainly unique but I personally disliked them, but if you watch the show you'll know why the animators used this style.\n~sound~ 9/10\nThe opening 'Connect' is a cute song and I understand why the creators decided to use this song. The ending 'Magia' is darker and fits the show better, so I liked the opening and the ending. The OST's were also very good, especially 'Sis Puella Magica'. The background music was used the right way, every song fitted the scene in which it was used. So great job!\n[CONCLUSION]\nThe music was really good, the opening, the ending and the OST's. Also, the voice acting was really good. The music was the best part of this anime (that's not an insult, but a compliment for the music)\n~characters~ 3/10\nYou could have replaced the main character (Madoka) with a brick and the first 9 episodes would have been exactly the same! Our main character has only one character trait that really stands out: she cries a lot, oh and she has a lot if cheesy lines which she screams at her friends in the most annoying and whiny way possible. The characters were by far the worst part of this anime, our main character is at first plain annoying but it gets even worse, (spoiler) our main character (the whiny little girl) turns into a godlike being and is now part of the universe or something like that.... really creators, really. The other characters aren't that good either, Sayaka is the happy, tomboyish best friend but later turns in a tragic heroine (or that is what she could have been if she wasn't that stupid and cliche) and her friendship with Kyouko is stupid, (\"I want to kill, because lolz\", two days later \"I actually respect you\", a week later \"Let's die for each other\") this is not how friendships work, Kyouko is a just a one dimensional evil girl that gets a sad backstory and also turns into a tragic heroine. And Homura at least gets some proper character development, though a bit over the top (and her friendship/obsession with Madoka is somewhat creepy) oh and they also tried to make her a tragic heroin. Mami wasn't developed at all. There was only one character that interested me, Kyubey. He is quite intriguing, not really evil but not good either. One problem, his logic is really flawed (I have to get witches otherwise the universe is doomed, oh the witches are gone, still no problems with the universe because of plot convenience). All in all, the characters acted stupid. And they are either annoying little girls or a goddess because of weird logic. Also, their psychological problems were not nearly as interesting as they could have been.  \n[CONCLUSION]\nOur main character is annoying, weak and stupid during the first 10 episodes and after that she's just weird. Oh and almost everyone was just a stereotype with weird relationships with each other (Sayaka and Kyouko, Homura and Madoka). Kyubey could have been a great villain, but he wasn't thanks to his flawed logic, still he was an interesting character.\n~enjoyment~ 7/10\nThis is a show about girls fighting witches with all kinds of weird weapons and the world seems to be on drugs, yes this show was enjoyable. But I had the feeling that it started very slow and I was really done with Madoka's crying after the fifth time. As I said before, this show could have been way more interesting if the psychological issues of the characters were handled better. Also during the middle of the show, it got rushed and the pacing was a bit off. But it got really interesting again after the ninth episode.  \n[CONCLUSION]\nThe battles were really enjoyable, but there were some pacing problems and because of this, the story was rushed and not everything was properly explained. Also some characters (including the main character) were a pain. Because of this the anime wasn't as enjoyable and good as it could have been, this was a pity, because this anime could have been a masterpiece! Still it's enjoyable and an anime that every real anime fan should have seen. I'm not a fan of this anime, but I certainly did not hate it, it was a decent anime, nothing more and nothing less.\nPeace!\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=60,   ["text"]="                          \n    People may praise this anime to the skies but I think otherwise. I first watched this show like a typical magic girl action anime with very low expectations (due too the nanoha similarities at the beginning). I wont try to spoil anything for you but the show starts to make drastic turns and got me excited for a couple of episodes but the excitement dies later on. I didn’t like how utterly by the book it was at its presentation and story. It starts of like a typical magic girl anime. Episodes latter its not, but oh wait it resembles a typical tragic anime from\n          \n        90s-early 2000s. Everything just rolls along perfectly and foreshadowed predictably that it isn’t a surprise to find people predicting the events that’s going to happen.\nI wasn’t expecting something totally original and unpredictable. I was expecting something with a little character. Madoka has failed being the unique show I was looking for. I think it rose my expectations too high when I saw the first 6-8 episodes. And shows its true nature later on and it just becomes nothing more than a shell of its former self. I actually found my self rolling my eyes near the end. Nothing surprises me anymore, I don’t care about the characters anymore because all of them seem to act completely out of character for the sake of drama. The character archetypes can be found in a random no name anime/manga so don’t expect any deep characters. The story itself has been written a million times over since the beginning of time. There is nothing wrong with reinventing the wheel, but if you’re going to do it make it unique. And the ending is a complete joke and typically anime like and follows anime laws.\nThe art and animation is very bland and moeish. Shaft doesn’t do the art justice with its annoying directing skills. The only good thing about this show is the action scenes. Its what got me hooked on this show in the first place. But the action takes a back seat for a poor excuse of a greek tragedy play.\nDon’t watch this show if you are expecting something fun, and don’t watch this show expecting it to be something deep and character driven. Just turn your brain off and watch this show mindlessly like the people giving perfect tens on this show, and you will enjoy it."},
		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=59,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ah yes, Madoka Magica. Upon request of another I am reviewing this show and believe when I say that I did not truly wish to do this because of two reasons. Firstly, I see no reason in reviewing shows that will receive exceptionally low scores as it only wastes my time and yours, plus make a lot of people angry at the same time. Secondly, the director of this series is someone I do not like either based on many of his other works in addition to this one, so it is not fun to talk about him. His name is Gen Urobutchi, sometimes called\n          \n        the \"Urobutcher\" due to the extremely harsh ways he kills his characters. Without further ado, make a wish and lets go:\n     Plot: The series uses the same one Sailor Moon did in order to start itself. A young and fairly naive girl discovers an animal that is not as it seems and through some means becomes a Mahou Shoujo (Magical Girl). Naturally she tells others and her friends become them as well. I am bound by spoiler-free style to not talk much about its overall plot to prevent ruining anyones experience. However, when a show has a plot this bad I feel their is very little to spoil, this is very true in light of the ep 3 death that nearly everyone knows about. Mami, a mentor of sorts dies from the attack of a demon (Called a witch) in ep 3 and from there the girls are left to fend for themselves with a magical animal named Kyubey \"helping\" them every step of the way. I also need to mention that Kyubey is the animal/entity that bestows these powers on the girls in the first place. Giving out wishes to girls in exchange for near slavery as Mahou Shoujo. The first plot hole we need to address is Kyubey itself. This \"thing\" is emotionless and claims to merely be following a prime directive to harvest the energy (fancier word used in show) for its alien planet. If Kyubey can grant these wishes for anything to the girls, why not take their energy by force? Why have a roundabout way of getting them to be Mahou Shoujo and waste time killing an infinite amount of Witches and a lot of crap when it could just take the energy and leave. Its because Urobutchi said so thats why. Next point is that one of the girls named Homura is actually a guardian for the main girl Madoka. For reasons that never had what I would consider sound reasoning she cannot tell Madoka to not become a Mahou Shoujo outright, and since Kyubey is likened to that of a god in power thus never dying she also cannot kill the instigator. It stands to reason that Homura's best option would clearly be to either kill Madoka to end her protection cycle (Oh yeah, Homura is stuck in a time loop protecting Madoka because terrible reset ending said so) or yelled it out to her at the several points she could of instead of being emo and stand-offish every chance she gets. Even reality would of had a collapse because of Madoka learning this it would still be preferable to the never-ending \"Groundhog Day\" scenario Homura finds herself in. I could go on through several more plot holes but these two illustrate my main point. Point being that the series ignores solutions to problems in order to create a false sense of danger despite it just being a reset ending so the danger isn't really there. 1/5 \n     Character Development: I am guessing that at some point Urobutchi decided to take a page from Evangelion and use its characters as pure symbolism. This is great in theory, but the problem is that in Evangelion they were Characters with a personality first and symbols second. This series' cast are all supposed to be symbols first and every once in a while some part of them develops. Madoka despite being the main character never develops, all we see is an alternate reality version of her where she is better but thats not development, thats just another version of her. The only girl worth mentioning for development here is the blue-haired girl named Sayaka and her friend who is a sickly boy in a hospital. Thanks to their interactions both develop and learn to cope with that situation in a great way. But of course a good male character with development need not stay long and once he is healed is kicked from the story, thankfully not in Urobutchi's favorite method of death, but is simply fazed out. Sayaka's development ends shortly there-after and everyone else either stays the same or has an alternate \"what-if\" version shown near the end. 2/5 for taking a small amount of time out to develop someone. 2/5\n     Sound: Finally, a good aspect of the series! I will not lie I loved all the dark music and the way it helped build tension and atmosphere. If the plot and characters were as fun and interesting as this music it'd be another story. Then again, the music had nothing to do with Urobutchi in terms of design, so it makes sense to me. The openings and endings are nicely done too. Not much t say here since it was all handled quite well. It'd be higher if it actually had a better variety aside from brooding sadness, but it does that very well thankfully. 3/5\n     Art: Its no secret to those who know me that grossly disproportioned moe (Cute for sake of being cute, big eyes small facial features with waxy feel) turns me off from a title. The good news is that \"Madoka Magica\"'s designs were handled by someone with no knowledge of the story and it resulted in nice concept art. While I am not fanatical about it, the backgrounds in the witch's realms and the girls' designs are not the worst I've seen (See K-On! for pure moe hell). It gets the job done but does not impress me. 2/5\n     Final Thoughts: If I owe my critical views of moe and Urobutchi to any show it is this one. Every type of trope modern anime has come to behold from reset endings (Thanks Key/Visual Arts), moe visuals (Wow K-On! \"nice\" job), and also flat characters (Thanks every boring battle shonen) Madoka has it all in one pretty bloody Urobutchered package. As I sign off from this review, I urge to remind the haters that these are my views and they do not need to match theirs, if you are a lover of Madoka thats fine (even if I honestly am saddened by that fact) and you should continue watching whatever interests you. I am here to merely give a harsher analysis with more detail and higher bars for media to live up to. Oh and one last note, you gotta love how the name of the studio that made this is called Studio Shaft, Urobutchi sure loves to give us the shaft all day long. Final Rating is 4/10\n        "},

Anime fans proportions is heavily dominated by action fans. Yet in this action fans group, chuuni subgenre can be considered as unpopular compared to those that dominated the market, with the only exceptions for nowadays being Fate series. But by combining the aspects of those in this two genres, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica has become a new achievement for the medium. It popularized both genres, and has made many other magical girl shows that's created afterwards, tried\n          \n        to imitate its legacy. Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is one of the few series which can be enjoyable by wider audiences, it can serves as one of the gateway anime for newcomers, those who watch anime casually for just hobbies, and even some anime veterans who have longer experience for the medium and loves analyzing anime.  More pros for me is that it has only 12 episodes so it's easy to binge, as I don't usually wanted to invest my time for a really long series except if I heard many good things about it.\nEntering Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, we will be greeted by pink haired girl, who runs throughout a long staircase until the door in the end of the staircase opened up for her, and then a bizarre scene featuring a black haired magical girl struggling in a hopeless fight against an abstract being which seemed to be from another world, with dark metal OSTs being played. This scene implies the tone of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica a lot. Introduction matters in order to grab one's attention towards a certain thing, it's called as first impression, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica can utilize it in order to make the combination of the two niche genre become popular, and enjoyable.\nMagical girl genre has a history of having darker tone as the series goes and many of them also deal with the theme of sacrifice. While Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica also did the same with their predecessor, it also invented something's new, fresh, and ingenious messages that's being embedded as the core theme of the story. It meticulously utilizes forshadowing, characterizations, and dialogues in order to imply it, making this theme anything but hard to digest, at least for me. People who want to watch Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica however, can still enjoy the series for having a visually stunning fighting scenes, surreal magic world, the eerie-yet-relaxing atmosphere of the series thanks to the comfortable looking school, the tragic events that happened within the story, with the background music that's really strong to evoke such feelings to the viewers. Other people can also simply enjoy this series for being dark and full of despair without overthinking about it. Yet for some people, who likes to analyze a series Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica might also still hold a special place as a great work. When I firstly watched Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica as a new anime fan who only have few anime on my completed list, I consider it as awesome for the former reasons, yet when I decided to re-watch it after I learn on how to analyze works, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica have made me let out a sincere smile due to how intelligent it tries to deliver its core thematic elements with satisfactory ending.\nThe core thematic elements of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magicais simple, yet poignant. Imagine that you've met a creature who can grant you 1 wish of anything in your choice in-exchange that you'll become a magical girl that should fight against an evil beings called witches. Sounds cool? It maybe is for some watchers, and some others surely will notice that it's already said that such battles can costs your own life. Is there a wish that's more important than your own life? Being a chuuni genre, of course this theme looks exaggerated that one should fight in a life-and-death battle, so to put it realistically that almost everyone can apply it on their own life, \"When you wish for something, is it the actual thing you need the most from the inside of your mind so that if you die tomorrow, you will regret nothing?\" I have questioned this in my life for several times, and thankfully, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is the first step for me in order to realize the answer.\nSpeaking about plot points of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is impossible without mentioning the characters, as the structure of the story being a semi-character arc and in the end of almost every character arcs, new plot twists are introduced instead of being having \"Monster of the week\" plot progression, which I found in almost all magical girl shows that I have seen and I have to say honestly, that kind of plot progression is boring. This method of plot progression also will made the user think on how in the world will this series which has high dose of despair and hopelessness will end up as more twists are introduced? The first twist being the visual introduction of the actual tone of the story, the second being the introduction of the core thematic elements, which is further implied with Kyouko and Sayaka's dialogue before they started their next fight and lastly, the true definition of being a magical girl is on the world. Episode 10, which is infamous for having the rest of the cards being revealed from Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica's sleeves, can be interpreted in two ways. One may look it as an inevitable bad end that will land upon all the main characters that made the characters anguished until they developed into what they're yet still not solving the problem, while others might see it as a hope, which is foreshadowed on the episodes that the magical girl in action just have repeated the same mistakes over and over again in which the culmination of all the bad ends. But unbeknownst to her, had she did something that simple before, all the mistake she had should never happen. To summarize in the end, every characters on Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica have done the same mistake and that they can't tell the others before falling to the pit. As how the life implications will be when you have fall to these pit of \"can't think what you truly needs in mind yet have done said actions\", only regrets remains. I found that this mistake, despite on what kind of personality you have, has been at least done once by all people in the world, as nobody can escape for being wrong. And yet you need to get over with it and not fallen deeper, in this which part I will describe on the spoiler section.\nThe chuuni tone of this anime is also fun at least for me. It deals with the existentialism elements of the history of humanity and magical girls and how the world of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica works, befitting any of the common chuuni titles. According to my friend who studies Chemical engineering, it has some truth on it too, making it more appealing for those who are fans of the genre. One might question whether our universe is actually run with such conspiratory and unfair system, which is fun to think about it. I don't take it on an individual levle but simply because thinking like chuunibyous is fun to do.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica have a high production value and know how to use it properly in order to create an epic visuals that is surreal as if the existence of magic itself do exists in that world, having the witch labyrinth that gives a distorted feels on such an evil being, as expected from SHAFT studios which is renowned for its previous works Bakemonogatari. The character design looks nice too, and moreover, the magical girl clothes models can be linked to each of their own wishes. This also makes help on the characters memorability, aside from their quirks and character explorations, which I also have to put on the spoiler sections.\nThe voice acting is also wonderful. One can notice the level of voice acting with how much do you feel a character as they speaks, and I can at least totally understand their feelings even if I have to watch this raw despite not knowing what they're talking about. This is a sign of good  voice acting as if the voice actresses know how to blend with the characters personality and to evoke certain feelings.\nThe OP lyrics is actually another foreshadowing on the show actual tone, as it is actually pretty sad, and the first scene itself shown that Madoka is crying on it so that one can already guess the tone shift, so I have to digress the people who said that it has no signs of it. The ED, which is actually the first song you've heard on the first 2 minutes and appears on episode 3, gives a darker tone, but the lyrics is surprisingly more positive compared to the OP. It also depicts on the magical girl chasing for hope through the darkness, in search for light that will brought peace upon her. As for the OSTs, like I have said before, brought by the talented composer Yuki Kajiura, it never fails to amuse me. My favorite OST among all of it would be \"Sis Puella Magica\", because it gives a strange sense of emotions for me. It feels both relaxing, mysterious, and depressing at the same time and this kind of theme truly befitting for Kyubey the most.\nI have to admit that the cover poster of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is deceiving, it looks so lighthearted that people can easily mistaken it's a lighthearted series, despite it balanced the light and dark tone in my opinion.\nTo summarize, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is a fantastic ride of a more chuuni magical girl series that you will hardly found in any other anime. Magical girl in general might be weird for having darker tone in the end, but Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica put it on another level along with the implication of a simple yet profound themeatic elements, yet subtly show that a speck of light on the darkness of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica can be seen, if one have enough love for it. It is by no means a perfect work, as there's few off-model scene and the character arcing is too visible that it doesn't have dynamics that much except for the characters required for said arcs, but it has achieved many things it has to offer for me for just 12 episodes in an entertaining way. It skillfuly throw hints on what this core thematic elements is all about that those who have enough love on it will realize on how compelling Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica actually is.\nThis marks the ends of this review with minor or might be no spoilers. For the implications of said themes to each characters for you who have lesser love for the series to realize it, which I have already posted it outside of MAL (100% spoilers):\nThe first few episodes are more of focused on Mami Tomoe, the senior magical girl which saved Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki from the witches. She can be described as a seemingly poised but actually fragile and reckless person. This is reflected on her fight with Charlotte (and it's emphasized on episode 10 when she is the one who lost her emotion control the first after realizing the truth of being a magical girl and shot the others.) When her family involved in a car accident, Kyubey approached her to offer her to become a magical girl and granting her a wish, and her wish is to live her life by her own, possibly because she know that she won't survive without her parents financially. So now let's see now on the basic traits of Mami, shall we? Among all of the Magical Girls introduced within this series, Mami looks the most elegant and luxurious of all. This is reflected by her magical girl character design (She has a curly tails harstyle while all the other girls have a simple and plain hairstyle, Her dress also gives splendor feels the most for me, and yellow is the color that represent money for me), the way she fights witches that backed up with the soundtrack \"Credens Justitiam\" make me feels that she's a gorgeous magical girl who fights for justice, and the place where she lives looks the most expensive compared to others. For me, all the splendor that Mami has was all rooted from her wish when she made a contract with Kyubey, which makes sense. But then again, is Mami's wish all that she will need the most for her life? How is it when a middle school girl live alone without feeling the love of her parents despite already having a luxurious life? I bet the first word that comes to mind will be: Lonely. Yes, Mami is a really lonely person in the heart, which is shown during some scene before she tried to fight Charlotte in episode 3. Moreover, she is also the most mentally unstable among the girls. For me this implies that her parents really loves and cares about her, so that the sudden loss of that feelings gives Mami a shock effect that makes her to that state.\nThe next character that I will talk about is Sayaka Miki. My comments on Sayaka Miki's characterization in it's simplest form will be \"The least historical but the most fleshed out.\" She is depicted as a tomboy girl which is Madoka's best friend and classmate. Like Mami, she also has a strong sense of justice, proven on how she acts during the first time she become a magical girl. After Mami's death, she got a bit concerned about being a magical girl, but then she decided to do so, after knowing that her crush Kyousuke has suffered an injury on his hand so that he could never play violin again, which is his best abilities he likes to do, she decided to become a magical girl with the wish to heal Kyousuke. But is that what Sayaka Miki needs the most? Let's see how the story will flow further. At the first glance, Sayaka was so happy seeing that Kyousuke was healed and he can play the violin again, and Kyousuke looked happy to at Sayaka when he return to play violin. Sayaka then, as a magical girl began to hunt down for the witches, even the witches independent familiars (The one that also appears within the witches labyrinth, but then flew away from it. It can devour humans to turn themselves to witches but in that form, they don't drop grief seeds.) Another magical girl called Kyoko confronted her shortly, telling her that a familiar don't drop the grief seeds, thus making them useless to be killed and that she shall wait for it to become a witch so that it will clean her soul gem from being tainted. But Sayaka got enraged, believing that it's the same with she let a human die, which means killing humans for her. The two engaged in fight but Homura comes for them to cease the fight after Sayaka seems to be losing. But because of her wish that is related with healing, her pain dissipates quickly. They both have another fight in a street bridge after Kyoko said that she should've wished for him to like her and now that its too late, she will break her leg to make it happen, also with the prescence of the other two magical girls, and Kyubey. But this time Madoka threw up Sayaka's soul gem, hoping that doing so will prevent them to fight further. But another plot twist has just began. Sayaka lost her consiousness while Homura was chasing for the soul gem and returning it to Sayaka. Kyubey then explained that during the process of one to be a magical girl, when they're saying their wishes, their soul was being extracted and turned to be the soul gem, rendering them unconscious if their soul was 100 meters away from them. This subverted almost everything we expect about being a magical girl during the first two episodes (yeah I know that some magical girl anime have a somewhat tragic theme, but this anime didn't try to make it so at its first impressions.) After the incident, Kyoko tried to befriend Sayaka, but Sayaka with her strong sense of justice, often left her and keep thriving against all witches and familiars, doing what she believe was right. But then when she heard that her friends Hitomi, who also have a crush with Kyousuke was going to confess to him, she began to fell in despair. She feels that she can't be a good couple with Kyousuke with her current condition. She afraid on how if he knows that she was practically a zombie that fights against so many grotesque looking monsters. So by this time, we know that Sayaka's wish wasn't what she need the most. Ironically, its on what Kyoko said to her, which is to make Kyousuke fall in love with her. Because of this one mistake Sayaka has done, her personality grew darker as she rampagingly fought through countless of witches and familiars. She didn't even take the grief seeds, believing that its pointless now that her wish went wrong. She fell deeper into despair when she heard some guy badmouthing about a girl which is implied to be a magical girl. She got angered upon them and its implied that she murdered them both, believing that those guys aren't any better compared to the witches. So let's see now, does Sayaka still bring positivity, justice, or whatever you call it after knowing Hitomi was going to confess to Kyousuke? Or is it the opposite? Isn't she just become like the witches now that she killed those guys despite their attitude? And most of all did she still have any positive aura on her? All we can see is just that she was in a total desperation and even brought negativity rather than the positive. So now we even can come up with the question: Isn't this Sayaka become more and more witch like? And so it happened, when Sayaka's desperation was already beyond help, her soul gem shattered and she turned to a witch. The lesson is: Don't let yourself being eaten by hopelessness just because one of your wish went wrong, move on and do what you think is the best for you and this world sake.\nLet's went to another character now, I bet you can already guess who is it. Yep, it's Kyoko Sakura. Kyoko is by far the best characterized magical girl for me. She has a balance between her backstory and how she acted on the series. Unlike Mami, Kyoko comes from a terrible family records, which makes her quirks differs alot with Mami. Her father was a preacher. When Kyoko's father see the suffering of some people, he thinks that the church must be revolutionized so that he used a new doctrine for his church. But then again most people seems to be disagree and thus they left the church one by one. Kyoko's family went to an extreme poverty after that. Kyubey then came and offered Kyoko a contract. She wished for her father to regain his followers. But is it what she need the most? Will her wish become as what she wanted or will it backfires? The fact happens to say that its the latter. Kyoko's father happened to be disliked on how his followers acted more of a cultist rather than a normal person. It went worse when Kyoko said about the truth. His father claimed that she isn't any better than the witches and he began to lose his sanity, become a drunker, and ultimately killed all of the family. Yep, Kyoko have done the same mistake Sayaka did. She should've wish for her family wealth and happiness instead and she knew if she just did a mistake on her wish. Kyoko's changes on her family was less of a shock compared to Mami's and was never to be as loved as, making her personality firmer, selfish, and more badass. She is more tomboy than Sayaka. Also the fact that her family has ever suffered in an extreme poverty made her value food so much, which is shown on how she was angry when Sayaka thrown the apple she gave to her on episode 7. She also believed that humans, witches, and magical girls is just like a food chain and only kill the witches. After Sayaka's collapsing incident when they have some fight and Kyobey explained some fact about being a magical girl, felt decieved, she got angry upon Kyubey saying that he only turned them to zombies. But this event also makes Kyoko felt sympathy for Sayaka, thinking that they both have did the same mistake and undergo the same burden of being a magical girl, and both girls being tomboys. And this is where we can see the difference between Kyoko and Sayaka, which is Kyoko is a more easy-going person, given she has went through a lot of shit which was worse than knowing the truth of being a magical girl compared to Sayaka. This also being showed before that she didn't hold grudges to Homura for stopping her fight seemingly sided with Sayaka when she come to her when she played some Pump it Up like games while eating chocolate sticks. She also cared a lot about Sayaka's safety, proven that she always followed wherever Sayaka hunt for the witches and familiars and she even helped her once, and probably will do that more if she got overwhelmed. She still wanted to save Sayaka, despite the girl had already turned to a witch. She asked Madoka to help her on this. During the fight, Madoka tried to call for Sayaka's witch form in attempt to make her back to her original state while Kyoko dodged and defended her attacks. But it happens to be pointless. So that Kyoko perform a double suicide with the witch with her magical ability while Madoka got escorted by Homura who was arrived just then. This showed us on how Kyoko truly loved Sayaka, given the fact that she could care less about justice, other people's sake, and even other magical girls. Overall I think Kyoko is actually a likable badass redhead girl. She has a great resolution and strong too. Her musical theme is somewhat gives damp and soft feelings, in contrast to most of our first impression to her, perhaps this was meant for she show her caring side towards Sayaka after episode 6. Also, I like cheongsam!\nOkay so we will go with the character which is liked the most by the fandoms (me too), Homura Akemi. Homura was actually starts off to be the most timid among all the magical girls, even more than Madoka. When she was just recovered from a long-term illness, which made her not being able to attend school for a long time, she enrolled on Madoka's Middle School on Mitakihara. Homura during this time had a twin braid hairstyle, wear an eyeglasses, and weak at sports, the complete opposite on what she is when she was introduced on episode 1. Madoka is the first person who acted like her close friend to her, while also saving her life when she was being attacked by a witch along with the other 3 magical girls. They become friends each other. Homura is the only person who haven't become a magical girl yet during this timeline. When there's a giant witch called Walpurgisnacht attacked the city, the magical girl team had a fight with the witch, and ended with all of the magical girl are killed in process, due to the massive amount of strength this witch have. During this time, Homura was saddened seeing Madoka, the one she loved the most, dying. So she made a contract with Kyubey and wished to be able to redo her first encounter with Madoka. So then during this timeline, there's 5 magical girls. But things still not fixed. Homura is the only magical girl who survived, whilst Madoka, struggling for her life in agony got her soul gem tainted so much that Homura witnessed by herself on how she became a witch. Homura then resetted the time, now trying to tell them the dark truth behind being a magical girl. Things didn't work perfectly as Homura wanted, Sayaka put her distrust upon Homura and parted way with the team, and turned into a witch, possibly due to the same reason on what happened on the previous episodes. After defeating Sayaka, the girls now believed on what Homura said before, but Mami loses control on her emotion and wanted to kill all the other magical girl. She killed Kyoko in the process, but stopped and shot by Madoka when she was going to kill Homura. So now there are only two magical girls remaining. They ended up defeated Walpurgisnacht, but both are in a dying state and there's only 1 grief seed remained. Madoka asked Homura to use the seed and kill her, in which Homura once again turned the time back after doing so. Through countless number of time loops, Homura still failed to save Madoka. This is what made Homura got desensitized and being somewhat \"cold\" towards stuffs, even deaths, because she had witnessed it countless number of times. She also may have used her infinite time to practice a lot amount of skills (shown by how she was superb at sports and studies during the first episode compared to how she was during episode 10.) But her goal is still the same, which is to prevent Madoka becoming a magical girl, which is obvious upon all the word she said during all of the episodes. So did Homura's wish actually what she needed the most? No, what she obviously need is just living happily together with her friend which she love and adores so much, Madoka Kaname, forever. Despite not actually care about other magical girl life other than Madoka, she still has her human sense of pity, seen by how she try to give Sayaka some grief seed knowing that she will become a witch if she didn't use it. I know what people likes about Homura, which is probably her cool looking style and behavior, her black design (lol she do the flipping so many times) and also what she have gone through. Yep, I like that about her too, she was so determined to save Madoka. But then things got worse after she knows that Madoka and Walpurgisnacht got stronger on each of her time travel so that she was trying to defeat the witch alone. But sadly she failed until \"it\" happened. Lastly, her music theme is somewhat feels like a hidden sadness for me, which is revealed to be true at episode 10.\nNow before go with Madoka, let's go with Kyubey first, shall we? This creature is also have strong determination to make teens a magical girl, which is in this case we see a lot is Madoka. He even went as far as lied to Madoka on saying \"It's been a pleasure to know you.\" to make her a magical girl. The fact on why he wanted to do so is that because there's some energy that can be actively used when a magial girl turned to witch so that it would prevent the world from doomsday, which also means his species extinction. Well I've read somewhere about the theory of creation that the universe are created from a \"Big Bang\" which one gigantic star explodes and all its matters separated and went away each other and it has something like nebula on it, which created stars, planets, etc. If all of the gigantic star matters keep went away, the nebula will be finally drained and no more stars will be created, whilst the existing star will die and it will be a true doomsday if no new stars were created. If being a magical girl can be used to made some spacial energy to nebula or to at least preserve the Sun energy than it makes sense for Kyubey to want more magical girls. He also said to Madoka that the collaboration between human and incubators already exist since the beginning of the human age, and the wish of all the girls is what make human civilizations grow further. But he hide all this dark truth, in fact, he did it on purpose to make one impression on being a magical girl is fun so that they made contract with him. Sadly enough, since there's noone would ever think that far, one wouldn't ask for it so he will never tell about it. What makes him creepier is that he didn't have any kinds of feelings, and will do everything to achieve his purpose while still maintaining his cute an innocent design. Cute and expressionless, now that's a combination that I've never seen before.\nAnd now let's go to our final character we're going to talk about on this series, Madoka Kaname. Alright I got it, she got most of the screentime so you can see on how she was first being introduced as your typical cute, hopeful, and innocent little middle schooler who came from a fine family until that ending. She was the most excited to become magical girl after being introduced about it by Mami, but she haven't think about the wish well, since she knows that it can only be used once so it must be thinked properly. But then she got concerned about it after seeing Mami's death. Imagine how shocking would it be for a person like Madoka to see that scene? That would be the most horrible thing she had ever seen and will traumatize her hard, right? That's why she got depressed about Mami more compared to Sayaka, supported that she is the type who wanted everyone to be friends and happy. She try to avoid fights as much as she can, she even try to stop any fight between the girls, shown by her act of throwing Sayaka's soul gem before they fought (actually she wanted to stop the fight before too, but being powerless and they already fought, she can't do a thing.) The interesting things is that there's always some incident that happened on this timeline in which prevent Madoka to made contract with Kyubey, so finally what Homura have did for ages have grown its fruit. Yes, she got mindraped the most by Kyubey during this timeline, but its still better than losing her life and turned to a witch. But the main difference that happened during this timeline is that she realized that being a magical girl can turn one to a witch before she herself turned to a magical girl. So after knowing all the truth all over through all the incidents, she changed as a person. Now she know how she should say her wish and really determined to do it compared to how she was during the first time, it is even emphasized by her against her mother for the first time for this. Now then let's analyze this. When Homura almost end upp in a total deseration and turned to a witch, Madoka finally come and made her wish to Kyubey. Her wish is to \"Erase every witch that has ever existed and those who yet to be born in every universe, and if there's any law that forbid her to do so, those law will be broken.\" This means that Madoka's wish will broke the law of nature and thus making herself the new law of nature, rendering her a godlike being, since that means she also erased her own witch which is yet to be born. Did Madoka happy in the end after reaching her godhood? Yes, she stated that at the conversation with Homura. Did she achieve her goal to made all the magical girls happy and have no woorries on their life? Yes, although it will be sad for Homura at the first time, but she recovered from it some time after the event.\nSo that's why Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is my favorite anime. It achieved way too much on just 12 episodes. The plot twist that this show brought really will give any middle school girl into a total despair and hopelessness, if that was real. It also explores through how people wish can be wonderful if done right, and how it could backfire when it isn't truly what they need the most, and how each characters used their wish for with their respective results. Also the show didn't make us to notice that the \"wish granting\" system is heavily flawed so that it is possible for someone like Madoka to break through it. I've been in middle and high school too and there's so many people who can't describe what they actually need properly, which been done by mostly female over male statistically. So does this show meant to be for everyone? I guess not, some people may dislike the progress of this show theme from being heartwarming to downright gloomy. But since it only has 12 episodes, I think everyone should try this anime, and for deciding whether they like it or not, that's all back to yourself. And if you asked about my favorite Puella Magi, I'll said that I liked them all firstly, but if I have to sort it out from my most favourites that would be Homura, Kyoko, Sayaka, Madoka, Mami. Via all these characters struggles, this story tells about a life-changing themes.\nMoral of this story: In some events of life, you may have encountered a big problem, or your wish didn't go as well as what you need that is seemingly impossible to face them with a smile. But you must! Just do it! The moment you whine and desperate about it is the moment you become a \"witch\", the one who causes negativity to others that may give birth for another problems for others while not solving yours. Use any methods, as long as its legal, and the path will open itself for you as long as you never give up.\n        "},

But really, everything else was just bad. All the drama barely made me feel anything and it felt totally out of place especially towards the end when QB was talking about killing cattle and livestock. That whole scene was used to make all the obsessive fanboys/girls feel like the show just got DEEPER. I've heard that whole speech since I was in elementary school and every time I hear it, it's just a nuisance.\nI liked Madoka in the beginning, it\n          \n        had a real good \"something\" going on, and that was the action, the plot actually having potential, and the emotion hitting you fairly hard. but when Walpurgis and time travel and forced drama came in, it was executed so badly it felt like I was just watching a bunch of girls talk about death. And thats just what it was.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="                          \n    Today, I am deciding to live up to my username. I will review a gloomy anime and l'm gonna give it a gloomy score. Because that's how I roll.\nPuella magi Madoka magica! A 'deconstruction' of magical girl genre! \nI love it when a fictional work points out what is wrong with itself and love it more when they put logic into themselves. A deconstruction anime should be lots of treat to me! Well... it's not. :(\nI didn't really expected much from this show but it still mamaged to be dissapointing. That's got to take some talent.\nStarting with the characters! The girls should be at least\n          \n        worth rooting for, but none of them are to me.\nWe have the heroine, Madoka! A very kind and pure girl who is very kind and pure. At the end of the show, she developed into becoming a very kind and pure girl. So basically, Madoka has nothing else in her to be memorable. She didn't even had any development! We saw an alternate version of her who is kickass, yes. But that was not the Madoka that I followed! That is basically just a possibility of what Madoka could be but, it was never her.\nMadoka is my definition of a forgettable character.\nThen we have Sayaka. The tomboy bestfriend. She actually had an interesting development with that musician boy. But it was not fleshed out well for me to care about it that much.  When the guy started hanging out with the green haired bitch, Sayaka instantly became an emo. It was not really convincing. It felt more like, they just made her irrationally emo to get the plot gears grinding.\nNext, we have Mami. The experienced magical girl. When she unexpectedly died (which is a dull surprise for me), I felt nothing. It was quick to forget her. Maybe she just don't have enough charm (like Madoka). She might have worked with everyone else but not for me.\nNext again, we have the brash and binge eating Kyoko. Kyoko actually had a very interesting background. But when she died, just like Mami, I felt nothing. I think it's also because like how I felt about Mami. She had no charm at all. Again, this could just be me.\nI am now starting to sound like a heartless bitch. But to assure you, I've been sad over a character death many times before. Puella just can't do it to me.\nNow we have Homura... I usually end up liking the stoic and introverted characters. Levi from AoT, L from DN, Garnet from SU, Gogo from BH6, Raven from TT etc... I always thought, maybe it will always be this way? But, I came across many exceptions! Homura is one of them!\nHomura is just soooo cold and distant all the time, it was ridiculous. If she had the charm of the characters I mentioned earlier, she could work. But nah.\nHomura is also surprisingly dense! Now the \"quiet dude/gal is smart\" stereotype is in pieces because this girl is an idiot. She keeps looping in time to prevent Madoka from becoming a magical girl. If your'e looping in time, you should have plenty of time scheming! But the girl doesn't have a brain! Overnight, I thought of a plan that anyone with common sense could think of:\nI will befriend Madoka and co. Then I will tell them my biggest regret in life: to be a magical girl! I will tell them how terrible it is, I might even exagerate some things to really scare the shit out of them. If they don't belive me, I will simply say: 'who will you believe? A human girl or a walking stuff toy whose face never moves?'. With enough convincing acting, it will flawlessly work. It will not erase the possibility of Madoka becoming a magical girl but it will decrease the likelihood. See that Homura!? Being very detached towards Madoka will point you nowhere! Even a bored teenager can think better!\nI keep saying that the characters had no charm. Im beginning to think that its the problem. None of them are etched in my brain. I actually rooted for Kyubey when he was talking about live stock and shit. That was the point I realized, I don't give a damn anymore.\nNow I'm jumping to the real issue of this show. The fact that it was supposed to be a Deconstruction. First, what is a deconstruction? It happens in fiction when a cliche/ trope is played out like how it will be in real life. And so the question, did puella magi madoka magi do this? Nope. This anime is just unnecessarily tragic and dark.\nA deconstruction should be:\nOur heroine is just a highschool student! Because she fights monsters all night and studies all day, she is always exhausted. She keeps fucking up her regular life in the process.She felt that being a hero is not fit for her anymore. So the cute guardian decides to pass her job to someone who can handle it, because it makes more sense that way.\nSee? I don't even need to kill anyone. Its like the writer of puella just thought that a deconstruction is about spilling blood all over the place. Its not. It should be more than that.\nNow the art. It was not very impressive to be honest. The futuristic backgrounds are very stale. The witch realms are just weird. And most of all, I am not a fan of moe character designs. Overly wide head and overly tiny hands. As tiny as a cat's paw! Disney princesses are moe-ish too but they pull it off better.The only saving grace of the show are the action scenes.\nThe music, is fine. It delivered the dark atmosphere that the show needed. I guess its fine.\nOverall, Puella magi Madoka magica is a very banal show. Its so baffling to me how this was brillant. But its people's opinions, everyone has their own.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="                          \n    I would like to preface my critique by stating that I am new to watching anime and to reviewing any series as a whole.  I enjoy fast-paced action dramas the most, especially those featuring leads with strong personalities.  And I have had no experience watching magical girls anime in the past.  With that being said, I had heard that Puella Magi Madoka Magica transcends its genre, so I decided to give it a shot.\n[Plot]\nI went into Puella Magi Madoka Magica hopeful.  I desperately wanted to love it, and I was expecting it to really pick up after episode 3 or 4.\n          \n         Yet there was something about the blend of pastel riddled innocence and trippy, Burton-esque darkness that didn’t settle well with me. Admittedly, there was a slight turn for the better, but not enough to instill in me a strong desire to keep watching.  Nevertheless, I stuck it out and continued the show, if only because of its huge reputation.  To be frank, I didn’t find many of the earlier plot twists very shocking, and I didn’t feel personally invested in the characters.  \nMy perception of this show soon began to change, around episode 8 or 9.  Here I was beginning to get frustrated.  I found Kyubey’s course of action to be predictable, and almost cheating on the part of the show’s writers.  There were so many plot holes, and the science used to explain some of these plot holes was just plain wrong (from a physics, biology, and medical standpoint).  Plus, the show presented so many unanswered “what if’s” for me that I was becoming more and more skeptical.\nEpisode ten was bittersweet.  I was impressed with the direction that the show had taken, and was excited to finally get answers to some of my questions.  But the further I progressed into this episode, somehow, the more disappointed I got.  Without getting into the physics, the events that took place in this episode completely nullify the explanation that Kyubey had given in the previous episode.  And what’s more – I had seen this type of plot before.  While it might be a revolutionary idea in the magical girls genre, it certainly wasn’t my first time seeing these sorts of events play out.  There was nothing I could distinctly say I had never seen before.\nOverall, I would classify the story as fairly entertaining, but not high quality.  Those willing to overlook gaping issues in the show’s logic will likely find more enjoyment in it than I did.\n[Characters]\nHere is where I believe Puella Magi Madoka Magica is most lacking.  Madoka is a flat, and to be honest, boring character that did absolutely nothing for me.  She is not interesting, and the fact that this show is so Madoka-centric was a little off-putting.  \nThe other characters start off in a very stereotypical fashion and don’t really get that much more interesting.  Though it might be argued that they change perspectives throughout the story, I found the character development to be either too predictable or too unrealistic.  There seemed to be no happy medium.  Call me heartless, but I had a very hard time connecting to any of the characters personally.  They were all likeable enough, but there was no motivation for strong attachment.  Of all the girls, I would have to say that Homura is probably the most exciting, given the sacrifices she makes.  I could sympathize with her the most, even if her actions seemed a little unreasonable. \nAnd while many people seem to like Kyubey, I have a few issues with him as well.  First and foremost, I could not (and still cannot) fully see him as a villain, probably because he reminds me too much of a rejected Pokémon to be seen as that formidable of a threat.  Plus, his lack of true malice and total indifference as a facilitator doesn’t make him seem like a true “villain.”  But what really bothers me most are Kyubey’s monologues.  If you’re going to have a character centered on logic rather than emotion, make damn sure that the character’s dialogue is, in fact, logical.\n[Art/Sound]\nThe art and sound of Puella Magi Madoka Magica were probably its best features.  The contrast between the animation style of the witches and that of the magical girls is outstanding as a means of symbolizing dark vs. light.  Although it was definitely unsettling for me at first, it was something I grew to appreciate as an art form the more I watched the series.  I do wish the characters were more unique in their designs.  While I can understand that certain animators have their own individual styles, I would have liked to see more variety.  Most of the characters were only distinguishable by their hairstyles and eye color, since they all wore the same school uniform when not in their transformed states. (With that being said, the costume design for each magical girl and the transformation animation were both on par).  \nThe soundtrack certainly complimented the visuals, though the opening and ending themes weren’t anything to write home about.\nConclusion:\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica was far from the masterpiece that it is claimed to be.  Though it certainly breaks away from the magical girls mold, it did not live up to the raving reviews that praised its name.  Yet even with all of my criticism it definitely wasn’t a total waste of time. I would not classify Puella Magi Madoka Magica as a favorite, but it’s certainly well worth a watch. "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'm probably going to get tons of negative comments about this, but for some reasons, Puella Magi Madoka Magica didn't live to the expectation I got while reading the reviews on MAL, or the other ones online. \nEDIT : it's come to my attention that it would be important to precise that I was new to the Maho Shoujo genre, which might cause disagreement upon my review. It's understandable, really. I wrote this review with nothing to compare the anime to. \nStory : 7/10\nI was in my horror anime phase when Madoka came to me in a suggested anime list. For this only point, the\n          \n        anime deserves a strong 10. The ambiance is creepy and a lot more will be said on the Art/Sound points. However, since this is really about the story, I might want to explain why the anime deserve a 7 from my part. I really, really felt like the story was way (way, way, way) too much for the small amount of episodes. Madoka brings you to an universe that had a lot of potential : magic. Dealing with magic in an anime is pretty much opening every possible door and I felt like only a few were opened. Sure, the witches were present to doom this world and make fall in despair and agony, but there are some details that weren't clear, that didn't satisfy my curiosity of always knowing more. I'm like that, so it's pretty much a personal overview. \nArt : 8/10\nOk, very good art, BUT, only on the scary side. The characters were well drawn, but pretty much all over the same height, same kind of face, same kind of clothes. HOWEVER, the witches art, everything that is inside them is completely insane. It's a crazy universe, at one time very creepy and awfully ugly. This, along with the sound effects I will talk about, makes watching Madoka worthwhile. \nSound : 10/10 \nIncredible. The music, the sound effects, everything. You say magic, you get magic. Sounds are well done, incredibly accurate for the ambiance of the anime. This deserves a strong 10, or even 11 if I could. \nCharacter : 6/10 \nThis is where I lost it. I understand how people might have seen the friendship, the bonds and especially the struggle of the characters, trying to save the world knowing they were doomed to begin with, but I didn't see it quite this way. In my opinion, Homura is the only character that deserve an higher note than 6. Madoka is the classic main character who does the impossible at the very end to save it, while Mami is the strong and confident character that guides the other on the right path. Sayaka is the weak-hearthed but strong-willed character who wants to help but can't and Kyoko is the classic vilain-not-so-vilain character. Again, I understand how people could have seen the over view of the characters, the bonds they shared, but I'm analyzing them on a personal point of view and on an individual basis. \nEnjoyment : 6/10\nFor my part, everything was really rushed in. For some animes, this method works, they're made to be fast (I'm thinking of Btooom! or Elfen Lied, for example). However, Madoka, in my humble opinion, deserved way more episodes than that (I know there were movies, but please bare with me, I'm rating the anime). I watched it really fast and I think that it just went by, nothing really had the time to amaze me, even the 'so massive' plot twist of the end. \nOverall : 7/10 \nMadoka Magica is a nice anime. It has some fairly good points, it is creepy and it gets you in an hollow mood. Pretty much what you'd be looking for if you were seeking something similar to Higurashi no Naku Koro, which, in a way, shares many similarities (young girls, normal ambiance mixed with very creepy and scary stuff). I would recommend Madoka Magica, but with caution. I know it is considered as a masterpiece by many users on here, but for me, it was only a good anime with amazing music and sounds, but way too short for it's potential. \nAs always, critics are welcomed, but only if you motive them for a reason different than '' I liked it, your review is bad, you suck ''. Thanks for reading! \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Under the crimson red glow of the sun, the girls jump into action. At the prompt of their premeditated quote varying from the power of friendship to that of installing justice, hurled at their enemy, the girls begin to transform (for you see, it is entirely impossible for a girl to do so without following this procedure, or, at the very least, posing brazenly in wake of their opponent that lays before them). Exploding into a barrage of colours and lights, while simultaneously losing their clothing for a brief period of time (but worry not, as, you see, those mysterious lights that accompany a magical\n          \n        transformation will cover up all the bits that would normally place you on the FBI watchlist if they were absent). As the transformation sequence is complete (a process that may take upwards of sometimes two minutes; no idea why the enemy just doesn’t attack them during that time since they are left completely vulnerable, but whatever), the girls take their stance, posing passionately at their enemy before them. The magical girls are ready to fight…\nWhen the general public thinks of anime, several connotations and images are typically brought up, ranging from the battle shounen, in which two guys beat the shit out of each other with massive as fuck muscles, typical ecchi oriented anime in which girls are drawn to have ridiculously small skirts and extremely large breasts, and the most prolific, at least from what I’ve gathered from asking family and colleagues at university about this very same subject, are that of the magical girls! Even if you’re not particular that versed in magical girl oriented anime, as am I (for I’ve only seen the Sailor Moon series, Lyrical Nanoha and the show of discussion today) you’re at the very least probably familiar with the genre’s typical troupes and conventions, as the magical girl genre is perhaps the most parodied within the medium with countless examples out there, from Puruin in Welcome to the N.H.K to Stardust Witch Mereru in Oreiemo. As a result, there are several things people tend to associate with the magical girl genre, as I tried to replicate in my opening paragraph (and probably failed at mind, you) but there exists several deconstructions out there, going against the norm of what is to be expected from this typically more so child-friendly content, with the most popular example of these shows being Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica from 2011, becoming one of the most successful and popular anime ever created! But, alas, with all that said and done, let’s make a wish with some random cat who clearly looks like he will fuck us over at some point, transform into a magical girl and dive into the world of Madoka!\nMadoka, our main protagonist for this tale, along with her best friend, Sayaka, are regular middle-schoolers, until, that is, they encounter an adorable as fuck cat, by the name of Kyuubey, whom is capable of speech and through this, offers to produce a contract between each of the girls, resulting in them becoming magical girls (as Kyuubey needs them to fight off against these monster-like things called Witches) in exchange for one of their wishes to be granted. As the series goes along, more magical girls are introduced into the story, as the characters suffer through disappear and hardships, and, to cap it off, a lot of death as well! Madoka’s tone is one that takes a much more depressing and darker route than what is to be expected of these kinds of shows, and is consistent in its setting and overarching themes to make the world in which these characters inhabit, all the more bleak and miserable, with the constant threat of death always lurking around the corner, thus creating a sense of narrative stakes and tension since it is established early on in episode three, that characters do, and ARE going to die! This lends itself naturally in creating scenes with much more emotional weight, and the darker setting the narrative presents never really felt too forced, or what I’d usually classify as “edgy”. The show never tries to push its darker themes or ideas too hard to the point where it becomes silly, and instead opts for a mature and realistic tone that I feel was implemented in a serious and thought-out manner. The pacing for the show as well was also pretty consistent, moving the narrative along at a well enough pace to keep story beats moving. One thing that I actually really liked about the pacing, was how long it actually took for the girls to make up their minds in regards to their wish and what the dangers of accepting the contract may entail. I originally believed they’d make their wish at the first moment they could get within the first episode, but, instead, they ponder at great lengths, weighing it up in their mind, and as such, helped to ground the characters in a greater sense of believability, and made them seem more mature and rationale. Although, one thing I never really understood, is that why did none of the girls ever wish for more wishes? It was never established in the show that you are not allowed to do so, so why did none of the girls ever attempt this, especially since the wish is being promised by a cat who can talk! Maybe having more wishes could act as a means of reverting back, or changing something that may have gone wrong with your initial wish. Of course, this piece of criticism is one that is pretty pedantic, nor does it really effect my overall feelings towards the show, but I felt the need to point it out anyway.\nThe show also has enough plot twists and forks in the road to keep things interesting, and Kyuubey’s sudden reveal of new information to the girls that changes up the entire dynamic of how we think of the magical girls in general are easily some of my favourite moments in the show. Kyuubey is one sick motherfucker! As part of a race that always thinks cold and calculated, lacking any kind of emotion or sympathy for the magical girls he has created (whom he sees more so as pawns if anything else), Kyuubey upholds vital information in regards to the true nature of the magical girls and these sudden twists were one of the few incentives I had to keep watching, but I also feel that this makes Madoka a one trick pony, at least for me anyway. Kyuubey’s plot twists were one of only two things in the entire show to actually keep be invested in what I was watching and whilst I believe the show can be rather entertaining the first time through since one doesn’t know of the plot twists in the narrative, it leaves me with little desire to ever go back and watch again, which I suppose is fine, but I also value re-watchabiltiy in a title, and I feel that the other elements in Madoka are not strong enough to warrant another watch, and I don’t feel like I could get anything out of a second watch. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and Madoka achieves what it sets out to do in regards to its narrative fairly well, but, again, this is quite a personal nit-pick for me, and perhaps quite a pedantic complaint none-the-less. \nHowever, a less pedantic piece of criticism stems from the use of exposition in the show, and how overwhelming it can be at times. There are many times in the narrative in which Kyuubey dishes out exposition to the magical girls, about the origin of them or of himself, which, in small increments, can be interesting in learning more about the world, but these exposition scenes can go on for quite a while, and since so much information is being thrown at us in such a short amount of time, my brain eventually shuts off and I lose interest, especially since the exposition isn’t delivered in the most exciting way either. Now, one may argue that the exposition dumps in Madoka are justified since they given by Kyuubey, a creature who’s very existence is one that is very calculated and mechanical-like, so it makes sense for him to deliver information in such a way, and that is something I can totally understand, but it still doesn’t eliminate the problems I just mentioned, and if the exposition was spaced evenly over the course of the show, it would have helped to alleviate these problems for me greatly.\nSome moments in the narrative can feel kind of trite and forced too, and depending on your tolerance levels, can put a damper on the entire experience. One such example of forced drama implementation is in regards to Sayaka, and the boy whom she loves, being taken away by one of her best friends. This love triangle sort of thing is not inherently a bad element on its own, but my main complaint is that this idea is never really fleshed out, nor is there any pay-off in regards to it either, and it felt like it was only there just to make Sayaka suffer all the more, and thus can come across as rather unnecessary in my eyes. There were also a few moments of poor comedy as well, in regards to the girl’s homeroom teacher who constantly complains and rants about the lack of dick in her life, and a friend of Sayaka’s and Madoka’s who believes they have entered into a homosexual relationship with each other and runs away, screaming! Thankfully, there were few scenes of this nature, but they often came across as jarring and mainly unfunny whilst watching the show. There was also a certain level of disconnect I got when watching the series since the girls sometimes acted in such a way to bring me out of my immersion, such as in the case where in the first episode, where, Madoka, hearing the cries of help from Kyuubey whom she hasn’t met yet, runs out of a music store and into some kind of underground area, and this always came across as strange to me as we just see her pop up there with no interconnecting dots showing us how she even got there in the first place since the latter locale seems like it would take a significant amount of time to reach. In addition, I often found it kind of strange how Madoka and Sayaka were pretty calm about seeing one of their upperclassman as a magical girl along with a talking cat, and instead of freaking out or just simply acting surprised like regular people, they decide to drink tea and eat cake, as if this event is one that happens every day! Again, this may seem like something small and insignificant to talk about, but its moments like these that drag me out of the experience.\nNow, despite a few problems here and there in regards to the narrative, it’s overall pretty solid and does its job well for what It was trying to achieve; it reaches for the stars and tries to be as ambitious as it can in many areas and just falls short (especially with an ending that feels very much like The End of Evangelion of all things! Thankfully there is no scene where Madoka masturbates over someone else’s body!) However, my main problems with Madoka lies in its cast and how little I care for anyone, which is a massive problem considering that the entirety of the narrative stakes and threat of death present is reliant on how you can grow attached to these characters, and on that end, I believe Madoka does a poor job at investing me in these girls.\nMadoka, as previously mentioned, is our main protagonist for this tale, and is perhaps one of the most boring main characters I’ve seen in a while! She plays the typical cute girl, mainly characterised by her extreme amount of kindness and love for the people around her. Madoka’s character feels more so like a small puppy in regards to the way she was written. She is completely innocent, and is represented more so a victim in the show, with an insane love for everyone, including her family in which the first episode hammers down our throats that she has a happy life filled with love! As such, whenever she does get hurt or abused in the show, it acts as an emotional trigger to make us feel more sympathetic towards her since she is just so innocent and happy! It’s like watching a puppy getting kicked or something, and that is basically Madoka’s character in a nutshell. This doesn’t make her character bad just incredibly dull, and she is easily the least interesting character in the entire show, spending much of her time crying in the narrative. While there is a great scene between her and her badass mother in the final episode, in which we see how strong Madoka’s resolve is to finally put an end to the suffering of the magical girls, her character remains mostly pretty stagnant and uninteresting for the most part, which is even more painful since she is the main character of the entire series! Madoka more so takes a back seat to the rest of the cast and aside from the final episode, contributes very little to the story. I suppose her function in the show is to act as the straight man (I mean woman, don’t want those damn SJWs attacking me for assuming genders!) to the rest of the cast, and thus helping us to relate more to her as a person and to attach ourselves onto her, but I honestly forgot her character even exists half the time.\nMami is somewhat more interesting than the aforementioned Madoka but still wrought with problems. She is a senior to that of Sayaka and Madoka and acts as their mentor of sorts during the early parts of the series, and whilst we do learn something about her character in episode three, whereupon Madoka tells Mami she will always stick with her which brings Mami nothing but joy, and was surprisingly heart-warming to watch, her character doesn’t really go anywhere nor is there enough time invested in her character to make me feel a damn towards her or to learn more about her personality as a whole. There are a few subtle hints in the first two episodes that imply some more things about her as a person, but its nothing of any real substantial merit. \nNow, let’s talk about Sayaka, whom is the only character I was actually invested in, aside from Akemi anyway, and her spiral into self-destruction is easily the most interesting aspect of the series for me. Not only that, but her wish actually has some kind of emotional drama, as she uses said wish in order to make her friend, whom has been suffering inside a hospital, good as new once again. As such, Sayaka’s character feels far more grounded than that of the previous two I just talked about, and her downwards spiral into destruction is given enough room to breath and be fully fleshed out, making it all the more hard hitting and impactful. Sayaka’s character made me feel something other than just indifference, and her character is more so indicative of the darker side of magical girls in the series, and the show does a good job at representing this idea. She even embarks on an idealistic battle with another magical girl whom gets introduced in episode five, a girl by the name of Kyouka, and even though this battle of ideologies in regards to their duties as magical girls is as basic as they come, at the very least there is some kind of character conflict going on, and some level of introspection into what it means to be a magical girl to these characters. Kyouka and Sayaka, at first, seemingly dislike each other due to their differences, but the show tries to make them grow into friends over the course of the series, something I could never get behind because it just ended up feeling kind of superficial and it never feels as if the two characters grow to like each other on screen, it’s merely just implied. Kyouka’s character as a whole is just fine, and while we do learn something about her character, and the reasons why she acts the way she does (even if I would argue that her backstory is one in which tries to use emotional manipulation and shock to make us feel for her) at the very least we do learn something about her character, even if her relevancy in the entire narrative is rather minimal, and acts as a sort of mirror to Sayaka’s character, as Kyouka too wished for something that benefitted another, which backfired badly, just as what is happening to Sayaka. It’s nothing amazing, but these two characters do a decent job at making me at least somewhat care for what is going on.\nAnd finally that leaves Akemi, whom I can’t speak too much about since I wish to avoid spoiler as much as possible in this review. Akemi is first presented as being this mysterious figure who lurks in the shadows, with a major hard-on for Madoka, but in episode ten of the show, a whole episode is devoted into fleshing out her character and the reason why her hard-on for Madoka is as big as it is! It’s actually a well-done emotional episode that adds a lot on to her character, and does a good job in explaining why Akemi is as persistent as she is, and I also get a kick out of her using machine guns and grenades when fighting – it cracks me up every time! \nIn terms of animation and art design, Madoka is great. As expected of both Shaft, and the directing of Akiyuki Shinbou, Madoka’s visuals are unique and extremely experimental, adopting for insane amounts of colour and bizarrely interesting Witch designs, utilising many different animation techniques to make them feel different, but also horrifying in their design. The fact that the Witches are designed and animated differently than that of everything else in the show, gives them this uncanny and monstrous demeanour. The same thing can be said for the character designs too, and how each one of them feels so memorable too me, especially that of Mami’s and Sayaka’s magical girl costume, which I adore. The fight scenes were also a spectacle to behold as well, with great use of movement and fighting choreography, especially during the first fight between Kyouka and Sayaka in episode 5. The whole show is dripping with different animation ideas and art; it’s a feast for the eyes and I love it! The same thing can be said for the music as well, with the opening of the show winning the award for perhaps most misleading opening ever conceived, and one little thing I could admire about the show is how the ending theme changes in episode three, from the sweet and calming melodies prior, to the track called “Magia” in accordance to the shift in tone of the show; a track that’s full of despair! I also adore “Sis Puella Magica” with its orchestral arrangements and mystical tone, that fits wonderfully into the show. Everything about Madoka in these two departments is done to great effect, making the show’s music and animation extremely memorable.\nIn conclusion, Madoka Magica is a fine show. With what it sets out to do and what it accomplishs, I feel it does a good job, and there are many things to praise about the show, from the art and the music, to some of the decently developed characters the narrative presents us with, but ultimately, the biggest drawback is the lack of characters I feel a damn for. Out of the entire cast, the only character I slightly cared about whom may have lived or died was Sayaka and thus, most of the narrative stakes the show presents me with falls flat since I was not invested in any of them. It’s one thing to have narrative stakes and death in the show, but another to have characters whom we care about having those stakes afflicted upon. However, despite all that, Madoka at least remained somewhat fun for much of its duration and at the very least, I’d say it warrants a watch on that end. Just remember, that if a cat offers to forge a contract with you in exchange for a wish, either be smart and wish for more wishes or run the fuck away!"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=44,   ["text"]="                          \n    \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is the epic tale of one Paella Magi (magic users who direct their talents towards making ludicrously tasty paella) named Madoka and her life long quest to make the ultimate paella, the Paella of the Gods. In order to do that, she must first obtain that rare and elusive ingredient - the mythical pokemon Magikarp.\nYou may have realised by this point that I'm trolling you. And that's a bit like this anime: while the early episodes baits viewers into thinking it's an extremely moe magical girl show, with the only thing remarkable about it being extraordinary width of the moe girls'\n          \n        faces, it soon reveals itself as something unexpected.\nWhile the traditional demographic of a magical girl show is young girls, \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" isn't. Though the cutsey element is there, it's accompanied by a strong, detestable whiff of moe. That's right, in keeping with the trend in recent years, it's one of those magical girl shows aimed at pokemon trainers. And by pokemon trainers I mean otakus.\n\"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is really about some mutated squirrel thing named Kyubei trying to persuade Madoka and her friends - but mostly Madoka - to make a contract with him to become Paella Magi (or Magis? What's the plural for this word??) who can go around battling witches (who causes bad things to happen to people, like suicides and stuff) with their magical power. But soon it becomes clear that this is far from the whole story...\nThe first couple of episodes probably strike most as being ok at best and terrible at worst depending on their level of tolerance for generic magical girl fluff (of which I'm not particularly fond of) and bland moe guff (of which I'm allergic to). Underneath it all though, there's a hint of something unsettling, like a stray note sneaking into an otherwise consonant chord. This starts to manifest itself towards the end of the third episode, at which point the series starts to show its true form as a dark, twisted subversion of the genre. \nThe remainder of the series contains plenty of shocking revelations, religious symbolisms, and a dose of moral dilemmas thrown in for good measure. It seems that the purpose of the earlier magical moeblob material is to lull you into false expectations that the later episodes can rudely jerk you out of. \nJust how well does the whole thing work though?\nWell first of all, the moe still annoys me, and was a big barrier I had to get past in order to enjoy the show. I understand that it's used for misdirection, but do they really need do it this way? \"Planetes\" (now THERE'S a truly excellent show) did a similar thing, but mostly through its story instead of deliberately being obnoxious. Even in this show itself, Kyubei's cute mascot-esq exterior only makes him seem more sinister than annoying when constrasted with his unknown intentions. Clearly, making the show very moe isn't necessary, and I'm not entirely convinced that it's there PURELY for misdirection and not for pandering purposes. Perhaps I'm just a cynic. \nThen there's the visual style. Trashy moe character designs aside (Madoka's mum could have passed for her sister), I've never been a fan of SHAFT's style, and even though people tell me \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is the least \"SHAFTy\" work they've done, I can still see it quite clearly. Just look at the glass classrooms; odd designs for things like buildings, chairs, and decorations... it's the kind of things Apple would come up with, if they did interior designs. Like Apple, SHAFT often gives off an annoyingly smug air of pretension, and of style over substance. No where is this more obvious than in the witch fighting scenes. Within the realms of witches, the show tries to build up an overwhelming sense of chaos and madness by continuously bombarding your visual sensors with sprawling masses of psychedelic, surreal imagery: cut out butterflies; wicked barbed wires strewn across the screen; grand concert halls with designs reminiscent of the style of \"Gankutsuou\"... the themes vary from encounter to encounter, often accompanied by discordant instrumentals or wailing vocals, curtesey of the distinctive compositions of Yuki Kajiura. Is it different? Hell yes! Is it effective? If truth be told, it's all a bit too much. With the exception of one or two scenes, most of fighting feels flat and dull in spite of, or rather because of, the eccentric art style. There's a sense that it's trying too hard to be different... just for the sake of being different (a very SHAFT thing to do), and the design themes (with the aforementioned exceptions,) mostly have little if any relevance to the battle at hand. At least the music is good though.\nThe plot is probably the main draw of \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" - it's full of the unexpected, and isn't afraid to think big. Some parts are deliberately left vague to let viewer draw their own conclusions, and from the amount of discussion the show's generated, it's clear it's been effective in that regard. Although there're a few plot holes if you look a bit deeper, I think those who take it apart and catalogue its plot holes are missing the point a little - first of all, it's no good trying to apply hard logic to some of the abstract concepts which can be open to interpretation; also, given the scale of story and the fact that it involves overpowered elements such as wishes, it's almost too much to expect the story to be completely water tight. For what it's attempting, I think it's a damn good effort just to make the plot (mostly) functional, at least on the surface. It's hard to say much more without spoiling things, and believe me, there's a heck of a lot to spoil. \nThe cast starts off pretty generic, particularly Madoka herself, a timid girl whose paper thin personality can be summised by the description \"naively nice\". Other characters were also pretty forgettable, if not as annoying as Madoka - I remembered most of them as \"Madoka's friends\" - and even Homura seems to fall unremarkably into the quiet and mysterious stereotype bin. A few episodes in though, some of the characters starts to grow beyond their 1D state. Sayaka (fomerly known as one of \"Madoka's friends\") is fleshed out through her unyielding ideals (and/or selfish desires?); Homura through her compelling backstory later on; and Madoka... remains naively nice. (If it wasn't for the fact that she's the titular main character, I'm not sure I could have remembered her name...) \nDespite the brainless drivel that assaulted me in the early episodes, the dialogues in \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" can be superb when it tries, adding depth to the characters as well as throwing in some philosophical musings. Kyouko's telling of her own backstory contains a good dose of cynicism on human nature; Homura's despairing admissions of her feelings in the final episode is heart wrenching; Kyubei's dispassionate speech about cows (yes, cows) and the greater good knocks down the ego-inflated perception of our own worth. Those are some of the most memorable, most poignant moments from the show. There's a limit to how deeply (as in, not very) the show looks at these issues, but it generates enough food for thought to lift it above being mere shallow entertainment.\nHaving said that, I do think it's a show that's clever rather than intelligent. It's the kind of show that you can spend ages trying to work out details of what happened, or freeze frame and observe the plethora of symbolisms littered around the witches' realms. But it all boils down to a superficial coolness rather than something deep. The various themes it does touch on are used for making the story darker and colourful rather than as topics for serious exploration. That's not what it's going for though - it's no \"Planetes\" after all.\n\"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" could have been improved with more episodes. Though for the majority of it the pacing is great, revealing bits and pieces of the plot at just the right times, there are some parts that feels rushed. For example Kyouko's change of attitude feels too quick to be convincing; one shocking piece of revelation about paella magis fell out of a facepalm worthy act of stupidity on Madoka's part, and the event feels too engineered to be beliveable. Also, Homura's backstory episode bulldozed through an incredible amount of material, mowing down character consistency and story integrity along the way... it was like killing someone by bashing their brains out with a hammer - powerful, effective, but a bit crude.\nI guess I should talk about the ending, considering all the hoo-ha it caused. I personally really like it. For me, it wraps up things up in satisfactory fashion, both emotionally and in terms of the story. What's more, provided a kind of justification for the design of Madoka's personality - Madoka's fate and what it symobolised could only have worked so well with the pure and naive personality she has.\nTaking everything into consideration, \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is an over hyped show. I think those that who are writing essays on the deeper meanings it contains are crediting it with more depth than it has. End of the day, \"Paella Magi Madagasca Madoka Magikarp\" is a rollercoaster ride that goes a bit too fast at times and is un-necessarily coated in moe style... but it's a ride I ultimately enjoyed. For a show that mainly aims to be entertaining and to keep viwers guessing, it's done more than enough. \n        "},

You might’ve messed up your job and gotten fired for the littlest thing, upset someone important, lost a chance to make a new friend, got out of a bad argument with someone close to you, failed a test, hoped you would’ve planned time out better, or faced some sort of intense tragedy. \nWhile it’s unlikely that anyone has experienced all of these problems, it is likely to think “if only I could”. It’s the second chance, the renewed opportunity that could ignite a spark in someone’s mind. People want to have faith life\n          \n        rolls their way, so why not take the chance, if only once, to make something so much better? Today’s topic, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, one of the most popular anime this decade, and the anime that personally got me into full time anime watching, takes that upon itself, explore the reach of intense decision making/taking and the caveats of consequence in a form many are all too familiar with, a bright, vibrant and cutesy Magical Girl series. Although the show’s writing tends to go too far in some places and not far enough in others, the endeavor is largely a success.\nSpoilers for the entire series in review/analysis, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED:\nIt starts with 14 year old Madoka Kaname having an apocalyptic yet cryptic dream: a mysterious girl fighting a monster in their ruined city. Madoka lives an ordinary life, until one day, when she meets this mysterious girl in real life, and along with her best friend Sayaka, gets dragged into events beyond their understanding, with them being taught by a veteran warrior named Mami about Magical Girls, and the adorably cute critter Kyubey about having a wish to take. Things might seem simple at first, but in a snap, the straight line changes into an ever growing snowball that puts a lot into the impact of fixing a mistake and consequences to create and result from that.\nPeople love to call this show a “deconstruction” because of the fact that it takes the Magical Girl, something that seemed to be a black and white idea, and flips it on its head by having each girl deal with the consequences and fallback of their wishes, and the ignorance of seeing the world in rainbow colored glasses. In some cases, this excuse is basically used as a standout way to say that it doesn’t fall into the same trappings as what it is subverting, and while occasionally it does, a lot at the beginning and somewhat at the end, the promises and consequences of such are fulfilled to a reasonable degree. \nWhile many shows of the Magical Girl genre are known for having atmospheres that are lighthearted, inviting or candy coated, Madoka does a very solid job of building suspense for itself (even when one point is quite literally candy coated). Fear is constructed in three ways, fear of the unknown, fear of the uncanny, and fear of the self. Fear of the Unknown comes from the Witch realms the heroines encounter. Scattered throughout their city, they have a variety of different effects, sometimes can be easy opponents but can at other times appear as tricksters. You never know exactly how these encounters will go down. In addition, the uncanniness of these, as well as different art design choices show how offputting the experiences are for the lead characters. Fear of Self, however, is the most important, I feel. \nAs characters confront, succumb to, or release their inner demons, it produces some of the most effective moments in the series. Within this atmosphere, it is inevitable that shock value would sprout. The show is sometimes criticized for using shock value to make you care about characters for the sake of the lulz, but truly, the shock exists for the sake of propelling existing character drama to highs and lows for real impact. Unlike, say, Aldnoah.Zero, where the shock value lacked purpose and was too quickly swept of consequence to my irritation, here, these breaking elements matter.\nMadoka is very much revolving around its plot to get characters to provoke reactions at certain times, moreso than some of its older contemporaries like Princess Tutu and Utena, which use character writing a lot more to shape their story. In terms of the plot, the pacing is mostly on point and there’s a certain meticulousness to the overall structure that shows it was very adequately planned. There is barely a whiff of filler, everyone and everything that happens has a point to it. When watching the show, and even more on a possible rewatch, you'll notice a lot of different hints and thematic allusions that may pertain to current plot points, and while a viewer may not think too much of them at first, in the long run, their utilization really pays off for the sake of the narrative. The show toys with a lot of interesting concepts, and generally, I got the feeling that it knew what it was doing, when to properly place its events and why they are concepts originally made elusive to the audience.\nWhat is less effective is HOW these are conveyed, what they sacrifice, and what they do for the world at large. \nAnyone who watches the show will be likely to note that Mami Tomoe, one of the main 5 characters of the series, dies after just 3 episodes of screentime. It is only near the end of that time, right before she perishes, that you gain insight to development/backstory to make her more than what she seems as the big sister mentor archetype. To many, this might feel last minute: those not vulnerable to shock value especially likely won’t feel lost weight. However, it serves the plot greatly. It presents doubt to Madoka through a current scenario and the fact that Sayaka does NOT hear Mami say she was putting up a front assists Sayaka’s arc in ways very much like a play, where she ends up believing in a figure that wasn’t entirely real to begin with. And bringing back Mami in episode 10 reinforces the “front” aspect of Mami’s character even further.\nThis happens as well with two of the biggest reveals in Sayaka’s arc. The purpose of Soul Gems, feels very much like overly specific setup to get certain notions in place, and the second involves Hitomi, Madoka and Sayaka's unaware friend, having a desire to want to go to the next level with the boy whom Sayaka accepted the consequences of being a Magical Girl to save. The fact that it was brought up at such a critical point in the corruption of Sayaka’s character can seem forced at times. However, the strength of the consequences feels very much Shakespearean in its execution. If one recalls the ending of the original Little Mermaid (not the Disney film), or Cassius’s fate at the end of Julius Caesar, you come a similar idea here with Sayaka, albeit with less time for it to grow.\nNear of the end of the series, Kyubey expositions a CRAP LOAD of information regarding his motivations, entropy, and the past. All done at one time. While you could easily argue this as intentionally disorienting, it still feels like a massive dump of information designed almost specifically for overthinking at the outset. \nLess forgivable is the world itself, in 12 episodes we don’t know much about the setting aside from what’s currently presented as a city with Witch holes in it. How are other incubators working, in different parts of the world? Do all cities have Walpurghis naught level monsters? Why do no characters other than Madoka and Kyoko seem to have parents? Why target these characters specifically? Why make only young girls take these contract? It is believable that young girls would be more emotional, and therefore beneficial to Kyubey’s plan, but that aspect isn’t sufficiently explored to the best of the show’s abilities. \nThankfully, what IS sufficiently explored, as well as the major plot events when looking at Madoka, are given the proper handle. These include: the reaction to Mami’s death, the ever growing uncertainty a wish holds, the characterization and growth of Kyoko Sakura, Sayaka’s corruption, Homura Akemi’s fruitless struggle forcing her to try her damndest to manage emotions, and the meaning of the ending. All of these have satisfyingly emotional payoffs, though I’ll elaborate more on that in the characters section. The writing can sometimes have its problems in a lack of elaboration, some convenient setups or speeding through certain developments, but for most of Madoka’s run, the core ideas of the plot are presented very well.\nVisually, the show aims to dazzle and surprise. Again, compared to Tutu and Utena, it lacks a continuous visual motif (mainly just seems to be “abstract”), and the shot composition isn’t as strong as Studio SHAFT’s other big series at the time Bakemonogatari, but it still is very much impressive. There’s a very nice contrast between the dullness of ordinary life and the wacky, occasionally very shadowed color schemes of the Witch Realms. Each pops in their own way so people can start debates on which Witch Realm is their favorite. Despite what I said about shots, there are still plenty of effective ones without the constant cutting of Bake. A sundown shot of Madoka consulting Homura in particular was a standout. Animation maintained relative consistency and so did the character designs, at least upon my initial viewing in 2014. Sayaka’s design is probably my favorite, most unique of the costumes and the cape sells the “hero of justice” angle quite a lot. On the downside, some rooms can look a bit basic or undetailed, especially in the mundane segments and the facial design for some of the characters, mainly Madoka herself, might seem a bit silly looking for the show taking itself very seriously later. Witch realms may hurt some people’s’ eyes, though not my own. In general, very nice SHAFT production, really sells their flair.\nSimilarly, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajira is fantastic even years later when she’s made several more for series such as Fate/Zero, Sword Art Online and ERASED. The epic tune of Sis Puella Magica does marvels to accentuate the suspense in any given moments, and many of the other songs, from the character themes to the background music work just as well to set the dramatically exciting or tragic vibes. The OP “Connect” may seem ordinary, but by the end, it really “connects” the show together. The ED, “Magia”, which enters after episode 3, is definitely one of the best I’ve heard, coupled with very nice imagery that serves as proper foreshadowing for plot to come as well. It really sells the tone to dark drama with heavy consequences. Fantastic stuff.\nIn regards to characters, although in several cases they feel reactive to the plot rather than proactive, or have the foundation of simple traits inherent in the genre, the best of the bunch still have plenty of growth that stems from their existing character arcs, rather than shock value alone.\nMadoka Kaname is a.....tricky one to talk about. On the one hand, the development she goes through is great, experiencing the tragic events and being put in indecision because of her friends, before becoming more courageous and having a resolve what she believes the right choice for the sake of the world. That growth is well done, and seeing all of the tragic events, it is more than understandable she acts the way she does, constantly thinking about what that one big, mistake shattering wish could be. However, while it is very unique that she’s the LAST character in a series named after her to become a magical girl, it doesn’t change the fact that she spends most of the show being told what to do, being force fed exposition, and crying when bad things happen to her friends. Almost too fitting with the Magical Girl image for most of the run, her personality is borderline basic surrounded by much more interesting faces.\nLike her best friend, Sayaka Miki. With episodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 focused on her story, she is the character who gets to shine the most, and is unfortunately, the most unfit to deal with fixing a critical mistake. Early on, she seems to be the more identifiable between her and Madoka, being tomboyish and a bit teasing, but none the less caring and very protective of her best friend, a fairly good role model for young girls. \nWhen presented with the opportunity “if only I could fix this critical mistake”, one that haunted her since she was young, she takes it up because of how Mami seems to embody the ease of consequences. As I mentioned in the plot section, it is of critical importance that Mami only revealed her personal weakness to Madoka, because Sayaka goes on believing in a symbol that never was, for a want desperately to be a hero. With so much increasing insecurity, combined with the futility of her current form (being a zombie in a shell), Sayaka finds she can't reconcile her fantasies with reality, as her inspiring motto becomes a dark mantra by the absolute. The drop in mental state can be seen through her battling, starting calming and rhythmic before becoming increasingly reckless, brutal and sickeningly sadistic, greatly conveyed with the stylistic visuals. By the end, this inability to deal with flaws believably breaks her when everything surrounding her ethos collapses in front of her. It’s easy to feel like everything has to go your way, and with all of the circumstances Sayaka’s perfectionism entails, it’s heartbreaking to see what she has to go through and yet, important to learn as well. Determination can be made into a weaknesses, and then, acceptance and acknowledgement makes you stronger than any magic power will ever be, and that, thinking of a future other than her own, lets her die in peace in the end. She gets the bulk of screentime, and thankfully, her transition from a inspired heroine to miserable wreck was presented to enough of a degree to be believable tragedy.\nMami.....probably suffers the most from the plot being what drives the characters more than the inverse. She exists to lead Madoka and Sayaka to the world of Magical Girls, but aside from telling Madoka about what ultimately makes her insecure in the end, you learn too little about her to separate her from the “cool big sis mentor” archetype. Aside from constantly ignoring Homura’s advice. Episode 10 helps, but it doesn’t change how little her character got prior to the death that shocked everyone.\nThankfully, Kyoko Sakura is much better. Although, like Mami, she also has a moment where she basically tells another character her history, it isn’t used just as a sendoff, buit rather a way to contrast her past scenario with Sayaka. It’s not quite nihilism, but her character helps to show what living a continued life betrayed by care would result in, for her sake and others who wouldn’t take it following in her footsteps. Kyoko sticks around, at first as a pretty fun rival character with a unique chain spear weapon, but then becomes someone who ultimately empathizes with Sayaka’s attempted hope when it became too late, even with her view tinted thanks to some plot revelations. The attachment, and resolution, feels very sweet in the end, yet satisfying in how it coalesces overtime. \nBy far, the most talked about character of the cast is Homura. Homura....Homura...Homura. Many who watch Madoka will often cite Homura’s story as a highlight and despite it not having as much present time to sink in, her story is equally impactful. As we first know Homura, aside from taking a building to the face, she’s the mysterious stoic veteran type who we slowly see more and more of, to learn of time abilities in epic display. Generally, she remains emotionally detached from actions, even when she wants to move events for her benefit. Basically we don’t think too much of her, aside from her words beginning to slowly ring more true. Then....we get episodes 8 and 10. In the former, we see her approach change from ominous forewarning to crying and begging. It seems sudden, why change her approach, does she care that much? Then...episode 10. A very different picture is painted:\nA young girl without friends, without purpose, quietly shifting through life until one day when Madoka talks to her. That one interaction, combined with encouragement changes her life. She has friends, a life with purpose, something to look forward to.....until it comes crashing down. A simple thought “if only I could save her”, brings her through time loop after time loop. It seems happy, she gets to be with her friends and becomes capable in the process...but the quest is futile. Every time she tries....failure, failure, failure getting attached to Madoka and friends only to see them die in front of her over and over and over again. The show again shows stubborn determination again sees a weakness and in one loop, she is forced to KILL the friend she loves for her own sake...that shatters it. Don’t let them in, don’t let them see, don’t create unnecessary complications, do it for her, hiding all your care.\nHer characterization sheds a new light on all other encounters with her before, giving the series a wonderful heft of rewatch bonus. Talking to Kyoko? In hope for Sayaka to avoid her fate. Telling Madoka not to accept the contract? Hope she’s never have to see her closest friend die fighting. Seeing death before? Yes, many times indeed. But even then, she still can’t take it. Her breakdowns in episodes 8 and 11 feel even worse knowing the circumstances. There are some things you just can’t conceal, it all has to come out, realizing futility is the ultimate pain.\nThe last of the main cast is what we know as Kyubey. In disguise as the cutesy exposition mascot, Kyubey is a character who we don't initially know is an antagonist, someone who appears to be helpful but turns out to be totally cool with leading the girls to their self destruction. His logical demeanor and one focused facial expression contrast well with the volatile emotional reactions of the other characters that follow, and he gives a presence to add to the conversations that isn't directly related to the Magi Quintet, as a communication source to what's outside the immediate situation too. He essentially spurs the drama needed for conflicted character interaction. While over the course of the series, I wanted to kick, burn, strangle and shoot the little cat bunny creature, the way he accomplishes what he does is fairly unique. Almost no conflict that he wants to go his way does he directly take action in. Most of his actions come through half-truths, and spurring on other characters to accomplish certain tasks that benefit his end goal. An end goal for which, he legitimately believes is the best for the universe throughout milennia. Despite the seemingly abrupt and at once moment when he reveals this, the fact that he believed this adds another layer to his character, and to continue an earlier comparison, that anti-villain aspect reminds me of Brutus, also from the Julius Caesar play. Generally he made an interesting source of conflict, and a small bit in the ending even implies he actually got something out of the experience.\nAside from these six characters, everyone else is mostly a glorified prop. Except for Madoka’s mother, who honestly has a really solid moment confronting her daughter on the necessity of consequences with a bit of a push, for the sake of helping someone. It’s a very well handled scene, and how it follows helps Madoka’s growing character. For everything else though, you’re mostly following the aforementioned six, four of which having really solid characterization and the other two really helping to sell the themes of the plot in exchange for limited personality and screen time. That said, it’s no Baccano, but for 12 episodes, having at least 3 different characters have full arcs is definitely impressive.\nUltimately, one of the biggest takeaways from the show’s writing is that Madoka is a dramatic romance of characters. The substance is underneath the symbolism and why the character's do certain actions. Why does Mami die? To show Madoka and Sayaka that Magical Girls can die very easily and it's not what they expected. Mami didn't get enough time to really make much of her character, but she played the important role in the girl's character development. The romance of Homura and Madoka is powerful. Homura is literally driving her mind off the deep end, every time she resets the timeline. The love that Kyoko grows for Sayaka is important for Kyoko's character growth. She learns to open herself up to Sayaka, who has become deranged as a result of her own failing relationships with others. And when Sayaka dies and turns into a witch, Kyoko helps Madoka, not because she really cares too much for Madoka, but because she cares about Sayaka. She's fallen in love with her, and now the only person she opened up to is gone. Which is why she allows herself to die along with giving the Witch Sayaka a sweet release from existence as a lich creature.\nAs the show reaches its conclusion, there exists elements of tragedy to it, but it is ultimately hopeful. Madoka may be gone, but now Homura is carrying the burden of protecting the world, just what Madoka wanted. Continuing the theme of immense consequence, it presents how in spite of making things slightly better with the girls not becoming their own enemies, deathly consequences, satanic deals and the hypnotic allure of these creatures will always exist. The best people can do is try to live life, work through it and carry on both for their sake and the sake of others close to them. In fact, the entire show effectively uses the concept of mistakes quite well through almost every major character. In her personal journey, we see Madoka understand the toils of the present through the fates of those close to her, while having such a responsibility can be a great burden to bear, how death results from the unexpected and the tragedy of not living up to unrealistic expectations. She learns about the past through Kyubey; in understanding how this cycle, as a flawed system, continued for so long overtime, earnest desires to fix things destroying them. Finally, the future, through how Homura’s efforts literally break apart in front of her, the fact that fate seems continuous, and the fact that there’s nothing at the end of the rainbow the way events are transpiring. All of this kept Madoka’s mind in flux, what makes up the best decision she can think of for the sake of all time, even if it has its own consequences, the ease of mistakes would cause less suffering. And that is what Madoka leaves us with............an appreciation, knowing that in a world full of awful, horrible events that hope is possible even under constant strain. That, is what causes Kyubey to put up some questioning regarding the worth of humanity even under such stressful odds. With Madoka, Urobuchi has used elements of fear, tragedy and powerfully struggling romance to craft this intriguing tale off of something so simple.\nConclusion\nA bit of background here. This was actually the anime that got me into full time anime watching. Yes, THIS anime. I’d vaguely heard of stuff like DBZ and Naruto but knew they were too long to actually start. It was around a time when I was obsessed with essentially “fractured innocence” storylines, and based on what I’d heard, this show had a lot to hide behind it’s cute and cuddly exterior. Thankfully, in watching the series, it really paid off, so much that I got into the real anime medium through it. \nTo say Madoka was enjoyable and involving would be an understatement. Despite problems when it came to pacing, worldbuilding, and some contrived setups here or there, I really felt I got to know each girl (except Mami) well enough before their demises. Homura's arc was especially well handled and intertwined with Madoka's arc rather well, Sayaka's arc was an interesting tragic hero arc with an understandable sense of emotional progression and the problem coming from her character flaws of not seeing the harsh truth of her situation, and Kyoko and what becomes of her still makes me cringe (in a bittersweet way). Kyubey, while I hate him, was an effective villain in how purely logical he was, the concept building of how magical girls work was creative, and overall, while it was a deconstruction of magical girl stories at first, it became its own thing for other people to appreciate.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is not a perfect show, not by any means, and while one could make the argument that being emotionally blinded could cause me to forget about supposed “bigger” problems, I feel like the towering heights the series reached shine bright enough to understate the occasional unsteadiness of its building blocks. With evocative atmosphere, strong character writing when it counted, an interesting take on the idea of understanding past mistakes with heavy consequences, dazzling visuals, an incredible score and a great takeaway message, the show, by itself, stands its ground years later as a beloved popular anime of this decade.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an action anime produced by SHAFT. One of the most compelling and interesting stories I have ever experienced in anime. I will be carefully avoiding any revealing of the surprises in the plot of the show, as a result, this post may be very vague.\nThe concept of the show is deceptively basic. Various demons, known as witches, exist in the world causing death and despair to anyone they come in contact with. Puella Magi, teenage girls given magical powers and combat abilities, are employed to fight these witches, in exchange for a single wish. What may seem like a standard\n          \n        magical girl series, quickly becomes an inevitable spiraling journey into darkness for the group of magical girls.\nThe central character of the show is Madoka, a teenage girl drawn into the secret life of the Puella magi. The main plot of the show is her contemplation as she decides whether she should join the fight against the witches, which becomes an increasingly complicated decision as more of the secrets behind the origin of the witches and the purpose and fate of the Puella Magi are revealed.\nEvery aspect of Puella Magi Madoka Magica is executed with an extremely high level of professionalism. SHAFT are a very original and imaginative anime studio, who have instilled that originality into this series. The magical girl anime genre is usually light and cheerful, SHAFT have taken the genre in a much darker direction, with plenty of death and depression. One of the main themes is inevitability, the Puella Magi are given many different choices and many different paths, but it quickly becomes obvious that they really do not have as much free will as they may think.\nSHAFT have an easily identifiable art style, one using many different techniques not entirely common in anime, such as stop motion using various detailed textures. These techniques are used expertly in Puella Magi Madoka Magica to further the dark atmosphere of the scenes in the show, contrasting with the more traditional art styles of the characters in the show, but matching beautifully at the same time. Outside of these original techniques, the standard character art and designs is also of an extremely high level, with the character designs referencing the colour themed characters of standard magical girl series, but toned down slightly to fit the theme. The various backdrops, whether using the standard drawn style or the more standout stop motion style are all exquisitely drawn. The music and sound of the show must also be recognised, furthering the dark mood and setting of the show.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica has an excellent cast, all excellently voiced, each with their own well developed struggles and storylines within the overarching plot. One of the most important things to mention is how realistic the characters are, in how their backstory is developed and how they react to the strange and depressing events. The overall story is bleak and tragic, the characters are developed and identifiable, which only makes their struggles more relatable and ultimately tragic.\nIn conclusion, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a series every anime fan must watch. Definitely the best anime series so far this year, I will be extremely surprised if any series manages to best it before the end of the year. An extremely original, well written storyline with weighted characters and an interesting and effective art style. Definitely reccomended to everyone, watch this series.\n        "},

She has nice parents a younger brother and a few good friends. Everything is perfectly fine until one day she has a magical encounter that changes her life. \nThat’s how the show starts, and as the show was suggested to me by a friend whose first recommendation was Another, I was surprised. The show starts off all cute and nice, which was a great surprise, and I found it really strange and quite boring, but I told myself I have to at least try to make it\n          \n        through a few episodes. The atmosphere in the show slowly began to change from this blissful school life it started getting darker and darker. It changed from a cutesy lighthearted anime into a psychological thriller.\nThe story was great, I found it original and it was never really dragging, but it never got me to feel like I had to watch another episode so it actually took me quite a while to finish it (I watched three other anime in between). The characters were all great, everyone had flashed out backstory. Everyone had believable motivation behind their actions and practically nothing went unexplained in the end. Speaking of the ending like pretty much all 12 episode anime I found it to be a bit rushed but there is are three movies made afterwards that might fix this just like the OVA saved Mirai Nikki's ending. \nThe one thing I found truly exceptional was the art, it was just beautiful especially the sequences with the witches, which looked like they had just escaped from a surrealist painting. Also the characters all looked amazing and the action sequences looked just perfectly executed. Throughout the episodes it actually managed to keep the whimsical esthetics from the start and managed to make them work in a completely different setting. There is not much to talk about the sound, nothing felt out of place and nothing that great. The opening and ending are good enough to find their way into my iTunes but I won't try to hunt down the whole soundtrack like I did with Noir and Yosuga no Sora. \nEven though I found nothing wrong with the Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica I just can't give it more than a low 8 because it never really pulled me in like even the adaptation disaster that is Gokukoku no Brynhildr managed to do. I can fully understand anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece and it is possible I would find it to be one also, had I watched it at a different time. No matter what I still have recommend it to everyone who wants to watch a quality anime. \n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica- an extremely popular, well loved, and held up by many as a landmark in the magical girl genre. A show that many describe as having beautiful artwork, a fantastic soundtrack, and contains one of the most exciting and unexpected stories in anime of late. Is Madoka Magica all of these things? Yes, and no. Let’s find out what it is that works and doesn’t. Note that I will try my best to avoid spoilers- but for my analysis of the plot, there may be one element that could be considered a minor spoiler. \nBeginning with the Artwork and Animation: \nMadoka definitely lives up\n          \n        to its reputation of having unique artwork. The trippy witch labyrinth sequences are, in a word, psychedelic. Imagine, if you will- a mixture of Salvador Dali’s Dadaism mixed with Picasso, all in a very surreal, vibrantly colorful atmosphere. As for the character artwork and backdrops, Madoka is fairly average- with quite a few moments of very low detail in the characters, and a number of still frames used to conserve the budget. For the use of the surrealist art alone, this anime earns a place among the visually striking, but is dragged down at times by the standard animation. \nThe show succeeds to a much greater degree on the Sound and Voice Acting front, however. I watched it in both languages, and both are equally watchable. There are no real virtuoso performances in this, but it’s handled very competently. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is very good. Opening and ending songs aside, the background music is really something- with everything from dark, grinding industrial music to classical violin to medieval chant to soft piano instrumentals to introspective and dramatic orchestral pieces, and even a few rock pieces, too. I’m no Yuki Kajiura fan by any means, but this is decidedly one of her best works. The soundtrack is very effective in tense and dramatic moments, as well as it is in emotive and introspective ones. If nothing else good can be said about Madoka Magica- the music is really something. \n\nAlso, what is this, “Survivor’s Guilt: The Anime”? \nThe idea behind the show is that these girls who are given magical powers are granted one single wish in exchange for their soul and servitude, in order to eradicate these entities of curses and malice known as witches. If offered a single wish in exchange for one’s soul, does it not occur to the person that they should perhaps ask for more? The wishes are often very poorly thought out, especially in foresight and scope. There was no stipulation that “more wishes” was against the rules. This isn’t Aladdin’s genie, who laid the rules down up front before any wish could be asked. \nThe wishes are also extremely shallow and selfish, especially considering that they’re offered “literally anything” by the wish granter, with the guarantee that it would come true. Their wishes are the equivalent of wishing for a car, when they could just be given an entire factory that can produce any car, or other vehicle for that matter, and an unlimited number of resources with which to supply it. The wishes are similarly short sighted and fruitless overall. It’s not necessarily true to say that the characters are stupid- because they really aren’t. Madoka describes herself as being very average and “not particularly smart, beautiful, or talented”, and she’s exactly this: average. This show examines a group of otherwise absolutely average individuals given otherworldly powers. They don’t conform to normative anime color coded hair and character archetype tropes- which was refreshing, but at the same time, being that the characters were more grounded, they were also pretty predictable in their decisions. This, I think was used to good effect in a sort of “don’t do it!”, and “this can’t end well” type of way for the viewer, but inevitably you know that they’re going to do it anyway. Perhaps this adds a more tragic element to it for the viewer, but for me it was mostly frustrating to watch characters make stupid decisions that were obviously not given much thought to.\nOften in anime or film, we have characters who are defined by one trait- such as Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass being the embodiment of a lawful good rule follower. He exists for no other purpose than to uphold the rules. Or, we have a one note harem girl who is an animate <insert prefix>-dere archetype. Similarly, the characters in Madoka Magica who have the most screentime have the least depth and are least thought out. I think it’s because these other, lesser characters weren’t given as much exposition, but were given very cut and dried motivations for making their choices (and wishes). It’s not enough to say that their “wish” becomes the essence of their being, but even before they act out on said wish, their character is held back by this shallow, small scale goal. Perhaps they were designed to be that way- average, small minded people who don’t think ahead, but I see it as an oversight in character development- where they don’t consider that, when given an opportunity, they should concern themselves with all avenues that it may lead to. This was the focal point of the first four episodes or so- and I applaud the show for having the characters take time and reflect on their decisions (or lack thereof), but ultimately this is pointless, because they’re either conned into or make the same decision they were struggling make to begin with, even when faced with the gravity of making said decision. \nFurthering this point, Homura’s motivations are poor, to say the least. Dio Brando wanted to enslave the world because his dad was a jerk to him as a child. That’s a bad motive. Many shows revolve around a concept of friendship and the ties that bind, but this show takes this to a bit of an unbelievable degree- while still borrowing concepts from a much more tightly run series. If faced with a traumatic event involving a friend, and then given the decision to redo that part of my life, potentially with a different outcome, while my friends and family lose recollection of said event, VS allowing the event to happen or just taking myself out of the equation and observing whether it played out differently, I would choose the latter. If presented the trolley problem, and I had to kill an animal in order to eat it and survive or whatnot, it’s a non-decision to make- but one that’s turned into a needlessly wrestled-with problem in this show- ESPECIALLY when combined with the wishes.\nThis show also highlights very strongly why time travel is like taking a shotgun to the plot. Not only does it create a series of very questionable events and choices (and holes), but also opens up the story to “well, if this character can go back in time, why didn’t they just go back to X event that leads to Y consequence?” issues. Again, this topic was handled better in a pair of other, similar shows that were much less loose with their rules of time manipulation and the consequences thereof. I found myself asking “if this character can go back in time, why is it that they don’t just go back and stop the birth of the antagonist that plagues them?” Or “why doesn’t this character go back in time and kill X person?” This would create another paradox on top of the one that already exists in a time manipulation series- but, when a series plays loosely with its internal consistency and logic without a particular explanation of the limitations or grounds by which the time travel is made possible- then ergo, anything should be possible, right? This would have wrapped the plot up in a pretty pink bow (pun intended), with just a few words and actions by certain characters, but by virtue of “that’s not how the show was written”- it wasn’t. \nOne other thing that needs to be addressed, though, is this false claim that Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre. Perhaps my own understanding of what “deconstruction” in a literary use is, but my understanding is that it takes some established trope, idea, archetype, etc and draws attention to it- specifically how it works in a more “realized” setting vs the “idealized”. For example: In School Days, this is taking the idea of a harem, and then showing how playing a bunch of girls off on each other is probably a bad idea, and that Japanese schoolgirls aren’t all necessarily polyamorous/okay with sharing partners as many ecchi/school/harem shows would have us believe. I do see that as a “deconstruction”. A literal taking apart of the trope. Things like parodies aren’t deconstructions, but are subversions- which I think many conflate the meanings of. A subversion is something that you “expect”, but doesn’t happen in the expected manner. \nNow that I’ve established a baseline definition of a subversion vs a deconstruction, here’s how it applies to Madoka Magica: Madoka (the character) has a horrible inability to make decisions for herself. Even the title of the show is a bit misleading in this instance, also similarly to Code Geass- and those who’ve seen the show know exactly why. Because you know based on the title alone “Mahou Shoujo” or “Puella Magi”, this show is going to be about some girl who uses magic. Duh. The girl with the dream of being a Magical Girl is offered the chance, but fails to make a decision. That would be a deconstruction- rendering the “Magical Girl” element of the show meaningless. However, if she were to find out that being a Magical Girl is not exactly what she expected, or that it’s not something to necessarily strive for, or not even a good thing at all; then these are all subversions to the Magical Girl trope. Where the Magical Girl is typically painted as a little girl wearing a fancy dress and running around with a cutesy, stuffed animal looking mascot fighting some generic Machiavellian evil in a lighthearted manner, the subversion to this paints these all in a different light- which is exactly what Madoka Magica does. \nThe ending also left a bit to be desired- but was also fairly satisfying given the nihilistic feel the story had leading up to the conclusion. However, it felt like they were trying to outdo Gurren Lagann and End of Evangelion at the same time, especially in terms of scope and scale. There’s such a thing as “too much”, and I think Madoka came very close to going over. I can’t say I hated Madoka- far from it, really. As a show, it hits some of the right notes- and there’s a blessing and breath of fresh air in the complete absence of fanservice, but as a whole, it really just failed to leave a lasting impression.\nEinstein once said that “insanity was doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.” Madoka Magica embodies this definition with a capital I. It was a different ride; certainly not what I’ve come to expect from a magical girl series, but ultimately has some serious holes in the universe and the logic stemming from twists that leave me a bit ambivalent about how much magic there really is in Madoka.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=36,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Forget about the whimsy, pleasant, and archetypal mahou shoujo series, Mahou Shoujoi Madoka exemplifies the evolution of “magical girls” anime. As expected, the plotline involves magic plus transformation, and features school girls with supernatural abilities who are committed to fight evil.  Like any typical mahou shoujo anime, friendship and fulfilling a sole wish are the main reasons why Madoka and the other heroines chose to make a deal with Kyubey to protect humanity. However, don’t be deceived by the emblematic majokko and flashy sweet natured vibe of this series, as there is something apparently dark and serious behind the seemingly generic plot.\nIn the beginning,\n          \n        I tried extremely hard to avoid this series, for I’m not fond of fantasy based animes. However, after watching the first episodes of almost half of the new animes, of all, I was taken aback by Mahou Shoujo Madoka’s high-quality audio-visual and mind stimulating themes. Truly, nothing is more effective in stealing my attention than the permutation of symmetry, labyrinths, and fractals mixed with evil candy canes, cakes, dollhouses and obscurity. Also, the sensible used of cool soundtracks to soothe the mood, added to the reason why I suddenly found myself considering the plot as a background.\nNevertheless, I can’t just simply ignore the plotline. There’s unexpected horrid and mystery behind the relaxed colours and wide-faced characters, which successfully created a positive deception and negated the familiar viewers’ perception about Mahou Shoujo Madoka.\nLikewise, I love how death is used effectively to chain actuality and idealism. It certainly deviates the viewers’ discernment about the show and clearly separates this magical girl series from its predecessors, where usually heroes always escape death—as Gregory House mentioned “almost dying changes nothing, dying changes everything”.\nOne thing is for sure, prejudice is detrimental because the series that I tried so hard to disregard is now something that I look forward.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=34,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    It's not often that the first two minutes of a series give you such a great idea of what to expect, but the now-famous first two minutes of this one pretty much nail it: The young woman walking up the massive staircase of alternating black and white tiles, the heavy steel door that opens into a hellish world of destroyed buildings and smoking ruin, the mysterious raven-haired figure who engages a supernatural monstrosity in futile magical combat, and the orchestral metal song that adds a sense of ominous doom to the entire scenario. It's a suitable introduction for a dark, densely plotted series that throws\n          \n        convention to the wind in almost every regard, and explores every theme from the nature of human desire to the karmic balance of emotions in the universe. It screams: Welcome to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Enjoy your stay.\nAfter the above described sequence, the series takes on a brief air of normalcy. We're introduced to Kaname Madoka, an average schoolgirl with a loving family and two giggly buddies. During an after-school excursion to the mall, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka wander into a deserted back room where, before their very eyes, the world seems to transform into a nightmare of pulsating walls and evil imp-like creatures. They're summarily rescued by Mami Tomoe, who introduces herself as a “magical girl.” Mami and a mysterious talking creature named Kyuubey give them a proposition: They too can be turned into magical girls, and in return, Kyuubey will grant them each one wish. However, being a magical girl entails a life of servitude and dangerous combat against “witches,” shadowy embodiments of human despair and sorrow. The girls are forced to confront their own naivete and meditate deeply on the question: Is there any wish worth risking life and limb for?\nAs the series goes on, the plot evolves into an increasingly complicated web of connections, but it's never confusing, and definitely never boring. Hardly an episode goes by without a major plot twist or a defining character moment, and the show's story moves with breakneck speed as a result. Originally I thought this hectic pacing might be to the dislike of some, but closer examination reveals that there's a careful balance of revealing and reflecting, exposition and action, that serves the show well. Each time a twist appears, there are moments of temporary insanity which are later offset as the characters quietly examine the consequences of their new-found knowledge, and consider how best to respond. The series gives the audience just enough time to inhale a breath before it, once again, plunges head-first into carefully planned madness. There is a feeling of the story being rushed, but this feeling builds deliberately and with purpose as the show hurtles towards its ending; it's a feverish but acceptable pace.\nIn addition, it's clear after multiple viewings that it took an unfathomable amount of careful planning and deliberation to structure this plot. This series doesn't just have rewatch value, it defines rewatch value. Watching the show a second time armed with knowledge gained from previous viewings reveals just how much careful groundwork is laid in the first six episodes. Conversations can take on an entirely different meaning the second time around, since the viewer is now aware of the developments that lie ahead. Foreshadowing that might not have been understood the first time becomes clear. There's a remarkable amount of cleverness and consistency underscoring almost every aspect of the story. Pay particular attention to the dialogue between Madoka and Homura. You'll see what I mean.\nCharacter-wise, there's hardly a single member of the cast—either main or supporting—who feels unnecessary or lacking. The main characters possess a surprising amount of depth, and the nature of the “magical girl” agreement in which lives are risked for wishes forces each of them to examine themselves with brutal honesty. There's also a cleverly played comparison and contrast between the veteran magical girls and those who are being asked to join the ranks. The veterans include Homura, the mysterious transfer student who hides deep-seated insecurity behind a cold and emotionless facade; Kyouko, whose fiery temper and self-loathing result from shattered idealism; and Mami, whose easygoing air of confidence conceals an aching loneliness and desire for human contact. Then there are the two girls who are newly propositioned by Kyuubey: Sayaka, a selfless girl whose desire to help others with no regard for her own well-being is more of a fault than a strength, and Madoka, an average girl whose lack of self confidence and inability to think of a wish are mainstays of the plot. It's a unique cast where nobody is quite who they seem to be, and their reasons for hiding themselves and making the choices that they make are revealed in a pacing-appropriate manner as the series progresses. The interactions amongst the veterans, who all have their own personal reasons to fight, are interesting. However, the real character conflict evolves when the newcomers are confronted with the harsh philosophy of their more cynical counterparts: This isn't a fairy tale, and dreams about kindness and helping others are a distraction that could land the magical girls in a grave. This clash of idealism and pragmatism is the source of much of the show's drama. There is an excellent degree of understatement to the character interactions that might not be apparent on the first watch.\nIt'd be easy to let the main characters steal the spotlight, but there's also a good cast of support who are deserving of praise on numerous occasions. Madoka's sharp executive mom and caring stay-at-home dad are definitely worth mentioning. Although they're both unaware that their daughter is being propositioned to fight manifestations of human suffering, they inadvertently give Madoka advice that she carefully weighs before making decisions, and therefore play an important role in her development. The only character I might point at as underdeveloped is Hitomi, a friend of Sayaka and Madoka who doesn't have a lot going for her other than being a plot device on a few occasions; her personality seems to take a turn from “comedic relief” to “dead serious” when it fits the show's needs. Admittedly that's a nitpick. I find it to be forgivable and easily overshadowed by the depth of the cast as a whole.\nSomeone with time and determination could probably write an extensive dissertation about thematic developments in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, but it's out of the scope of this review, mostly for reasons of length and relevance. Suffice to say that the series touches on a variety of themes that, like the plot twists, are foreshadowed right from the beginning. The two most noticeable themes (in my opinion) were the balance of human emotion in the world, and the nature of human desire and selflessness. The first is touched on at dozens of points throughout the show, with the key question being whether or not one human's happiness always spurs another to be unhappy in an equal quantity. The second is not as clearly visible, but the series seems to be prodding at the question of whether or not people do the right thing because it's right, or because they want to be rewarded. During a memorable discussion in which one of the girls is considering using her wish to help a love interest recover from an illness, another girl asks her: Do you want to help him for his own sake, or because you want him to be grateful to you? These are mature themes that get developed into something genuinely impressive by the end of the series. The dialogue is always surprisingly poignant, and underlined with a note of subtlety. Themes extend directly from the character interactions and plot; the writers are generally careful not to bludgeon the audience with overt philosophical explanations. Many times I think elegant writing of this nature is a lost art, but a series like this always reaffirms its existence. I've mentioned only two core themes. The series is a regular playground for anyone who likes to go in-depth and pick at details, and there are many more that I've sidestepped around, both for the sake of brevity and to avoid spoilers.\nThe show's characters and world were brought to life by Shaft, a studio with a track record of unique and eye-catching visuals. That track record is certainly maintained here. The series is noteworthy not only for its markedly high production values, but for several artistic decisions that accompany its descent into darker material. The magical girls themselves, while undoubtedly well designed, are ultimately  somewhat typical looking—decked out with very ornate jewelry and frilly clothing, as you'd expect magical girls to be. However, the world that Shaft has created is one that changes constantly around them, to the point where they seem to be the only element left standing that isn't horribly warped. The city, which is originally a brightly lit place colored in pastel shades, becomes a dark and rainy slum as the series makes the transition to content of a more grim and revealing nature. The centerpieces of the show's artistic creativity are undoubtedly the labyrinths created by witches when they manifest themselves in the human world. Every witch encounter is animated with a unique and unconventional style; unorthodox art within unorthodox art. One is made up entirely of two dimensional images which form a scrapbook-like affect that resembles a hallucinogenic-induced nightmare. In my personal favorite, the characters and the witch are depicted as black silhouettes on a constantly shifting black-and-white background, with dark red blood from wounds serving as the only other color in the scene. As the series progresses, the witch encounters become increasingly haunting and psychologically grating, and the art direction makes it clear that, to the characters, the witch labyrinths represent a world even more cold and alienating than the one they already inhabit.\nWould it be too much to ask for a series with great visuals and a great plot to also have great music? Apparently not, because Madoka Magica is augmented by a strong musical score that is, quite frankly, the perfect icing on this particular cake. The soundtrack is composed by Yuki Kajiura, who had previously created the acclaimed soundtrack for Kara no Kyoukai (among other things) and would later go on to compose a marvelous score for Fate/Zero (among other things). Suffice to say that the word “slacking” does not appear to be in the woman's vocabulary. What's always impressed me the most about Kajiura compositions is the wide range of emotional tones that she can successfully convey with music, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the arsenal of songs written for Madoka Magica. There are lighthearted flute and piano driven melodies for moments of laughter at school, songs spearheaded by upbeat percussion for scenes of rapid action, and weightier orchestral tracks with heartrending string instruments for moments of sadness and reflection. The result is that the music carries the show's unmistakable double hallmark of cuteness and darkness every bit as much as the art. Even the show's opening and ending themes seem designed to reflect the dual nature of the series. The opener, “Connect” by ClariS, is an upbeat J-pop tune. Its counterpart is “Magia” by Kalafina; the ending theme changes several times (each change is a reflection on the tone of the series) but “Magia” is the most prevalent. It's a melodic metal track with heavy lyrical themes that correspond to those of the series. “Magia” also plays as an insert song on several occasions, most notably in the introductory sequence that I mentioned earlier. For me, and probably for many others, the music is a big part of why the series “had me at hello,” so to speak.\nFar more than the sum of its parts, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a truly unique and ambitious series that delivers in every regard. There's something here for everyone—action, character-driven drama, a thick plot fraught with conspiracy and revelations, and a myriad of mature themes which are developed so well that most anime can't touch them with the figurative ten foot pole. The only regret I associate with this charming and intelligently written piece of work is that I waited so long to watch it. My only regret after watching it was that I waited so long to watch it again. If you haven't done so already, I suggest you avoid making those same mistakes.\n        "},

Instead of a cutesy childish theme, it does a complete 180 which gives it a dark mature feel.\nThis is one of those animes where everything comes together and makes sense in the end, giving you a \"Mind Blown\" feeling.  The characters may seem 1 sided or flat,\n          \n        but through watching you come to understand that each character has a different story to tell.\nI was completely surprised that I liked this anime as much as I did.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=32,   ["text"]="\nAh, Madoka. A short anime, yet one that seems to have affected many people within such a short time span. I doubt we've seen a magical girl series this talked-about since Sailor Moon. As a magical girl fan since childhood, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the ever-popular Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\nStory \nIf you want an anime that sticks firmly to your plot, then Madoka should be right up your alley. It rarely strays from the task at hand, and is always focused on what is happening. There are many plot twists and interesting notes that keep the viewers guessing, and can even\n          \n        keep you the edge of your seat. There were some plot twists I admit I guessed already, but you'd be hard pressed to guess them all in this series.\nI must also praise Madoka for its pacing. Somehow, everything seems to tie in at the right moments in the series, and it even wraps up nicely in the end. I don't think I've ever seen an anime with every scene so carefully placed then this one.\nArt\nI have to admit, I was initially attracted to the moe designs. They were really cute, and I was expecting such nice cuteness to develop in the series.\nNo dice.\nNot to say that that's a negative, because that is actually a plus. Expect a very dark series that uses strange abstract backgrounds to make a scene really pop out at you or even scare you. The \"witches\" are one of the most beautifully detailed parts in the series, as they are where this abstract animation appears. Their worlds are unique to each and every one of them, and it's always interesting to see what trouble they will sprout for the characters next. The animation itself is also fluid and nice. Again, everything seems to be taken care of nicely, thus the studio did a nice job on this front as well.\nSound\nI have to say that even as I praise what is above, nothing is better than the music in Madoka. From the opening song of the entire anime (which later becomes the ending), \"Magia\", to the emotional opening \"Connect,\" this anime has an amazing soundtrack. There are a lot of pieces that add to the emotional turmoil of the scene, and make a scene like a transformation all the more....\"magical,\" for lack of a better word. If you are on the fence with Madoka, I heavily suggest at least trying it out for its OST. \nCharacter\nAnd with that, the praise train abruptly wrecks, because we are at, in my opinion, what Madoka did the most poorly out of everything in the show. It really is a shame, because I was expecting much more out of the characters, but in the end, they seemed extremely shallow to me and unlikable. And, worst of all, in the center of that is Madoka, herself, who is probably one of the most irritating protagonists I've ever had the treat to watch, and by far the worst character in the show. It's not that her character becomes irritating; in fact, I liked Madoka in the beginning. But I was surprised by how much her character DIDN'T change throughout the series. Until around the second to last episode of the series, she was still \"hunky dory happy sunshine fun times.\" Which I don't usually mind, but this is a series that isn't \"hunky dory happy sunshine fun times.\" Bad things happen to these girls. Often. And you'd expect Madoka's character to harden, and become stronger as a result? No. Instead, she cries and cries in just about every episode after three. Sometimes, MULTIPLE times within an episode. And continues to insist that everyone should have \"peace, love and happiness.\" Yeah okay Madoka. \nIt doesn't help it that the rest of the cast is at the same level of unlikeable. All the characters are pretty much cut board cut outs of tropes, but even when they grow past that, it is much too late. I can honestly say I never cared about Sayaka, the reckless hyperactive friend of Madoka, or her storyline; and Homura, the quiet assistant of Madoka, can be irritating in her own ways.  I personally felt like her episode to explain her past came by much too late in the series, as I was already beyond caring. It didn't help that I found her countless \"interruptions\" in fights or important scenes annoying as well (regardless of her powers). The only likable character isn't around long enough for you to develop an attachment to her either.\nEnjoyment\nAnd I must say that the characters really dragged down my enjoyment of the series as well, because this show LOVES to take these cutesy characters and do horrible things to them. Thus, when bad things happened, I was pretty indifferent, and didn't really care about it at all. I found myself rushing to the end as well, because I was really ready to be done with this show. This was very disappointing, because the music and story are all well done.\nOverall\nTo throw all these points together, Madoka is a decent show that tries some great new things, but is also in need of improvement. Is it a good show? Definitely. Is it a great show? Er....that one's up for debate.\nFinal Scores\nStory: 8/10\nArt: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nCharacter: 3/10\nEnjoyment: 4/10\nOVERALL: Madoka's a 6 out of 10 in my book. Good show, but has flaws that took over the enjoyment of the anime. \nThank you very much for taking your time to read my review."},

The pacing is utterly abysmal. I found myself bored out of my skull for the first 9 episodes. While this issue is certainly not unique to Madoka Magica (Gurren Lagann *cough*) the perceived overall value of the show is far more largely damaged as there are only 12 episodes in the whole thing, meaning that three-quarters of it isn't worth seeing on its own. This said, even I cannot deny that the\n          \n        sudden change in pace (and grand reveals) that take place in the final few episodes of Madoka Magica made the whole experience worth while, if only just.\nThe Art (9/10) is fascinating - both clean and simple moe and a far more chaotic, collage (similar to that used in Bakemonogatari) styles are used with a good deal of success. \nThe Sound (9/10) was quite well done - the soundtrack is solid and the voice acting (by the end, at least) is believable.\nThe Characters (8/10) are the other area that could have been much better. While there are some (well, one) characters that one cannot help but fall in love with (or at very least feel incredibly bad for), I couldn't help but hate the self-pitying (and frankly whining) attitude of Madoka herself. It may be said that her character is acting as most would in the situation she finds herself in, but the whining is frankly insufferable. At least in the case of Evangelion's Shinji Ikari he actually takes some action between bouts of his angst. \nThe resulting enjoyment was underwhelming for the majority of the series, only a 5/10 at best. The majority of the show was simply too tedious, too slow, and too (seemingly, until the end) pointless. While the impact of this slow buildup is fantastic, there is simply not enough content to justify giving Madoka Magica more than an 8/10 overall.\n        "},

However, that isn't the case at all. It is dark and twisted, and has unexpected plot twists as well as serious issues.\nI was initially shocked by the artwork because it is so unique.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=30,   ["text"]="                          \n    You'll often hear Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (henceforth referred to as simply \"Madoka\") described as completely revolutionising the Mahou Shoujo - or magical girl - genre of anime. You'll hear people say it \"deconstructs\" the Mahou Shoujo genre. But just how accurate are these statements?\nMadoka is different from other Mahou Shoujo. That much is made evident around a quarter of the way in. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows in the Madoka universe - oh no. The true nature of the universe is revealed to us - quite suddenly - as one in which death is a very real possibility; one in which we can\n          \n        expect the heroines of the show to die. \nBut does all this mean that Madoka is a deconstruction of the genre? Heavens no. Sure, we are presented with a universe that is far from the norm of Mahou Shoujo, but it is in no way a deconstruction of the genre. The \"deconstruction\" trope refers to taking apart something (hence the deconstruction) in order to better understand its meaning and relevance to us in reality. Madoka does not deconstruct - merely because there is death does not make it a deconstruction. It does not mean elements of the genre have been laid bare to the rigours of reality. Madoka simply looks at the genre through a different scope.\nThe perspective that Madoka is viewed from is, as I have mentioned above, completely different from most Mahou Shoujo. It is darker and there is death. There is quite a heavy focus on the suffering on the heroines. It paints quite  a bleak picture.  But are these elements enough to warrant praise? Does it make the series revolutionary? Does being different really make it good? \nOf course not.\nMadoka is so often touted as being brilliant because it deconstructs the genre, because it shows the world of Mahou Shoujo from a different scope, or simply because of the twists. Simply put, many see Madoka as being good because it is different - because it subverts cliches and has heroines far different from the norm who have to deal with issues that usually are never explored in the genre. It would be foolish to dismiss the setting as being irrelevant entirely, but the truth is Madoka isn't good because of the fact it's dark. It is good because of how well it was executed.\nRemember how I mentioned that the fact Madoka was different from other Mahou Shoujo was mentioned around a quarter of the way in? That's important. The dark universe of Madoka is not made immediately obvious to the audience. It completely takes the viewer by surprise, but it's a good kind of surprise - one that was foreshadowed subtly, albeit in a twisted fashion. It doesn't feel cheap. The brilliance of the execution that removed the façade of innocence from Madoka is twofold - not only does it completely take the viewer by surprise, but the event itself is not an irrelevant one. It serves as a catalyst for much to come in the series. \nNo event in Madoka is irrelevant; everything is interrelated, and every event seems to have significance. Nothing seems out of place - it's one concise story that flows well. The audience is kept on their feet; desperate to find out what happens next; desperate to find out how it all ties together. However, this is a double edged sword. This focused and fast-paced storytelling coupled with the fact it is only 12 episodes in length means that some developments are unfortunately rushed - for example, some plot twists come without warning and some characters seem to suffer due to these constraints (notably one of the original trio who seems to have just been cast aside).\nThe characters are however, for most part, very relevant to the plot, with their problems all tying together. The characters themselves are played quite well, with performances that really do add depth and life to their characters. However, I did not find the characters themselves very interesting - sure, their role in the plot was good, and I liked how their conflicts all seemed to converge, but (to use an example) could the character of Kaname Madoka really be seen as an interesting one? The personalities of certain characters in Madoka could only be described as generic and at times bland. This isn't that big of an issue though, considering the brilliance of Madoka once again lies with how the characters are used. It is their conflicts and their experiences which really adds life to this series. \nThe production value of Madoka is for most part quite high. The animation is usually fluid and of a high quality, with fighting scenes and transformation scenes being of a very high quality. There are slight mishaps, but it isn't a big issue. The art style of Madoka can only be described as unique - the faces are really, really wide. I was really impartial to this decision, but I can see how people might dislike this art style. However, even if you dislike the wide faces initially, by the end of the series you probably won't mind them. It really becomes trivial in the grand scheme of things and won't adversely affect your enjoyment of the series at all. \nAnother interesting facet of the art style employed in Madoka was the change in environment to a bizzare, surreal world whenever one of our heroines entered the realm of a Witch (which, if you don't know, are the antagonists of the series). The designs of witches themselves can only be described as bizzare. This is not to say this is a bad thing. The art style allows the viewers to see the contrast between the \"real world\" and the \"Witches' Realm\" - the difference between reality and this seemingly fantasy world; this world that is completely separate from the reality they knew of before - the world where they can get killed.\nThe sound was great, with the opening and ending songs providing an interesting contrast between jovial and dark. The use of sound in the series was generally done well - most of the music used was appropriate for the situation.\nI found Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica to be an enjoyable ride. Sure, it isn't as revolutionary as many would have you believe, nor does it deconstruct the Mahou Shoujo genre, but it was enjoyable nevertheless. The show is littered with a myriad of symbolism and cryptic messages written in runes, factors that only seem to encourage you to rewatch it. It's definitely a series that I'd recommen and, despite its flaws, is still a brilliantly written series. A must watch.\n        "},

Evangelion defines the 1990's, capturing the mood of Japan at the time. Haruhi Suzumiya led to an explosion in moe culture, defining the 2000's. Madoka Magica would surely define the 2010's, at least up until now.\nFor example, would Made in Abyss be the success it was, or would it even get animated, if its formula of cute-meets-soul-crushing wasn't done here first?

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    First a clarification, this review will be about the series Madoka Magica, its continuations the movie mahou shoujo madoka magica rebellion, and its recap movies (cashgrabs) will not be considered or discussed in this evaluation. And no, this review is not in any segment or paragraph spoiler free, so be warned when reading.\nDespite this not being a method I really like to use, I feel obliged to start my analysis exploring the concept that no one can shut up about when discussing this, yes the fact of whether madoka is a deconstruction, or not of the mahou shoujo genre, for it apparently containing an entirely\n          \n        new perspective on the genre. One of the reasons for the series to be perceived in that way, is mostly due to the lack of knowledge of most anime fans, darker and more dramatic takes on mahout shoujo trappings are common since the times of uta-kata or princess tutu. Mahou shoujo is way more diverse, and madoka differs way less from it, than a fan that has only seen a few shows kind that can imagine (and yes there are lunatics that have only seen one mahou shoujo, madoka, and still claim the series is a deconstruction). But no, the concept of madoka being a deconstruction is not only based on its unusual tone, but in the idea of it actually containing lots of commentary, about the mahou shoujo genre. Aspects like the action in such series being unrealistic, and would demand way too much of the human body to be feasible, the innocence of supposing that girls in this kind of situation would simply join due to the presence of a common enemy, character deaths being a common reality in this story, just to name a few. Madoka is taking a few elements people take for granted, and applying what could be said as a more realistic logic to them, having this as a way to comment on the genre’s nature. The problem in here is the content itself, what Madoka is actually saying about the genre with this, basically the series is using the commentary I explained above just to talk about how unrealistic each said aspects are. But verisimilitude with reality is not, and should never be the objective of any fictional story. The girls on those kind of plots join and have power of friendship to triumph over everything, not because of how much sense that makes realistically speaking, but because such elements are part of the socially important message those series are trying to pass on to younger audiences. When replacing those aspects for selfish heroes the series is in effect losing the messages which give meaning and purpose to the genre and its architypes. This is the issue I take with most of the so called deconstructions, they usually are works so eager in criticizing genres, to portray its meaning as hopeless idealism, but at the same time they construct nothing, no new coherent ideology in response to them. It just ends up amounting to a fake realism. They point out clichés but fail to recognize that making a story where the heroes always lose, is as predictable and unrealistic as one where the heroes always win. Only portraying the other extreme, the cynical, the immoral, the despair does not make such works any real representation of reality. If madoka fallen to such trappings, my verdict on the theming and meta aspects of the show would be pretty negative, but happily that is not the case, and this is where madoka simply brilliant ending comes into play. When all hope seems to be lost, to the point where simply having hope would mean a flaw in character, when it seems the whole series is engulfed in its own cynicism. Than we have the last episode making an unbelievable turn, hope is reaffirmed through a wish, the uselessness of practicing good, because due to the entropy that could only lead to an equal amount of suffering being done, is contested. The universal rules this perverse system that seems to deny everything to individuals is changed by said wish. Madoka in its last act reconstructs and reaffirms ideals that form the genre, the idealism destroying the own cynical setting the series builds up, following the simplest format of all, of the hero that by making a choice and having personal sacrifices, escapes and subverts a pervert system of control. The template for mahou shoujo is the result of that, reappearing here, at the series last moments. To conclude, I am not sure if what madoka is doing is actually a deconstruction or not (to be sincere I do not really care that is the case or not) but what madoka does efficiently has to explore about the mahou shoujo genre, is interesting to say the least.\nI have Always considered myself a big fan of Akiyuki Shinbou style of directing (despite never being sure, he is the actually directing some of the shows he is credited to).  Despite the variables levels of quality of a lot of projects he seems to be attached to, in each one of them I can safely say, the directing really added a lot to the experience. His style of directing may not be as artistic as something like what Kubrick usually did, where the directing itself and usage of symbolism are used to strengthen themes, and make complex really subtle points about the work, his style is marked for being really accessible and even so extremely memorable. The show tries in every regard to be visually stimulating, every scene, be it for the imagination and creativity presented in the designs, scenarios, location mapping, the usage of color pallet, backgrounds, everything in the series shows this attention to detail and creativity. Every Witch liar has a completely different form of being presented, and the forms of physical combat are among the most creative I have seen in anime. I have to point how not a lot of the directing or the detailed production is purposed to reinforce the series themes, but the effort and passion demonstrated are certainly praiseworthy. \nAn important element, I would like to present a defense towards, are the characters. Sure madoka may not have the most interesting and complex characters in the world, and I am not sure if there was a way to make really great characters of a really plot focused 12-episode series. But claiming as a lot of people do, that the series characters are empty puppets for the ideas and history, goes beyond overkill. Take Madoka the protagonist for example, her way of acting and thinking are completely understandable, her low self-esteem due to her lack of capacity of seeing merit in the things she was able to do (it would have been great if that trait did not need to be repeated 15 times), as such low self-esteem is her motivation for a dangerous altruism, leading her to want to make good things for others even when those actions mean prejudice for herself. Her insecurity and hesitation in regards to her wish are also perfectly understandable, due to the almost no way out situation, in which she is being forced to make that decision. This tendency marks madoka’s characters, they have simple personalities, that are easy to understand and sympathize, and their actions are coherent with the form they are written and their ideals. One character that negatively stands out for not being that way is Sakura Kyouko, her character and arc simply do not work. The establishment is relatively well done.  First we are presented to her and steadily her character is demonstrated through her actions, her individualistic mentality, when allowing that other humans may come to die, just to assure she will have more grief seeds, and for actively trying to take away the territory of another mahou shoujo, by force.  Later we find out her past, the fact she inadvertently has caused the destruction of her entire family, because of a wish she made judging it would help her dad, and how those elements explain the mentality she displays nowadays. All of this is shown in a short amount of time, but establishes her really well as a narcissistic asshole. And then what happens? Later she simply changes her mind, after a 5-minute conversation with Sayaka and starts to worry enough about her, to even sacrifice her life to save Sayaka. This change is not only sudden, she is also awfully explained, I do understand the fact of she forming a form of identification with Sayaka, because the two of them are suffering the shock of really awful reveals, that change completely the way that they see themselves. But from that, to there actually being this great connection between the two that justifies said actions, there is a great difference. The character development in this case, consists of convenient writing, that ignores previously stablished character aspects, just for the story progression, that needs Homura to face the Walpurgis Night alone. On a certain way it is way worse than Mami’s characters that has a more simplified development and arc, while still being coherent, due to her minor importance in the history. So in general the madoka’s cast is mediocre to ok, the characters do their job, and do not really deserve a lot of the backlash.\nOne of the more prominent themes in Madoka is the dichotomy and clash between altruism and egoism. Which one those two concepts rules, or should rule our actions is extremely relevant for the series, having every character show a unique point about that. Sakura Kyouko being the most emblematic example, since her introduction her character is defined by her egotism, and for giving absolutely no value to helping others. Those characteristics are the result of her troubling past, especially the idea of it being useless to try to do good things for others, because of our lack of capacity of understanding and really managing to enact good acts for them. The series answer for that is bringing the same logic for her own egotism, Kyouko on her own vision may be thinking she is acting according to what is best for her, but she finds herself unable to comprehend her situation, which in turn makes her incapable of realizing what is actually beneficial. In the other side of the spectrum we have Sayaka, always acting for the good of others, feeling disgusted to even imagine of taking personal gain with the situation. The character due to the loss of her body, starts to only define her value by measuring how useful she can be for others. This excessive altruism is the reason for her fall, after placing the value of her existence only on how useful she could be, when she starts having doubts on the society she is trying to protect, Sayaka is left with nothing becoming engulfed in complete despair. Homura is an odd case since her actions seem to be altruistic in a first glance, after all her motivation is the love she fells towards Madoka, but such love is essentially selfish. She wants to save Madoka only, not worrying with anything else, like other people, how they may see her, the broader situation, and being because of that incapable to solve the situation. The ending portrays a synthesis of both concepts, sure Madoka’s sacrifice may be the utmost representation of selflessness in the series, but that is only possible due to Homura’s egotism. The union of both, egoism and altruism is the answer, both are important sources to guide our actions.\nAnother remarkable aspect of this work are some of the sources it takes influence from, especially two great literary authors. Goethe is the most obvious, madoka raises a lot of the same questioning that are in the center of his reputed work Faust, some witch’s lair even containing direct visual references to that. And it is not hard to understand why that is the case, both works focus on human beings trying to enact impossible or almost impossible feats, through short cuts without putting the necessary effort. In this process the characters lose their humanity and souls, to see their desires come true. The message is also pretty similar; be careful with what you wish for. Kyuubei is also kind of reminiscent of the charismatic devil offering temptation to humans, and portraying an even understandable perspective for the audience. H.P Lovecraft, probably the most influential figure on terror as a literary genre, being another. Gen Urobuchi is in my opinion trying to recreate the existential horror that Lovecraft’s works contain, the idea of the incubators being extremely reminiscent of the Cthulhu, this supernatural being that inflict terror on the characters, this mysterious being that gives no importance or value to human kind.  The key differences are in the form both beings are portrayed, Kyuubie has motivations, methods and objectives explained in the series, the figures of horror in Lovecraft’s books on the other hand have pretty much everything about them involved in mystery, the mentality of those creatures cannot be understood for human beings and trying can only lead the individual to madness. Theoretically having said aspects explained would be a point in favor of madoka, but that is the deal. The horror in those histories comes from our lack of capacity to really know, of there being these incomprehensible horrors, which you cannot understand or predict. Giving answers and demystifying said beings only makes them less scary or threatening. This is one of the cases where raising questions and intrigue means way more for a work than any answer and explanation. If you view Madoka as an attempt in existential horror, it simply does not work on that aspect.\nThe narrative quality of Madoka also cannot be understated. I have already seen people referring to this series as the one that has perfect story’s pacing, and despite not agreeing with the sentiment, I really get the why. The narrative structure of madoka works really well, containing a healthy number of twists and revelations spaced out excellently. Having each one the twists fulfilling an important function in the narrative and in the character’s arcs, by changing the character’s perception of themselves or the reality they are inserted. Between those revelations the series never stops paying attention to how each character is being affected, how they react to the new events and reality. This constantly changing and evolving style of narrative makes madoka one of the more addictive experiences I have ever had with anime. Sure there is a degree of convenience involved here, I will always find hilarious how Homura is always getting late or in the nick of time in several events, even when she has the capacity of moving infinitely faster, than other characters.  But there is nothing that really hurts the series internal logic to a high degree, or really represents important structural problems in the series.\nTo sum things up, as I rewatched madoka I gained a deeper appreciation for the anime. I managed to comprehend what the series is trying to do, and what is the point it trying to make with its aspects.  While not always being that successful in those, it is overall doing a good job in its diverse aspects. I may not believe it will ever be a masterpiece in my eyes, mostly because of the characters, which I never managed to form a connection or caring that much about. Moments of intense emotional turmoil like those Madoka and Sayaka went through barely affecting me. But still I got a satisfying experience of the whole thing."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Kaname lives as good a life as many adolescent girls go: a well-off home, a wonderful family, and great friends. Then the first-hand revelation of the existence of witches, the fathomless despair they will within their auras, emanated from their so-called labyrinths wherever they pass, and the obligations of those whose duty it is to oppose them. And finally... an offer, a wish. For whatever you ask, would you be willing to make a contract? Would you like to become a magical girl? \nProduced by Shaft as its first original anime series, the same studio that brought us the anime adaptations of Sayonara Zetsubou\n          \n        Sensei, ef – a fairy tale of the two, and the monogatari series, Puella Magi, or Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, begins with what appears on the surface to be another typical take on the magical girl genre... one that usually places adversity, action, and fluff, sappy stuff, in the same room. The show, even from the beginning on, begs to differ. It commands us of this: To see what's off color from that strange, ominous dream. To listen to the warnings of that mysterious, yet familiar girl. To be aware. To be ready as plot and character are tested and contorted by this tale from both within and without, from the heights of pre-subversion heaven into the depths of post-subversion hell. It is full of twists and turns meant to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, if not fall off of them altogether. To accomplish these twists and turns successfully, adequate and subtle foreshadowing is imperative. A balance of expectations must be struck: one that could happen rather than should, one that invites shock while warding off suspension. And to the show's merit, with what it did with the first major subversion and beyond, it does that very well. This show is subtleties a plenty that suggest those traumas and horrors, delivered with a certain finesse, letting it all sink in before letting another wham smack you upside the face or double up the gut.\nDirector Akiyuki Shinbo's unconventional style of surreal artistry, odd angles, variant lighting, and object placement, alongside allusions to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust not only give audiences something strange, yet innovative and exciting to look at. The standout sight, however, the witches, the familiars, and their lairs, inspired by Russian and Czech animation styles, are thanks to troupe Gekidan InuCurry. They provide the perfect complement, unnerving perversions of innocence, to Script Writer Gen Urobuchi's dark knack for character brutalizations. This is not to say brutalizations are a crucial trait toward excellent storytelling, but Urobuchi's prowess in fingering through bowels make it work in a way as to have either result in screaming in anguish and/or sobbing uncontrollably at and/or on their screens. However, a story cannot hold itself up to scrutiny unless there is more to the content than just subversion, since subversion is a more a means, a device, rather than the end. The end to subversion is a deconstruction, and the end to deconstruction, to the show itself... But what is a deconstruction? What is it besides another means? Deconstruction is a postmodern form of literary analysis that tears into how genre tropes are presented in the story. Fluff, for instance, is one common expression of magical girls, sweet and simple. It's so ubiquitous in magical girl anime that one tends to take it for granted. Yet on whose authority is fluff the end all, be all? Is this all that this genre can amounts to? Deconstruction questions these assumptions through the binary oppositions, or dialectical opposites. What becomes of this is the juxtaposition of fluff with grit and gore. Grim consequences brought to the fore. In addition, new perspectives, interestingly enough, result in further deconstructions of other issues present in the form of philosophical inquiry. What is the nature of warfare? Is there such a thing as altruism? What does it mean to be human? Is hope real?\nThese writings are complemented by show's incredibly well done battle sequences, both avoiding the pit-fall of becoming a distraction while serving more than just spectacle. Aside for fan favorite arrays such as “Unlimited Musket Works” (though I happen to be fonder of the RPG and Mortar versions myself), no where is the action shown just for a rise. In fact, Some contribute to that dangerous sense of elation. Others suit the tone of desperation. Still others build heroic defiance.\nAlong with Shaft's trademark aesthetic is its rather clever and dynamic utilization of OPs and EDs. Minor shifts in detail, choice temporal placements, and, particularly with the EDs, the incorporation of different musics and visuals at the conclusions of fait accompli intervals not only reflect the direction the show is headed. They provide new insights under the lenses of new contexts. Picking directly at the music itself, we have the official OP “Connect” by the female J-Pop idol duo ClariS, which, paralleled with the OP art and animation, provides for primarily the fuzzy feeling one gets with bright lights, energetic hijinks, and happy images. Yet there is foreshadow; subversion, we salute you. The official ED “Magia,” by Yuki Kajiura's band Kalafina, by contrast, follows the show's descent into the dark and disturbing: bleak and steadily blackening backgrounds swallowing the colored silhouettes of characters coupled with those chimes, cymbals, strings, heavy metal, and eerie, eerie chants. Both OP and especially ED, if not for the music, deserve repeated by observant and fanatical fans as they hint at later developments that might not otherwise be appreciable on first watch. The OST, composed by Kajiura itself, is done fittingly within the contexts of characters and scenes as well as on their own merits, whether it be with the intensity of one violin or the epic of an entire orchestra: happy-go-lucky to heart-wrenching, mysterious to evocative, tragic to inspiring.\nAll this being said, the show is not without its flaws. Though I don't have much issue with Shaft and its tendency toward quick vacillations in camera views, peculiar angles of characters within some of the shots, such as the studio's iconic tendency toward head tilts, admittedly, can feel distracting. The Hidamari Sketch character designs by Ume Aoki, for the most part, fit the subversive features. They can also demonstrate, from body language to facial expression, a surprising amount of pathos. However, far distance panoramas can have faces looking somewhat like moe blobs which can take away from the immersion of moments otherwise meant to be taken seriously. The animation is fluid, save for certain parts when much isn't happening on screen, whereby things may feel stilted. Character development is superb throughout, but if complaints are to be had, the introduction to one character's back story felt a bit rushed and unnatural. Another's was hardly touched, though hers worked fine for the purpose that she was set up for while containing a subtle, yet surprising amount of depth. It would just be nice if her background was more thoroughly explored.\nRegardless if Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is as revolutionary as Neon Genesis Evangelion was for mecha... Regardless if it is darker than cousins Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha and Princess Tutu... it is nonetheless a piece that deserves a watch, regardless of preconception generated by the genre. After all, it is a human story foremost.\nI give Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica a 9 out of 10.\n        "},

And now that I've completed it within a day I just have to say: It's a masterpiece.\nThe producers take the genre magical girl and create something much more.\nIt's an anime full of death, pain, sadness and the question \"What's the value of a single human life?\"\nDon't be shocked from the first impression. The anime isn't what he may look like the first time you see it. \nTo the art: It's impressive, the\n          \n        girls themselves look like any girls from another magical girl anime, but the enviroment (especially the other \"world\") looks like it's taken from a newspaper and being put in this anime.

When I saw the first witch I knew that I want to watch the anime till the end.\nTo the story: I don't want to spoiler anyone so I'll try not to do. Like I said before, it's like a very very dark version of a magical girl anime. The girls have to suffer great physical and even psychological damage through the anime. They have to learn the value of their own and other people's lifes.\nTo the sound: I just love the soundtrack chosen for this anime. It's just like the soundtrack in a good horror movie: They chose the right music for the right situation. The only thing I didn't like was the opening, cause because of the opening I thought it would be another crappy anime again.\nTo the characters: Well, the only thing I'll give a 9. The characters are well developed, but I think the bound between some of them are too great. Some of them know each other for a month or less and even so they think of each other as good friends. It's a bit too much, but except for this ..the characters are great too.\nTo the enjoyment: I watched the anime on one day. I just had too...after the first three episodes I was excited. I really enjoyed it till the very end and I would recommend everyone to watch this anime.\nOverall: Well 10/10 points for sure.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    If you had told me a few months ago that a magical girl anime would become one of my favorite shows of all time, I would have laughed at you, slapped you upside your head and then continued to laugh. Don't let that label fool you however, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is not your run-of-the-mill magical girl anime. There have been a few series, such as Nanoha that have gone against the grain in terms of the magical girl genre, but Madoka seriously flipped the script. This ain't no sunshine, happy, cute, fluffy, fuwa fuwa magical girl show meant for little kids. Not by a\n          \n        freakin' long shot. Yeah, you have magical girls fighting witches, but this is not a standard anime from the genre. This is gritty and dark yet enthralling, full of despair and bleakness yet it leaves you full of hope. This is one of the first anime I've seen where forums dealing with speculation were 20 pages long... after three episodes! This is just an amazing anime. I'll break down the grading criteria:\nStory: 10/10\nThe storyline of Madoka is absolutely great. The way it rolls along just keeps you wanting more, guessing more and eagerly awaiting the next episode more. There are times where it's pleasant and nice, where you're smiling watching it. Then, there are times where you feel a deep pity and sadness for some characters or blatant hatred for others. Gen Urobuchi wove this tale intricately but not intricate enough where you're confused. The fact that it's intricate keeps you on your toes and guessing. Plot twists, when inserted in the right place, can make a story much better than it already is. Madoka is chock-full of the well-placed plot twist.  The storyline also flows very well. Some may feel like it builds up slow, but the pace is what creates all of the tension. There will be dissenting opinions on the ending of the story, but in my opinion, it was written and executed in an amazing way.\nArt: 10/10\nThis is a SHAFT anime, so you should expect ridiculous art. Cotton ball monsters? Yup. Paper layering animation? Yup. Director Akiyuki Shinbou is notorious for this style of art and it's in full effect. It isn't used all the time, but when it is used, boy, it is freakin' used. I personally love it (the art in Bakemonogatari was AMAZING, in my opinion) but others may feel like it's a bit too much at times. The characters were drawn by Ume Aoki (Hidamari Sketch) and I thought that they were drawn beautifully (in a non-attracted-to-2D type of way). A lot of people aren't a big fan of the character designs from Hidamari Sketch, but I love those eyes. Just something about them. Seriously, look for a Madoka pic online and just stare in her eyes. Beautiful.\nSound: 10/10\nYuki Kajiura did an excellent job with the soundtrack of Madoka; some of the music sounds archaic, but bad-ass archaic. It's the type of stuff you want to hear when you're talking about fighting witches. The opening song, \"Connect\" by ClariS, is one of the most played songs on my iTunes. The ending song, \"Magia\" by Kalafina, has grown on me big time. Madoka is a great musical experience.\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe characters and the storyline are the two most important facets to any story, and Madoka pulls through with its cast of characters. You really sympathize for the characters and the pain they go through. The seiyuu (voice actresses/actors) are well-chosen for the characters; it's a pretty renowned cast and they all pull off their roles extremely well. You'll find yourself wanting to scream at Madoka, pull your hair out at Sayaka, cry for Mami, smile at Kyoko and hug Homura. Most of all though, you'll want to kill Kyuubey. See what I mean? You really get the feeling of knowing the characters through their actions and through their progression in the storyline.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nYou'll find yourself at the edge of your seat watching Madoka. It's a ride. A crazy, crazy ride. If you're not coming in with negative expectations, you should have a great time watching it. All the elements of the show come together to really hit you. Whether it's the action, the emotion, the art, the music, the characters or the story that gets you, you'll be enticed by Madoka. I wouldn't mind watching it over and over, just to pick up things I had missed before. I think that this is one of the best anime to come out in a while; hell, I'd say that it has the possibility to be the best show of 2011. It managed to pack an entire warehouse full of epicness in 12 episodes. I recommend Madoka to anyone who is trying to see a \"revolutionary anime\" done right. \nOverall: 10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=27,   ["text"]="                          \n    Honestly, I don't understand why people are so in love with this anime. I was made to watch it and it wasn't so bad, so I finished it. That doesn't mean that it was great by any stretch.\nLet's start with what was alright in my opinion. The soundtrack was decent and I liked the ending song. The music complimented the story nicely and that's all. The art was also good, especially the backgrounds were very well done.\nCharacters - I give them 5/10. They were believable in their behaviour (mostly), but I didn't identify with any of them and their struggles didn't really have any affect\n          \n        on me. Why was that? Probably because of what the story was doing to them. I admit some of them had their cool moments, but there were few and far between.\nThe story - in my opinion it's above average, but doesn't deserve more than 6/10. The idea to show why becoming magical girl is a very bad choice of future career has its appeal, but the ending totally destroyed it and cheapened the struggles of the characters. Basically, it all was going in a good direction, story-wise, then it seems like the authors decided that the magical girls have to save the world and maybe even the universe, because it's no fun without that. I hated it.\nEnjoyment - at first there was none on my part, then the middle of the anime was good and interesting, and then the ending, which blew everything out of proportion and ruined the whole experience for me.\nGenerally I don't watch the magical girls genre, but I heard \"Madoka\" was different. It was, and probably it's very good in comparison to other animes of this genre, but when I don't comapare it to anything, I can give it only 6/10. Above average, thanks to some originality, but nothing great or exciting.\nThank you for reading my first review.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is an interesting anime, and it surprised me. Nonetheless, it is by no means a masterpiece.\nThe story in this anime is extremely complex. Everything starts rather simply, but things got exponentially more complex as things went through.\n-------Spoiler ahead:\nThe story was fine until it touched the laws of the universe and thermodynamics. The principle of harnessing the energy of a witch conversion to nullify the universe's entropy is way too far fetched. \nThe time travel aspect of this anime was good, but nothing exceptional. It certainly improved the story.\nFurthermore, the concept of witches and grief seeds was not very good in my opinion.\n          \n        For instance, familiars are spared so that they collect human energy, to become a witch, and only then be killed by a magic girl so that they can collect the grief seed and get the witches energy, which essentially is indirectly absorbing human energy.\nSo pointless. Why not make it so that magic girls, if they wish so, can directly kill humans to get stronger? I think evil magic girls could be explored more and replace witches.\nKyubey being evil, or perhaps simply neutral, was a plus to the story.\nBecause of these issues, and the over the top ending, I can not give this anime a high rating for the otherwise good story.\n6/10\nThe artstyle was hit or miss. I particularly did not enjoy the way witches and their barriers were made. In general, the art was mediocre. It delivered its purpose, but just that.\n5/10\nI liked the music of the anime, and overall the sound quality and effects were good and fitted the anime well.\n7/10\nCharacter development was the main theme of this anime. The plot mainly served as a way to display the characters feelings, rather being the focus itself.\nAs such, we got to know all the characters deeply and know their personal struggles. That said, it became a bit repetitive, and in no way was it a masterpiece. \n7/10\nThe plot was initially dull to me, but then, it got overtly complex trying to achieve depth. It got me going in conjunction with the characters, but it was not a particularly memorable experience to me. The enjoyment was mediocre.\n5/10\nOverall, the anime certainly pleased the fans of the genre. But to an outsider, it just provided a fair experience. The plot certainly is the most interesting aspect of the anime. I am sure some will think of it as a masterpiece. But to me, complexity is not necessarily quality, so this anime can not have masterpiece status to me.\n6/10.\n"},

I've rewatched this anime 5 times and can say that with utmost certainty. Why is it a masterpiece you might ask? You'll really have to see for yourself, but I CAN tell you why it's worth watching.\n- \nLet's start with...the story which I give a 10 overall. (Some spoilers for episode 1. I recommend watching it first if you care.) \nMadoka Kaname is your average middle school girl. One day, a new student transfers to her class.\nThat same day, after school, she's hanging out with her friend when they end up encountering a magical familiar named Kyubey, who\n          \n        is being attacked by said transfer student. \nAfterwards, Kyubey offers to grant them any wish that they desire. In exchange they must become magical girls and fight witches. \nSo far it seems like a regular magical girl series, right? \nMagical familiar (✓)\nMagical girls/magic being used (✓)\nEnemies they must defeat (witches) (✓)\nThis could just be Cardcaptor Sakura or something! But that's where your wrong. The darker undertones are already there. \nNear death of magical familiar (✓)\nTerrifying enemies (✓)\nBitter rivalry between magical girls (✓)\nAnd that's where this show differs from \"your average magical girl anime\". You probably already know this, but the show is a psychological thriller for a freaking reason. \nThe world of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a perilous place and things are not what they seem. \nThis anime may seem happy-go-lucky for the first few episodes, but these things are present all the time. And as you go on, you'll see them become more apparent.\nSecond, the art. This gets a 9 from me. The art style is very unique. The character designs are a bit simplistic, but they're charming. All the main characters can be associated with their own color since their eye and hair colors are the same and they each have their own style as well, making them distinct as characters. The backgrounds are really beautiful and creative (especially during fight scenes). The animation is really smooth as well. I don't really have any complaints, honestly. \nThird, the music. It gets a 10. The soundtrack of this show is absolutely amazing. From the opening (which stays the same the entire show) to the numerous ending themes. I've found they're all very fitting. Especially when you analyze the lyrics of these themes. The various characters also have their own character themes which fit their personalities well.\nNext, the characters. They all get a 10. All of the main characters feel almost alive. You can really feel yourself rooting for them at times and in my opinion, each and every one of them has an equally important role in the series and they make this anime the masterpiece it is. I won't say more to keep this review less spoiler-y.\nMy enjoyment and overall opinion of this anime is a flat out 10. Sure I may be a bit biased, having watched it 5 times, but it may just be my favorite anime. I hope my review convinced you that you need to watch it (if you haven't already). Have a nice day! :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Here’s my review of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica… of the 200 or so that are out there.\nThe anime is rated by the MAL criteria in the bottom of this review. Because countless top-rated reviews have already provided this information exhaustively, I believe my opinion about why “Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is worth the watch” would be more interesting than reading the same information over and over.\nWhy “Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?” (Top 3 reasons)\n1) Gen Urobuchi: He was the writer for many highly rated anime out there: Fate/Zero, Black Lagoon, Psycho-Pass, and Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. If you’re like me, watching a memorable anime motivates\n          \n        me to look out for more works done by the same writer. Therefore, I recommend this anime if you have already watched and liked any of the anime listed above.\n2) The Tip of the Iceberg: There was more depth to this anime than meets the eye. At first, I was completely bewildered by the ending of this anime. The episodes that came beforehand were fine, but out of all the anime that I watched, the ending of this anime did not seem to add up at all -- I felt that there were so many questions left unanswered and that the last episode was unsuccessfully trying to cram everything into one episode. \nI was terribly mistaken.\nI was so used to explanations being spoon-fed to me that it never occurred to me to think for once. I eventually resorted to researching, after coming up with my own theories and explanations. In the end, I realized how brilliant the ending actually was and everything made so much more sense. No doubt, I still had questions and I still found inconsistencies (I’d be more than willing to discuss with anyone), but Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica managed to do a better job of closing off the anime than I first thought. The challenge of trying to understand the writer’s intentions was somewhat of a first for me, since most anime have simple plot lines and somewhat predictable endings. Therefore, I recommend this anime if you like an anime that makes you think.\n3) “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” I have to mention this aspect of the anime, even if everyone else has already written about it. The surprisingly dark twist on the idea of a “magic girl” is what initially drew me into the series. The contract that the girls make to become “magic girls” is actually quite deceptive. On the surface, the deal is as good as it sounds. The girls can have one wish granted, as long as they risk their lives to fighting off witches. Since the girls receive awesome magic powers in addition to getting their individual wishes granted, this deal sounds like a “win-win” situation for the girls, right? Not really. I won’t spoil anything, but I will say that this anime is very dark and somewhat depressing even. I recommend this anime for anyone who is jaded from the typical “magic girl” anime.\nStory: 9/10\nThe anime focuses on the life of the young schoolgirl Kaname Madoka. She is shy, humble, and most all, kind-hearted to a fault. She lives with a loving family and a group of friends that she treasures equally as much. She’s not particularly talented at anything, a fact that initially draws her into becoming a “magical girl,” because she believes even she can do something to protect her loved ones. Not much else can be said without spoiling the first two episodes or so, but basically the world is filled with “magical girls” that hunt witches that curse human beings into committing suicide or other unworldly deaths. The anime focuses on the decision of becoming a “magical girl” and explores the various consequences that come along with it. The dark twist that the anime takes on the “magical girls” trope, the tense emotions, and the plot twist elements are what gives this story a 9.\nArt: 7/10\nI would rate the art higher only because of the unique style of animation when the girls fight witches. The witches are depicted as moving pieces of abstract art, as well as the world in which they occupy. This emphasizes the distortion of the witch’s moral values as well as their chaotic and inhuman state of mind. The art used to depict these witches and their worlds are beautifully tragic, and you’ll see why as you keep watching. This choice of animation will always remain in my memories as one of the best.\nPersonally, I’m not a fan of how the characters are depicted. I feel that the “magical girl” costumes were too generic and simple (not to mention how they were mostly single-colored). The facial features of the girls seem way to simplistic for my taste, because they make all the characters look way too young. In addition, the animation that girls go through as they “transform” into the “magical girl” clothes seem very unnecessary, because these animations were very short, inconsistent, and hardly memorable. Besides the character depiction, however, the fighting animation is very fluid and well-done. What I dislike about the character’s features is counteracted by the many epic fights that occur throughout the series.\nI can’t say much about the scenery, but I can say that there are many dark colored backgrounds. The glaze of gray and black adds to the darkness of the situation and goes with the intense mood of the anime.\nMusic: 8/10\nWhat struck me about the soundtrack of this anime was how epic and well-made it was. The ending song “Magia” is very dark and intense. There are not many cheery type of music, and most of them help to amplify the tension and the atmosphere of the situation. \nCharacters: 7/10\nThe anime focuses mainly on five characters, but 12 episodes are not quite enough to develop all of them (I felt as though some characters were neglected). The viewers are introduced to the background of the characters and their motivations to becoming “magical girls,” motivations that are very much relatable and understandable. There will definitely be some characters you will be emotionally attached to by the end of this anime. Despite the short amount of episodes, however, this anime did a decent job of developing these characters.\nOverall, I enjoyed this series a lot and it’s not an exaggeration to say that I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole marathon of watching this series. \n9/10"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica doesn't need an introduction. Airing in 2011, the anime took the world by storm, having an unorthodox twist to the magical girl genre (to people who don't really know much about the magical girl genre, but I digress) in that it was incredibly brutal, lacked the usual plot armor that magical girl anime are infamous for, and it's more complex themes, ranging from Faust to selfishness vs. selflessness as well as finding salvation when there is nothing left.\nThere are mild spoilers in this review, but I've managed to avoid spoiling anything that isn't already known to the average person capable of\n          \n        looking at the official art on the page and anyone who hasn't already heard about the series' reputation.\nThat being said, proceed with some caution.\nThe story isn't much that we have seen before on a basic level, but becomes more multi-layered and complex as it goes along. The show has high re-watch value simply to watch all the pieces of the plot mash together, and boy do they mash together very well. The show remains thematically consistent in its message until the ending, while not providing any answers to most of the themes, leaving the a lot of aspects up to interpretation.\nThe problem is that, well, the show's story isn't as fleshed out as it could have been. A lot of aspects are left unexplained and undeveloped, from the point where magical girls always existed (which brings the question of when and how relevant they are to anything) to the point where you wonder why none of the wishes made when a person makes a wish are in any way similar to the wishes that occur over the course of the show, specifically near the ending. \nThe show is filled with plot holes like this, and you truly wonder if they edited out parts explaining such ideas in favor of cramming the story into 12 episodes. A lot of the world-building feels rushed and confused, which is a shame considering that the story as a whole is quite good, but doesn't reach the amount of depth and interest that it could've reached.\nThe artwork is another minor concern over the course of the show, as I find it unable to fully express the emotions of the various characters, and couldn't help but feel that with a more human appearance, I would've been more emotionally involved.\nI know that the art-style was supposed to fool people about the kind of show this is, but it nevertheless doesn't really work in this kind of show in my opinion. The show's character designs are a factor that stand in the way of humanizing the characters completely, since a lot of their facial expressions are indistinguishable from one another and hardly change.\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful and the direction is incredibly well-done, with some absolutely gorgeous backdrops and a lot of amazing scenery throughout the show. The developers put a lot of care in bringing the setting to life, and it truly shows over the course of the show.\nThe voice-acting is exceptionally done and fits the characters well, and becomes absolutely chilling later on in the show. Sayaka's voice actress in particular did an absolutely fantastic job in bringing the character to life, and Eri Kitamura deserves full credit for managing to change from happy to sad to angry so effectively.\nThe dub is atrocious and forgettable, and I recommend avoiding that like the plague. The Japanese voice over has more passion and care put into it than the dub, and I couldn't help but feel while watching the dub that the voice actors were trying way too hard to sound like their Japanese counterparts rather than voice the characters in their own way.\nThe soundtrack is excellent as well, bringing some absolutely amazing tracks that are on my phone and frequently listen to. The ending song, Magia, is high on my all time favorite ending songs of all time, and the opening is surprisingly fitting, strangely enough.\nThe characters are my biggest problem with Madoka Magica; they are simplistic and mainly serve as tools to serve the plot, rather than the other way around. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course, but I couldn't help but feel that the story is why they're so popular rather than them standing as characters on their own.\nThey're so defined by the plot that they feel like plot points rather than characters, with very simplistic traits and conflicts (although the character conflicts are engaging in the context of the story) and don't stand on their own in any way. Again, this isn't a bad thing, but I couldn't help but feel that they were way too simple-minded for something that they're supposedly putting their lives on the line for.\nSayaka is a major exception to this flaw, and her character relationships with everyone in the show and her own character conflict was a joy to watch and easily the best part of the show. I don't quite understand the hate on her character to be honest, she's the character who felt the least like a plot device and felt the most human and dynamic out of the entire cast.\nI enjoyed Madoka Magica greatly, don't get me wrong. It's a very solid show which is consistent from start to finish and is engaging and very easy to recommend to most people. I couldn't help but feel, however, that it's hype has more to do with the gruesome elements in the show rather than other elements more worthy of attention, and that many aspects of the show are underappreciated by the fanbase.\nI nevertheless recommend it, as I believe it's something most anime fans will find some enjoyment in.\n        "},

Yes, it's the same quote from the FMAB series, in which the theme that is heavily stressed out is the fact that you must pay something to obtain another. Madoka Magica is a series that also uses a similar theme to the quote, except a little different. Let me first explain for people who have not watched the series exactly why.\nIn the universe of Madoka Magica, familiars such as Kyuubey have the ability to change you into a magical girl while granting your wish; all you have\n          \n        to do is simply reply that you want to become one. But Kyuubey never explains at the beginning of the series that there is a cost to becoming a magical girl, and that is losing your own humanity. Kyuubey takes your soul and puts in into a soul gem, in which you are invincible, as long as your soul gem does not get damage. Kyuubey thinks of this soul transaction as a helpful bonus, because the human body by itself is incapable of battling against a witch. Yet the character cast is terrified, and some pay even more than just the loss of their humanity.\nSayaka becomes a magical girl after making a contract with Kyuubey to grant her wish, to help return Kamijou's ability to use his body to play music. But because of this miracle, Sayaka gave away both her humanity and sanity, eventually being turned into the very thing she was to fight against, a witch. Sayaka, after becoming a magical girl, was driven into insanity, because of her naive belief that her miracle would come true and everything would be happily ever after. Well, half of that was true.\nMadoka Magica, similar to FMAB, tries to explain that nothing in this world is free, and if you got something very valuable, you were to pay something else that was valuable. Each character is to shown to have gained and lost something in this series, such as the aforementioned Sayaka, Madoka, who lost her best friend, and Sakura, who paid her life.\nOnce again Shaft Sudios tries out their unique style of animation, which I find quite fitting with the theme and dystopic story. Madoka Magica definitely gives off a different feel, like you truly are in another universe. The animation may seem lazy and simple, but in many ways it fits the series the best.\nAnd the soundtrack, Yuki Kajiura has done it again. She has created another magical OST using operas and instruments such as the flute quite often. With an amazing story and amazing soundtrack, the enjoyment of the series is amplified over and over again. \nThe overall story, soundtrack, and art were amazing, and I can consider this to be one of my favorite animes out there. Shaft studios has once again, created a story with depth and multiple layers. Madoka Magica definitely does take time to understand, as you most likely need to watch it multiple times to understand each characters point of views. Don't let that title fool you, this is definitely a dystopia-type of anime."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Of all the genres in anime, there are few as innocent and as light as the magical girl genre. It is usually by default that audiences expect the same old concept of the young, optimistic heroine who harnesses some sort of magical power given to her to battle evil forces in the name of justice. So to those unfamiliar with director Akiyuki Shinbo and writer Urobuchi Gen, Puella Magi Madoka Magica must have come with quite a shock.\nWhile there certainly have been magical girl shows that have taken a darker focus in the past, none so far have been able to deconstruct the genre as\n          \n        successfully as Madoka Magica. In this regard, Urobuchi Gen lives true to his name, as he manages to carefully and logically dissect the magical girl genre, turning it into an often cruel and unforgiving place. The tension and horror that Gen creates is further compounded by an aura of ambiguity that lies over the setting, which is propagated by one of the most unreliable exposition characters of all time, Kyube. In such a universe there is no solace to be found in this little mascot companion, all the while there are barrages of unsettling revelations. \nIn appreciating the incredible atmosphere of this anime, one must not certainly forget composer Yuiji Kajura. The way she manages to bring out the often somber and dark atmosphere of the show with nothing but the ambience of her music is breath taking. In particular, the way each episode in the series is led into the powerfully dark ending theme, Magia, is chilling. It would not be an overstatement to say that without her contribution, Madoka Magica may have only been two-thirds as great. \nAlthough perhaps a bit eclipsed by Urobuchi Gen, Shinbo’s style and hand in the series is definitely there. From the trippy and LSD induced scenes of the witches that create a sense of a foreign environment, to how usual scenes are made to look surreal, it is definitely classic Shinbo. Whether or not one will appreciate his distinctive style in a magical girl show is a different story. Sometimes seeing a bunch of mustache men and your lunch integrated into the action sequences just goes a little bit too far. There were often points in the series that perhaps would have done better with a more traditional approach to animation and art. This is not to say that Shinbo did not have his usual touches of brilliance, but that there is a fine line between brilliance and just being flat out pretentious, which at times I felt, was violated.\nHowever, despite everything, the story can be boiled down to the personal struggle of our main character Kaname Madoka. As an idealistic young girl, she has to come to terms with the cynical universe she is placed in and search for the best answer to solving the vaguely dark and evil forces that threaten to destroy the world she has come to love. The decisions she has to make eventually culminate into a very touching and emotional conclusion. \nOverall, while the plot often forces the characters into dire situations, it is through these plot points that the viewer is truly able to see what each character is made of. In doing so Gen manages to not sacrifice the emotional involvement in this show in his pursuit of deconstruction, maintaining a nice balance of both intellectual and emotional satisfaction. Madoka Magica manages to become a unique experience that almost any anime fan can appreciate, and for that, it is fully deserving of the accolades it receives."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    When I first came across Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica I expected something that was light and fluffy (I did watch the series when it first started) but what I got was completely different. Everything came as a surprise and that's what really kept me watching. \nIt starts out like a regular magical girl anime, fighting enemies, collecting their droppings (yes that's what I like to call them), but then everything takes a turn.  The atmosphere becomes dark as we watch the hardships each character goes through. While all this takes place, we, the viewers, also learn what is really going on.  After a turn\n          \n        of unpredictable events we reach an exciting climax and then given a somewhat conclusive ending\nUsually the pacing is a problem in a 12 or 13 episode series, but not in this case.  Every episode does contribute to the story and the it never seems like the story is being dragged.  Pacing is part of the reason to why the series gets such a good reception, because if the series had horrendous pacing, the series would get boring at some points and super confusing at others no matter how good the story is\nAnother reason to why the series is fantastic is because of the unpredictable twists.  The anime is actually an original (as in not an adaption), so no one knew what happened next. A lot of the events that advance the plot are really unpredictable. It always surprises us which keeps us watching.  Also for the majority of the series, we are not given the full picture.  So it also keeps us watching as the events piece the picture together. The series also managed have a conclusive ending unlike many others today, which leaves the series up in the air.\nAs the idea itself, it's also another strong point but I wouldn't say it's a first. The reason being that there are countless series out there and I'm sure there is a number of them had a similar premise.  However since there is a large amount of series out there it is very difficult to come up with something totally unique.  Also the combination of genres really isn't the first thing that comes to mind.  So I applaud the series for going for something different.  The idea was also executed really well which plays a major role in how good the series is.\nThe series is also character driven and the characters usually spark events that happen. All the characters have their time in the spotlight and each are more complex then what they appear to be.  Each character undergoes development and each one is explored in depth as we watch the hardships each one has to go through. We also have Kyuubey, who some may consider the antagonist of the show.  Although he has no emotions or moral values, the reason why he does what he does, seems logical.  There's thought put into each character but the behavior of the characters can be a strange at times and the development of each is a bit rushed but the characters were done really well nonetheless.\nAs many of you know, the producers of the series was SHAFT so I was expecting another series with unique art.  The normal world is slightly futuristic and is drawn fairly well. However when we get to the world with witches the entire style changes.  Everything becomes very abstract and it helps set up the atmosphere of the series\nSound isn't really something I pay attention to.  However I did notice that ClairS did the opening which actually creates the illusion that the series would be something very light. The ending is a much different story, unlike the opening it matches the atmosphere the series and I feel that it fit perfectly. The cast has some well known voice actors and they all match their character, they also voice the characters' emotions quite well.\nI watched the series when it first started so the hype didn't really effect me as a viewer.  However with all the hype around, I feel like enjoying the series might be harder. The reason is when I came in I had no expectations so it was a pleasant surprise to see how good the series turned out.  But when there is a lot of hype, a viewer tends to come in with expectations which are through the roof.  Also when there's a lot of hype, I find that people tend to have a negative mindset because it's almost as if they are being forced to watch it.\nAll that aside, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica was really enjoyable due to all the unpredictable events that happened, it always had you guessing. The pacing also played a role in enjoyment because it ensured that it never got boring since everything that the show presented relevant.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is certainly making it's case for anime of the year and it has set the bar pretty high. It just goes to show that a well written, well paced story with a twist can still get pretty far.\nThanks for Reading.\n"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="                          \n       Madoka Magica was hyped as the ultimate deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Not only that, but one of the best deconstructions to date. Its name carries a lot of weight with anime fans, and is often brought up when talking about great anime from this decade. I went into Madoka Magica expecting greatness; however, only mastering its goal wasn't enough to illustrate a true masterpiece. \n   The story starts out extremely slow and confusing and becomes predictable over time. It being called a deconstruction is a giant spoiler tag for me, as I can see what to expect. If\n          \n        you go on the premise of a normal magical girl show, the plot will seem overly dark and brilliant in some eyes. This was not the case with me, as I only became interested in the plot around episode 9+. The story wasn't that dark, and became similar to a classic thriller, giving immediate signs of following a similar formula. \n   Shaft's animation quality was great, but the art style itself was unappealing in my eyes. The characters seemed bland and uninteresting, as well as the abstract enemies and backdrops portrayed throughout. The sound was top notch, not the best soundtrack, but not far off from perfect for this show. \n   The characters in Madoka Magica are easy to sympathize with and intriguing in their own rights; nonetheless, they're not perfect and their natures are distinguished early on. Each girl's personality is revealed early on, and with past examples of similar characters, they're, again, predictable. \n   Overall, I did not enjoy watching Madoka Magica; however, I still see it as a good, well rounded anime and an amazing example of a deconstruction. I give Madoka a good 7/10 and a recommendation for anyone                                          who likes thrillers or unique art styles to watch it immediately, or if anyone want's THE deconstruction of the magical girl genre.  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Are you looking for a magical girl series filled with happiness and joy? Well, then you are looking in the wrong place. I watched the opening. The word dark was pushed into the back of my mind. I watched the first episode-I didn't expect much from the anime. But later, I included Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica in my ''favorite'' list.\nThis whole anime starts by showing Madoka running across a dark room and seeing a girl struggling. She wakes up after being told that she can save her. But then someone transfers to their school. Madoka thinks she is the same girl in her dream. The\n          \n        story is told in a slow pace, gradually showing hints that it's going to be dark. You'd need to watch every episode to understand what was going on. I think part of the reason why I gave the story a 10 is because it is not very easy to understand if you don't pay attention to the story.The thing that bothered me in this anime was that the ending didn't make much sense to me. I want to write this review without any spoilers, so I'm not going to write about what confused me. But if you watched the end, you'd see what I mean.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is very unique. First, you think it's a happy-go-lucky anime, and...SNAP! Everything changes into a dark anime with very few comedy scenes. This is also why I gave the story a 10. You can always receive a surprise from this anime. The pacing is excellent too. I was always excited to watch the next episode. The first episode is very welcoming, showing events that will continue the story. The owners of this anime planned this anime very well and carefully, so we can watch an anime filled with excitement.\nThe ending was very satisfying to me. There were a few plot holes, which bothered me a little, but other than that everything was explained. The ending concluded everything, but it leaves the audience would want more episodes, which is also why I gave this anime an extra point. \nThe art is developed by Shaft. I liked the character's ''wide face'' feature. It makes them look cute, which is needed for a magical girl anime. The director wanted you to think it was going to be a cute anime full of smiles, because of Madoka's cute and chubby face. Many people were fooled by this feature. I don't think the character's art styles are fitting for the story. If I knew what this anime was about before I watched it, I'd expect the art to be realistic, like Death Note. The witches are a totally  different story, though. Some may look cute (like Charlotte) but some may look scary and gross. I think every design matches the character's personality well, like Kyouko's red hair represents her fiery personality. \nThe backgrounds are very well drawn. I like the backgrounds when they are fighting witches. You can tell what the witch is going to be like by looking at them. The backgrounds are usually food or plants, but there are other kinds. The transformations are also superb. Unlike animations like Mermaid Melody, the transformations are very short but still enjoyable. I like how the background in the transformations also show the magical girl's personality, like how you can see music notes in one transformation because she likes music.\nThe eyes of the characters look very similar, but other than that, they look very different. This did not give the plot away, because I didn't see any characters that looked very dark and scary (except for the witches). By this smart plan, you wouldn't expect anything. \nThe music was composed by Yuki Kajiura. The music is for dark anime, suitable for anime like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I would listen to the music again one day, because they are very well played. My second favorite song from this anime is the ending song. It is actually so epic that they sometimes use it in battle scenes. The ending VIDEO isn't very epic though. It only shows Madoka walking past everyone. I kind of wish they made it more interesting. However, the opening is a different story. The opening is called ''Connect,'' by ClariS. It basically shows WHAT the anime would be like if it wasn't dark. It's the biggest lie ever. So I'm not very fond of the opening, but it is still enjoyable. \nThe characters have special traits or their own, making them unique and different. They react to situations and events in a realistic way. The supporting cast was useful in the anime, but there were so little that I thought there weren't a supporting cast at all. I think there were too little people in the supporting cast. But still, I would remember these characters in the future because they have a special meaning for me. My favorite character is probably Kyouko. She is very headstrong, and she matches my personality. I believe the staff wanted us to like Kyouko on purpose because they want us to have a little surprise after some episodes. \nThe characters do not grow in age throughout the series- they grow in a special way, like how a character became wise. This usually happens in dark anime. \nOther than all of that, people will like this anime because it is filled with excitement. Even non-anime fans would like this work because this anime has a special meaning for everyone- and the meanings are all different. I would re-watch this work in the future. This would still make me excited even if I know what will happen. I think re-watching would add to my enjoyment of this series becuase I would understand things I didn't understand when I first watched this. This masterpiece is so enjoyable that you would remember it for years.\nI would recommend this to people who like dark anime. Do NOT judge this by the picture. This anime is not for kids-it's for matured teenagers. It's even rated R. It is darker than you can imagine. Even if it sounds girly, this anime is superb. \n\n\n\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka Magica was by far the most interesting anime I have seen. The story starts very lighthearted and girlish, but quickly turns into dark horror. The story was very thought out and planned. The music soundtrack was amazing. The character personalities were introduced thoroughly. The anime was hard to stop watching. (I watched it start to finish at 2:00 in the morning). Madoka Magica was a masterpiece. However, I did find one thing that I didn't like. The faces were too flat for my liking. After about 5 episodes, I forgot and stopped caring, but the flatness of the faces almost stopped me from watching\n          \n        this in general. Most other anime reviews about Madoka Magica state that one must watch this until episode three. Episode three was a huge plot twist, but in my opinion, you can't drop the anime until episode 8. If by then you don't like it, then fine, but for me episode 8 was the big one. Most people are thrown off by episode 4, because most of it is just girls crying, but if you can make it through that episode, then the rest will be very good.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    (Some Spoilers)\nGoing into Madoka Magica, all I'd heard about it was \"you don't know what you're getting yourself into\". To me, this is one of the biggest problems with the show; It relies on being compared with other shows in it's genre, rather than it's own qualities as an independent anime. It's not great, it's just better. But if you were to remove the prejudice and expectations that comes with being a \"magical girls anime\", and simply judge it on it's own merits, it's nothing special. \nIn other words, Madoka Magica falls victim of the \"cheerleader effect\", a cognitive bias where individuals appear more attractive\n          \n        in a group than on their own. For instance, the show gets pretty dark after a couple of episodes. But because of how not-dark these types of shows usually are, it feels even darker, simply because the audience didn't expect it. But is it really that dark? Sure, some characters die, but that's not very uncommon in anime.\nAnd why should I even care if some of the characters die anyway? it's not like the show ever gave me a reason to. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional, and the little development that actually occurs is almost exclusevly handled in exposition scenes. \nThe story itself is pretty avarage and boring. It feels like 6 episodes would have been enough. Because except for the beggining and the ending, all that ever really happens in the show is the girls fighting between themselves, moping about how bad life is, and being busy trying not to move the plot forward. \nNow, I'm not saying that Madoka Magica is bad by any means. It's just not as good as it would like to think it is. It wants us to see it as the masterpiece it could've been, instead of the one it failed to be. It's the equivalent of a bad artist presenting his work by saying: \"trust me, the painting was beautiful in my head\". \n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Before this show was aired, anime enthusiasts were looking forward to cute character designs, pretty visuals, and charming stories of friendship. Weeks later, the same people were indeed enjoying those — while decoding encrypted text, citing 19th century German literature, brushing up on physics, and debating about ethics. \nMahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica has certainly been the center of much attention. Despite the efforts of the creators to tone down certain elements in their promotional videos, the anime has suffered from levels of hype and backlash unseen since Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Haruhi series. The presence of notable names in the list of collaborators suggests that\n          \n        the show could be mind-blowing at best, or worth seeing at the very least. Regardless of these (or perhaps, because of these), there are two things to keep in mind when watching the show: Don't judge a book by its cover, and read between the lines.\n---\nThe story begins with our protagonist Madoka and her friends living ordinary carefree lives until Kyubey, the obligatory cute mascot, appears. He calls upon them to become magical girls and fight the menace of the witches; in exchange, Kyuubey offers the girls the chance to have any single wish granted. Thus the life of a magical girl begins with a decision, and this leads to consequences both intended and unforeseen. Once the perils of the vocation are revealed, it becomes apparent that, as with any position of power, there's much more to magical girls than being selfless, righteous, and idealistic.\nWhile the premise seems fairly standard enough, it doesn't stay that way for long. Not in the hands of writer Urobuchi Gen. This anime takes the magical girl genre and infuses it with elements more reminiscent of Silent Hill 2 rather than Sailor Moon. The result is an unorthodox mix which induces cognitive dissonance. \nHowever, Madoka☆Magica goes a step beyond simply contrasting ideas. More than just combining disparate details for the purpose of shocking the audience, Urobuchi Gen weaves these elements together to create a bigger picture. The plot itself is excellent, though not as revolutionary as hardcore fans would claim it to be. Even so, few anime titles out there could match this series in terms of thematic development, and it's a pity that only a handful express appreciation for this particular highlight. Some viewers may nitpick about factors such as technical details and suspension of disbelief, but given that the story prioritizes purpose over plausibility, I find most of the criticisms of these aspects to be blown out of proportion. \nThat is not to say that the story is without shortcomings. Having the series limited to a mere 12 episodes is simultaneously a boon and a bane. On one hand, it forces the creators to use a compact and focused style of storytelling which leaves no room for insignificant details. This accentuates the suspense of the plot and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. On the other hand, developments feel rushed on more than one occasion. Despite the good use of foreboding for most of the show, some twists still come suddenly with no warning whatsoever. Character development may have also suffered as the limited time made it difficult to flesh out the cast completely.\n---\nIn contrast to the previous points, opinions seem to be less divided with regards to aesthetics. This comes as no surprise since the merits of the audio and visuals are much more evident.\nThose familiar with Kajiura Yuki's previous works may set their expectations high as the music of this series does not disappoint. Similar to the soundtrack of Kara no Kyoukai, the pieces in Madoka☆Magica range from light and pleasant to haunting and dramatic. The ending theme in particular (Magia) is song that packs a lot of impact by featuring a mesmerizing tune and lyrics which are actually relevant to the story. \nOn the side of animation, director Shinbou Akiyuki brings in SHAFT's distinct art style puts it to good use. Although attentive viewers could easily spot signs of budget/time constraints at several instances, I find these shortcomings forgivable given how well the visuals were utilized for most of the show. Besides presenting eye-candy, the images play a significant role in presenting ideas. Appreciating the numerous details may require a bit of effort on the part of the viewers, but it does make the experience much more interactive and rewarding.\nAs for the characters, Aoki Ume's designs lie a bit on the cartoonish side. They're easy on the eyes and they have the unexpected benefit of having virtually no fanservice potential (except perhaps for the well-endowed Mami). However, these designs offer little advantage for later dramatic scenes after the dissonance has worn off. \nFortunately the voice acting makes up for this, and Madoka☆Magica has some of the most moving performances I've heard in years. Special mention goes to Yuuki Aoi for giving life to the main character in her moments of distress.\n---\nTo sum it all up: This anime is by no means perfect, but I find its flaws heavily outweighed by its more outstanding aspects. Hype or no hype, Mahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica is a show worth paying attention to — if you're willing to pay attention.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="                          \n    *This is an in-depth review with spoilers.\nA rare original (non-adaptation) anime series by SHAFT, 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka☆Magica' began like any other Mahou Shoujo series, and while it's not ground-breakingly original in any way, it's anything but ordinary.\nStory / Character:\nThe story is a very well thought-out three-act structure. Beginning with a standard exposition(ep1-2) of an action teaser to draw viewer's attention, and introduction of all the main characters before the protagonist learns the existence and power of Mahou Shoujo, and their unseen threat in ordinary life. Followed by conflict and rising action(ep3-9), where people around Madoka become involved in the underground war between Mahou Shoujo and\n          \n        witches. Finally, the climax(ep10-11) and resolution(ep12) as Akemi's identity is revealed and Madoka finally gets her abilities, before the aftermath in the final episode. Although the story starts out very slowly, it slowly draws you in. The perfect example of this is the very first sequence with Akemi losing badly against Walpurgis Night before Madoka asks to sacrifice her soul to save her friend. I for one knew this sequence was a classic 「夢オチ」(\"dream punch line\"), because my first impression was: \"There's no way SHAFT would make something so corny\". However, the IDENTICAL sequence was shown in the climax ep10, and this time it was overwhelmingly dramatic and touching. This must be the exact reaction the producers were looking for, a solid proof of the engrossing nature of the story.\nIt's difficult to say whether this series is predictable or not. Like the opening sequence, there are many clichés. On the other hand, there are some elements of this show that comes as a total surprise or distinctly different from your average Mahou Shoujo. For one, characters died in rapid succession, and none of the characters really came back to life (not in the primary timeline). Personally, I thought Mami was perhaps the mastermind behind it, and faked her death somehow to get others to sign the contract. Also, we're all accustomed to the miraculous rescues and close calls that save protagonist's allies from death. This does not happen here. It really turns out to be a desperate war to the last man (or should I say, girl) standing. The transformation sequence also occurs only once per person. Yes, no scene recycling, and no attempted ecchi either. Then of course, there's the time loop.\nThe \"conflict\" section of the show was an extremely difficult watch. The problem was not the pacing, but the fact that it crosses the suspension of disbelief despite its serious tone. It really forces the audience to accept excessive plot holes and irrational character behaviors. However, the time loop had completely turned the tables.\nEp10, titled 'I Will Never Depend on Anyone Again', was so much of a 「神回」 (\"epic episode\") that I feel the episode needs an entire paragraph of its own. Being a time-loop episode, it does make many references to the past episodes. Like when Akemi and Madoka meet for the very first time in ep10, Madoka turns around in hallway to say \"Homura\" is a wonderful name. If you remember, there was a similar event in the first episode, which even had the same turning shoe-shot then two-shot scene from the side. That shoe-shot was deliberately planted in the first episode to assist the emphasis of alternate reality in ep10. The same conversation came up in the \"main timeline\" (ep1), and Akemi and Madoka's positions have physically and psychologically reversed, with Akemi being the confident one, and even her reaction to the compliment is opposite.\nEverything else about the \"first timeline\" was polar opposite of the \"main timeline\" we have been following up to ep10. From there on, she repeats the same events over and over to try to change destiny, much like 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Kai'. What makes this episode exceptional is the non-stop emotionally draining sequences of drama and action, with every single scene carefully chosen to depict Akemi's changing personality, without repeating too many same events even though she goes through 4 time loops in a single episode. It still amaze me how they were able to pack so much material in 25 minutes. Akemi fails every single time, but her personality gradually changes from an insecure and frail girl to cool-headed and powerful fighter. At the same time, the despair, anger, mistrust, and finally a sense of futility growing within her. Yet, the bond between Akemi and Madoka have only strengthened, single-sidedly.\nThe episode completely throws you off in the beginning, but explains most of the major mysteries in the past episodes:\n* Akemi's ability to instantly kill enemies\n* How she knew Madoka's name, and that Walpurgis Night was coming\n* Why she doesn't team up with others\n* Why she didn't just kill Kyuubey after Mami died, to prevent its contact with Madoka and Sayaka\nHowever, there are still many unexplained irrational character behavior that made it hard to appreciate the first half:\n* Why didn't Madoka just wish for all witches to disappear in the beginning? - She wanted people to stop fighting, that would've been an obvious wish that could've proven Kyuubey's \"I can grant you any wish\" to be false (or so he would think).\n* Why did Mami act like an evil mastermind in the beginning? - Deliberate misleading or not, the way she acted was strange unless she was the villain who was behind all (which she was not).\n* Why didn't Akemi tell Madoka to her face what she's getting herself into? - If they didn't believe in time travel, telling everyone of the truth about Mahou Shoujo would have done the trick. She can even prove it by taking someone's crystal out of range.\n* Why suspect other Mahou Shoujo? - If Akemi and Kyouko were indeed selfish, wouldn't they just ignore witches instead of fighting just to get magic replenishment? Sayaka's sudden distrust makes no sense.\n* What is the problem with leaving the territory for those who are interested in Grief Seeds? - At the time, they were not aware of Familiars or that they can turn into witches. Why were they so eager to stop Mahou Shoujo who were solely interested in Grief Seeds?\n* Why didn't Sayaka wish Kyousuke's injury to be completely cured? - It's just strange to cure only his hands instead of entire body.\n* If Kyuubey's race has no emotion, why does it speak with emotion? - ???\nWish granting and time loops are tricky business, but ultimately, the scriptwriting was sloppy, and character development of side characters were rushed through (especially that of Sayaka, whose sudden change in personality was not convincing, nor that of Kyouko's). It was interesting though, that the story was driven by the side characters, and the \"protagonist\" Madoka was just trying to make sense of everything happening around her.\nThe ending (resolution) was a typical \"protagonist surpasses the law of the universe\". We've all seen it before, even in the same season with 'Yumekui Merry'. While this was very well executed with an afterthought of Madoka, it was overly predictable and corny. This might sound stupid, but I was actually hoping for an open ending for this series. Maybe she fights Walpurgis Night alone, fails, and goes back to the beginning again, only with more hope from maybe a word of encouragement from Madoka. Still, the actual ending was rather conclusive, and a fitting ending for the show.\nArt:\nBackground art is incredible. The outdoor scenes are visually reminiscent of 'ef' series in that the skies look like they have gone through a hundred gradient and gloss filters and everything is pretty and shiny. Visually pleasing, but nothing out of the ordinary. The \"Alternate Space Design\" or the \"boundary world\" of witches by animation team 'Gekidan Inu Curry', on the other hand, were absolutely phenomenal. The collage effect is somewhat similar to that of 'Mononoke', but far more detailed with better textures. The heroines enter the alternate space almost every single episode, and the scenery of the \"boundary world\" is different depending on the witch's despair. Scene transitions are often seamless with various special effects, the best one was perhaps ep10 witch that attacked Akemi, which began from pain and suffering as depicted in Picasso's 'Guernica' to the bloody eternal darkness version of Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night'. There's something about the surreality of the collages that instills fear into the audience.\nUnfortunately, the characters were drawn in 'Hidamari Sketch' style that did not match the theme nor the backgrounds. I suspect this style was chosen for the additional shock value of cute and innocent looking girls causing and falling victim to violent destruction, but it was totally not worth the incongruity it caused in most scenes.\nThe art direction (camera angle, the way scenes are presented) were entertaining in the usual SHAFT fashion that contributes to seemingly accelerated pace.\nSound:\nOP 'Connect' by ClariS is exceedingly bland for a theme song. Was 'Irony' in 'OreImo' a fluke? The ED 'Magia', however, is a wonderful dark despair song that also works very well as battle insert song.\nBGM is almost equally wonderful, with most pieces seem to be dominated by string and percussion instruments, successfully conveying the mysterious and scary atmosphere of \"boundary worlds.\" Sound for special effects also sounded very real, and dynamic enough as buildup for the battle scenes.\nVoice Acting for Madoka was overly strained, and her mother sounded way too cool for the appearance, but otherwise wonderful.\nEnjoyment / Overall:\nThere were some serious convenient story writing in the first half, but the masterpiece that is ep10 'I Will Never Depend on Anyone Again' and the following climax episode 'The Last Remaining Path' has saved the series from disaster, though not enough to completely remove the bitter aftertaste of earlier episodes. My favorite moment in this series is when Madoka says \"I will never forget you saved me\" in ep4. In afterthought (after watching ep10), it must have been excruciating for Akemi that her effort to save Madoka has been forgotten many times already, and the pain of listening to her say that she will never forget. Her bitter reaction finally makes sense. 'Madoka Magica' may have been more sloppy than their usual adaptations, but it's subtle scenes like this, and the previously mentioned hallway scene, that makes SHAFT one of the best anime studios around, because of the way they deliver the truly important scenes in ways that you will never forget.\nI am certain the second viewing of this series will be far more enjoyable, as more of those subtle scenes start to make sense.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=22,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka is hands-down the best anime series of 2011 thus far, and a contender for the best anime series of all-time. How could an original, non-adaptation magical girl show of all shows end up rousing the anime community in such a fashion?\nWhat starts out as a regular, pastel-colored magical girl show quickly turns on its head as the magical girls come to realize that they're in a zero-sum situation: the stakes are real, and for every bit of hope given in the world, an equal amount of despair must be displaced. The first three episodes have a sense of normalcy to them, but it is\n          \n        this calm before the storm that sets the stage for the chaos which resides through the rest of the series.\nAs each revelation is presented, the viewer is left with some thought-provoking questions. Is the antagonist truly evil, or just looking out for the needs of the many? Is Madoka, the lead character, selfish in delaying her decision to be a magical girl? And what about the true intentions of the other magical girls? The answers to those and more are carefully presented at the right times, never too fast or too slow. However, the more the viewer learns, the more the viewer realizes that there's still much to be realized. Nothing is ever certain, and the viewer is kept on edge the entire way. It is not until the final two episodes that all the pieces connect in a harmonious manner.\nPresentation of the series is spot-on. The imagery of each of the witches' labyrinths is unique and firmly brings each combat scene into one of terror rather than one of indifference or skepticism. The rough, imperfect drawings of the characters' expressions only serve to remind the viewer that none of them are the ideal, righteous heroes that they thought they would be. As for the orchestral soundtrack, it blends in so well that you almost don't notice it's even there. Only the ending theme played at certain combat scenes steals the spotlight.\nThe hype leading up to these final two episodes (that were aired together) was unprecedented, the likes of which had never been seen before. Full-page ads for just the final airing were printed in major Japanese newspapers. Multiple volumes of the blu-ray release were sitting at the top of Amazon JP's preorder list. Some shrewd people were even streaming live feeds of the final episodes over the internet. Everyone and their dog had an opinion on the show in the blogosphere, and a wiki site was created for the series. There were passionate discussions of a wide variety, such as the basis of entropy, the emotional breakdowns of the characters, the parallels with previous historical works such as Faust, and of course, the merits of specific scenes in the ending. Madoka took the pure, proud obsession of anime fans and gathered them together for one main event.\nSo is Madoka truly the greatest anime series of all-time? There can never be a concrete answer to that given the unique tastes of each individual. Indeed, there will always be people who will claim any sort of personal issue or technicality to prevent giving this a 10. However, it does what almost no show does: transcend its genre while maintaining homage to what it surpassed, requiring little prior knowledge of the anime medium as a whole. If there was to be any half-season series that you could show a friend who wasn't into anime at all, this would be the one. All that hype was definitely real. Thankfully, you can now marathon the whole series in one sitting instead of becoming crazy while waiting for the next episode, as many people were.\n        "},

As long as you remember that, you are not alone.\" \nMadoka Magica is a masterpiece of an anime that I can't believe I didn't come across earlier. In fact, if it weren't for my favourite reviewer raving about how great it is, I would have passed it up if I had just seen the poster and description of the show, because the show is SO MUCH more than an anime from the magic girl genre. This review will contain slight spoilers (not revealing any plot details that's for sure but if you've yet to complete the\n          \n        show I suggest you to just watch it blindly without any hints because it'll ruin the enjoyment). \nTo start off, the poster, opening, as well as the first few scenes of the anime is deceiving to say the least, and if you didn't know better you would have assumed that this was a colourful fun show about magical girls saving the world from danger! Wrong wrong wrong. This show takes the fundamental concept that exists in our realistic society, \"nothing is free in this world\", and from there this beautiful story is blossomed. I have to say that the constant reiteration of for every \"hope\" there needs to be an equal \"despair\" in order to maintain the equilibrium was done so splendidly. It wasn't the in-your-face way of portraying, through boring exposition or repetition by the same character. Well yes kyubey, the familiar constantly reminds us of that, but that always happens after we are SHOWN how this idea works through different happenings along the show. And at first we don't think much about it, the girls in the show brush it off and so do we as the audience because this isn't a new concept, its something that is so familiar to us and yet taken for granted. But gradually, as the hopes and wishes grow, so does the accumulation of despair and sadness. Not to mention this story is EXTREMELY original and unpredictable, it keeps you confused and speculating what's going to happen next, and while you hold on to the hope of something happening, it never really does, yet you're surprised by how they're able to twist the story here and there, without being too far-fetched or deus ex machina-ish. Everything is well thought out, well planned, and the flow of the story is amazing. \nMoving on, to the different characters. (WHY ISN'T KYOKO IN THE POSTER T_T) Every character seems to fall under some sort of troupe at first, but as the story slowly flows, you realise how mistaken you are about them and how different they turn out to be. And I absolutely love their character development. Within the short span of 12 episodes they manage to bring out the dynamics of the 5 main characters, they past, their stories, their emotions, their flaws, their strengths, their regrets, everything. And the best part is that you think you know the main character, but you don't at all. The transition is extremely smooth without inconsistencies and abrupt shifts and their actions are justified throughout the series. You FEEL for the characters, you feel their pain, you understand why they did certain things, but at the same time being the on looker you question why they're so foolish, so selfish, why they can't see the picture. And at the end of the day you do understand why, and that is because they're human. And to err is human. \nNow the animation is really interesting. The witches' realm is shown through a different stlye all together, a rather creepy and eerie one if you ask me and I think its just perfect. The action scenes aren't that many but they're smooth and detailed enough. The music of the show added on to the greatness of this. With a mix of emotional to outright chills inflicting songs, it really sets the mood of the scenes and brings out the best in it. I'm listening to the ost as I'm writing the review because it is that good. Also, THE OPENING <3 Please please pay attention to the lyrics of the song, there is a huge spoiler embedded within it and when I first realised I was so WOWED. It made me love the opening even more. \nIn a nutshell, Madoka Magica is one of those shows that lights a spark within you, keeps you thinking even completion and despite it being a fantasy, how it parallels reality is freaky as it is. But please have mental preparation that this show is pretty dark and impactful, it will leave a mark on you. It's a beautiful show about friendship, sacrifices, miracles, despair and hope. I give it my utmost recommendation.  \n        "},

I am a grown ass man. But see, I still need my guilty pleasures in life, one of those being magical girls. What can I say? The dresses and poses are way too cute, and usually magical girl shows include adorable pet sidekicks as well. I love it all, it makes my kokoro go dokidoki.\nMadoka Magica is a pristine example of a feel good magical girls show! For one thing, the girls are just absolutely moe up the ass. Also, Madoka Magica sports some of the\n          \n        most beautiful and cute transformations, into some of the prettiest dresses I’ve ever seen! I know its main demographic is for young girls, but I can’t help myself! Madoka Magica is way too cute for me to resist!\nOr so you want me to say. Nah man, Madoka Magica is anything but cute. If anything, it’s dank. Really dank. And manly!\nI was one of the lucky few who got absolutely trolled the fuck out by this show. It was a beautiful Sunday, and I had just finished watching Angel Beats, meaning I was dying under my tear soaked blankets. I was frantically searching the Internet for a good show to cheer my poor ass up, until I found artwork for Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I decided to toss away my manliness and believed that cute girls doing cute things was what I needed to climb out of this massive hole. Needless to say, I got rekt harder than TSM at Worlds.\nAnd now, after finally rewatching Madoka Magica, my manly tears won't stop. Someone, call the ambulance!\nPros:\n- Great for all ages, perfect show for the family to enjoy.\n- Very strong and respectable role models.\n- Probably the most artistic and creative art style in any anime.\n- Arguably the best soundtrack in anime!\n- Masterful execution of incredibly powerful themes! So many quotable quotes in this show.\n- Manliest show ever made.\nCons:\n- As with all shows that use time as a theme, plot holes m8.\n- Believe it or not, Madoka Magica isn't the first to do what it did! GASPS!\nStory: 10\nI believe I called it dank, and I still hold true to that statement. As stated before, I was effectively trolled by the first couple of episodes. I mean, I could tell that the show wasn't ALL rainbows and butterflies, since witch labyrinths are literally drugs, but I still thought it was going to be a relatively lighthearted adventure. And then...\nMadoka Magica may be the most dark and twisted tale. Well, not exactly THE darkest, but its complete 180 twist from the apparently lighthearted nature in the beginning gave the dark moments a lot of contrast. This huge twist in the beginning is what I believe made Madoka Magica's fucked up story extremely powerful.\nMagical Girls are usually symbols of hope, friendship, cute dresses, cute sidekicks, and girly fun adventures full of wishes and dreams. Madoka Magica completely turns these ideas on its head. I believe you call this a de-construction or something like that.\nNormally it would be like \"Oh, wishes and dreams can defeat evil, and friendship can win against all odds!\" Madoka Magica says \"Filthy casual, that's what Shounen-tards say! Evil actually spawns from within, and all wishes, no matter how selfless, have selfish and evil intentions within them.\" \nLaw of Equivalent exchange is a thing here. If you wish in loads of hope and good, and equal amount of evil will come to balance it out. Wishes never go as smoothly as you think they will. Selflessness is always tailed by selfishness. Good always brings in evil. Whenever there is the best, there will always be the worst. Life isn't fair, ya nerds!\nArt: 10\nI've never taken drugs in my life, and after watching Madoka Magica, I don't need to, even if I'm curious! I'll just simply search up one of the witch fights on YouTube, and voila! I know what drugs are like.\nMadoka Magica's artwork is absolutely amazing! There is a lot of symbolism, metaphors, all that artistic stuff. It's full of dark imagery, amazing animation, headtilts, quirky yet lovable character designs, headtilts, brilliant depictions of insanity, and headtilts. Madoka Magica truly supports its eerie and messed up atmosphere with its artstyle.\nSound: 10\nTroll opening OP! It's super fun, lighthearted, and was one of the reasons why I believed the show was going to be a funny and adorable journey! Ey, we even got the troll ED during the first 2 episodes! Wow, this show is really fun!\nAnd then, the ED from episode 3 onwards. GG! That song is one of the most creepy and manly songs I've ever heard.\nBut of course, it's all about the OST and sound effects. Madoka Magica's OST is just breathtakingly beautiful and well written. As a composer myself, I'm hitting myself over the head due to how amateurish my own pieces feel compared to Madoka Magica's soundtrack.\nThe sound effects, like the artstyle, always seem to fit the mood of a scene incredibly well. During the witch fights, the sound effects, whether it be jingling or laughing, creeps me the hell out man! The voice acting was also borderline perfect! The seiyuus did such an amazing job voicing the emotions of their characters, it really made the show that much more engaging and impactful.\nCharacter: 10\nThe magical girls of Madoka Magica are all incredibly unique from each other, and they were all incredibly lovable (except Sayaka, but even she redeemed herself in more ways than one).\nHomiera: Homiera did nothing wrong! She's just doing something that's right, not good. Homiera is an absolute bro! She's willing to go to such lengths for one person. She's the definition of a saint. Homiera is definitely someone I would want as my Homie.\nMadopeka: Madopeka is pretty dope. She is such a damn pacifist that even Ghandi would be proud of her. She cries so much, like actually though. How is she not dehydrated yet?? She represents hope, and as you can tell, hope isn't always happy. In this case, hope is always crying. Even Saki Watanabe held it in at times, but Madopeka lets the waterfall continue falling.\nSayucka: Sayucka was a bit yucky at first, but she's still a good character. At first, she seemed like one of those lesbian friends, but, SPOILERS, she isn't lesbo!!! Not only is she Sassyaka, since she's so sassy, but she also cares way too much about everything. I guess you can call her the PMS Master. Either way, Sayucka is the one who teaches us that there are always selfish intentions under selfless deeds. There is a huge difference between wanting to save someone and wanting to be someone's savior. Just because you're correct, doesn't mean you're right. Shirou, good job.\nMommy: Mommy! Mommy is the reliable senpai who... ends up not being so reliable. She is the one who represents what an actual magical girl should be like! She is selfless for selfless reasons, but due to her righteous ways, she's incredibly lonely. See, no matter how righteous one is, one can't avoid bad things to happen to them.\nKyouko Littner: I think this pun is a stretch, since the only thing the two have in common is hair color, but this'll do. Kyouko Littner is the opposite of Mommy! While Mommy is selfless and is the representation of what all good mahou shoujos should be, Kyouko Littner is the representation of what mahou shoujos are like in the world of Madoka Magica. In this world, acting righteous only gets you killed. Kyouko Littner is selfish, with her main goal being survival. She really highlights just how unfair and twisted the world of Madoka Magica really is.\nKyubae: Kyubae is bae! Just kidding, he's Satan incarnate, and I think most people will agree with that. Kyubae is the definition of READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS! Although, he takes this even further by not even giving you the entire terms and conditions. Believe it or not, Kyubae isn't evil! He's just an asshole, but he doesn't even know what being an asshole means. In fact, when you think about it, Kyubae is really just thinking long term, and his actions are technically the most righteous of the bunch. He's the embodiment of what it's like to truly be selfless, but as you can see, being 100% selfless isn't exactly viewed as a good thing in this show, isn't it?\nEnjoyment: 10\nDuring my first viewing, Madoka Magica definitely made me shed a tear. The twist completely got to me, and I was sitting there in awe, especially since I just wanted something to get over Angel Beats.\nAnd finally, during my rewatch, I cried rivers upon rivers of tears. This show is definitely something you should watch twice, with different perspectives, in order to get the full experience.\nOverall: 10\nCall me over pretentious all you want for liking Madoka Magica so much, but I really think that it's a masterpiece of an anime! In fact, I love it so much, I think I'll watch it with my entire family! After all, my little kid sister would totally love something as happy and rainbow colored as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica!\nTL;DR: Cute girls doing cute things has never been this manly.\n\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    One in a while one would stumble upon a surprisingly subversive and interesting series that defies its roots. As such is the case of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. What makes this series interesting is it offers a unique deconstructive take on the magical girl genre.\nWhile the core concept of the show's story has been done before (grim, depressing magical girl show) the story still manages to leave its own mark by copying distinct elements and criticizing said elements by showing the realistic grim consequences. This type of genre deconstruction shows that the makers are very familiar with the conventions and how to subvert them. Granted\n          \n        there are some moments that could've been sped up a bit and the final moments seem confusing in a Gainax-esque manner. Fortunately, everything is held together by the reoccurring themes of selflessness and faustian motifs. These elements help prevent the story from buckling in on itself even with the occasionally uneven scenes and mind-bendingly surreal moments.\nThe characters themselves are all well-written and likable. What really makes the characters work surprisingly well is how some of the narrative offers deconstructive takes on their archetypical traits. For example, Homura is considered what TV Tropes describes as a \"Satellite Character\" whose life revolves only around one character, in her case Madoka. However, Homura's archetype is deconstructed as her clingly protective nature of Madoka shows how empty her life was before and how her obsession has worn her out at times. Interestingly Madoka herself is treated as helpless bystander yet she has her own engaging self-contained character arc of trying to find purpose. Overall these characters work because of how the story fleshes them out using basic character archetype traits. Plus everyone sound legitimately shocked at deaths thanks to the fact that the voice actors were deliberately mislead.\nWhile the art is obviously fantastic (this is a Studio Shaft work afterall), what really makes the animation style work is how it intelligently it mixes different styles and images. The girls are drawn in a soft pastel moe while the the witches resemble dark cutouts and the disaster scenes are drawn in dark watercolors straight out of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei. These mixed art styles provide a nice sense of contrast such that there is an eerie otherworldliness. Furthermore, the art direction helps with storytelling given the design of the witches. Each witch is a represent a despair-infused personification of feminine interest, thus giving insights into their origins and relationship to the characters. As such, fighting the witches would be like confronting their inner demons.\nOverall, I would highly recommend Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Its narrative offers a unique deconstructive take on the Magical Girl genre and characters. It's an engaging experiencing of examining despair and the cruelty of world that leaves viewer cathartically relieved in the end. On a final note, I know a lot of people are unhappy with the ending and I get that. However, I'm also fine with it because it honors the recurring themes: everything has a price and true heroism means willing to give up one's happiness.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="                          \n    The fact that so many people still name Puella Magi Madoka Magica “the greatest or most significant or most influential\" mahou shoujo series of all time only tells you how anime still is from becoming a serious art. Classic critics have long recognized that the greatest mahou shoujou series of all times are Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Other critics rank the highly controversial Princess Tutu over classic anime who were highly popular in courts around Japan. This new wave of anime fans\n          \n        are still blinded by commercial success: Puella Magi Madoka Magica sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. True anime critics grow up watching a lot of mahou shoujo of the past. Madoka Magica fans are often totally ignorant of the mahou shoujo of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Puella Magi Madoka Magi did anything worth of being saved.\nIn a sense Puella Magi Madoka Magica is emblematic of the status of modern anime criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena and too little attention to the merits of real anime. If somebody composes the most divine mahou shoujo seires but Crunchyroll refuses to hype it up and stream it around the world, a lot of bloggers will ignore it. If every teenager on MAL hypes up a mahou shoujo series which is as stereotyped as one can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said series. This is the sad status of modern anime criticism.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica sells not because it's the greatest mahou shoujo series of all time but simply because it is easy to sell to the masses: it has no difficult content, it has no technical innovations, it has no creative depth. Gen Urobuchi just wrote flat characters and obnoxious plot twists to catch attention of the masses. If somebody had not invented \"Madoka Mania\" in 2011, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial anime.\n        "},

Too bad not many are able to succeed in overtaking both Evangelion and Utena. The closest i can think of is Now, Here, Then & There which deconstructs the \"another world\" genre but it still failed to make an impact to the industry & fandom like what Eva & Utena did.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica might not be the next Evangelion & Utena, but it certainly creates the same impact to the industry in the same\n          \n        way that Evangelion & utena did. With great critical reception and high sales in DVDs and Blu-Rays, Madoka Magica exceeded it's expectations as a deconstruction of the Mahou Shoujo genre.\nThe story is about a middle schooler named Kaname Madoka who is torn between two choices: to either be a Mahou Shoujo in order to prevent an apocalyptic event called Walpurgisnacht or to not be a Mahou Shoujo in order to save herself from the impending despair befalling her. \nIn the midst of these two choices are two people who wants her to decide: Kyubey, a cat-thingy who wants her to be a Mahou Shoujo and Akemi Homura, a Mahou Shoujo who doesn't want her to be a Mahou Shoujo.\nNow, the story starts off basically as that, but as it progresses it becomes more of a Faustian retelling than a simple Mahou Shoujo story. As the anime goes on, her friends and family members became torn as she sees her friends die, her colleagues becoming witches and the suffering Madoka endured. We get to see the true nature of Kyubey, and why Homura does not want Madoka to be a Mahou Shoujo. It's gets sadder, and in the end you can feel the sadness going into your heart.\nThe thing that sets Madoka Magica apart from other Mahou Shoujo anime is that not only it's a deconstruction, it's also a more Evangelion-esque take on the genre. This is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo who's known for directing not only SHAFT's greatest works, but also anime masterpieces like Nanoha and La Petite Cosette, so you get alot of influences from Nanoha, Cosette and other SHAFT works in this. It's also written by Nitroplus's gen Urobuchi, known for writing mangas like Saya no Ueta and Fate/Zero along with Nitoplus's games like Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. So unlike Utena, Tutu and other Mahou Shoujo deconstructions, Madoka Magica makes itself way more darker ala Narutaru or Bokurano. Urobuchi was a fan of Mohiro Kitoh, and thus you can see some influences from Kitoh's works in this.\nThe art and animation is pretty good. Now, SHAFT is also known for being experimental so they also include lots of stop-motion and retro-European animation style. But due to this, you can see QUALITY animation which became the product of 4chan memes. Still, it's nice to look at and it doesn't have \"stop text\" like Shinbo's other anime works.\nThe characters start off generic like other Mahou Shoujos, but as the story progresses they become much more interesting. Especially Akemi Homura, where later in the series you get the suffering she endures just to prevent Madoka from being a Mahou Shoujo. Her story is just heartbreaking. Madoka's friend Miki Sayaka also has a good side story, seeing her becoming a Mahou Shoujo because of a promise and getting broken after that. it's mean and sad at the same time. \nSpeaking of characters, the seiyuus in this are really good. Yuuki Aoi does a good job as Kaname Madoka, whereas SHAFT queen Chiwa Saito is amazing as Akemi Homura. Eri Kitamura does a great job as Miki Sayaka and Kaori Mizuhashi is also good as Mami Tomoe, a blonde but more refined version of her character from Hidamari Sketch. Nonaka Ai (Another SHAFT seiyuu) also does a great job as Kyouko Sakura. But one surprising casting is none other than Emiri Katou as Kyubey. Yes, it's Kagami from Lucky Star doing a role that is definitely different from her Lucky Star days. Holy damn i was surprised and disturbed at how good she is as Kyubey. I'm surprised.\nThe sound is great. Yuji kajiura's wonderful music creates this magical atmosphere that is present throughout this series. The OP is wonderful, i love listening to the OP. It's beautiful but as the series progressed, you actually feel sadder listening to it. It's one of the saddest OPs i've listened to in a while. But i don't like the ED. It felt more like a rip-off of a System of a Down song. Seriously, Kalafina's singer sounds like a Japanese high school girl trying to sing like Serj Tankian. I'ms erious. I don't get why people actually like the ED. But in the end, it didn't affect my enjoyment of Yuki Kajiura's music as a whole, so therefore with the exception of the ED, the music and sound of this is amazing.\nOh and if you really want to enjoy watching this, do not judge this series from its first episode. Watch until episode 3, and after that you will get to know this series better. \nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a well made anime that does the same impact as EVa or Utena. Whereas Utena deconstructs the Sailor Moon style of Mahou Shoujo, this series deconstructs the Nanoha side of Mahou Shoujo, and in the end it's great. It gets into your heart and you'll love it in the end.\n        "},

But after a while the show evolved into something much more than that, with religious symbolism and themes and constructs with deep meaning. A true controversial masterpiece.\nFast forward 15 years into the future and comes along a show named Madoka Magica, from the trailers that animation studio Shaft released, they made it out to be a cute magical girl anime. Seem familiar? But after\n          \n        the first few episodes it became clear how much darker and how much more substance it had than its predecessors. Seem familiar? And grew into something that had massively deep themes and symbolism that many consider a masterpiece. Seem familiar? And grew into something that had the whole anime community in it's controversy. Seem familiar?!?\nBut the question is, is Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica a masterpiece?\nWell read on to find out.\n[WARNING LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]\nStory: 9\nThe premise of Madoka Magica is not that different from your average magical girl show at first glance, some people passed it off as \"Moe bullshit\" and just didn't give it a chance at first. But for the people who looked deeper into the show before it aired, they noticed that it was written by Gen Urobuchi, who's past works involved Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom which people found really odd considering the trailers and what people were expecting of Madoka.\nIt was only in the first few minutes that we had a glimpse of what we're actually getting into, but then it snaps back into the Slice of Life show with a magical girl theme that we were expecting. For a while at least.\n The main protagonist, Kaname Madoka was going on with her ordinary life, waking up in the morning, eating breakfast, brushing her teeth, until she gets to school one day, when her class is told that there is a new transfer student, Akemi Homura. Who comes off as the cold but beautiful Ice Queen at first, but then she asks Madoka later that day, \"Do you hold your family and friends dear to you?\"\nIt is later revealed that episode that a creature named Kyubey, who has the power to grant any one miracle through contracts, through these contracts he comes to a teenage girl and tells them his deal, \"I will grant you any one wish in exchange for you to fight witches\". He later tries to form a contract with Madoka, much to Homura's dismay.\nIt later goes on to tearing apart the magical girl genre bit by bit, asking and answering questions other shows just can't or won't. Things like who are the magical girls? Who is this Kyubey? What does he want? Where do the witches come from? What do they want? What pushes the girls to form a contract with Kyubey? And many more.\nMadoka's pacing is also tricky to put into words, as you don't really have a sense of time, as none of the episodes give an exact date or a time when something happens, you can only guess.\nArt: 8\nThe art style in Madoka is another thing to contrast the series, as the character designs are moe-esque and bear resemblance to Shaft's other show Hidamari Sketch, while the art at times feels reminiscent of Gankutsuou and the Monogatari series, with rapidly changing camera angles and a very unique art style.\nThe art direction was done by Kaneko Yuuji, who's a rather upcoming name in anime even though he made his debut back in 2001. His recent works include things like Kill la Kill, Little Witch Academia, and To Love Ru Darkness... Yeah I'm gonna pretend I didn't read that and move on.\nSound: 9\nThe soundtrack for Madoka Magica was scored by composed Yuki Kajiura, who's name should have been a tell tale sign of what this show was gonna be like right off the bat, as I've said before, Kajiura's work is usually linked to shows with very dark undertones like Kara no Kyoukai. Her work usually includes orchestric melodies with vocal choirs, and it fits the world of Madoka almost perfectly. The piece \"Decretum\" which plays during emotional moments in the series and \"Credens Justitiam\" a victory sounding piece that plays as sort of a battle theme for the early episodes.\nAlso the ending theme \"Magia\" is one of the best endings I've ever heard, it's so good they also use it as a battle theme for the later episodes.\nCharacter: 8\nThe characters in Madoka Magica, without going into dangerous spoiler territory, are easy to describe in essence. Madoka, a shy young girl who just wants to live a normal life. Sayaka the outgoing, energetic best friend who would go out of her way to help her friends. Homura the enigmatic ice queen who's shrouded in mystery. Mami the helpful and strong senpai who's a weak girl at heart. And Kyouko the rude girl who has a sweet tooth and only cares about herself.\nAs generic as they may sound, how they grow as characters is really where they shine. Each character's mental state gets tested and tried each episode, to the point where they completely lose their shit.\nMadoka Magica is only 12 episodes, a fact that has been proven to give shows a more direct storyline that's not bogged down by filler and pointless side characters. Giving you characters with purpose that you want to see succeed, even if it's not very likely that they will.\nEnjoyment: 3\nWait wait wait WAIT.... You just gave a 3 to Madoka? What the hell man?!?!?\nYes, I did.\nBecause from everything that I've said and watched, Madoka isn't something to be enjoyed, you don't marathon Madoka and enjoy every second of it, it's like saying you watched Serial Experiments Lain with a huge grin on your face the whole time.\nIt just doesn't happen.\nOverall: 10\nMadoka Magica is reminiscent of things like Neon Genesis Evangelion in that it beautifully deconstructs the aspects of the magical girl genre, setting up a harmless moe magical girl anime and shooting your preconceptions in the face and throws them down pit of spikes. \nOverall Madoka Magica is one of the best series to come out in recent years and is an absolute must watch for any anime fan, so they can make their own opinion of what the show was about and what it all meant. Because the meaning behind the story and as to why it ended the way it did is completely left to speculation. Some believe it retells the story of Jesus, some say it's shit, neither one of them are wrong.\nGive me feedback as to whether this review was helpful to you or not, if it wasn't, tell me why and I'll take you suggestions into consideration for my next review ^.^\n        "},

When I saw the pictures of the magical girls, I thought it was a rip-off off of Sailor Moon. So then I watched the first episode and got extremely confused.\nThen... I felt as if I was blinded by something. I went back to it. And when I hit the next two episodes, it was a mindfuck. This anime will screw up the image of magical girls. You'll think that they're a bright thing, but in reality, it's like as if a witch casted a spell on the innocent magical girls who want to save the world. Hearing\n          \n        the truth about them made me shocked for almost a few days that my mind couldn't be sane anymore.\nStory (Rate: 10)\nThe story of it... At first, you wouldn't understand it since your mind is only just at the beginning of a \"wonderland\". But as you go up and up each number of episodes, your mind. Where is it? You can't find it? That's because the second you see or hear truths being revealed, you can't blink. You can't speak. You can't think. Because it's a thriller. You start the anime with a smile, but at the end, you can't help but try about the truth. This anime turns from a candy wonderland with magical girls in tutus to a hell hole.\nArt (Rate: 10)\nMostly how they use mystical creatures and the abstract art... It's amazing. At first they're in a peaceful town, next thing you know it, they're in a place where you can be slaughtered. Where you can see blood splattering everywhere without a police or a city patrol strolling by. The fighting, the action... You can't help but gander at it and think... \"Where is my mind?!\"\nCharacter development (Rate: 10)\nYou see a few girls around high school age with smiles and giggles. But then you see nothing but tears and regrets a few episodes later. You see how the character drastically change. You even see how a character that is the \"antagonist\" use-to-be happy but they had to change for someone else's life.\nOverall, I think this anime deserves a 10. Definitely. If it mindfucked ages 14-25 year-olds (which is a very VERY deep age limit), then it deserves nothing but a loud and long round of applause. And a shit load of tears.\n        "},

It appears to be extremely joyous and happy with puppies frolicking through fields of rainbows and lollipops.\nIt's pretty much anything but.\nThe anime begins as lighthearted as any other super fruity magical girl anime. Hell, it was almost Winx Club level. But as the anime goes on you delve deeper into an ugly truth yet to be disclosed. It's as if your inner cynical is nagging at you telling you something feels off. It was too cute. It was too happy. That's what makes this anime\n          \n        so special. Madoka no Magica presents an ugly truth as the sugar and gumdrop topping is slowly scraped off. The reality of things behind the magical adventure trope is revealed bit by bit as a horrid yet necessary truth is revealed. \nThe best part about that is, that truth isn't a selfish and evil truth with lightning in the background and an organ somewhere. It was realistic, without gumdrops or gummy bears. It's the unfair but necessary mechanic of things that with enough thought, you could see how justified such atrocious actions are. They are necessary, and that's what makes it even more morbid.\nIt's a terrifying, though provoking, yet entertainingly cynical reminder that nothing comes without a price–the best things come at terrible prices.

I have never seen any mahou-shoujo-show comparable to this.\nTo be honest i havn´t seen many mahou-shoujo-shows at all.\nWhen i was little i watched Sailor Moon and i tried some other, like Cardcaptor Sakura and right now i´m watching\nMagical Girl Nanoha and some other.\nI still think Puella Magicka is much darker, then any of the\n          \n        former named.\nAlso Puella Magi's story has much more twists, actually at least one per episode.\nBut let's get some structure in this review.\n\nStory:\nPuella Magi Madoka Magicka starts off like any other mahou-shoujo-show.\nOne or a small groupe of school girls get drawn into a fight with a magical monster (they are called witches in this show).\nShe is/ they are saved by an other magical girl or the mascot of the show.\nThe other magical girl/mascot explains the concept and the rules of the show to the school girl(s) and the audience.\nThe school girl(s) decide to help the other magical girl/mascot to fight monsters \nand collect MacGuffins (named griefseeds in this show).\nThe first three episodes are totally sterotypical for the mahou-shoujo-genré, but after these the show shows it'S true\ncolours. Very, very dark colours to be precise.\nOf course there are dark and sad moments in other mahou-shoujo-shows as well, but the major difference is, in other shows\nthe characters are able to recover from these mental blows.\nIn Puealla Magi Madoka Magicka this is not the case.\nThe girls get pushed over the limit what they are able to endure.\nSeveral of the girls just can't take it any more and thier mind snaps.\nThe pressure on the characters gets even higher, because in this show the greif seed is actually no MacGuffin,\nit serves the purpose to restore the magical energy of the girls which is needed after becoming a magical girl, not\nonly to fight on, but to survive.\nSo the girls are forced to ensure a steady supply of grief seeds even if this means to snatch an other girls prey.\n\nCharacters:\nThe maincharacter, Madoka, is the stereotypical innocent ultimate-magical-girl messiah.\nShe only cares for others and acts so sweet, your teeth will start to hurt, just by looking at her.\nWith that said, she's the only stereotype in this show.\nThe others characters seem to be stereotypical at first, but when the story moves on it is shown, \nthat the other characters have multible layers of personality.\nThese deeper layers often happen to be quite nasty character traits.\nMany characters in this show are rather selfish and the word friendship often is not enough to\ncalm them down.\nThe most obvious example is this shows cute mascot character, Kyuubey.\nHe's the stereotypical cute and polite and always wants to help the girls.\nBut while the show moves on you realise, all these good traits are just a facade, used to get the girls trust him.\nHe's actually extremly cold hearted. He understands nearly nothing of human values.\nJust enough to use it to manipulate the girls.\nFrom a specific point onwards, he's just extremely creepy.\nThis impression is even stronger because of his paradoxial appearence.\n\nArt:\nYou have to differentiate between two art-styles.\nThe first is the real-world-style. In this style everything looks quite normal and the backgrounds are\npretty much like every other anime now a days. \nThe characters look rather plain compared to other anime these days.\nThis might be a matter of taste, but i really like this.\nIt makes the characters in this show much more recognizable in direct comparsions with other anime.\nThe second style is the witch-world-style.\nTo fight the witches in this series the girls have to enter special dimensions, \nwhich where made by the witches.\nThese worlds look very surreal.\nAlso they are wastly different from each other.\nEach witch-world features a special and unique design.\nThis goes for the witches as well.\nTheir appearences vary from giant half-demon/half-robot monsters to little plushies.\n\nSoundtrack:\nThe soundtrack is simply awesome.\nThere is nothing special about the intro-song. \nIt's quite interchangable witch every other intro from mahou-schoujo-shows.\nBut the outro-song is a totally different case.\nIt reminds me of the early songs of nightwish.\nIt's hard beats und the dark overall tune goes quite well, with the dark story, which this show tells.\nAn other fact, which makes the outro even more memorizable is, it´s quite rare.\nOnly six out of twelve episode actually end with this outro.\nThe other six episodes use the two minutes to let the charcters reflect what just happend, or for foreshadowing\nof the next big plot twist while the credits are shown over these scenes.\nThe music within the episodes is also better than average.\nIn the all days live you get very calming music, like flute tunes.\nOr no music at all, so it doesn't distract you from the pichtures you see, or the conversation you hear.\nThe battle music has quite the variety.\nDepending in the level of danger the music differs from J-Pop over orchestral to symphonic metal.\nconclusion:\nThis will be tough...\nEither the Puella Magi fans or haters will stone me to death...\nBut please keep in mind, that this last part are my personal thoughts, so you don´t have to agree with me.\nIt's just a matter of taste.\nSo, what do i think about Puella Magi?\n\nIs Puella Magi really this unique?\nI still think, it's just as unique as it claims to be.\nYes, there are other magical girl shows, which are rather dark,\nbut non the the shows I have seen takes it as far as Puella Magi Madoka Magicka.\n\nIs this show a real masterpiece?\nAnimé is a form of art and art is always a matter of personal taste.\nIt's impossible to create something, that is the ultimate form of art and everybody loves it.\nWith that said, Puella Magi Madoka Magicka claimed the title of being my favourite animé.\nSo, from my point of view, i whouldn´t mind if somebody calls it a masterpiece.\nIn fact, the magical girl genré is as far as you can get away from my favourite genré, mecha.\n(At least if you ignore Magic Knight Rayearth, which actually is a magical girl meacha show...)\nAnd still, Puella Magi managed not only to catch my attention, but to hold it.\nI've rewatched my personal favourite episodes, as well as the whole series several time and it\nstill manages to entertain me.\nSo, there just has to be something special about this show.\n\nWill you like this show, too?\nOf course, i cannot look into your head, so i won't guarantee anything,\nbut if you like either dark plots, non-stereotypical characters or the magical girl shows,\nthen there's a good chance you will like this show, too.\nBut keep in mind, if you try this show, watch at least the first four episodes before you make up your mind.\nIf you stop watching earlier you won't notice the real concept behind this show.\n\nOverall I give this show a 10/10.\nYes, i'm fully aware, there are some problems with this animé, \nfor example the inconsistence of Homuras magic in the first episode.\nBut these are minor problems compared to the join, this show brought me.\nSo i'm totally willing to overlook these glitches.\n        "},

IT'S ALL SERIOUS AND SAD!\nThe pacing seems to be all over the place, the action scenes always feel rushed, while the \"tragic\" scenes with someone crying that happen EVERY GODDAMN 5 MINUTES seem to go on forever.\nArt/Sound:\nProbably the only redeeming factors to this show, I like the art style, and how it's not just the generic cookie-cutter style you see most of the time, the witch dimensions look really unique and creative and the characters themselves look and animate really well.\nAs for sound, I like the Opening, however, I wasn't overly fond of show's OST but there were some tracks I liked.\nThe VA was a mixed bag however, characters like Sayaka, Homura and Mami sounded fine, while characters like Madoka and Kyouko were unbearable and for some reason, Sayaka's love interest (Forgot his name) sounds like a girl.\nCharacters:\nI wasn't particularly a fan of any of the characters especially Madoka herself, she is she is nothing but a Mary Sue who cries ALL THE FUCKING TIME, and does jack shit until the last episode, then the rest of the characters are pretty much uninteresting archetypes with the exception of Homura, a girl who see's the dark side to all of this and tries her best to resolve it, and Kyubey who is the Ultimate Troll.\nOverall:\nI tried to like this Anime, I really did, but I didn't find the characters interesting, and the plot is just wasted potential with Madoka crying all the fucking time.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Warning: spoilers ahead\nLet’s clear something up right now. This is not an unbiased review. I don’t believe any such thing exists. However, I will do my best to keep my fangirl juices in check and judge this anime the same way I would any other one. Madoka is not a perfect anime by any stretch of the imagination. It is not flaw-free. So why, you may ask, am I giving it a 10/10? Because I love this anime more than any other one I’ve seen. I give out scores based on my personal feelings, and my feelings are that this anime is amazing despite its\n          \n        flaws. \nPlot: 9/10\nI have a weak spot for dark, depressing as fuck anime. I have a soft spot for suffering lolis. However, that alone is not enough to merit a 9/10, as can be seen by my Charlotte review. The scope of this anime’s plot is perfect. It never tries to be anything it isn’t, which seems to be a sadly common theme among a lot of other anime I’ve watched. The pacing is always on point and the twists come one after another, always in natural ways. They never feel forced. This anime feels like it was planned out before the writer even wrote the first sentence. There’s little hints everywhere about the truth, from the name of the soul gems, to Homura’s reactions to Madoka’s comments. They are subtle, and things you wouldn’t notice unless you were looking for them, but they are effective in making nothing feel like it was put in at random. Madoka has a few holes in it, though not very many. For example, in episode 10 it’s revealed that Homura has been going back in time over and over and over. We see the beginning of episode 1 where she’s fighting Walpurgisnacht and Madoka is up by the big tree. But if that’s the case, then what was that abstract hallway she was running through? And what was the big floating island? Those don’t appear in any of the other timelines. You could argue that it was because it was a dream, but we’re seeing it from Homura’s perspective this time. The giant tree is still there. There is no giant tree in Madoka’s city, so where did it come from? It kind of feels like the plot forgot about that, but maybe I’m just misinterpreting something. Another bad part about the plot is that it felt like it was trying to hit a series of plot points and the story was based around those plot points. It’s basically the opposite of penguindrum; the story is plot-driven rather than character-driven. That is to say, the characters change with the plot, not the other way around. \nHonestly, if I was going to judge this anime objectively and set my personal feelings aside, the plot would probably get an 8/10 simply because of the ending. It was almost but not quite an “it was all just a dream” ending. It felt conclusive, but rushed. It felt like it should have taken up at least one more episode, maybe even two. It had a lot of good ideas, but it was presented in a way that left you wondering “what just happened”. They wouldn’t even have had to change any of the ideas, just give each one of them more screen time. Explain things a little better as well, since it can get really confusing unless you’ve seen the anime several times and read spoilers and explanations online. All in all, it was not the worst ending I’ve seen to date, but one of them. That last scene with Homura was really sad. This is the one time I’m going to let my emotions cloud my judgement, because I just loved that ending scene so much where she is fighting and can feel madoka in her. And she has Madoka’s weapon. It’s just so… heartwarming? I don’t know. I loved it. 11/10. \nCharacters: 9/10\nThe characters in Madoka are even better than the ones in Penguindrum in terms of depth and development. Each of them has their own sets of motivations, their own desires and, of course, their own wishes. Every single one of them has a tragic story of some kind, be it Sayaka’s path to self-destruction or Kyoko’s backstory of parental abandonment or Homura’s determination to save Madoka, even if it means doing the same month over 100 times. The character relations and interactions all tie into the bigger story and serve to show something much larger than the story we see. Each one of the girls is there to show what can become of a magical girl. We have Mami, who died in battle, being beheaded by a witch and then… eaten. We have Sayaka who follows what she believes is the one and only righteous path, eventually falling into despair and becoming a witch, and we have Kyoko (who’s story I loved the most) who died after using up all her magic and destroying her soul gem. Unfortunately, at times the characters interact with each other and talk like plot devices rather than actual characters, and while they never acted in a frustratingly irrational way just for the sake of the plot, their actions did feel like they were in service of the plot more than anything a lot of the time. And fucking Kamijo was literally nothing more than a plot device to lead Sayaka to become a magical girl and eventually to crash and burn. I kind of wish Urobuchi had given him more character rather than treating him like a prop. Also, Homura is best girl. \nArt: 10/10\nWith this being a shaft anime is is directed, like all shaft anime, by Akiyuki Shinbo. His artistic vision is one of my favorites, with his use of random colors and photographs in the background. It’s no secret that Shinbo loves to be artsy and symbolic, and oh boy did he have fun with Madoka. The labyrinths are basically the definition of Acid Trip Dimension. The witch designs are hilariously horrifying with their abstract surrealness. The character designs were done by Ume Aoki, better known for her moe/slice of life anime Hidamari Sketch (which was also done by shaft). This made all the characters look SUPER adorable, serving to clash nicely with the dark plot and fool people into thinking that this show was going to be happy before they watched episode 3. \nSound: 11/10\nThe music was done by the one and only Yuki Kajiura, also known for her work in Fate/Zero, Sword Art Online, and the .hack franchise. The Madoka soundtrack is basically everything I could ask for in an OST. It’s memorable and distinctive and if you were to play one of them for me, I’d be able to say “hey, that’s Madoka music!” All of the music fits with the mood of the scene it’s played in and draws out the emotion of both the characters and the audience members. Or maybe that’s just me… \nAs I said before, this review is biased. Objectively, this anime probably deserves an 8.5 or a 9, but I loved it enough to push the score up to a 10. To me, it is one of the best anime ever made, despite its flaws. I recommend it to pretty much everybody I meet and everybody who watches it tell me how much they love it. If I could rate it 11/10 I would, but sadly MAL only goes up to 10. "},

Nothing so lighthearted waits for you here.\nThe anime tells the story of... Nah, that would be a spoiler. Madoka, a normal highschool girl, gets introduced to a world of terrible monsters known as witches and those who fight them, magical girls (those are different... kinda... maybe... ok f@ck it, lets continue). A creature known as Kyubey offers to give her magical powers, along with fullfilling one wish, in exchange for her eternal servitude as a magical girl onwards. Along with\n          \n        Madoka comes Sayaka, a close friend of hers who is also offered this chance. Both Madoka and Sayaka spend a large part of the series trying to decide if they want to become magical girls, and also what their wish is. One magical girl specifically, Homura, from the start tries to convince Madoka otherwise, for unclear reasons.\nThe anime's main focus is regret, aka the girls making decisions that later backfire 100% of the time. The sentence \"This is too cruel.\" has almost become a catchphrase for the anime, as the girls are continuously psychologically tortured and manipulated. In addition, Kyubey might not be exactly the happy little funny sidekick you'd expect in a magical girls anime. Just to clarify, this isn't an adventure anime, it's a drama. The protagonist is obviously Madoka, but equal, if not more, focus is given to Homura. Every scene is painted in the most surreal way possible, successfully creating a continuous feeling of unease that really gets to the user. But there is a reason I gave it 8 instead of 10, right?\nSpoilers warning: Lets be honest about this: Kyubey's deal is a win win situation, I would take it without a thought anyday. Hell, Kyubey doesn't even force the girls to fight, all of them fight because of personal reasons, yet they keep whining about their \"terrible fate\". Hey, here's an idea, wish for a billion dollars, get an ageless repairable body, get amazing magical powers, the ability to transform into an unstoppable monster if you ever were to become completely desperate AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY. \"K, thanks, bye, have a nice evening!\" Seriously, Kyubey's contact is a win-win situation, what's to complain about?! But I digress... A second complaint would be that the art of the anime sometimes comes out as \"forced\". While it reminds of the Monogatari series a lot when it comes to style, the chaotic scene change just doesn't come out as natural as it does in Monogatari. In addition girls faces' are way too squary, making them look unproportinally large.\nBut let me be honest, those are just water under the bridge. If you're looking for plenty of well-acted drama, surreal scenery and an interesting plot, then you have found it.\n        "},

FUCKING KYOKO IS FUCKING AMAZING AND IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FEMALE CHARACTERS EVER. Homura is really dislikable at first but when you start to understand her a lot more as the show goes on, you start liking Homura and feel something for her (NO SPOILERS). Madoka is one of the most kind hearted and most adorable characters ever. I mean if your a fan of madoka, you would fucking know what im talking about. Sayaka is so loveable in the beginning of the anime but later on, she was being a bit of an asshole. I love Sayaka but... she just turns from AMAZING to NOT SO AMAZING. Mami.... :| I DON'T HATE MAMI BUT.... she is very selfish and greedy. I didn't care about her that much at all but her fate was very cruel (NO SPOILERS).\nEnjoyment: 9 \nI REALLY enjoyed this anime, I avoided it for a very long time because I couldn't handle dark things but when I can now, I wish I could handle dark things a very long time ago :( however this anime is overrated as fuck. It was fantastic but no where close to being the best anime ever.\nOverall: 8\nI'm giving it an 8 because how overrated it is, the animation is derpy sometimes and Mami :/\nbut the best things about this anime are Kyoko. Kyoko. Kyoko. Story. Kyoko. Kyoko. Kyoko. Characters. Dark Plot. Kyoko. \nNow If you just started getting into the magical girl genre and your looking for a magical girl anime that is about the main character (or her friends whatever) saving the world. DO NOT WATCH THIS ONE, IT ISN'T ONE OF THOSE. I recommend something like Sailor Moon (original), Shugo Chara, CardCaptor Sakura, Precure series and Tokyo Mew Mew (I don't really like Tokyo Mew Mew but lots of people do and I think you probably will too. If you want a magical girl anime that is really dark or has a plot twist (or has someone fucking amazing like fucking KYOKO) then WATCH THIS! ITS AMAZING!!!"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is an extended review of Puella Magi Madoka Magica adapted for suitability to MAL from my own personal blog. Therefore this will be a longer review. If you are looking for something that quickly summarises the scores someone has given then you are better looking elsewhere. This is designed to be a detailed breakdown of the show. Anyway, hope you enjoy the read.\n\nMany 12 episode shows that are extremely plot driven go on to disappointment me greatly due to their annoying habit of just skipping forward and missing out far too much. Many magical girls shows tend to lack anything past cute girls prancing\n          \n        around. Many moe shows end up having next to no solid development of plot and concentrate more on making you go \"Awwwwwww!\". So, Madoka Magica. It's review time!\nMadoka Magica follows the story of Madoka herself and her everyday fun adventures as a magical girl. Yeah right. Of course if this really was a generic magical girl show there's no way I'd be here reviewing it because there's no way I'd have watched it in the first place. In contrast though I've watched Madoka Magica not one, not two, but three times. It's difficult for me to give a plot overview because quite simply I'd ruin the show doing so. The initial plot of the show quickly becomes redundant as it develops and we start to get a real feel for its true nature. Now there's something worth talking about.\nMake no mistake. This is a dark narrative show which has some genuinely twisted moments in. To actually label this as a 'magical girl' show is unfair to those who get suckered in watching it under that name. This is the very definition of a psychological thriller. In saying this it's worth noting that whilst this might not actually be a regular magical girl show it sure as hell presents itself as one. Everything from the art style (which I'll speak about in more detail later on), the way it was promoted to the characters themselves, there's very little here that'd tell you that you're about to watch something with even a hint of dark narrative. This is perhaps Madoka Magica's greatest strength. It manages to be so much whilst appearing as so little. It baits you in just so it can punch you in the face. It's a bit backwards in that regard really. It was promoted as a generic magical girl show when it was really a psychological thriller. As a result of this at the time of its release it didn't actually get a huge reception. People simply didn't take in interest in it due to their misunderstanding of the show's reality. Instead Madoka Magica has actually become more renowned in the last couple years where attention from big YouTubers has allowed people to appreciate its real beauty. Oh and if you can't tell already, I really like this show.\nThe main theme here is one of risk against reward and the judgment of humans. \"If you had to make one wish that could literally do anything, what would it be?\". These are strong words that Madoka Magica gives you early on as you get your first real taste of the values this show really wants to explore. Making a wish when only given one opportunity is a really difficult decision. What would you do? The obvious path is the fortune one but what repercussions does this have? You can never return to your old life again and is it really money you even want? What about helping out someone you care for? Well, the show itself explores that in a lot of detail so I'll let you see exactly what the consequence of that can be for yourself. What this show does is take a seemingly light-hearted theme and give it a dark, realistic twist. There's a real lesson to be learnt from Madoka Magica. Do you really want what you think you want? Messages of life only appear from truly great shows.\nMoving more towards my traditional format of reviewing let's have a look at the characters. It's no surprise that the entire cast pretty much consists of ultra moe magical girls who seek justice and righteousness. Well... except for the ones who don't. The main usage of characters here is that they are all young, eager minds that, due to their naivety, are corrupted by the desire to have something.  Sometimes this came in the form of utter selfishness yet at other times it was complete selflessness. The point though is that regardless of their motives, they all fall to the same trap. This practical use of the characters in order to reflect the overall theme of the show is a real strong point for Madoka Magica. As for the characters themselves I find it difficult to pick out a particular highlight as they're all pretty damn solid in their own right. Their presentation of emotion is done better than a huge majority of anime out there and their designs are cleverly done as they both subvert and conform to the conventions of the magical girls genre. If I really had to pick my favourite characters though I'd have to go with Akemi and Kyouko. I can't go into detail about why I love them (especially Akemi) but basically they have by far the most powerful scenes in the show. Also, Akemi's ability is really cool as not only does it look amazing but it also is very relevant to the over-arching narrative but once again, that's heavy spoiler territory. To summarise though the characters here really are pretty much faultless. There are a couple times where I felt the transitions between them came across as being marginally unnatural feeling but that really is being overly picky. I've had to actively seek out that fault and I heavily doubt any regular viewer would notice it.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica (which is a very elegant name indeed) is a truly gorgeous show. The real strength here is that it manages to look beautiful both during the casual chatting scenes between the girls and the brutal moments. The art style adapts itself wonderfully to suit the occasion with the transition between bright pastel colours and dark moody colours being faultless. This is really emphasised in the fighting scenes later on. What's so magical about it is that the base art style doesn't actually change. The characters are still drew the same no matter the occasion and yet they look suitable at all times. It's also worth giving a special thumbs up for the art style during the witches' labyrinths. It comes across as being mental and mad with a real focus being placed on the craziness of the universe they are in. That's what makes it so perfect though. They reflect the very attitudes of the witches incredibly in a distinctly stand out way. Also don't be put off by the show's appearance, this knows how to do a fight scene. Many shows such as Sword Art Online get special notice for their supposed incredible fighting scenes and great visual effects. Here's the thing though, they aren't all they're cracked up to be. I'm not claiming SAO's fights are bad but rather uncoordinated. Most fights in that series include two people mindlessly throwing a sword at each other until one wins. It lacks intelligence is the best way to describe it. In comparison though Madoka Magica has a real sense of sophistication about it's action scenes. You feel like a lot of time was put into not only the choreography but also the meaning of each attack. Characters fight with a serious passion to get what they want and you never feel like the fighting is done for the sake of it looking cool. If characters in Madoka Magica fight, they have a strong reason to. This reason isn't always admirable or heroic but it isn't supposed to be. At times they fight for completely irrational and selfish reasons and yet all that does is emphasise the naivety of the cast even more. I adore this show's art style and the usage of its art so much that I don't think I can even convey just how much I do in this short review. It really is one of the most artistically brilliant shows out there as far as I'm concerned.\nThis opening falls nicely into the 'I have downloaded this onto my iPod' category which basically translates to I love the music in it. As with most of the show's quirks the opening would have you think this is going to be a nice slice of life with some magical girls in. Without repeating myself once again this further reinforces the whole emphasis of the subversion of the genre that Madoka Magica produces. Looking past artistic merit and all that can be just appreciate for a second how great of an opening it is in its own right. Not only is it catchy with some very nice looking art but it also has very light foreshadowing in as well as some strangely placed fan service. Yeah I don't really get that one. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fan service but that one shot where Madoka is naked with herself and having some kind of self reflection really is weirdly out-placed considering the rest of the show. It says a lot though when you consider that's probably been my biggest criticism of the show up till now.\nI don't feel the need to tell you that this show is worth watching because by now that should be very apparent. As genre subversions go Madoka Magica is in a league of its own. It takes the magical girls genre, turns it on its head and then blows it up for good measure. I think this shows gets a lot of praise but unlike many mainstream shows I do not for a second believe it is undeserved. It manages to convey a strong message whilst looking wonderful, portraying a well structured narrative and most importantly no skipping forward all the time to ruin the overall experience. Basically if you want to know how to do a 12 episode series right, look no further.\n\nStory: 9/10\nArt: 10/10\nSound: 8/10\nCharacter: 8/10\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nOVERALL: 9/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    After having just watched the finale on livestream, I must say that any attempt to be objective will fail at this point.  Shaft has delivered one of the most unique magical girl show ever in my mind.\nIt starts out like any other magical girl show, a quick glimpse in the daily routine of the main characters of the show.  The machinations of magic are quickly introduced, giving us time to be able to digest part of the world of Magical Girls before the first twist occurs.  From here on out, we catch a glimpse of a parallel plot and subtle foreshadowing, while\n          \n        being explained of the truth of the Magical Girl.  All this was but a set up for Madoka's final decision as the story draws to a close, with nary a gaping plot hole in sight.\nShaft's first anime original has given them a lot of liberties to take.  The most striking is perhaps the Witches, each given their own theme and décor.  It is wide and varied, along with the architectural porn on display.  Not to mention some of the cinematographic choices in lighting and camera angles which adds subtle accentuations to the scenes.  However, the broadcast episodes do suffer in quality at some points; the characters looking slightly off.  Shaft is notorious for this but it is not to say that it detracts too much from the experience.\nThe sound as well is given great attention to detail.  The themes are simple yet easily bolster an already powerful scene.  Whether it is the hopeful rescue in the first episode or the sorrow and regret preceding the fall from grace.  Again, special mention goes to the sound effects of Witches and their minions.  Contrasting their horrific appearances with cheery laughs or a distortion thereof really completes what they are.  The voice work is a non-issue.\nIn terms of characters, once again a master stroke.  The cast were able to perform their functions in terms of plot and still have characterisation, changing over the course of the series.  This mostly applies to the main characters like Madoka but there was still attention paid to the minor ones like her mother.  Admittedly, I thought some were more plot-drivers than actual characters.  We are given enough to be able to feel somewhat strongly for the characters because of this.  For the Magical Girls though, the feeling is mostly of sympathy.  Even the quiet Homura is not what she initially appears to be and could arguably be the protagonist with along Madoka.\nAfter writing this much it'd be impossible to say I haven't enjoyed Madoka at all.  From deciphering the runic alphabet to recognising famous landmarks of the world present in Mitakihara, it was a fun ride, speculating on even the smallest details as the show ran its course.  The fact that this was an anime original that was trying to do something different only adds to the satisfaction.  If you can't at least recognise that, you think too highly of yourself.  And remember, the contract was always worth the price.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, an anime which certainly became a real something during this season, has finally came to conclusion. One may say that conclusions are often parts that kills a good anime, but with this particular one we have a bit of a different story... However, let just start from the very begginning.\nAt first, we see the lovely story of Madoka, a typical ordinary girl, representing the stereotypical cute anime character - pink hair, ribbon, shool outfit and rather not too tall. With all that charm, she is drawn in a way that rather prevents her from being described as moe, but this is\n          \n        not quite a problem in here. The main misfortune is the fact, that among all characters, the main one is the worst one. She is just warmly-hearted, one-dimensional girl, that seems to be existing just to keep the plot going.\nWell, what is the plot? As the title indicates, it is focused on the topic of magical girls, although there are quite not the same as in the most anime of its kind. In this one, the whole procedure of becoming mahous shoujo or puella magi, as you like, is telling your wish to Kyubey - a weird, but adorable cat-like creature, who has mouth, but never opens it while it speaks - and it grants it for the repayment of you starting a risky life as the magical girl, spending whole days on hunting the evil witches. The entire thing starts when the main character and her friend Sayaka meets Kyubey being chased by another character, Akemi Homura. It soon turns out that the cute monster wants to make contracts, as earlier described, with the two protagonists. The third one however, the mysterious Homura, wants to stop them from proceeding in this way. The reasons for her doing so and many other unknown facts concerning the true nature of magical girls in this universe are being revealed to us in the following episosed, making the whole plot much more complicated and darker than in any other anime of this kind. As many people claim, this is certainly not an anime for children. Althought the very begginning does not suggest it, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has some very thrilling moments in it and is in fact overloaded with a hard, dreading climate.\nOne thing that is certain is that the audiovisual side of this anime is the factor that instantly keeps this climate going. Even if the plot is not very appalling itself, the way it is presented keeps the viewer's attention without any delays. The feeling that \"something\" may instantly happen is following you all the time as you keep watching the show. The music fits perfectly to the scenes, the opening is just great and the way in which this anime was drawn makes it even more appealing and outstanding, especially if you keep comparing it to the other mahou shoujos.\nNevertheless, despite how great this anime is, it still has a couple of drawbacks. As I already mentioned, the most annoying thing is the main hero. She really is the less interesting thing in the whole anime and despite her being the title character, one can argue that the whole show could even proceed without her at all. Apart from Madoka, there are not really many characters and the one that I most enjoyed is Homura. Always cool and mysterious, but having a completely different nature on the other hand, as it is revealed later on. She is the only non-one-dimensional character and the only one that you can at least sympathise with as far as I am concerned. Moreover, another problem with this anime, which I indicated on the beggining of this review, is the way it actually ends. I do not want to give you any spoilers, but I guess it is fair enough to warn you to not expect anything extraordinary. I had some hypothesis along before watching the final episodes and I was in fact closely enough with one of them and I did not find the ending scene that surprising. One may have other feelings regarding it, but in my opinion the last part was not that great as the rest of this anime.\nSo, how is it overall? If I have to sum it up, it is a very enjoyable anime overall. It has some cons regarding the characters and the ending is not that good as it could possibly be, but it still it a great piece to watch and I really liked the way it outstands on the background of its genre. I feel awkwardly sorry about the fact I cannot give it the highest score, but this does not change the fact that is a truly amazing thing to watch. Highly recommended!\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=18,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I was skeptical coming into this series. After showing me the trailer on Youtube, my friend laughed and remarked that the trailer was \"perfect\". It was simply a show about cute magical girls, he assured me. Being outside the conventional targeted demographic for this such a genre, I was very dubious of whether I would enjoy such an anime. However, since his recommendations had never led me wrong before, I decided to give it a try and started watching it with him.\nBy the first episode I was somewhat intrigued. The characters all seemed fairly likable, if not coming off as a little juvenile, considering they\n          \n        are in middle school. The production and animation of the show was also demonstrably well-done which certainly made it more engaging to watch. However, the component that really piqued my interested were the witch fights and their bizarre and trippy animations. I really enjoyed watching those scenes and experiencing somewhat of a sensory overload as various, indiscriminate objects haphazardly wrapped around the screen and the textures and colors came to life. I did my best to try and describe these scenes, but really there is no substitute for viewing them yourself.\nWe continued with two more episodes, and throughout I found that the exposition (where the laws of this universe are gradually explained to the viewer) was nicely intertwined with action sequences and the further revealing of character motives and backstories. I watched this show in early 2014, long after it had already been released, and looking back now, I consider myself very lucky that I had managed not to overhear anything about this wildly popular show. Due to this, I was entirely unprepared for the bombshell twist that was dropped on me at the end of episode 3. It was so unexpected that I nearly lost my head at how sudden a development this was. In my opinion, shock value in media can be done either very well or very poorly. Let Puella Magi Madoka Magica be a textbook example of it done flawlessly. I had originally come for the trippy presentations of the witch fights, but now I was definitely staying for the story.\nAfter the ensuing episodes, which glue the rapidly advancing plot together quite nicely, I was beginning to understand that this was a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Not being very well versed in the genre played straight, my only regret is that I had not watched some conventional magical girl anime beforehand so that I could better compare and contrast. Nevertheless, the writing is enthralling enough that it shouldn't matter too much for viewers without much previous experience with genre.\nThen we come to episode ten. There are too many brilliant factors to cover comprehensively in this acclaimed episode, so I will only talk about a few. We finally gain some semblance of a true understanding in regard to what is happening in the plot through very smart and angled storytelling that allows us to sympathize with several of the characters (trying my best to be vague in the interest of avoiding spoilers). Through this, I found it very hard to not perceive the sadness and sense of hopelessness that was so heavily percolating from the storyline. It is here that mask comes completely off and this anime reveals the full extent of its dark undertones for the whole world to see. And at the end when the opening credits play, and then the lyrics start to make sense... saying I was touched would be putting it much too lightly. I have to admit, I consider this episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica to be the single greatest episode in television anime of all time.\nThe ending, while considered controversial by some, in my opinion put a very satisfactory ending to this magnificent and breathtaking tale. The ending was not some thoughtless, happy-go-lucky fairy tale ending, but more of an intellectual and thought-provoking close to the story that caused me to parse and ponder its true ramifications for weeks to come; and that's just the way I like 'em. With dazzling and intriguing visuals, a great and emotional soundtrack, and writing on a level that I have not yet seen another anime match, I can't recommend this series enough. But if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you didn't read too much into my review. Go watch it now, and just keep in mind the wise words of my friend: \"After all, it's just a show about cute magical girls.\"\n        "},

And now that I've come this far, the only star left that will help guide my way... You don't have to understand. My words don't have to resonate within you. But still, I beg you. Let me protect you.\"\nMaybe its how Shaft grabbed me visually, perhaps its how unique it is to the rest of its genre, but when I finally decided to give the Magical Girl genre a chance again by watching Madoka★Magica, I was rewarded with one of the greatest animes of its time, one that tears apart the\n          \n        stereotypes of Mahou Shoujo and creates from the ashes a breath of fresh air that made me ponder the very ideas of morality, power and most of all, the bittersweet tragedy of sacrifice itself. Normally I would break it down for individual ratings, but once, here is an exception, because it would take me an entire booklet to describe its intricacy. That day when I picked it from a shelf will be the day I consider a turning point in my belief.\nIn fact, I remember when I first collected the anime from a convention. Normally I avoid Mahou Shoujo's because frankly, the frills, sweet, moe characters with magical powers created by wishes or whatever wasnt appealing to me. It always seemed like a genre meant for 13 year old girls that wanted hope and a new world to entrance in, and being an 18 year old university student...thats rather embarrassing. Suddenly, it was in my hands...and so without much to care for, I watched the first episode, and from then on, I knew that this was the one that would change my perception completely. I saw black darkness and checkered beauty all within the dream of the girl who would become the main protagonist later on. In only 5 minutes, my perceptions of the Mahou Shoujo genre was shattered.\nWhat shocked me most though was the intricacy of the storyline itself. Unlike Naruto or other \"big\" anime that constantly drag me to hell with fillers, this was a delightful exception, with every minute of the storyline leaving me on the edge of my seat, weaving the basket of plot thicker and thicker as our curiosity increases at what will happen next. There are no \"fillers\",  you cannot skip an episode or you have basically missed out on a large chunk of the story for that. That is what makes it so perfect, its execution, but not only that, its sound.\nThe music of Madoka★Magica entranced me and thrust the series deeper into the world of psychological manipulation in terms of twisting my soul into pure emotion as time progresses. In fact, I even downloaded the OST and discovered my favourite interpretation of \"Ave Maria\" by Charles Gounod, interpreted by the legendary Kajiura Yuki, whose use of the violin moved me to tears by its intense feeling. Not even being roundhouse kicked in the face years back made me cry, so that says enough really.\nArtistically, I had to get used to it, but then again, the characters were bubbly too, and speaking of that, after only 3 episodes, I felt like I was watching a different anime entirely, the character development being just so deep in such a short span of time, that it is almost impossible to top. \nIve never been a fan of the overly bubbly (unless its  K-On!!), and picking this up, I expected disappointment. Yet now I realise how wrong I was, and my only regret was that I didn't give this a chance sooner. I smiled, I was thrilled, I felt my emotions tingle and at times even teared up, and although Im hopeful that the Anime industry can continue to produce perfect worlds like the one created here, but in this genre, I doubt I will ever see something this beautifully perfect again, and although it only spanned 12 episodes, I have nothing but fulfillment from this, and cannot wait to see the trilogy of movies airing soon. 10/10, and well deserved.\n~Katsuro-chan\n        "},

Girl turns into Mahou shoujo, girl fights evil, and love and hope triumph, a predictable plot, right? WRONG. As i said, the story will soon dwell deeper into darker themes. \nthough it's not as dark as horror series like Higurashi or Another, this series has a common and at the same time different type of dark. Common in a way that it has been done before, but different, mainly because even if it's a mahou shoujo anime, the darkness can almost be put in real life situations, which is uncommon to see, as most dark shows give these themes to the extreme, but Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica put the darkness on a level high enough to be dark, but low enough that even the most common of the people can relate to. most people will say only about one character is relatable, but if given good thought, most of the cast have things even i can relate to. For instance, Jealousy, when the one you love has someone else; Loneliness, when you alone understand your pain and no one else doesn't; Shock, when you live a normal life and suddenly get forced into something terrible; etc..\nby now you probably know the kind of darkness the show has.\nOn to other things, the plot seems predictable, however, this is where most mistakes are made. If you have noticed the other reviews, you can see words like, \"i never expected this\" or \"this gave me quite a shock\". Mainly because, for a mahou shoujo anime, it's plot is hard to predict, it gives you constant shocks, and after a while, you won't even know what's going to happen next. This is part of what makes the show popular. The way it fools you in the start, only to reveal a deeper story.\nI'm not gonna say anything else, as that would end up spoiling the show, but as i said earlier, This show is Not your typical mahou shoujo, and i would say it could me more of a Psychological genre.\n[Character] 8/10\nThe show has a small set of characters, and mostly focuses on the main characters, whereas the supporting characters are given very little screen time. However, the show makes up for it with the development of these main characters, the Mahou Shoujo themselves. \nHow? well, let's just say that 70% of this show's darkness lies within the characters themselves. For the most part, The very main character, Madoka, lives an ordinary, almost perfect life. Her mother is a successful business woman, a stay at home dad, a baby sibling, and they all get along. She has good friends, goes to a good school. and then suddenly, she and her friend Sayaka are pulled in a witches labyrinth, meet Mami who is a magical girl, Mami saves them, and then Kyubey tells them that they have the potential to become magical girls. And then the plot twists are revealed and the show gets darker, now how will she handle this darkness? her who has barely experience pain before? And the way she handles this, is in accordance with her personality. She doesn't do something out of nowhere which opposes her very beliefs, she takes action on a way that does. that's how the characters handle their actions. if you feel like they did something out of the blue, just pause and think about it, and soon you'll realize why they did what they did. Some of them took action because of what is currently happening to them, while others, have a deep dark secrets of their pasts, which took a lot of pain to go through. and they brought all this in 12 episodes, and it doesn't feel rushed at all. For this, they at least deserve an 8.\n\n[Art] 9/10 [Sound] 9/10\nThe art is great. though the character designs don't really stand out, the environment and atmosphere do. The background of the city they live in, Mitakihara city, gives a futuristic look to it, but doesn't go too far in the future. and the Highlight of it all, The Labyrinths of the Witches. Each Labyrinth has a specific and unique style. From a child's scribbles, silhouettes, and Almost realistic like background, the labyrinths bring out the dark and twisted atmosphere of the anime, and it is just outstanding, it's really hard to explain what exactly the backgrounds and the environment is because of it's complexity, but as expected from SHAFT, the company that animated this, it is something that really stands out.\nThe sound is outstanding. there's background music most of the time, and it really brings out the colors of the scenes. From happy - transformation sequence music, to sad, orchestral backgrounds, it brings out the drama of the show, dramatic enough to become a sad classical orchestra piece.\nThe Opening theme song shows your typical Mahou Shoujo, however, the Ending theme foreshadows a darker plot.\nThe voice acting is good, on the most part, they fit the character's personality, but my personal favorite is Homura Akemi's voice actor, since it really fits her part the best.\n[Enjoyment and Overall] 10/10\nOverall, i enjoyed watching this series, i didn't expect much, but i got more than i wanted. I cried, i despaired, i felt happy, i felt very sad. This is a great show, just put all prejudice aside, and you surely won't regret it.\n        "},

I've heard many things about it. How its visual style is beautiful, how it subverts expectations, how its dark and brooding. I still put it off though. I was either busy with life or simply busy with other television.\nI've finally watched it. All twelve episodes. \n...\n\nI'll be splitting this review into two parts. The bulk, which will include every piece of information you may want to know about the show. Including my thoughts on the animation, the characters, the sound, the style,\n          \n        and the entire piece as a whole. \nThen, much like this show, i'll attach a worthless piece of pandering, dishonest bullshit and call that a conclusion. \n______________________________________\n[PART 1] : Bulk \n\nAfter the first few episodes, Madoka had me hooked. It did something that I feel a lot of television is scared to do. It deconstructed a genre in a dramatic sense, rather than a parody sense. \n________________________________________\n[PAUSE]\nBefore I continue, the buzzword button just sounded and I want to clarify a few things. Doing a deconstruction isn't something that should be inherently praised. It is simply a descriptive term used to describe something. It doesn't make something good or bad. Madoka is most definitely a deconstruction, by showing a darker and more realistic side to a genre that has a lot of bright and up-beat shit in it. That being said, it's not the first show to do this and it won't be the last. \nPlease stop using the term as something that it's not. Praise. Although I will continue this review by praising Madoka as a show that does do deconstruction well. \n_____________________________________\nDeconstruction is an every growing idea in television. You take a cliche-ridden genre and you ring out every drop of cliche from it, you enhance said cliche's and you make a parody. Western shows like Community and Rick and Morty do this incredibly well. Out of the anime i've seen, Monogatari, specifically Bakemonogatari, serves as a deconstruction of romantic comedies and Harem shows. \nAll these shows deconstruct a certain genre and make it something to laugh at. They do this while constantly being meta and lampooning the situation. But most importantly, the comment on the situation and resolve it in an uncliche manner. There is nothing that pisses me off as much as a show commenting on a cliche but simply continuing to do it. \nWhat Madoka does, however, is go the other route. The harder route. The route where comedy won't enhance anything. They attempted to do a dramatic deconstruction. Which by its nature is something I think is more challenging. \nWhen you do a dramatic deconstruction you can no longer \"overblow\" something to make it stick out. You can't wink at the camera knowingly. You can't purposefully include said cliche. No. You have to unravel what it means to be that genre in a serious way.\n...\nThis is what Madoka does with Magical Girl anime. A magical girl anime is more of subgenre, but regardless, its still rife for deconstruction. Madoka does this by placing us in a world that we have seen before, characters we've seen before, a situation we MAY have seen before... and then turning it upside down. \nI'm avoiding spoilers, but needless to say, this show has \"psychological\", and \"thriller\" in its \"Genres\" section for a reason. Its dark. Very dark. \nBy taking a genre that is by nature (and name) something that sounds more childish and breezy and putting it under the microscope of realism, pessimistic realism, at that Madoka causes every action to have a reaction and that reaction is almost always negative. \nIt shows the bad sides of something whimsical. It does this with a totally straight face. It also does this spectacularly. \nThis is dramatic genre deconstruction at its complete finest. Every element is there, every theme, every idea. Its there to create something that feels as though you are being torn apart, much like these characters are. \nThey change, contort, and bend. Its horrifying. Its exactly what I wanted from a dramatic deconstruction. Even the cliche \"Magical Girl transformations\" are juxtaposed by the situations these characters are in. Broken cities, petrifying mazes, sickeningly distorted locations. \n...\n\nThis is where Shaft as a studio shines. I've only seen two Shaft shows, the Monogatari series and now Madoka. Each show Shaft is superb. The animation is impactful, vibrant, stylistic, and beautiful.\nEvery aspect is eye-grabbing. Especially the unique worlds that every antagonist in the show brings these characters through. I loved every disturbing second of pervasive animation being taken to the extreme. It was glorious. \nWith that, an emphasis on movement and impact was drawn by the animators. Every attack was meant to feel powerful. The lack of still images that are so often seen in Shounen-action anime was also pleasant. The amount of effort shaft put into the visuals is nothing short of jaw-dropping. \nThis show was exquisite. It was damn near at a 10/10 for art if it wasn't for the generic exposition sequences that were included occasionally. \n...\nThe music was spectacular too. The reoccurring backing tracks in the show were amongst the best I've ever heard. Sweeping orchestral, bad ass guitar riffs, melancholy violin. Instead of detracting from scenes by being incorporated so often, they ended up improving them.\nThe soundtrack was the best I've heard in anime. It tied perfectly with every emotion being felt in every scene.\nThe only thing that I never quite enjoyed was the intro, which although had some nice theme-tying visuals to it, didn't really ever sound all too great to me. \n...\n\nThe characters were also well done. Each one started as a genre trope and slowly sprouted into something a bit more meaningful. Especially Sayaka, with VA Eri Kitamura giving a powerful performance. \nEach character started off one way and ended another. Or so I was lead to believe until the end of the show... which i'll get into soon. The entire thing unfolded in a remarkable manner. The writing for each character was tight. \nBecause this show was shorter, with only twelve episodes to tell this story, it used every scene to its most. That's what perhaps had me so invested. No scene felt like it was there to fill time. I never felt like this show dragged something out.\nIt was quick, and by episode three the shit really did hit the fan. \n...\n\nSo why exactly is this show a 7? To tell you the truth, it wasn't going to be. Writing this review has been heartbreaking to me. Its actually been physically difficult to put these words on page... or on... internet - page. I'm lingering, maybe rambling in some areas, but I do have to address the twenty-five minute elephant in the room at some point. \nThe ending. \nLet me put it this way. Up until the twelfth episode of the show, this was the best anime i've ever seen... probably. Monogatari is currently at that top spot and who knows what my thoughts will be after that finishes. But the amount I truly adored this show was staggering. I was captivated by every breath of stylistic glory it breathed on me. The dark, fucked up environment was perfect. The psychological elements were well done.\nThe theme of the show was so well thought out and incorporated. The idea of 'Regret' being the driving factor of this shows dramatic deconstruction was amazing. Who thought that regret would be the theme for a magical girl show?! \nIt was so good I was debating on whether or not to give it a coveted 9.5/10, something I reserve for only some of the greatest television. It was literally almost pitch perfect. It could've gotten the score if the ending was absolutely jaw-dropping. If not, it would have settled at a still spectacular 9/10. However, it didn't do either. \n...\n\nSo why is this show sitting at a 7.0? Why am I so sad? Well, it all had to do with the ending. \nI have never. Ever. Seen a show collapse on itself as badly as Madoka had. It was almost an astounding collapse. It was as if the biggest mountain in the world suddenly imploded on itself. No. It was as if the tallest mountain the world was never there. As if it was a lie. As if every piece of historic and visual proof that a mountain is there was just a lie and what really lay in the mountains wake was just a hot steaming pile of shit. \nThat's how bad it was. Every thematic element, every driving force of the show. Every piece of storytelling was ruined. The ending was so bad, so nonsensical, that it quite literally ruined a show. \nThis show was short, but long enough to make a total impact on me as a viewer. It made me love it so quick. So it only goes to show how hard the writers worked to ruin the entire thing. \nIts as if the writing staff did a complete 180 on every thematic element of the show and decided that they'd be better off turning it into an ACTUAL magical girl show, rather than a deconstruction. \nI don't want to ramble more about this, but let me just say that the ending was so disappointing in virtually every way... I can't see myself recommending this show to anyone. \nWhile it is still at a 7 because i believe everything before that twelfth episode is damn near a masterpiece, the twelfth and final episode is horrific. Its one of the most disappointing pieces of film making I've ever laid my eyes on. \nThat's not because the actual storytelling was 1/10 bad, no. Although it was pretty bad. It was because the entire point of the show was lost. The entire structure was disintegrated. It left me hollow inside after I saw the credits roll. But because of the short yet phenomenal experience I had watching this show for the first two nights, I'll be as nice as I can. \n_________________________________\n[CONCLUSION] \n\nMuch like this show, I'll end this with a dishonest and fake statement. The mountain was never there. The climb never happened. The concept was always false. The story was always the same. The characters were never compelling. The idea never formed. \n...\n\nIf you enjoy anime, watch the show. The first eleven episodes are a marvel. When the time comes to watch the finale, however, close your eyes and wish for something real. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica is not your standart magical girl show, but you probaby already know that because \"Not your typical magical girl show\" is the most oftenly used phrase to describe this anime. Still it is true nonetheless.\nThe show is a rather unusual and dramatic twist on an everyday magical girl show. The main word being dramatic. There are fights, transformations and monsters but the thing this show dedicates most attention to is drama. A well written and for the most part beautifly executed drama. The show takes a huge advantage of the protagonists being 14 or so year old girls to explore the psychology of\n          \n        teens and how they can balance and swiftly change between bright hope and endless despair. I can boldly call this anime a master of controlling and manipulating the mood, atmosphere and the undertones to it's advantage to make you feel just what the show wants you to feel. Rarely I have seen the show knowing just what buttons to push and when to tell an deep, adult and intruiging story.\nAnother word that I would use to describe the story would be gripping. Now people throw that word to left and right like it is nothing and I don't think we should treat it that way. I have seen many good and interesting anime shows which were not neccerely gripping. Madoka Magica is really what I can call a gripping show. The episodes flow into each other flawlessly and always make you want to watch more without using the cheap tactics like awful cliffhangers at the end of the episode which did not really bring anything cool in the following episode but were impemented only for you to turn on the next epsode.\nThe reasons for being that gripping is that the pacing of the show is near flawless after the first 2 episodes. As I said the story flows with no filler and no time spent on unneccery things. The dialoges are well written and the voice actors did an outstanding job. \nThe show also had a memorable soundtrack with nice opening and amazing ending. And that says a lot because I mostly skip my endings even if the song is not bad. The reason that the ending stands out is not only because of the song (Which is wonderful) but because of the way it was implemented and how the last scenes smoothly flow into the said ending. The original soundtrack itself always helps create a special mood and is subtle when needed and energyzing when the scene demands it.\nThe animation of the show is superb. There are not as many fight scenes as one would hope but they are all animated and stylized in a great fashion. The style change when the protagonists fight witches is imaginative and always cool to look at. Still this anime often reuses the same shots of character animations especially in dialoge. It is more apperent in the second half of the show. Still it looks more like a directing technique than the means to save some budget.\n\nFrom here the review enters the spoiler section because to explain the things I did not like about the show I need to get more in depth into the story. If you have not watched this anime I urge you to do so and I also urge you to avoid any and all spoilers concerning it because it can really ruin the whole experience for you.\nNow it is time to discuss the things I did not like about the show and really all of them come from the last 4 or so episodes. To tell the truth the frist 8 episodes are near flawless and are a 9 or 10 out of 10 material. I can't say the same thing about the rest of the show. It was still rather good but not as good as what preceeded it at least in my opinion.\nI will start with a small nitpick which is the thing I personaly find a bit silly. The fact that the universe runs on the energy which is collected by aliens by giving young girls powers to turn into magical girls and then gather even more energy from their despair as they turn into witched is a bit silly to me. Yes it is a magical girls show and this kind of thing does not seem that much of a silly concept for the genre but this show had a completely different tone. Still it may just be me.\nThe real problems I have with this show started with the show introducing us to the information that one of the protagonists is a time traveler and that she has relieved this events many time already to try to get the different outcome but she always failed and went back in time to relieve these events again to try to fix things and make the outcome different. First of all it is rather dumb that she has the powers of complete time travel but only travels to a single perioud of time. I think anyone would think of going back a little further than a few weeks to try to fix things after you have failed numerious times. The anime did not set any limitations on her powers so it is not like she can travel only to that set time a few weeks ago. Often she failed only because the events she tried to stop from happenening already started happening at that time she returned to. You would think she had enough brians to go a bit further into the past.\nThe fact that the whole show till the end was just another timeline she traveled really and I mean REALLY undermined the events that happened before we were introduced to this twist. I mean why should I care if I knew that she could and did come back in time so that the events happened in a different way? The first part of the show starts feeling rather unimportant even though it was much better than the last few episodes.\nThe other problem I have is the ending. I was left unsatisfied with it and it produced close to no impact on me. It leaves many questions and answeres close to none of them. The protagonist becomes a sort of \"God\" and just waves her hand to fix everything and make everything good...well at least it would be good if she actually thought the wish through. While better, what she wished for was not really a good solution to the problem.\nAlso one thing. The collosal potential of the main protagonist is explained as following. The more impact the magical girl has on the fate of the world and ETC the more powerful she becomes. But following that logic the time traveling protagonist should wield far greater power. She has the power to travel through time and basicly holds the fate of the unverse in her hands to some extent and it is only because of her obsession that  the main protagonist has this much of an impact of the fate of the universe. In reality the timetraveler is the one who has a much bigger impact. I mean the universe has repeated the same few weeks a dozzen times just because she wanted to save her friend.\nStill all of that issues may not bug you at the end of the day, but they did bug me.\n\nTo tell the truth overall I stil highly enjoyed the show, especially the first 8 or so episdoes. I can't be mad at this show beacuse in it's first half alone it accomplished more than a huge chunk of shows do in their long 26 or more episode run. The ending was not straight up horrible. Even though the idea was rather dumb in my opinion, it was executed very well. I still HIGHLY reccomend this show to anybody and urge you all to watch it.\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Where to even begin with this show. \nI suppose I can start by saying, while I'd been a casual anime fan for years, Madoka Magica was what really got me into it. Since then, I've especially had a thing for anime that fucks with your expectations. Which is exactly what Madoka Magica does, and it does it amazingly. \nMadoka Magica is what I've heard many people call a 'quote on quote' \"Deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre. To put shortly, this means it takes common magical girl tropes, takes them, and twists and distorts them until it's something completely different. But you can certainly see\n          \n        where it keeps it's original roots. \nThe characters are all believable, realistic, and you can really feel for them. ( But seriously... fuck Kyousuke.. fuck music boy.. that is all.) That guy aside though, I really couldn't bring myself to legit hate any of the other major characters. They're all amazing. (Especially Homura... but apparently that's an unpopular opinion, a lot of people seem to love Mami, and y'know.. she's pretty awesome too.) \nThe music is absolutely beautiful, I'd like to especially point to Sayaka Miki's theme song \"Decretum\" as being one of the single most amazing songs to come of any soundtrack, period. And the animation, lord.. It's so.. unique. And I try to say this with no spoilers, but lets say you'll know exactly what I mean once you see the witches lairs.. its so.. just.. really good. \nAll in all, I love this anime as it puts an extremely creative, and actually really dark and serious spin on the magical girl genre. Others have done this too, for example, Yuki Yuna is a hero, or the criminally underrated Magical Girl Rising Project. But even so, none do it quite like Madoka. Madoka with it's lovable and interesting characters, dark nature, compelling plot, beautiful art and soundtrack... \nI can say with confidence, that as it stands now, is my favorite anime. Especially after watching the movie: Rebellion. \nAnd while I understand it may not be everyone's cup of tea. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something new.  \n10/10\n(P.s Beware of the feels)\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I was hesitant to write this review. While my stance on this series is well known amongst friends and family, I was hesitant to actually step up and make a public statement on the reasons WHY I rate this like I do.\nLet us break this down.\nStory: 10/10\nThe story feels like your generic Magical Girl series at the onset. Cute cat-like creature wants to make a contract with one (or more) 'everygirls' in order to have them fight against a grand evil. There is your token main character, her friends that do know about this world of magical girls and those who do not, your typical\n          \n        dark magical girl, pretty gems that the females use to channel their abilities, the girls occasionally butting heads over how to go after the evil enemy, and this side-lifestyle beginning to show its' negative effect on the main character's normal daily life.\nThe similarities slowly drop away from there. Death, which is occasionally addressed in other Mahou Shoujo series, is more then just a kick in the teeth to make the viewer pay attention and give the show a 'raised stakes' feel. Here, Death is treated as the traumatic situation it truly is, especially to a cast of 14-16 year olds. The effects of seeing a fellow companion die weighs heavily on the main cast, and rather then the characters just 'moving on' with their lives, they never do recover. The series analyzes how such an evil can come about, rather then just presenting it as a long-present force that wishes to wipe out the world from behind it's giant chair beneath the earth. It looks at the effects that power gained by strange means has, such as the effect on relationships with others. And these are just some of the topics, all of them weaved cleanly into the story, flowing marvelously. As one situation comes up and is dealt with, another one rises up from the ashes of that, each piece bringing the 'answer' of the previous problem to it's logical conclusion. \nIn short, it is a complex plot and story line, but it never gets too deep.\n(Note: Despite all of this, I hesitate to call this a deconstruction, as in nature PMMM fits the definition of a Darker and Edgier take on the Magical Girl franchise. Most of those elements which are deconstructed in here have already been done in many other Magical Girl shows, such as Lyrical Nanoha.)\nArt: 10/10\nWhile the original TV airing was a bit on the bland and empty side, you'll typically just end up watching the DVD/Blu-Ray releases of the series, where the animation teams went back and added to the scenes, along with spicing everything up. It shows. The Art is scary when needed, and beautiful when need also. It pulls this off by actually showcasing two different art styles, both being vividly different from the other. Yet on either side of this contrast, everything is literal eye candy. Your eyes will never bore. The foreground is just as pumped as the background with things, but neither is so obtuse that it breaks immersion.\nPersonally, I don't worry to much about the artwork and artstyle in a series, as my only real request is that the art reflects the mindset of the main character(s). PMMM does this with flying colors, using two alternate styles of presentation, the first being 'cute' but never feeling quite right, representing the start of the series and the character(s)' mindset, while the later is plain 'wrong' and does a great job showcasing everything that is wrong with the situations it is used in.\nFurthermore, the more observant viewer (or the viewer re-watching the series) will notice many things hidden within both styles of artwork. The foreshadowing is cleverly placed in every episode, but it is never so extreme as to give away the entire plot.\nSound: 10/10\nEvery piece of music does the job it is set out to do. If the situation is somber, the music either shuts off completely or sets off to mimic the somber nature. In the middle of the fight scene, the beats are well timed to compliment the flow of the battle, rather it be swift and quick, or harsh and violent. The background noises never clash or take away, only add. The voice acting in both the Japanese and English dubs are marvelous. Many other series have issues with one or the other, but upon rewatching both several times, I will say that both were an example of voice actresses and actors putting their best feet forwards each time they came to the mic.\nCharacter: 10/10\nA good story goes nowhere with a bland cast. A bad story can be salvaged by a good cast. This, however, is a case of a smooth, flowing story being complimented by a well written group of characters, both primary and supporting.\nAbove, I made mention as to the flow of the story. This flow is aided by the characters. While the titular character is Madoka Kaname, the focus of the story shifts along with the situation at hand, often using Madoka herself as the tool for the perspective shift, but never neglecting her even when another Magical Girl is the topic.\nAll of the cast are also quite active for the majority of the show. The very few times that character(s) do not jump to advance the plot, they have reasons, and the reasons they state are actually reasons that anyone with a more mature mindset wold be able to resonate with. Each magical girl has her own trove of troubled pasts and dark secrets, and even toward the end of the series the cast expands the lore behind them and alongside the world around them.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nThis is a really subjective section. Those who love tragedy or bittersweetness will likely be roped in quickly. On the other hand, the intense darkness of the series, which overshadows nearly everything else in the final four episodes does clash with the lighter sections of the first few episodes. The transition is smooth and never terribly over dramatic, but the end result of the overall atmosphere could very easily turn off viewers that are more familiar with lighter and softer series such as the Classic Sailor Moon or Pretty Cure. Personally, I would say that due to the smooth transition and emotional investment, the enjoyment and satisfaction of watching and completing this never abates.\nWatching a collection of characters interact also adds to the enjoyment. Along the likes of Lyrical Nanoha or Sailor Moon, the primary characters interact with each other in a variety of situations, and they all bounce off of eachother in a natural way. Even if the story itself is a turn off due to the extreme darkness in the closing stages, the characters themselves make it worth watching.\nOverall: 10/10\n'Outstanding' is the term used by this site for 10/10 ratings, and I have to fully agree. PMMM does what many other series do, and runs with it without stumbling over any hurdles, major or minor. On the emotional level, intellectual level, and the 'pure-entertainment' level, you will always be interacted with and treated to a wonderful and terrifying work.\nPersonally, I can not stop recommending this series to anyone, regardless of their stance on the Magical Girl genre or on Deconstruction/Dark series. And without exception, everyone I have recommend this series to was quickly pulled in, and found the same investment and love for it that I did.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Personally, I expected a lot for this anime. There had been a lot of hype and good reviews, not to mention the high rating. However, I did not enjoy the anime as much as I thought I would.\nI usually expect an anime to draw you in as soon as you watch it, such as; Tokyo Ghoul, Black Butler, Assassination Classroom etc. which are rated similar to Puella Magi Madoka Magic. This anime did not have a dramatic or increasing build-up, after watching 3-4 episodes the anime still had no build-up whatsoever. Usually a short anime, such as this one, would develop their build-up earlier on\n          \n        in the episodes.\nPersonally, I did not like the characters. Madoka, really annoyed me, of course I understand that she's just a character and that the director made it so that she does certain things just to support the plot, but I found it ridiculous that \"she\" continued to involve herself with witches and magical girl even after knowing all the trouble they go through. Because I didn't like the characters, I think this is the main reason why I didn't carry on the anime.\nThe art for the anime is very unique and I liked this aspect of the anime. I wasn't so keen on the design of the characters but the art for the world was interesting.\nOverall I rate this anime a 6/10 because after comparing each aspect to the other I wasn't either excited or unhappy with this anime, though I was disappointed after hearing all the hype. However as I haven't completed this anime, i can not entirely judge this anime and this is my opinion as of now. Unfortunately I will be dropping this anime but don't let my review discourage you from watching this anime :]\nI hope that this review was helpful and informative, this is my first review so hopefully I will be able to pick up more ways to make my reviews better.\nPs. This is my opinion only so you neither have to agree or disagree, thank you.\n-Tay"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I'll be realistic some seconds, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is not the best series I've seen. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is also not even the best anime I've seen. And yet, among all these other series, as excellent as they are, it is Madoka brought me the most, not just as a spectator but as a person in general. This anime made me dive several times a madness, a continuous spiral of depression whose visual violence is only a reflection outside. Madoka acted on my inside and it showed on the outside.\nToday, when I look at the first seconds of introduction I see how the\n          \n        animated point is already extremely thoughtful. A curtain opens slowly with a jerky animation, and share more than a cinema, which will be suggested in the third movie, the series is defined by the theater and especially the puppet theater. We are faced with a stage on which will enchainer images with strong connotations, subtle planes where joy will give way to melancholy and melancholy to madness and horror. When I said puppet theater I mean it for several reasons: \nFirst everything is imbued with history of manipulation in Madoka. The characters are just empty puppets living because they desired to live in a precise moment, then little by little they cut the ropes that attach to the cross brace and they fall before crashing violently on the floor starting to shreds. And like the characters, the viewer too is handled, the writer plays with him and play with him before making him understand that his thinking was perhaps futile or meaningless.\nFinally in this series, the viewer never takes the reins of the story, it can only be guided by the topics discussed and highlighted.\nMany times I read that Madoka was mostly a series that told the transition to adulthood, when the young person has to wake up and take heavy sense decisions that will surely have an impact on all its life. I had this idea in mind for a long time on the series but it seemed that it was only a tiny part of what was said. The anime talking about much deeper and internal rivalry, desire against reality, perseverance against cowardice, finally ... The daily struggles that may seem superfluous but are not.\nMadoka take against the foot the magical-girl side in this point: there is sufficient desire to be or become a reality? Take Magical Doremi or Sakura for example, the characters exist and revel in their world as they arrive to satisfy this kind of desire they expressed when they wanted to be a magical girl. I help people, the world is better, I do good. There is sometimes some questioning but rarely do we go further than just a matter of one or two episodes. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica does not hear it this way: what if all these actions were ultimately futile? In the anime it is not because they help people that the world is better at the end of the episode, there is instead an unknown force that makes the bleak picture, a purpose is known, and they know, disastrous and inevitable. They can help the world, save the same, it will not prevent the fate of committing its horrors. Destiny is a very strong component of the whole story elsewhere. The characters are linked to this horrible fate that makes them. \nIt was only in the third movie that we will open the door to another possibility, not necessarily as fun.\nIt's there for me this animated draws its strength, I am a pretty fatalistic person in the background, my philosophy, as light as it is, suggests that everything is written for us, changes we can make in our life are minor and the overall impact of our actions will be erased with time. The series clearly strengthened me in this way of thinking to the end where it offers me an alternative. But a heavy alternative and potentially destructive for me and for others. \nWhat is interesting is that ultimately no one is saved or free in Madoka, we survive in this universe and that idea is important because it is the basis of the story. To anchor the story in a serious and violent context it should not be a significant loophole, just a dilute hope ounce. The very structure of the anime is based on it. The anime is an emotional roller-coaster which always ensures that the light at the end of the tunnel is unreachable. Like the ideology invented by the characters, is cut away over the episodes, the viewer have his moral down because ultimately these girls wanted only one thing: to help and spread the good around them. But to do this they have to accomplish it brutally. Again in the magical-girl you often see rays magic, incantations made by the characters in order to launch their fate. Except for huge finish, this is never the case in Madoka, girls must take charge of their swords or weapons to destroy the threat, and so in that sense they are no longer the guardians nice but somehow , warriors of humanity.\nAnd this is a point that I find extremely important in this idea of desire and reality, since ultimately they either end up accepting this kind of brutality that runs through them or they give almost death. When I am told that the death Sayaka is caused by his disappointment in love I do not agree, it suffers because the image she had made of his power and his influence on his person was false. Blinded by a reality she had created, she finally sink while taking into account the violence of his actions, I want to show this fight devoid of color against Elsa Maria at the end of episode 7, what separates the magical-girl of his enemy? Nothing, there is a visual cue to action necessary, for the rest we see two characters to fight, not a nice and not a bad guy. \nI find it very clever idea of alternative world for witches because in my eyes they are just crushed ideals. Worlds that girls become witches, were created when they wanted to have a power, their Garden of Eden. Eventually their passion, or desire, does not correspond to reality and they have failed to psychologically overcome these two criteria. Attached to memories, these worlds also leave room for reflection of the viewer, if Sayaka has devised a musical world that was in connection with a vivid memory or a certain goal. What was the purpose or the vivid memory of those other girls died at the task? This is also why I love this anime with this is that there is always a place left for reflection.\nThe design of the witches are pretty awesome too, Sayaka became siren with a warrior mask as she's plunged into madness and was of unspeakable brutality. When I say dive into the madness that's not for the simple purpose of metaphor, it's true. Look in the animated scenes from the time Sayaka learns the nature of the soul-gem and begins to fall in depression, we see ever more in the daylight, it is still covered with a dark side then the night seizes her gradually to devour. This kind of setting subtle but striking scene when you know the anime finally sees everywhere.\nAnd the realization full of ideas like this that in addition to perfectly support the remarks, gives absolutely beautiful scenes. To stay on Sayaka, when Kyubei extract the soul-gem of his body was entitled to a fabulous plan. Or the part about the past of Kyoko where we see an apple, the forbidden fruit that she will eat to save his family before realizing his mistake, all in an absolutely superb graphic style. \nMadoka is an extremely rich visually animate, he enjoys great discoveries at both the symbolic and in terms of aesthetics and the unique atmosphere generally given to achieving makes all the more endearing. ... Or there's this beautiful shot where Sayaka is slowly gnaw through the darkness and ... ok ok I'll stop.\nFurthermore the chara-design, greatly inspired Hidamari Sketch, fits perfectly with this story because it is out of step with what one is entitled to expect with such remarks. This reinforces the general standard of the work because watch all these cute girls kill monsters species on legs or slug it out, just that it is a broken code classical magical-girl is completely unexpected from. \nOf course the series is not flawless, some transitions are too fast, some tricks are used somewhat crudely at times but I think the overall quality of writing and how has led the scenario erases all imperfections. Because if you have seen Madoke only one time, you miss the little write nugget who's this anime. At the second reading it is ultimately the character of Homura, who initially was just too dark character who speaks only evasively that shines. Once her fate and her story told, we understand the subtlety of her lines of dialogues and the result is a much less superficial character than we think. \nIt must also finally acknowledge the tremendous work of Yuki Kajiura for the soundtrack which in addition to changing its register for the first time in years, she remains my favorite composer, built a ost which forms a whole. Some pieces are used for battle and reused for a tragic scene behind. These are not musical compositions whose aim is basic but defined a set that goes along with the images. Many pieces are reminiscent of Mozart's Requiem, obvious choice compared to the range of topics but is not happy about that, she mixes of instruments which at first glance do not have a place like the flute that seems too light for accompany the images. Although choirs, strings and piano remain dominant it will not use them very gross manner but instead will serve as counterpoint or so will not hesitate to make them disappear and then reappear instruments, whose meaning is obvious, within the same song. Moreover if some music is highly charged, others are much simpler, as the Ave Maria, and help keep balance and fluidity in the genre that I have found nowhere else.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is in my eyes a pure rough diamond whose beauty continues to amaze me even after more than a dozen viewings. Once started, I can never stop it would only go to rehydrate me. I do not hold this lively for a particular reason as the end of Cowboy Bebop or cool side and then as Gurren Lagann and epic side, no I remember Madoka as a whole, an indivisible whole which has made me live an intense adventure and wonderful. It would be stupid to say I am almost in tears when I think back to certain scenes or while chills run down my spine when I hear a few notes of the soundtrack as at the time of the criticism would be designed to tell you that I love Madoka and this is probably the work I love most in the world.\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    The first thing you need to know about Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is that it is not as revolutionary as it wants you to think it is. Dark magical girl shows have been done before--Princess Tutu delved into some pretty heavy stuff, and Revolutionary Girl Utena (if you can even call it mahou shoujo) went...well, deeper. Action magical girl shows have been done before, Nanoha's probably the prime candidate for magical girl shootouts, but practically every popular magical girl show since Sailor Moon's been about throwing around magic for peace and justice. Even looking outside the mahou shoujo field, at deconstructions that throw young kids\n          \n        into terrifying situations, Narutaru and Bokurano had it down a long time ago, graphic evisceration and everything.\nSo then, what makes Madoka Magica special, you might ask? The answer is a little tricky to define. It's not so much about the gripping story, the brilliant art direction or the incredible music as it is all these elements working together as one coherent entity. If the viewer wasn't so caught up in the plot, he wouldn't miss the visual shortcuts. If he wasn't awed and frightened by the witch battles, he would see the rough patches where ambition perhaps outstrips technique. And in patches where the visuals are almost too quirky or the story going on weird faux-scientific tangents about entropy, Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack saves the day and distracts the listener just long enough to get back to the good stuff.\nBut make no mistake--despite Akiyuki Shinbo's recognizable touch, this is Gen Urobuchi's piece, through and through. Considering Shinbo's other work, which have been almost totally overwhelmed every time by his own unique aesthetic, this is kind of a miracle.  When the gloves come off in episode three and one of the magical girls is decapitated, directly followed by the brilliant hard-rocking ending, designed to make anime nerds shell out money for Madoka Magica Bluray disks. That's a statement of intent, right there.\nThis is where Madoka Magica outdoes just about every show in 2011, its insane ambition. You see, Madoka Magica is not a show about magical girls. It is a show about the magical girl system, and the handful of poor scared girls thrown into its midst. It is a show where the scope of the horror increases every episode, and the true villain is always in doubt. The scariest thing of all is that the true villain may be the rules of the universe themselves. I mean, if you've seen the show, I know you laughed through Kyubey's entropy speech, but think about it for a second. What happened there was that the show contextualized itself yet again, as it does over and over again throughout the show. What starts out as a slightly twisted show about girls fighting Lovecraft horrors quickly becomes the struggles of under-prepared young people against the universe itself. You might be able to fight witches, asks Madoka Magica. But can you fight gravity?\nComplementing the deranged scope of the story is the fact that the folks over at SHAFT are in no way interested in padding the story with filler, like Sailor Moon or even Cardcaptor Sakura (no matter how brilliant the filler was in the latter.) There are no extraneous transformation scenes, no villains-of-the-week, no cut-and-paste enemies. Every witch is a marvel of surreal design, and every magical girl uniform says something about its owner. The fights on display are probably some of the most kinetic and interesting of any magical girl show ever made. Many would say that the fights are not the focus of magical girl shows, and I'd agree. But it's also true that in each clash with witches , no moments are wasted and no punches are pulled.\nSHAFT couples Madoka Magica with arguably the most restrained use of Shinbo's trademark aesthetic yet. Some might decry his work as being a step below Bakemonogatari in terms of visual creativity. I'd say, though, that while some of his earlier work flirts with visual craziness for the sake of visual craziness, Madoka Magica comes as close as I've ever seen him come to his style actually meaning something. Just the sheer difference between the wide-open spaces and futuristic architecture of the human world coupled with the cluttered paper-cutout world of the magical world conveys more than flashing text across the screen. Even though the latter effects could certainly entertain in his other work. Shinbo's style is coupled with a memorable soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura, which is by turns melancholic, whimsical and terrifying. Then, of course, there's the opening theme, which grows more poignant with each listen; and the ending theme, which is probably one of the greatest ending themes of all time. Magia is Madoka Magica's Cruel Angel Thesis, and it deserves a spot up there in the pantheon with it.\nSo the story aims for greatness, the visuals amaze despite the middling budget, and the music is phenomenal. Why isn't this anime a 10, then? It's probably the best show of 2011 that isn't named \"Wandering Son\", and should be watched by every self-respecting fan of Japanese animation out there.\nOn the other hand, there are two things about Madoka Magica that I can see as significant problems. The first is that it is that, when you come down to it, it doesn't bring anything particularly new to the table, besides maybe Kyubey. The second is that the characters don't hold their weight. Despite the superbly constructed story, despite the art and sound, the characters themselves can be a little dull. Kyubey is brilliant, and makes for one of the best sort-of-antagonists of any anime in the past few years, but as for everybody else: Sakaya's fall of darkness happens too quickly, Mami leaves the picture before she experiences much development, Kyoko's change of heart happens too fast and her decision in episode 9 is frankly ridiculous, and Madoka herself spends most of the series in a tear-ridden stupor. Madoka's family actually succeeds as one of the most convincing representations of family in recent memory, but they ultimately play so little part in the storyline that it is a little frustrating. Madoka's dynamic with her mother was so warm that I expected her to play a larger role, but in the end her role was disappointingly minor. The fact that Madoka actually had a visible family, in contrast to just about every other heroine in the story, was something in itself, but the potential was ultimately squandered for something less interesting.\nHomura, on the other hand, received an entire episode to herself, and ultimately became one of the most sympathetic characters in the show. So maybe I'm undervaluing the cast just a little bit. Compared to a show like Princess Tutu, where the main cast are all uniformly multilateral and tragic, the characters of Madoka Magica are lacking; but on the other hand, given the show's time limit and the scope that it pulls off, it is difficult to see how they could have had time to give everyone more development. More importantly, in contrast to other shows where the characters remain frustratingly static, the cast of Madoka actually go somewhere. Sayaka loses her ideals but holds true to them at the same time, Kyouko puts her life on the line for a friend, Homura learns a lesson about hope and Madoka, at the very end, like Shinji before her, gets on her feet and makes a difference.\n I think it says something that while the amount of development the characters go through isn't enormous, each of the characters in the show are developed just enough to remain sympathetic. They may be archetypes, but they aren't one-dimensional.\nThere's plenty more to say about this show: the Buddhist overtones, the cosmic balance of happiness and despair, whether or not Kyouko and Sakaya were lesbians, the ending itself. But I think it deserves to be said that whatever Madoka Magica's faults, it's something special. \nAlso, what other magical girl show would have the guts to end the way it did? That's not commercial calculation, right there. Anno might have aimed for meaning at the end of Evangelion, and Rahxephon might have tried to synthesize that meaning into something palatable. But I think that Madoka's end, succeeds in dominating both of these shows. Considering Evangelion's weight, that's no mean feat.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Before submitting this I would like you all to note that this review will contain spoilers. I'm am reviewing this assuming you have seen the series or don't care about spoilers, so read with caution. Also, this review will be very long. If you want my opinion without being spoiled, then yes, go watch this anime, I believe it is great. \nSo, this is my first review, so bear with me. I came into Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (MSMM from now on) quite skeptical, as I can imagine many others would be. I never have been the biggest Shaft fan in the world nor the\n          \n        biggest mahou shoujo fan. I decided to pick it up solely for one reason and that was the involvement of Gen Urobuchi as the scriptwriter. Did I regret it? Absolutely not. MMSM has the potential to go on to be the best series released this year, if not one of my favourites of all time. I have allowed the ending to digest and now here I am reviewing it. I cannot stress enough, most of this review comes down to my speculation, and serves not only as a review, but also as an analysis of the series as a whole. Feel free to disagree with any observations I make. \nStory 9/10\nMMSM's story is mostly about subverting the mahou shoujo genre. It does this by subverting, or altering, certain tropes commonly found within mahou shoujo and by allowing the show to have a much darker setting than that normally found within this genre. It also includes both religious and psychological differences. The story stars Madoka, a typical Japanese teenage girl. One day, she has a dream about a girl fighting some giant unseen monster. The girl is clearly outmatched. Madoka then decides to agree to a contract with some little white hairball. At this point Madoka wakes up. When she arrives at school, to her shock she sees the same girl from her dream, named Homura, joining her class as a transfer student. Later in that day, Madoka is with her friend Sayaka when she hears a telepathic call for help. Rushing to the help of the person who called her, she finds the hairball from her dream, named Kyuubey, being attacked by Homura. When she rushes to his help, both she and Sayaka are attacked by a monster, known as a witch. A girl called Mami, a mahou shoujo (or puella magi, depending on whether you use the Japanese or Latin translations for 'Magical Girl') come to their rescue, at which point both are recruited by Kyuubey to become mahou shoujo, in exchange for one wish, in order to fight witches for the remainder of their lives. \nMSMM incorporates religious symbolism and themes from both Buddhism and Christianity. Most notable are the Buddhism references. The ideas of balance play a vital role in what it means to be a mahou shoujo. Though there wish brings happiness, the mahou shoujo's must be burdened by the equal and opposite despair caused by their wish, so that the balance is preserved. It is this which makes becoming a mahou shoujo an unappealing prospect. However, in the beginning, becoming a mahou shoujo seems a rewarding experience. Not only do you get a free wish, borderline a miracle, you also get cool magical powers and you get to help people. However, it quickly becomes apparent that being a mahou shoujo isn't a pleasant prospect. Mami, who's wish is to keep living, is killed by a witch. Sayaka, who's wish is to heal the man she loves, ends up losing him. Kyouko, who's wish is to help his father's preachings, causes him to go mad in anger and murder her entire family when he realises just what she has done. These buddhist ideals of balance and karma play a vital role in just what it means to become a mahou shoujo and are also relevant to the plot. Ultimately, each and every mahou shoujo must pay the inevitable price of their wishes and all the lives they have saved, by becoming witches themselves in order to spread this despair, while the creation of witches helps to starve off the heat death of the universe. \nChristian references also play a part in MSMM, but only towards the end of the show and in the conclusion. In the climax of the show, Madoka becomes a mahou shoujo and her wish is to stop the creation of wishes entirely. Ultimately, she uses her own immense power, rather than that of Kyuubey's to take the despair of each and every mahou shoujo so they don't become witches and just die. This ties in with the Buddhism references mentioned earlier, as Madoka now has to burden the taint and despair of every mahou shoujo that has ever existed. However, in turn she effectively becomes a deity. Her very existence is erased, as if she had never been born and everybody forgets about her (save for one character... and possibly more depending on how you are willing to speculate on the ending). What prominent Christian figure do we know of who 'died' and was reborn as God? These symbols are further prominent by the fact that Kyuubey throughout the series tells Madoka that she has the ability to become as powerful as a God. As a result, those who had died throughout the course of the series are reborn. Witches no longer exist but instead are replaced by demons, hinted at being born from the darkness in the world, or possibly anomalies from the taint Madoka is forced to bear. In this world, mahou shoujo are forced to fight these demons. These demons drop 'grief cubes' instead of the grief seeds dropped by witches, which are harvest by the Incubators in order to continue to starve off the heat death of the universe. In this world, Homura's ability has changed, she now wields a bow, similar to Madoka and we see her with Angel like wings as she descends to fight the demons. From what I have speculated, Madoka has taken the Christian perspective of a God. That is, an omnipotent deity who has altered the laws of the universe. Homura, being confirmed as the only one who remembers the world as it was, is Madoka's Angel. Her wish, which was originally to protect Madoka, has become null and void, and as a result she fights for the protection of the world. She has been given power by God (Madoka's bow) in order to protect the world Madoka so desperately wanted to save, inheriting Madoka (or God's) will. This explains the brief glimpse of wings we see behind Homura. \nI believe that psychological references are also present in this series. Mahou Shoujo are picked as they 'enter their second growth phase' as Kyuubey calls it. In other words, puberty. Puberty is a stressing time for all who go through it. For many teenagers it leads to depression. For each of the Mahou Shoujo, they go through a similar phase which can be mirrored in real life (without the magical powers, fighting of supernatural beings and inevitable outcome of becoming a witch, of course). Each of them become Mahou Shoujo around the age of puberty and each of them become emotionally depressed due to the burden of despair that they must carry. This can be paralleled with the growing into an adult that each and everyone of us have, or will, experience. What happens to the Mahou Shoujo (ignoring the supernatural stuff), starting off proud, on top of the world, and then falling into depression, can be mirrored almost accurately with teenagers in our world. Proud of our changes, becoming adults, something we look forward to, and then due to hormonal issues, becoming depressed, unhappy and surly teenagers. \nMSMM suffers from what I call, the curse of the one cour. This seems to effect a lot of anime that are 11 - 13 episodes long. MSMM has pacing issues. For example, Sayaka's descent into darkness takes up one entire third of the anime, yet it still feels rushed, incomplete and too a point, forced. In my opinion, MSMM would definitely benefit from an addition 2 to 5 episodes, but then again, nothing can be perfect. \nMSMM has references to other popular sources, most notably Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a novel which tells the story of a man who makes a deal with the Devil who later comes to regret it (similar to how the girls make a deal with Kyuubey, who also later come to regret it). I could tell you about all the Faust references throughout the show, but it's much more fun to let you find them yourself. I'm sure there's a few I've missed out on as well. \nArt: 8/10\nI am by no means the biggest Shaft fan when it comes to art. The stereotypical Shaft headtilts are present in abundance, faces are abnormally wide and the girls come across as very 'moe'. \nHowever, this doesn't mean the art style in general is bad. Not by a long shot. In fact, in a lot of ways, it is very cleverly used. For example, colour is an important part of the mahou shoujo genre, particularly bright colours, yellows, pinks, blues, normally associated with specific characters. MSMM is no exception, but it goes about it in a clever way to show that it is different from your typical mahou shoujo. Though the characters still have specific colours to them (Sayaka - Blue, Madoka - Pink, Mami - Yellow) these colours are presented in more subdued shades instead of bright colours. A clever way to help the series blend in with the darker pallet of the scenery as well as being faithful to the mahou shoujo genre while subverting it at the same time. \nAnother example of the art style being used cleverly is in the town where they live. This town is pristine and almost bland, with tall towers and classrooms made of glass. Everything is organised. These contrast very heavily within the world of the witches barriers, where everything is abstract and different. This makes our first foray into a witches barrier disorientating and makes every subsequent visit a surprise and as a result, we almost look forward to seeing what the next barrier will look like. \nAlso, just for giggles, pick two episodes at random and watch the openings side by side. See what changes you can pick out as the show progresses. \n Sound: 10/10\nWhat can I say, the music in MSMM is fantastic. The themes for each of the characters are incredible, the opening is deliciously deceptive (in order to trick us into what sort of show we are watching) and the ending is dark and dreary (held off intentionally from beginning until episode three).\nCharacter: 10/10 \nTime for another long section. I'm going to break this up into each of the main cast: Madoka, Homura, Sayaka, Mami, Kyouko and Kyuubey. \nMadoka-\nMadoka is an example of the subversion of the genre that MMSM fulfills. In the mahou shoujo genre, the main character takes the center stage. Her powers are often exceptional and she often saves the day. As a result, many of the supporting cast can be shadowed by her. Madoka is different. Infact, we don't actually see Madoka as a magical girl until episode 10, and even then it's in an alternate timeline, despite the fact the opening and all the promotional material shows Madoka in her magical girl outfit. Madoka is in no way a cliche mahou shoujo protagonist. She isn't the hero until the very end. Her character is, for the most part, almost entirely useless and is borderline bland. Madoka eventually does become the hero in the end, however. Effectively, her character is one of the main reasons I call this show a subversion. \nHomura-\nHomura is a mystery from the beginning. Her character is shrouded in allusion. Despite the fact she often comes at odds with the other mahou shoujo in the series (as well as trying to murder Kyuubey) it's clear to see from the beginning that she isn't an antagonist. Her character is strong and mysterious. Eventually, we come to learn that she is a time traveler, her abilities allowing her to manipulate time. After Madoka is killed in Walpurgis Night (the coming of an immensely powerful witch, which occurs at the climax of the story), Homura's wish is to go back in time in order to relive the events in order to protect Madoka. However, she eventually learns that the mahou shoujo are doomed to become witches and that kyuubey has been tricking them in order to harness the energy they release when they become witches. Throughout numerous timelines, Homura tries to warn the other girls and protect them from Kyuubey, failing at each Walpurgis Night along the way. The constant failure and even murder she performs on Madoka (at her request to prevent her from becoming a witch) changes and hardens her personality. Homura, in particular, is the character that most emphasises the darker nature of the series, being forced to live time and time again to try and prevent Madoka's inevitable fate. One of the most moving scenes in the anime occurs when Homura comes clean to Madoka about her past and her wish, revealing part of the original Homura before she became a mahou shoujo. \nSayaka- \nIf I had to choose a favourite girl in this series, it would be Sayaka. Sayaka best represents the fall from grace that all mahou shoujo experience. She is the first of the girls that we see as a human, and throughout the series we see her become a mahou shoujo, make her wish, and slowly accumulate despair and eventually, inevitably become a witch. It is almost painful to watch. Sayaka has a crush on a boy named Kyousuke, who she often visits in hospital. Kyousuke was a talented violinist before an injury left him crippled. Sayaka eventually makes her wish to help Kyousuke so he can play music again, ignoring the advice of Mami, who says \"Do you want to make this wish to help him, or do you want to make it so he'll say thank you to you.\" Sayaka makes this wish and becomes a mahou shoujo. Originally, she is proud and happy to become one. She is happy she has helped her crush and happy of the role she fulfills as the protector of the town. However, two main catalysts lead to her fall as a character. The first is when she discovers that the souls of mahou shoujo are removed from their body and placed into soul gems. This leads to her growing disgust in herself and the belief that she is a 'zombie'. At this point she begins to realise that being a mahou shoujo isn't all sugar and roses. The second catalyst is when her friend, Hitomi, expresses a romantic interest in Kyousuke. Sayaka doesn't pursue Kyousuke because she believes she doesn't deserve him. She believes he deserves someone whole, and not someone like herself, who she considers a zombie. \"How can I hold him with these hands? How can I kiss him with these lips?\" Ultimately, her growing despair leads to her becoming a witch, and subsequently her death. There is a beautiful scene involving her witch which shows a subversion of a typical trope. In shounen and mahou shoujo anime, it is not uncommon for a good character to be brainwashed over to the bad side. This is often followed with a scene where the main character yells the other characters name and eventually they are brought out of their delusion by the 'power of friendship' or something similar. This is what Madoka tries to do when Sayaka becomes a witch. In any normal Mahou Shoujo, this would work, however, in MSMM, it fails miserably. Sayaka's character is easily the best to see the Buddhism references to balance and the flaws of being a mahou shoujo. Her death also shows us that mahou shoujo eventually become witches. She gets to the point where she will easily strike out against Madoka and her fall is painful to watch. Though it feels slightly rushed as I mentioned earlier, it is well done and a credit to the writing staff.\nMami- \nMami's main position as a character is to show us the good side of being a mahou shoujo and also to set off the chain reaction that leads to the series becoming what it is. For most of the first three episodes, the series seems cliche, it appears as a typical mahou shoujo anime. It isn't until Mami's death that the chain reaction occurs which allows us to view the anime in an entirely different light. Her death is not only surprising, but horribly gruesome. Mami is looked up to by both Madoka and Sayaka. Her character is their envisioned perspective of a mahou shoujo. She did not choose to become a mahou shoujo, but was rather forced to become one in order to save her own life. Her wish was not out of greed but was out of mere survival. She fights to defend the people of the town and puts the obtaining of grief seeds second to saving people. When Sayaka becomes a mahou shoujo, her goal is to become like Mami. Mami's character provides a vital role to the early part of the series. \nKyouko- \nKyouko, originally, serves as an almost exact contrast to Mami. Kyouko doesn't care about the lives of people, only obtaining grief seeds. The first time she meets Sayaka, she fights her for the control of the town. Kyouko doesn't come into the series until after Mami's death. It is also Kyouko who comes up with the idea of balance and how happiness and despair must equal out. Kyouko is violent, aggressive and ultimately portrays what a mahou shoujo shouldn't be like and what one normally isn't like in other mahou shoujo anime. Ultimately, we do see Kyouko's more humane side. Her wish was not a selfish one, but one to help her father. She doesn't like people wasting food and is often seen eating because of when she had starved earlier in her life. Her selfishness can be put down to self preservation, caring only for herself, due to the betrayal by her father and the loss of her family. She eventually, however, becomes attached to Sayaka, as she can see Sayaka making what she perceives to be mistakes, the same mistakes that she made, making a wish for someone else, wanting to help people. Kyouko is the only girl who dies of her own volition. She kills herself in a powerful attack to kill Sayaka's witch, stating that she doesn't want Sayaka to live alone. This shows us that Kyouko becomes emotionally attached to Sayaka, more than she is willing to reveal originally, even though they started out as enemies. \nKyuubey-\nIf MSMM has an antagonist, it is him. I wouldn't call him an antagonist either. In fact, the series lacks a true antagonist, as the witches themselves are essentially fallen magical girls, and even though they are the targets throughout the series, they can be pitied and we see the struggles they had to go through when they were human. The series lacks a true antagonist, another feature which sets it apart from other mahou shoujo anime. Kyuubey creates mahou shoujo and harvests the energy they release when they become witches. He does this in order to prevent the heat death of the universe. His race, the Incubators, have been doing this and influencing the life of man since prehistoric times. Though Kyuubey deceives magical girls, his motives are quite logical and noble. He intends to prevent the death of the universe. He compares his relationship with the girls as similar to that of humans and cattle, but only more humane, as he recognises humans as sentient and intelligent, whereas humans do not afford this same respect to livestock. Kyuubey cannot be perceived as an actual antagonist, he is emotionless and destroys the lives of girls, but he states that the life of one girl is insignificant compared to that of the entire universe and every living being in it. Kyuubey cannot be called an antagonist.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nI loved this anime. I loved this anime enough to put enough thought into analysing it and coming up with my own interpretations of it. I love it enough to spend over an hour writing this review. I love the subtle symbolism to religion and human psychology, I love the characters, the voice acting is incredible as is the animation and by believe this is the best work by Gen Urobuchi, I could not recommend this anime enough, in the off chance that someone who hasn't seen it (or anyone for that matter) has read all of this. I hope I have managed to help some of you broaden your views on this anime and perhaps made you start to speculate what this series means for yourself. Ultimately, I could not recommend this anime enough.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=17,   ["text"]="                          \n    Magical Girls. When someone says that word nowadays, many people think of one series, this series, Madoka*Magica. Across the web, this title is heralded as a great series, but is it really?\nThe story of this series starts off like most MG animes. However, unlike many series, the protagonist takes a very backseat role on the action. Actually, the protagonist barely even fights. Its up to the other girls to carry her weight around, but when all they're talking about is the protagonist and she does not do anything of value, the plot suffers. The entire story is practically built around her and since she does\n          \n        nothing of value for more than 3/4 of the series, the plot loses a lot of its meat. It has a good concept where there are consequences to the MGs and their presence, but the characters themselves rob it of its power. The ending is also very anticlimatic. \nThe art of the series has a sketchy quality, yet the animations are crisp. That being said, the colors and abstract art that comes from the enemies, the 'witches' is blinding and it was hard to follow the action through all the kaleidoscope-like images. Character designs are good, though. \nThe voice acting matches the characters, and the BGM is strong as well. The opening and ending are good enough. \nThe biggest fault with this series are its characters. The main girl is a whiny girl who wants to be a MG but...doesn't want to be a MG? Her convicts and beliefs change by the second. She does not seem to get her ducks in a row until the end. Her friends are about as deep as a dried up kiddie pool in summer, with the exception of Mami and Kyubey. One is a MG who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and is doing the best she can. The other is a mastermind. I won't say more for fear of spoilers...Sadly, because of the rest of the cast and how they rely on Madoka to pull her share, they all fail in the end. \nEach episode was a test of my conviction to finish this series. I nearly gave up several times and when I finally completed it, I felt as though I got nothing for my effort. I won't recommend this to anyone who wants a series with any notable  male characters in it or with any females that give the typical anime girl a good name. The people who may enjoy are those who like this kind of genre no matter what, or those who can see past Madoka's faults. \nOverall, this anime is famous for reasons I just can't understand. The horrible cast, weak Madoka-centered plot and bad ending render this show overly hyped and nearly a waste of my time. Watch at your own risk. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Have you ever watched a movie so intense that you felt the irresistible urge to tell someone, anyone, about it because how it made you feel? Has a piece of media ever resonated with you so strongly that you were left speechless and felt empty? When was the last time that a work of art made you more closely examine the world around you? I ask these questions because these are the sorts of emotions and thoughts that ran through my head as the credits rolled on episode 12 of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\nMany anime are tearjerkers, many anime make you feel empowered, and many\n          \n        anime deliver satisfaction through feelgood stories. Madoka could be considered all of those things, but more than any of those other feelings I just felt awestruck. I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed or how a show whose main characters are middle school magical girls had just forced me to stop and consider serious philosophical questions.\nThe above is all I can tell you about the content of the story. Even the slightest bit more specific would be massive spoilers. All I can say is you MUST give this show a few episodes. Don't judge it based on the first episode or two alone.\nAlong with the story, the characters are perfectly written. No character is unnecessary. No character feels flat. All major characters have some sort of arc that is intricately and purposefully woven into the plot for a specific purpose. Empathizing with all of our magical heroes was very easy for me.\nAs far as execution, this is studio SHAFT to a T: striking visuals, surrealist styling, and an amazing use of imagery to convey tone, theme, and emotion. In the TV version some early art feels a bit rushed or lacking a budget, but SHAFT always cleans up the art for the BD release, so if you're watching that you shouldn't notice any of those problems. It feels like the art only gets better as the show goes on too.\nAs for sound, I watched the Japanese dub with English subtitles and the voice acting is strong and all of the characters feel unique and well acted. I didn't notice any errors, so there were none so egregious as to pull me out of the story. \nThe music is composed by Kajiura Yuki and it is simply amazing. The BGM is so hauntingly beautiful it stayed in my mind for hours after I had finished the series. Her ability to create exactly the right tone to convey the message of every scene left me breathless. In particular the track titled \"Credens Justidiam\" is so amazing that I can't stop listening to it.\nIn summary:\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\nOverall: 10/10.\nThere's too much to say about this show in a review. The themes explored, the powerful nature of the work, and the brilliant execution deserve much, much more analysis and praise than I could possibly express here. My only goal in writing this is to convince you that you MUST go watch it. I hope I have succeeded.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This review contains MASSIVE SPOILERS. Turn back now.\nHoly crow.\nThis show...\nThis show...\nThis show.\nI love this show.\nI love this show for the same reasons you do. But I want to talk about the ending, because it is one of my favorite things in animation, right up with the Avatar finale, which is my standard for animated excellence, full stop.\nThe ending of Madoka made me cry, but not because it was sad. Parts of it were, sure, but that wasn't why I cried.\nI had spent the previous ten-ish episodes following Sayaka down her path of tragedy and grief and rage, right there with her the entire time. I\n          \n        had begun the series with just as much hope and confidence and goodwill as she'd had, only to find death and despair and a world where magical girls never got happy endings to their wishes. Watching her become a witch, and be slowly destroyed from the inside out, was one of the most heartbreaking, soul-breaking things I will ever witness. I had been steeped in Homura's backstory, which felt like the same cycle, only so much worse since Homura witnessed every version of the same ending. She can go back and try to save Madoka and again and again and again and again, but all it will lead to is the same time loop of destruction and heartbreak, until she loses hope, her wish becomes a curse, and she turns into the very thing she was trying to save her best friend from.\nEverything is bleak, and there is no end in sight for either cycle, until Madoka makes her wish.\nShe becomes a magical girl, the very fate Homura was actively preventing her from realizing, but instead of joining the cycle of magical girls and witches-- wishes and curses, hope and despair, birth and destruction-- Madoka breaks it. By rewriting the laws of the universe, Madoka can make sure that all magical girls who ever were or are or will be do not become the very thing they set out to defeat; instead, they die in peace, having given their lives to kill wraiths, never having to fear that the next witch will be the one that corrupts their soul gem for good. Madoka, in short, is given the power of happy endings, and the ability to ensure that they come to fruition.\nThe most powerful scene comes when Madoka looks out at her own grief seed, at labyrinth she is destined to create, according to Kyubey, and declares that she \"Wished for the power to erase all witches. And if what I wished for really did come true, then even I don't have a thing to worry about. Ever!\" I'm tearing up just writing this; because Madoka was not only able to give happy endings to others, but to herself as well, with the power to destroy any possibility that even she will become a witch. Her power-- her hope-- was so great that even she did not have to sacrifice her soul, that even she could be spared from the cycle.\nI love this show, and I love this episode, and I love this scene, with all my heart.\nThat's what it did to me, at least. And for that, Madoka, I will always be grateful.\nThank you.\nxoxo,\nAmazing Grace\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Madoka magica is one of those shows that come along once every decade or so and changes everything about their respective genre and the way people view that genre. \nLike Evangelion did in the 1990s, Madoka manages to take a popular genre in anime and flip it on its head with a surprisingly thrilling, tightly written, psychological, dark show about what it means to be a magical girl. \nNow I've seen this anime twice and I got a different experience both times so I will be saying why this show is great and comparing through different viewings as to why it works and how my\n          \n        experience changed whilst seeing it a second time. What were those changes? Lets find out shall we?\nPlot: Now many know that Madoka magica was falsely advertised as cute, innocent magical girl show. This was to trick people into lowering their defences so that they would be shocked by the quick change in tone from fun and care-free into a dark, physcological thriller.\nNow watching it for the first time, the show is exciting, gripping and shocking and is great fun to watch. However after watching a second time I found that the shock value wore off and it turns into quite a simple show and I got the gist of it in one viewing. The ending may need a re-watch but thats it.\nNow I gave the show a 9 so obviously its not a big problem I had as I loved other parts of the show. It is great to re-watch it to notice the subtler writing and dialogue that is placed throughout the series and to see it come back in future episodes which you may have missed the first time round but it was just something I noticed and was a bit noticeable and needed to be pointed out.\nCharacters: Now I'm only going to talk about the 5 main girls because to talk about other minor characters like Kyousuke, Hitomi and Kyubey and explain why I liked or disliked them and what did or didn't work with them would be a bit spoilery and I would not want to ruin the experience for newcomers.\nMy opinion of the characters did change on a second viewing.\nMadoka: My opinion of her has not changed at all in both viewings. Quite honestly as a main protagonist she fails completely. A main character is someone who the story focuses on and someone who has direct influence on the plot thats going on around them. Madoka, herself, has no involvement what so ever in the plot and for 11 episodes just sits back and watches whilst the other girls change and get involved in the story. Madoka just cries and watches and doesn't get involved until the final episode, which is ironic as her only involvement is proabably the most significant event in the story.\nOf course this could be another hint of the subtle writing and the fact that Madoka is not really the main protagonist but I can't explain that as that would be spoilery again. \nMami: She is probably my least favourite magical girl. Now people say thats just because shes not in it as much. I think thats a crap excuse as for example Kaworu from Evangelion is a hugely popular character and appeared in 2 episodes of evangelion. On my first viewing I liked Mami but as I watched the second time I realised she has no real personality and I didnt really care about her. Her motive was unclear and she could have used a bit more screen time. This is a reason why this show should have been longer but I'll talk about that later.\nSayaka: Easily the most well written out of the main girls. Her arc is very interesting considering I thoguht she was going to be the cliche best friend of the main character but she really was not. Now on first viewing I didn't like her and thought her problems were petty and childish. But on second viewing I couldn't help but feel bad for her and whenever I watch the show again, her arc always hurts to watch.\nKyoko: I really liked her personality. Her interactions with the characters were different and fresh in particular with Sayaka. On second viewing I realised that her backstory was really rushed. I mean she says her entire backstory in one speech in one episode. They could have used maybe one or two more episodes to really tighten up the character work a little bit but I liked her, she was a fresh presence on screen.\nHomura: Can't say too much about her as that would spoil the whole story but I found her backstory to be interesting. The segway into her revealing her backstory felt a bit quick and could have used more time to make the transition more smooth. But I liked her none the less.\nArt: Studio Shaft must have the largest bank reserves of any anime company in the world. This show is very distinct in look and is gorgeous to look at. It looked like Shaft were just masturbating on screen. It was just so gorgeous, some of the best I have ever seen, very fluid. Mami's costume design was my favourite. I loved the design of the witches, it was just so original and not what I was expecting. It really helped give the show a sense of identity.\nSound: Yuki Kajirua does a fantastic job here as well. The pieces she chose fit very well with the narrative whether it was the cute opening which misled people into believing the show was something different than what it actually was to the haunting theme when fighting the witches or the sad character themes.\nWhenever I hear \"Decretum\" I just have all the emotions come back to me and I go damn that is hauntingly beautiful despite it being only 1:49 long. It reminded me of a Hans Christian Andersen story and the kind of music I would want to hear in my head if I read his stories, in particular the little mermaid which madoka magica takes a lot of influence from.\nThe second end credits, Magia, not only highlights the show's real tone but emphasises the subtle writing and foreshadowing that you would miss on your first or even second viewing. Let me explain:\nIn the credits Madoka passes Sayaka who is ignoring her and looking down in sadness. Foreshadowing her arc in episodes 5-8.\nThen Madoka passes Kyoko who doesnt move or look at her at all. Hinting at her loneliness and having no one which is explored in episode 7.\nThen she passes Mami who is on the floor looking in an earnest pose for Madoka. Showing her loneliness and wanting a friend which is explored in episode 2.\nAnd then she passes Homura who turns around and tries to reach out to Madoka but fails to. Foreshadowing her story in episode 10. Then Madoka proceeds to run to what I guess is her wish.\nJust more subtle writing which makes me love the show even more.\nEnjoyment: I had a blast watching Madoka magica for its shocking and gripping story and emotional content. Even though this shock wore off on second viewing, it got me to notice the subtle hints that were placed in each episode to foreshadow either an event in a characters arc or backstory or personality. It made me appreciate the writing more.\n* I also didn't like how they changed the main character so suddenly (episodes 10-12), it came out of nowhere and if Madoka magica was a bit longer, it could have meant for a smoother transition. A nitpick quite honestly.*\nOverall: Madoka magica is great. Despite there being some character stories that felt rushed and some characters who were just there for plot devices, i.e. Hitomi and Kyousuke, this show is a true accomplishment in what you can do in only 12 episodes and is one of my favourite anime and I look forward to re-watching very soon.\n        "},

Many things about this Anime stand out, as well a fair amount of viewing isn't spent confused as to what's happened or happening. The overall enjoyment of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica was outstanding, I was enthralled from the end of episode 3 on. But never the less enjoyable as hell, sadly the series had to end.\nUpon first starting to view the Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica one thing that stands out, rather jumps out, is the Art. This Art is different, it's unique and it's brilliant. I at first\n          \n        thought it would slowly detract my interest in the Anime, but gladly I was proven else wise. With this Art work you actually get a more authentic feel from watching this Anime, the witches domain feels more hysterical and realistic. The unique Artistic effects of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica really set this Anime on a different path for me from the get go. Thoroughly delighted, bravo.\nWith the Characters development and designs. As well as the Sounds given from the OST and the tidbits here and there, you weren't given slop and told it was filet mignon. The designs of the Characters weren't over the top, neither were they too under whelming. It was just right in it's own regard fantastic. The same can be said for the Sounds. Great songs from the OST to match the feel of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, perfect in it's right.\nLastly I want to discuss the story. To which I will first state, it's effective. Though the sudden turn off the highway at the end of episode three was a little shocking. Everything went smooth from start to finish. No loose ends from the plot and not putting too much into a small space. Overall perfection as a whole from Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica.\n        "},

After episode three, I had to go to a Fourth of July party with my family but didn't want to stop watching, so I (rudely) shut myself up in a room and completed the series in one day! Screw Independence Day! That's how good\n          \n        it was! I skipped a party! It's my absolute favorite show to date. \nNow, onto the specifics. \nStory: 10/10\nThis isn't your normal magical girl show, like Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. Madoka Magica truly depicts what challenges the magical girls actually go through. How it interferes with their life and turns it upside down, messes with their emotions, inflicts fear into their minds and keeps them from fulfilling everyday duties. I can't even describe how much torture all of these girls had to go through. This may not seem like a very original plot now, but Madoka Magica does something else that other dark fantasy/tragedy magical girl titles don't. It creates a complex plot that messes with your feels and seems totally cruel. It's all so deep and meaningful. There is so much packed into this 12-episode show. There really is. \nArt: 9/10\nYou either like it or you hate it. This is how it goes. I think the art has had a huge impact on me. It's amazing. It would earn a ten, but SHAFT's style really divides up everyone into the groups of liking or hating it. It always does. I especially love how they did the witches. I thought that they were on drugs for a while. It's so detailed and unexpected, which perfectly matches what this show is all about. Not to mention how the girls are drawn, too. I find the style very cute and lovely. I also love the animation. It's just so wonderful and I never noticed any awkward poses or movements. Also, the colors change slightly to fit the mood. Have you ever noticed that when Madoka and friends are magical girls fighting witches, their hair color, skin tone, eye color, and outfit colors get a little more vibrant? The attention to detail that SHAFT had was amazing. \nSound: 10/10\nThe opening and endings were very good. I loved how they tricked me! The ending theme in the first two episodes was all cutesy and happy with that picture of Madoka and Sayaka (and if I'm remembering right, Hitomi was there too, right?) and that definitely threw me off. Then in episode three, the ending changed to the darker, creepier and more serious \"Magia\" by Kalafina, which definitely fits the show better! The opening is also great. I can play it on my flute and I always get lots of compliments wherever I go from other Madoka fans!\nThe voice actors are also impressive. They definitely fit their character and almost never faltered. I especially loved the contrast between first timeline Homura and present Homura. \nOh, might I also mention the BGM? Fantastic! It leaves me speechless!\nCharacter: 10/10\nAt first, Madoka was your ordinary protagonist. Nothing special about her but OH MY GOSH! She gets an amazing opportunity! She's enthusiastic and not as smart! And Sayaka as the ordinary side character. The tomboyish best friend who always teased her.  And Mami was your cool, friendly, good-at-everything upperclassman. And Homura was the mysterious, \"cool\" character. And Kyubey was your equivalent of Luna in Sailor Moon. \nUntil this show screamed, \"HAHA! Just kidding!\" right in my face. \nThe character development is the best part of this show, I might argue. Madoka learns to put others before herself but also not to let herself be stupid and get everyone else killed along with herself. She learns a lot about herself. Madoka learns that not everyone is made for greatness, but she could help someone else be great- and possibly work hard to achieve something good herself. \nSayaka learns that things don't always work out the way you want them too. Sometimes it's better to be realistic than optimistic, but to never lose hope. She learns to always protect her friends and be there for them no matter what. Sayaka grows so much. She reminds me so much of myself that it isn't even funny. I love her so much. \nHomura develops the most out of everyone, in my opinion. She, like Sayaka, learns to protect her friends no matter what. She also learns that sometimes you have to sacrifice some things to get positive results. Also, what's done is done. You can't (always) change the past. She has to learn to suppress emotion and deal with the consequences of her actions. This entire show depends on Homura. Homura also reminds me of myself in the sense of loving friends and doing anything to protect them. \nMami learns that she can't always be the best, and sometimes in a crisis virtues don't matter. She also learns not to flaunt her stuff or act so cool. She develops the least, sadly, but this is justified by her lack of appearance in the show. \nKyouko learns to sacrifice some things for others' good, and that you can't always be a hero. She learns to utilize her resources and enjoy herself. She also learns that even if you don't like someone, teamwork is better than battling something individually. She actually develops a lot, but I'm getting a little tired and this review is a little too long. \nKyubey...let's not elaborate. You can just watch the show! He doesn't really develop anyways. \nI loved these characters so much. I cosplay as Homura all the time. I doodle them on my homework a lot (oops). I have fallen in love with them and you will too. \nAs for the side characters:\n-Hitomi: I hated her. She's so stuck up. I hate what she did to Sayaka even after how loyal she always is to her. She and Kyousuke definitely belong together! They are both stuck up, spoiled rich brats who never ever consider anyone else's feelings!\n-Kyousuke: I hated him too. See above.↑ He's just so mean and selfish! I get it, he was in an awful situation, but that doesn't justify his actions! Sayaka gave everything to him! And in return, she was tossed out of his life like a piece of garbage. \n-Madoka's mom, Junko: I love her, despite her imperfections. Her willingness to help Madoka and protect her family is awesome. I love her self-confidence, and the confidence she has in others. Her advice is really good and deep, despite the fact that she's drunk when she is giving it. \nEnjoyment: 10/10\nI have rewatched this series over and over again and loved it more every time. I think that rewatching it actually makes your experience with the show better, and it's easier to understand that way. I have watched both sub and English dub. The dub isn't THAT bad, but the subs are definitely better. \nOverall: 10/10\nThis show truly is a masterpiece. \nAnyone will enjoy this show. Man, woman, boy, girl...all people will enjoy this show. Watch it. Now. Just do it. Stop reading this and go watch it. \n"},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    This show is absolute trash. People try to say it is good just because of the poorly written plot twist at the climax of the story. The shows narrative is complete garbage, switching from one characters insecurities to the despair of homura due to madokas ignorance; with almost no transition. In the end nothing changes. This show tries so hard to be something that its not. Which only makes it worse overall. The ending provides no resolution to the story at all, instead just making it worse. This show ruined the magical girl genre. \nThe art is terrible, the scenes where they fight witches are\n          \n        awful. It looks like a 3-year old played with crayons over their frames. Like seriously what were they going for with that. People think its abstract so it must be a masterpiece. These people do not know what GOOD art is.\nThe opening is mediocre at best, and even then its not that great. There are a few good background tracks, however apart from this the show again fails to deliver in yet another category. Definitely not as bad as the other though.\nThe characters are boring and 1-dimensional. Madoka has no depth to her at all despite being the main character. She doesnt change throughout the entire show, forcefully re-arriving at the same outcome, despite how hard Homura tries to stop her. She learns nothing and doesn't grow as a result of that, she instead remains a dumb little girl. How is this a masterpiece? It isnt.\nPeople who actually think this show is good are suffering from cognitive dissonance right about now. Trying to argue otherwise is like trying to detect brain activity in a Madoka fan. You cant. You could say Madoka herself is the personification of her fans, brainless and steadfast. Please take a hard look, and see this show for what it really is. That one edgy emo kid you hate for thinking they are big and bad but in reality they are pretty lame. \n        "},

The  ending  was like oh i will never be remembered and yet  a few  remembered her name. and the\n          \n         time  travel chick was like yea  ok shes  basicaly god now  so eh whateves even tho  she had a total  lesbo crush on her. in the end  she  was like meh  whatever and moved on making the whole entire series null and  void. same thing  happened in Mirai Nikki except that in the end (spoilers)\n\n yuno gasi and yuki actually got together and lived  happily  with one another  which was a satisfying ending madoka magica is the  same thing  except meh i don't care and moves on like nothing happens, and that's what pissed me off about madoka magica the nonchalant oh i fought  for nothing  guess ill just  continue on with my life. \ncharacter development  was meh would have loved to see a lot more from that but nope just focuses on. madoka and  her constant  crying up till the end it got annoying. however there are  parts where it did focus on other but it manly  wasn't important at all what so ever.\nand the music by Yuki Kajiura was AMAZING probably why i enjoyed SAO and this  show as much as i did Yuki Kajiura is an amazing artist. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    The production quality is top notch... but the show has some very serious issues with theme.  If you want a fun visual romp then this is a great show, if you're hoping for something deeper you will end up disappointed.\nIt's very difficult to discuss it without spoiling, but basically my issue is that the show is dark, very dark.  But there's no actual exploration of why the world is dark other than to create an opposition to the show's art style & young characters.  \nThe principle of karma (that kindness and malevolence must be generated in equal amounts) makes very little sense\n          \n        and is just a fixed mechanic in the world.  There's no reason why it has to be that way, and there's not exploration into why there has to be a karmic balance, and the story muddles itself in trying to seem deep while not actually exploring human nature or anything that would be needed to talk about it on a next level.\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    To say I am truly stunned and floored by this series isn't doing it any justice. I have never watched a magical girl series before this (I even made it a point to boycott Sailor Moon for good, because I couldn't stand how dry it was after watching a handful of episodes). However, this series' plot progression, style, and everything else about it stand to justify my watching it.\nLet's clear up one major detail: I am male. At the time of writing this, I am 19 and in college, and I am a huge fan of heavy metal music. I am one of the most\n          \n        testosterone-driven people I know. How this magical girl anime - which crosses over to borderline psychological horror at points - consistently drives me to emotional depths I never even knew I had is truly amazing. The range of emotion displayed throughout is downright amazing. Not since Hayao Miyazaki have I seen such brilliance from character development, and not since Ennio Morricone have I felt so swayed by the score of anything. The soundtrack is perfectly placed, deep and dark, with Kalafina's vocals reaching a whole new level of haunting. I sometimes find myself getting goosebumps by how well the sound is done. That's not easy to do for someone like me.\nI am very, VERY enthusiastic about the story. Few interpretations of true self-sacrifice and true, heartfelt emotion are made today, and even fewer are made in America. This is one \"Mahou Shoujo\" series that delivers. A lot of series are very easily distracted by the \"magical girl\" aspect and not easily brought into the plot, but the fact of the matter is, the plot is incredibly well-illustrated and there is never a dull moment. Again, not since a true classic has something like this been brought to light.\nThe artwork is definitely different from anything I've previously seen. Madoka's eyes are given very meticulous yet minimalistic direction. I can't call it \"effortless,\" but it comes together magnificently. Akiyuki Shinbo brings a hint of Shel Silverstein-influenced LSD into the mix, and we get a genuinely horrifying witch's labyrinth. You start to become entwined in the plot right alongside the other characters, so to speak, understanding their gravity of emotion and genuine fear. This only gets amplified in Episode 3. It's a whole different breed of enjoyment, like the kind of addiction you get to reading a classic horror novel, but scaled up to a much more widespread audience.\nSuffice to say, however, it's not for the faint of heart. If you like most other magical girl series, you probably should watch this as an experiment, but I can't recommend it to everyone. There are subtle nuances in the plot that leave you puzzled and dissatisfied at times, even though they have (so far) mostly been resolved. You can't be impatient with a series like this. It's the delicate balance of everything that's presented before you that makes Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (also known as Puella Magi Madoka Magica) such an amazing series. \nUntil an official sub is released, I'd stick with gg's fansub. It's pretty accurate and easy to read because of the high contrast, and it doesn't take away from the energy of the anime. It's dark, well-paced, well-versed, and breathtakingly beautiful at every turn. I can only hope the next two episodes are as good.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    By now, you've seen countless reviews saying that Puella Magi Madoka Magica (PMMM) is a great show. Reviewers say that you should watch it because it's a brilliant deconstruction of the magical girl genre, or a surprisingly dark take on the genre. \nThat is not the only reason to watch the show.\nPerhaps you are like me. You heard about PMMM, and decided to do some investigating. I accidentally spoiled major plot points for myself because I was reading too much about the show. Knowing those plot twists, I had a hard time convincing myself to put the effort into watching the show. I finally did,\n          \n        and was pleasantly surprised.\nEven knowing what was in store, the show was a thoroughly entertaining and beatiful experience. The following review hopefully outlines why PMMM is more than worth your time. I will not spoil anything in case you want to go in blind.\nStory: While the show starts like a standard magical girl show, the real meat of the story comes into play within the first few episodes. It is not a very complex story, but the themes presented and situations encountered are all at once heart-wrenching, joyous, frustrating and satisfying. The plight of the girls is immensely touching, and the sweeping conclusion is one of the best I have ever seen.\nArt: The character designs are all unique, and very colorful. Animation is smooth, and backgrounds are beautiful. The witch labyrinths are easily some of the most haunting and interesting scenes of the whole show. Mixing traditional animation with the \"Unmoving plaid\" effect makes for a very disorienting trip.\nSound: I watched the sub, and enjoyed the performances of each voice actor. The background music fit each scene, but is not very memorable by itself. However, the music during the witch labyrinths is appropriately creepy, and coupled with the animation make for the most memorable parts of the show.\nCharacter: Each of the main girls has different reasons for becoming a magical girl, and exploring the backstories and motivations reveals a lot about each character. While each girl represents certain archtypes, they do not feel stale. Mixing common tropes with their varied backstories keeps the characters feeling fresh.\nThe amount of character development achieved in only 12 episodes is amazing. Some characters change more than others, but every major character gets so much time devoted to her that you feel like you are going on their journey with them, and rooting for them.\nOverall: A solid plot, engaging characters and beautiful art are why you should watch this show. Not just for the \"dark themes\" and \"shock value\". After a year, that shock value is lost.  What remains is a strong, well-rounded show. \nTL;DR 5 words or phrases to describe PMMM\nbeautiful art, strong character development, emotional, mature, friendship is magic :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a show that disguised itself as a typical magical girl series but ended up as a deconstruction of the genre, doing a whole 360° and transforming an apparently innocent show into a dark fantasy series.\nThe story of Madoka Magica started up as a regular Magical Girl series, our young protagonist Madoka meets the \"adorable\" and \"cute\" magical creature Kyubey who  \noffers her to fulfill one wish, whatever it could be, and, in exchange, she would have to start being a magical girl.\nSo for the first two episodes they carry out this \"normal\" mahou shoujo plot as any other show\n          \n        of the same genre would, we see the magical girls fighting with their natural enemies, \"The Witches\" and the characters interact with each other as any other teenager would. But this is only the quiet before the storm.\nIn episode three the show turns itself upside down and becomes a dark fantasy, and we see the characters trying to unravel the horrible truth behind the witches, the magical girls and their inescapable reality.\nThe director of this series was Akiyuki Shinbou who also directed Hidamari Sketch a moe looking show. As such the artwork in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is also kind of moe which was part of the reason why nobody would have guessed that it would become such a dark series and thought that this would be only a straightforward and light-hearted show.\nHowever when things get crazy and people start dying, getting suicide and going insane, the moe looking artwork makes a high contrast and makes everything even more disturbing.\nThe design of the main enemies the \"Witches\" is also used to make a contrast as they have a rather cartoonish look that make them seem harmless while, in reality, they are lethal monsters.\nThe animation itself is fluid and consistent and it looks even more amazing in the battle scenes that is when it truly shines.\nThe soundtrack can be described in one word and that particular word would be \"EPIC\", the reason behind this is only one and that is because Yuki Kajiura is its composer.\nThe fact that Mrs. Kajiura composed the soundtrack of this series was kind of a clue about the show´s real nature, as she is usually involved in series with dark tones such as Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai. But when this soundtrack really shines is in the battle scenes, where we can hear the orchestra with the vocal choirs in the background, and I´m a sucker for those.\nAs for the openings and endings, the opening was \"Connect\" by ClariS and it was  \na very nice song, granted, but it sounded kinda like it was made for a completely\ndifferent show and, as the series went forward, this opening ended up being less and less fitting for the show, but it was very catchy so that´s really my only complain about it.\nThe ending theme, however, it´s a completely different story because it fit the show perfectly, the ending theme is \"Magia\" by Kalafina and the ending became unskippable for me just because of that song, it´s simply awesome.\nIn regards of the voice acting it was pretty solid I really have no complains about it and Chiwa Saito did an amazing job as Homura because she managed to give feelings to a character that, at first, apparently had none.\nFor a 12 episode series, this show has some heavy development for every one of it´s characters and by the end you will probably be attached to most of them which will only make the trauma worst when you see them dying RIGHT in front of your eyes in the most dramatic and sad way possible.\nThe weakest character in this series is probably it´s protagonist, Madoka, because she is very indecisive on whether being a magical girl or not because even if there isn´t something she wants so much that she would risk her life for, she feels the need to help people and to help other magical girls in their fight, so there is a kind of dilemma, but when I thought about it I asked myself \"If I had seen the kind of sh*t this girl has seen, would I have done something different?\", and the answer to that is NO because everyone would be scared if someone told them to risk their life like that even if by doing so they can have a wish granted. So even if she is indecisive she has a very good justification for it.\nThe series ended great and it had the two things I love the the most in any kind of medium: a dark story and a fantasy setting, plus it looks and sounds incredible. How could I not like this show?\nSo, people, do not be fooled by appearances because this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, so if you are looking for great character development, a story with A LOT of plot twist (plus sad and traumatic events) and an awesome ending to the series, you owe it to yourself to watch this series.\nFor me this series was a 9.4/10 but I can´t use decimals on MAL so it ended up with a 9/10.\nSo I will see you on my next review I hope. I bid you farewell\n        "},

The scheme of things seem devious but also mistifying at the same time, and all do a very good\n          \n        job at causing the viewer to FEEL something. Yes this anime actually makes you go through emotional agony, really making you question matters like what it really means to be a human, religion, emotion, society. All are tied together and represented in a masterful and action filled heartbreaking anime.\nStory: The story was very well done, wasn't rushed at all and was so unique but at the same time flexible, that it allowed the writers to really be able to portray the characters very well and show how they are developing through the dilemma they are in.\nCharacter: The characters develop wonderfully, turning from happy to sad to insane in a steady and organized manner, everything has a reason for happening, which gives a great bit of satisfaction when you see something happen to a character and understand it fully and be able to connect to it feel bad or good about the character.\nSound: Music was amazing. I felt that it did lack something, which I cant really put my hands on, but im still going to give it a 10/10 because it fit with the overall feel of the anime and made each seen either really intense or sad and did a very good job at it. \nAnimation: Shaft really did a spectacular job with this one, animation is very pretty and always top notch, they even went to the trouble of trying to make every seen or a quick still look really really epic, even if its just showing streetlights, or a dark room with only a single light, the lights arnt exaggerated Battlefield 3 style, but are still done so well that it makes all the stills stand out. The set pieces were also impressive and did a great job and showing off that Shaft had a lot of money to spare.\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the anime especially because of the meaningful messages it brought up, and the many connections to religion that it made, tying it all this together was really magnificent and im just a sucker for this kind of stuff. I really enjoyed the anime.\nOverall: Its a great anime stressing many aspects of human nature and evil and portraying amazing set pieces and storytelling and pacing. Lovely characters and amazing art. This kind of anime is very rare and it should not be missed.\n        "},

I just can't believe why on earth would a \"Magical girl theme\" have a high score? I mean look at the picture, doesn't it look like only a child would watch this or maybe some maniac who loves magical girls? Even after reading the synopsis, it hopelessly sounds like a 12 year old magical shoujo show. \nI still can't believe this show is Rated-17, and also have a weird genre, I think someone made a typo - but to hell with it. I'm bored\n          \n        so I watched episode 1 just for lulz, lets watch some childish anime since I've never seen one since I was 10. \nThis... isn't what I thought it would be. It looked like a fairy tale made by Disney, but the storyline is written by the Grimm Brothers. I can't even call this \"magical girl\", it doesn't fit the genre. The environment, the scenes, the story and the characters are way out of my expectations. I can't believe how good this show was and it tore my heart apart. In just 12 episodes it felt like I watched a 52 episode anime + OVAs. The show was not perfect but certainly not lacking, there were some irrelevant parts but they don't hurt the story. \nThe character development for this show is outstanding, Kyuubei was Kyuubei, while the girls showed some some growth regardless whether they matured or they became reckless. It's hard to describe the development for this show without spoiling it, this is the best part of the show; therefore, I'd leave it as it is.\nWatching this series, you get enticed by the background music from dramatic scenes to fighting scenes. The music plays with your emotion whether you want to be sad or interested. There was never a dull moment in this part, everything was synced and it fits the environment. \nThe art style was amazing.. I don't even have to describe it as it would totally spoil the enjoyment.\nI would not say I enjoyed watching this because its not a show you enjoy watching, its a show you need to be involved with. You have to be serious with it, love it and feel it because that's how its suppose to be. Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica is a title worth of a million applause.\nTL:DL: Watch it, I gave 10 for it and I rarely make reviews. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    With a show this complex and groundbreaking, a review in and of itself won't be able to cover all the factors that resulted in me giving it a perfect score. Nonetheless, I'll try my best to give a brief idea on why I felt Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica was a masterpiece. \nArt (10/10)\nNot even a minute into the first episode, the artwork intrigued me; not because it was necessarily outstanding, but because it was unique. For me, it was the first time that I have seen this type of art style being used in anime. After getting used to it, I noticed that it blended in\n          \n        really well with the typical anime art that we are all used to. The flawless combination of these two art styles to create interesting visuals really impressed me. In the past, and even now, I haven't been a big fan of art, let alone abstract art, but after watching this series, my interest has grown slightly. In my point of view, I think this aspect of the series was either a hit or miss, with the totally different styles either enhancing or degrading the audience's experience. \nCharacters (10/10)\nThe most interesting character, in my opinion, has got to be Kyuubey. The emotionless face he has while telepathically spewing deceptive and persuasive words makes for a character that leaves many viewers unsure of whether to love or hate. As for the girls themselves, they are a great example of what can happen to a person when he/she is given the chance to obtain an immense amount of power. I find the Soul Gems a great representation of this. The more one uses their newfound power for themselves, the more evil will spread within them. But using one's powers for good, something that happens less often, will allow one to purify themselves (in a mental sense, that is). Throughout the series, the psychological stress of being a magical girl evidently changes the personalities of each character. These changes may be drastic but are surprisingly quite realistic and believable. Like in many of my other reviews a cast of characters with different personalities is always a plus in my books. What's special here is that the outfit of these girls after they \"transform\" also reflects their personality. Aside from the excellent story, I believe that the characters, especially Kyuubey, contributed immensely towards the success of this series. \nSound (10/10)\nThe first ClariS song I listened to was 'irony', OP for Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai. Ever since then, I've become a fan of their songs. 'Connect', the OP for Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, was no exception. It was never a mood killer in any way and, in fact, set up the episode quite well in close to all the episodes. As for 'Magia', the ED, it wasn't really my cup of tea but I have to say that it was the perfect song to end off the episodes. A sense of despair and suspense amplified the often depressing and cliffhanger ends of the episodes. BGM was appropriate and fit in well. The cast of highly-talented voice actresses added to my enjoyment. Their portrayal of the characters' emotions were done especially well, sometimes making the 'acting' part of their job seem obsolete. If I were to pick the weakest aspect in this category, it would have to be the BGM. Although this is the case, I'm certainly not saying it's bad, but it just doesn't compare to the superior quality of the other aspects (OP, ED, VAs). \nStory (10/10)\nThe toughest section to write about is definitely the story. I find it hard to string together a short paragraph that, without spoiling anything, describes this story well - one that, I believe, has revolutionized the \"mahou shoujo\" genre. In my opinion, Episodes 3, 8, 10 and 12 were the pinnacles of this excellent story; the great use of plot twists and the tying up of loose ends to keep the viewer interested and not confused, respectively. All in all, the story in Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is the reason for its success and trying to summarize it would never work; it would probably create some false hope/expectations instead. So all I can say now is: just watch it and you'll see why so many people, including me, say it's so good. \nOverall (10/10)\nWhat more can I say? A perfect score in all the previous categories should be enough to convince you to give this anime a try. Whether you're an avid \"mahou shoujo\" fan or have no idea what it is, there's a high chance that watching Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica will change your perspective on the genre; I know that it did for me. What's best about the series is the fact that it doesn't spoonfeed every little detail to its audience and, instead, forces them to think a bit in order to understand what's going on. So, once again, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is definitely an anime to try. I'm almost certain that you won't be disappointed!\n        "},

This genre usually involves girls that have to deal with their lives while having a form of supernatural power. When I first saw this anime, I had the thoughts of it being another 'Sailor Moon', but I was wrong. I have to say that Madoka Magica is a major deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Since the series, the magical girl genre has been more noticed. As I go into the review of this anime, I have to express my view that this series is\n          \n        a magnificent piece of work, which many will remember. Let's now go into details...\nStory: \nMadoka Magica is about a girl named Madoka Kaname living a normal life with her friends and family, but one day, her life took a dramatic twist, when she and her friend, Sayaka confronted a cat-like creature named Kyubey, who was being chased down by a girl named Homura Akemi. Kyubey then offered the girls the opportunity to wish for anything, but in exchange, to become magical girls. As this is a magical girl series, many would expect a light-hearted and passive atmosphere, but think again, Madoka Magica actually has a very dark atmosphere, as the magical girls had to face evil, such as fighting witches. Because of this, Madoka Magica has completely rewritten the magical girl genre. Even with the dark atmosphere, the story was really well-developed throughout. The first few episodes of the anime were pretty slow-pacing, but as the story progressed, it became more intense. The plot was setted out really well and this causes the audiences to be 'on the edge of their seats' for the whole time.\n10/10\nArt:\nThe art and animation is being done by Shaft, the studio that also did the art for other series, such as Nisekoi and the Monogatari series. The art throughout the series suited the atmosphere really well, especially in scenes, such as when the magical girls fight the witches. It perfectly gives the impression of a dark and gloomy place and environment. The use of various colours on the characters makes them all look really unique in their own ways. The characters design were done really efficiently, which allows the audience to distinguish between the characters. The animation were very fluent in every scene, such as in the fighting scenes or passive scenes.\n10/10\nSound:\nThe Madoka Magica has an amazing soundtrack, from A to Z. The thing that stands out the most in this area is the OST. There were many emotion expressed in each songs, such as happiness in the OP, 'Connect' by ClariS, or despair in one of the ED, 'Magia' by Kalafina. The songs just fit every situation in the series perfectly and intensifies our feelings.\n10/10\nCharacters:\nDespite the small amount of characters in the series, this allows us to know more about each of the characters as they grow and change throughout the series. Madoka Magica does a good job of showing the audience, the past and backstories of all the characters. This helps us to evaluate the reason behind each characters' action and feelings towards certain situation. This makes each of the characters all different in their own ways.\n10/10 \nEnjoyment:\nOverall, Madoka Magica was a spectacular anime. The story was very well-written and developed really nicely. The art perfectly fits each scenes of the series. The music was impressive in every bit and the characters were really memorable.\n10/10\nConclusion:\nStory: Excellent in every aspect (10/10 Outstanding)\nArt: Nice-looking and intriguing to look at (10/10 Outstanding)\nSound: Suited the scenes' atmosphere efficiently (10/10 Outstanding)\nCharacters: Well-developed and memorable (10/10 Outstanding)\nEnjoyment: Hooked for the whole time (10/10 Outstanding)\nOVERALL SCORE: 10/10 (Very well-done and superb)"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    So, Mahou Shoujo animes are for little girls right? Hmm. How to put it. Neil Patrick Harris is gay by formality and title, but in actuality, he is probably one of the most awesome person to walk this Earth. Madoka Magica is pretty...gay.. by title, but in actuality it is probably one of the most awesome anime to have been aired. \nSTORY: Complete troll on the producer's part, this was actually advertised as a slice of life show....it's not....The show starts off with a normal school girl going to school (obviously) and having cute and moe fun with her friends, and by all means, the\n          \n        first two episodes can be categorized as a slice of life. But...when it hits the third episode...it basically makes you want to play Russian roulette with 6 bullets, crap your pants with rainbows, throw up your dinner, give you a lust for unicorn tears, while crying blood and eating your socks. Yes. Quite a mess of emotions to say the least. I will not say anything about the plot in detail from here because everything and anything will be a massive spoiler, but just be warned that you will be absolutely sh!t-faced after watching this show. It triggers painful emotions, with this extremely dark and depressing yet heartwarming story. The tags are there for a reason. The story wastes no time at all and in just 12 episodes it creates one of the most memorable story in your anime watching history. It revolves around hatred, jealousy, greed and everything in between, but mainly friendship and, in my opinion more importantly, loneliness and despair and overcoming odds. I honestly cannot say anymore without spoiling anything, but trust me, psychological and horror in my opinion are the biggest categories i would put this show under.\nART: Now this one is also very troll-y. The characters are so damn moe its almost disgusting at what they have to go through in these 12 episodes. The animation is veeery unique with its moe style with a few cg effects, and a world that gives a vibe of being sketched with colored pencil. Its very pleasing. The quality therefore is top notch as to how it is pulled off. I've never watched a mahou shoujo, but battling is a part of them i'm pretty sure. And the battles, to be honest, (at least in this show) is very well dished out, and i can safely compare them to the scenes of typical, no, top-notch shounen animes. The only thing is...the style of the battles...i cannot explain it but, the battles give the vibe that the artists were very high on various drugs while creating the show (you can decide for yourself if i'm joking or not). But yes, it is in the end, a very unique art style that sticks with you at how ironic the cuteness is compared to story of the show. \nSOUND: To be honest, its not memorable and its not the best, but instead, its unique (as in on drugs unique) to match with the rather different art style. I can say that the sound is perfect for the show at how it blends in with the scenes. But there are one or two OSTs that are gut wrenchingly messed up at how much emotion it puts you through.\nCHARACTER: This is heavily character driven, and is focused on the hardships the character have to overcome (...do they overcome them?...watch and find out :D ) Like i said, the main focus of the story is the power of friendship, what loneliness will do to a person and what despair and pressure will make a person do. It also deals with the concept of \"Be careful of what you wish for\" because what you get in return may not be what you want, or there are unexpected and horrible consequences. Every character....grows..? Yes, they do, however, growing isn't always positive, as someone can grow and mature in the wrong direction and Madoka Magica deals with this idea VERY. THOROUGHLY. \nENJOYMENT: The first two episodes are slow and to be honest you might be thinking why the hell am i watching this, but, this is necessary to set up the plot and themes. These two episodes are a waste, but that is exactly why this shows needs it. And then comes the infamous THIRD EPISODE. You will be very surprised in both a good and bad way at the way the show goes about. Episode 4-10 will make you want more and more after each consecutive episode as the story gets deeper and darker, but at the same time, somewhat brighter. In the final two episodes, i must say, it is, out of all the animes i have watched ( i have watched much more than i have on my MAL list, just too lazy to post them up), i experienced some of the most powerful emotional rollercoasters. The conclusion is epic and you will not regret watching it. I suggest that you do not finish this in one sitting, however tempting it may be, otherwise your brain will turn into a mushy grey matter like mine and leak out of your ear because of the beating it took. \nOVERALL: Amazing. This was my first mahou shoujo and it was recommended to me by a friend who told me how it will be the most f***ed up thing i will ever watch. It was pretty close, i think School Days still wins in this situation :P though. The morals that are presented are so good (i won't write them because they may be a bit spoilery) and the way the characters deal with them are both heartwarming and spirit breaking.  Nothing is perfect though, and the one \"flaw\" i would say is that, this is, in essence, a mahou shoujo, and it does get a bit sappy and girly, but that is the show, and i would like to think that it adds to the show. But it is in no way a true hinderence to the show. \nIs this a watch? Um, do you like anime? Yes you should f***ing watch it why are you even still reading this review? \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is the slightly shorter version, if you are interested, you can read the unabridged one as blog entry on my profile.\nStory:\nUsually the story of a magical girl anime is about the main character becoming…well, a magical girl, learning and growing and turning a whiny, timid girl into a confident, strong woman. Of course exceptions may exist (I am not an expert on this genre, even though I’ve watched some of the more prominent shows). Madoka takes a different road to get to the same destination. Madoka Magica is the story about a girl growing stronger and becoming a more confident person by NOT becoming\n          \n        a magical girl. Instead we witness her witnessing the paths of other magical girls and learning from their mistakes. People have accused her of being a nuisance to the story, but these folks seem to be missing the whole point of the show. Being a magical girl is not glamorous or fulfilling and least of all rewarding. The anime tries for a somewhat realistic approach of the subject. What would real girls do if they were given the opportunity, if they were fighting these abominationsI personally think that Madoka just seems grim to many people because it does not leave out the negative aspects of being a magical girl. Sure, other shows had that too, but having both, the realistic side of it and the negatives, might make it an uncomfortable watch. But one should not overlook the fact that the overall message it is trying to get across is a very positive one (even if it may not sound like it). Think before you act.\nBut without a thrilling story this would all go to waste, so let’s take a look at that. The characters have different opinions and philosophies, which often do not work out well with those of others. What begins as a fight between magical girls and witches evolves into a much, much bigger picture until we are left with nobody being truly right or wrong and the outcome being completely uncertain. Even the ending does not make itself clear. The road throughout these 12 episodes is filled with twists and turns and if you manage to watch Madoka completely unspoilered, you will be in for a couple of big surprises (unless you are really good at guessing). But Madoka becomes even BETTER when you rewatch it with full knowledge. Which brings me to another thing that this show does incredibly well. There are tons of little details that are easy to miss the first time around, heavy, heavy foreshadowing of later events in the earlier episodes. There is so much going on that one can only fully digest it in a rewatch.\nOne final thing before we move on. Often, I have whined about 12 episode anime being too short for their own good. That is not the case here. Sure, Madoka has the advantage of being an original creation, so it doesn’t need to convey itself from one medium to the other, but it is still remarkable that this anime has no filler whatsoever. Every scene, every small remark has a purpose. This allows for the rather complex story to be perfectly played out in just about four hours. In total, the writing and direction is absolutely stunning. The people at work here knew exactly what they were doing. I would never go so far as to call something perfect, but this is probably as close as it gets.\n10/10\nArt:\nCharacter movement is very smooth and looks natural, something I highly appreciate after watching one too many anime where this was not the case. It’s always a matter of how much it fits the work, so for comedies for example, unnaturally animated characters can be perfectly fine. In a serious show like this however, it’s crucial to make the people look like, well, people. The special effects work just the way they should, there is no badly used CGI that has sadly become the standard (and the recap movies are guilty of this as well).\nThe responsible person for character design is Ume Aoki, best known for the cutesy girls in Hidamari Sketch. While the girls in Madoka are not as cuddly as them, they are still designed to be cute. This was one of the major factors that were used to mislead the audience into thinking this would be a light-hearted show and to this day makes it very hard to convince people that Madoka is not a simple moe anime. One might argue that this design choice is irritating and distracts from the overall experience of the drama, but I disagree. The backgrounds are often overlooked when talking about Madokas artwork, but I think they play an integral part. The world of Madoka Magica looks highly technically advanced, which also makes it feel very cold. A very good example is the school, which is full of high tech and glass walls. It gives me a vibe of claustrophobia. On the other hand, the landscapes, which are often very effectively shown in wide angle shots, do the exact opposite. It should also be noted, that there are multiple real world buildings to be seen, which is a cool little bonus for those who recognize them.\nThis is probably a good opportunity to address a certain aspect of Shaft anime, the hardly finished TV version vs. the revised DVD/Blu-ray version. While this would usually be a huge problem and embarrassment, Shaft somehow manages to work with it, most prominently in the Monogatari series. In Madoka, the two versions can create two very different scenarios and even character aspects. For example, on TV, Mamis room was completely empty, sticking out like a sore thumb. The revision completely changes this to a room filled with tons of girlish accessories, which can ALSO be seen as a sign of her loneliness, only this time she tries hard to cover it underneath all the kitsch.\n10/10\nSound:\nYuki Kajiura does an incredible job here. Pieces like “Surgam Identidem”, “Nux Walpurgis” or “Symposium Magarum” make their scenes and leave an immense emotional impact. “Anima Mala” and “Venari Strigas” emphasize the darkness and tension respectively in the scenes they are in and the ever haunting “Sis Puella Magica” constantly emits a mysterious aura, like something is not quite right. I could talk for hours about almost any piece of the soundtrack. The opening song is one of the weakest of the soundtrack, but that is very subjective, since I don’t like J-Pop very much. It’s still a lot nicer to listen to than many other random anime openings, and it has a secondary function as well. As part of the false advertisement as a kid-friendly happy-go-lucky magical girl show, the opening song is exactly what the viewer would be expecting of such a thing. Same goes for the first ending song, that you may not even know, but it is used after the first two episodes on the blu-ray. After the mask went off, the ending was changed to the fantastic “Magia” by Kalafina. There’s one more ending for the blu-ray version of episode nine. It’s a cute duet done by Eri Kitamura and Ai Nonaka, the voice actors of Sayaka and Kyouko. Speaking of which…\nThe voice acting is very, very good. Actually not that surprising if you take a look at the cast of the show. Let’s start with the two I already mentioned. Kitamura is great at doing extreme emotions, that’s why she usually voices hot-blooded characters. With Sayaka, she can run riot in that department and she did. Kitamura is a perfect fit. Nonaka does more or less the opposite. Most of her more prominent roles fall into the category of moe, something Kyouko does not stand for (even though she is, but you know what I mean). She doesn’t even sound much different than usual, but she makes it work nonetheless. The fact that she is portrayed as a heartless monster (at first) but still sounds like a little girl makes her cruelness all the more jarring. Aoi Yuuki is an expert in voicing cute, innocent girls, so Madoka befits her nicely. But despite being very convincing as a whiney, weak girl, she is more than able to step up her game later on, when we see Madoka a lot more confident.\nChiwa Saito reprises her role as Senjougahara by playing another seemingly emotionless mystery girl. Later on, when we get to see more sides of Homura, she recalls her whole repertoire in an overwhelming fashion. It’s hard to believe that these two are the same person and that is exactly what we are supposed to feel. Emiri Katou does a convincing little alluring bunnycat, but not too cute, after all, Kyuubey is an authority figure (kind of). Kaori Mizuhashi does a wonderful job as big sister role model Mami Tomoe and at this point I have to stop myself, because I start to sound like an advertisement for these people’s agency. To make it short (too late boy), the voices are all done very well and with attention to detail, showcasing a lovely amount of passion for the project.\n10/10\nCharacters:\nThe cast of Madoka is relatively small, with only about a dozen named characters and only have of them recurring. However, these characters are interesting and fleshed out enough, that they are all you need to tell a compelling story, especially if you take the constant character development into account. All five girls have a solid backstory that explains their actions and thoughts and make them believable, while we are left mostly in the dark about Kyuubeys motivations and goals until the end. How multi-dimensional the characters are is especially blatant in the many, many dialogues Madoka has. Very often the girls can be seen in pairs of two, showing how much they differ from each other but also what they have in common. Due to their very different personalities, each of these pairs has vastly different dynamics.\nMadoka, the girl this show is named after seems to be the main character. Makes sense, right? But as the story progresses, this fact comes into question, as several plot points hint at somebody else being the real main character. She is however the center everything revolves around, but I can somewhat understand how one can overlook this as she is often damned to a passive role. She is anything but however, as long as she is given the chance. You see, even though she is a timid girl with low self-esteem, she is not a coward that just swells in her helplessness. That’s the point of her character, she does not like how things are going and she tries to find a way to change this. Homura is the other character one can say is the focus of this anime, though we don’t get to know much about her until late in the series. Her objectives and abilities remain mysterious for a long time, all we know is that she has knowledge that the others don’t. The fact that it is never fully clear which side she is on makes for a lot of tension for everyone and much like Madoka, she is trying to change things, but she is able to work towards this more actively. Once we get to take a look at who she really is, she becomes a much more sympathetic character, even though her goal is a very selfish one.\nEven though Madoka and Homura are the protagonists of Madoka Magica, the driving force of the story is somebody else: Sayaka. The constant descend into drama has a lot to do with her and how she is slowly but surely mentally broken. She starts out as the more confident and pro-active companion to Madoka and unlike her, she is very decisive and has a clear morality and opinion on things. She is very into the idea of becoming a magical girl and the fact that this utterly destroys her leaves a lasting impact on Madoka and changes her perspective accordingly. What I especially liked about Sayaka was how well handled her love story is. Usually, these feel like they are shoehorned in, but here, the whole thing is believable and makes sense in context. It also works in terms of showing us a different side of the otherwise brash and tomboyish Sayaka.\nAnd then there are Kyouko and Mami. Due to the rather short runtime of the anime, these two get the short end of the stick, which is a pity, but not necessarily a bad thing. They both serve a purpose to the story and in my opinion, the fact that there is much left to explore with them makes them the most interesting of the magical girls. There is a lot that is told between the lines, especially when it comes to Mami. We get to see her as this proper and a bit cocky big sister type that acts as the mentor of Madoka and Sayaka and only at the very end we get a glimpse of what lies underneath: loneliness. She is not only lonely, she becomes possessive the very moment the possibility of a friendship presents itself. Everything Kyouko says and does early on leaves the impression that she is a villain, but this is not a world of black and white. She is more or less right, there is no turning back and now it’s all about survival. That’s awful, but that’s how it is and there is nothing you can do about it. Only when she has a change of heart does her world crumble as well.\nKyuubey is an interesting villain, as he is not evil in a tradtional sense. He lacks emotions (that’s what he claims at least) and most of all empathy. The magical girls are merely means for the purpose of his bigger goal and he couldn’t care less how much they suffer or if they survive or die horribly. In fact, their suffering plays into his cards so he is pushing them towards the edge in a passive-aggressive manner quite often. How much of what he says is the truth has been the subject of heated debates for years and I think that is what makes him so intriguing. All we know is that he is the root of the problem for everybody else. I’m going to refrain from talking that much about the rest of the cast, they are of less importance (though they aren’t exactly unimportant, mind you) than the six main characters and are therefore fleshed out a lot less, but they still fulfill their roles exactly like they are supposed to to keep the story moving.\n10/10\nEnjoyment:\nMadoka Magica is a well-written, well-animated anime with an interesting cast, a fantastic soundtrack and most of all, a plot that makes sense from start to finish. I’m sure many of you will be able to find something to pick on, but for me, this show is as good as it gets and I have yet to see something better. Everything works, there are no weak spots. I highly recommend Madoka for anyone, no matter what kind of anime you usually prefer. Sure, my opinion might be clouded by Madoka being my favourite anime, but aren’t all reviews subjective anyway? I think this anime justifies all the hype, even if internet hipsters like to bash it. I couldn’t find a flaw that would have made me not give a perfect score (my very first in 100 reviews).\n10/10\nOverall:\n10.0/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica was one of those series that I had always heard people talk about, but never really knew anything about it or had any interest in watching it. Now that I've finally gotten around to it, I feel like an idiot for taking so long.\nI went into this series knowing without any idea what it was going to be. All I knew was that there were girls who had magic powers and frilly costumes. I assumed it was going to be some cheesy fantasy story--not that I wasn't expecting to like it. Madoka managed to defy every single expectation I had, to\n          \n        the point that I can only assume that that was exactly what it was aiming for.\nIt's hard to say what made this series so fantastic without spoiling anything, so I'll just talk about this as generally as possible. Every aspect of this series was excellent. I was not expecting a show about magical girls to make me think as much as it did. The art style of the witch labyrinths was so surreal and creepy, definitely making up for the visuals of the normal world which were good but not great. Everything I'm saying right now is stupid because there is a lot more that I want to say but I don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it.\nMy point being: watch this series. Whether or not the magical girl thing seems like something you're interested in, I can't recommend this strongly enough. Madoka is the only series I have ever felt comfortable giving a perfect 10/10 rating. To be perfectly honest, it's not a genre that I'm particularly interested in, and I'm not sure if I'll ever come back and watch it again. Regardless, I'm glad I watched it. If you like the mahou shoujo genre, watch Madoka. If you don't, watch Madoka anyway.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    - English Review (Translated version)\nFirst of all I want say when I started with anime I never would have imagine me choosing to see something as \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica\". Because the genre \"magical girl\" was very far from I usually see. Call it prejudices, call it ignorance or call it common sense, whatever, but this is a fact. The fact is I do not regret.\nI mean, \"Madoka Magica\" is still a \"magical girl\" anime (from the title): there are young girls fighting evil with elaborate dresses and detailed choreographies when they transforming/dressing, but... it has something different. It has a darker and melancholy tone,\n          \n        it has a latent and constant mournful atmosphere, it has more profounds dialogues than the average of this genre. And this is something that should be noted.\nIt is short, only 12 episodes, due to it has a fast and vertiginous rhythm (which is not the same as full of action and battles). Bardly there is time for a little introduction to get you into the story and then the plot begins without respite. It really does not need more, because it has an almost perfect narrative structure. The scriptwriters mark the tempo between explanations, action and moments of calm with brilliant form. All this spiced up with some of the most spectacular script twists I have ever seen (I think Shyamalan's films). I will not go into too much detail to not spoil anyone who has not seen it (although then I see no point in reading in detail about it, my fixation), but I think it is necessary to name two of them: especially the last, that give way to a spectacular final stretch. But without forgetting one at the beginning that proves \"Madoka\" has something special regarding similar works. Surely whoever has finished it will know to recognize what moments I mean.\nThe story at first seems to be simple, without too many pretensions, but little by little it is complicated at times and, as I said before, in the final stretch stands as a complex story, but totally compact and perfectly finished. No loose ends. Even the scriptwriters add in their plot real moments and characters of the history of the humanity. A great work.\nThe cast of characters is not very high in number, just four or five recurring characters and same number of secondary. It is not that they have a remarkable depth (nor time to develop them so much), but well, nor is it necessary. Each one of the protagonists has its style, covering very well the range of different personalities. Secondaries have practically testimonial appearances, although personally  I want stand up Madoka's mother. Towards the middle of the series it is a conversation between mother and daughter that is pure gold, talking about happiness, good/bad actions and mistakes in life. Very profounds dialogues that I never thought to find here.\nLast but not least, because in my opinion it is one of the strongest points of \"Madoka Magica\" is the technical section. A real wonder both visually and musically. The art style is very beautiful, original. Special mention to the psychedelic, disconcerting and obscure personality that acquires in \"barriers of the witches\", shocking at least. The music is not far behind and I think I'm not very wrong when I say that the main them (both \"normal\", as the instrumental or slow version) is one of the best melodies I've ever heard in an anime.\nIt does not matter if you are not a fan of \"Sailor Moon\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" and others with this style. \"Madoka Magica\" goes far beyond its gender. It is an interesting, compact and surprising story. It is a brilliant technical section. It is a breath of fresh air within the clichés and copies. You should see it.\n\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\nVaya por delante que cuando empecé con esto del anime en ningún momento me habría imaginado eligiendo algo para ver como \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica\". No por nada, sino porque el género \"magical girl\" andaba muy lejos de lo que a priori encajaría con mis gustos. Llámalo prejuicios, llámalo ignorancia o llámalo sentido común, lo que sea, pero esto es un hecho. El caso es que por una razón u otra he acabado viéndola y desde luego no me arrepiento de haberlo hecho.\nQuiero decir, \"Madoka Magica\" no deja de ser un anime \"magical girl\" (desde el título): hay chicas jóvenes luchando contra el mal con elaborados vestidos y detalladas coreografías al transformarse/vestirse, pero... tiene algo diferente. Tiene un tono más oscuro y lúgubre, tiene una atmósfera latente y constante de sufrimiento, tiene unos diálogos más profundos que la media de este género. Y esto es algo que se nota y eleva el conjunto.\nEs cortita, apenas 12 capítulos, debido a ello tiene un ritmo rápido, vertiginoso (que no es lo mismo que lleno de acción y batallas). Apenas hay tiempo para una pequeña introducción para meterte en la historia y entonces la trama echa a andar sin respiro. Realmente no necesita más, porque tiene una estructura narrativa casi perfecta. Los guionistas marcan el tempo entre explicaciones, acción y momentos de calma de forma brillante. Todo esto aderezado con algunos de los giros de guión más espectaculares que he podido ver (pienso en Shyamalan). No voy a entrar en demasiado detalle para no hacer spoiler a quien no la haya visto (aunque no le veo sentido a leer en detalle sobre ella entonces, manías mías), pero creo que es necesario nombrar dos: especialmente el último, que da pie a una recta final espectacular. Pero sin olvidar uno que hay casi al inicio con el que uno se da cuenta de que \"Madoka\" tiene algo especial respecto a obras parecidas. Seguro que quien la haya terminado sabrá reconocer a qué momentos me refiero.\nLa historia al principio parece que será simple, sin demasiadas pretensiones, pero poco a poco va complicándose por momentos y, como he comentado antes, en la recta final se erige como una historia compleja, pero totalmente compacta y perfectamente rematada. Sin cabos sueltos. Incluso los guionistas se dan el lujo de encajar en su trama momentos y personajes reales de la historia de la humanidad. Un trabajo excelso.\nEl elenco de personajes no es muy elevado en cuanto a número, apenas cuatro o cinco personajes recurrentes y no muchos más secundarios. No es que tengan una profundidad destacable (ni tiempo para desarrollarlos tanto), pero ojo, tampoco es que sea necesario. Cada una de las protagonistas tiene su estilo y cumple con su papel, cubriendo muy bien el rango de diferentes personalidades. Los secundarios tienen apariciones prácticamente testimoniales, aunque yo personalmente me quedo con la madre de Madoka. Hacia la mitad de la serie hay una conversación entre madre e hija que es oro puro, hablando sobre felicidad, buenas/malas acciones y errores en la vida. Diálogos muy profundos que nunca pensé encontrarme aquí.\nPor último y no por ello menos importante, ya que en mi opinión es uno de los puntos más fuertes de \"Madoka Magica\", está el apartado técnico. Una auténtica maravilla tanto visualmente como musicalmente. El estilo de arte es muy bonito, original. Mención especial a la personalidad psicodélica, desconcertante y oscura que adquiere en las \"barreras de las brujas\", impactante cuanto menos. La música no se queda atrás y creo que no ando muy errado cuando digo que la melodía principal (tanto la \"normal\", como la versión instrumental o la lenta) es una de las mejores que he oído nunca en un anime. Diría que la simbiosis que realiza con la historia es imprescindible. Por lo demás gran nivel en general y opening/endings que cumplen sobradamente.\nNo importa si no eres fan de \"Sailor Moon\", \"Do-Re-Mi\" y otras del estilo o si preferirías cortarte un brazo antes que ponerte a ver un anime de \"magical girls\". \"Madoka Magica\" va mucho más allá de su género. Es una historia interesante, compacta y sorprendente. Es un apartado técnico brillante. Es un soplo de aire fresco dentro de los clichés y las copias. Tienes que verla.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    All in all, Madoka Magica is quite an overrated anime. Which isn't to say that it isn't enjoyable, but as has probably been iterated to death over the internet already, it does nothing that hasn't been done before, nor does it look particularly stunning. It's a mostly well-done little anime that you can easily binge down in a few hours.\nIt starts off slow and perhaps a bit annoying, but builds up steadily to the big reveal of what's actually going on.\nNot to give away too much, suffice it to say that it is a (and this might be subjective) rather innocent story about the balance\n          \n        of happiness and suffering in the world.\nAs everyone has probably heard already, it was originally marketed deliberately misleadingly as a cheerful feel-good show, which it certainly isn't. The atmosphere grows darker with every episode, and even if you know what's coming and/or aren't particularly invested in the story or characters, eventually it WILL pull on your heart strings, thanks in very large part to the excellent voice acting performances (in original japanese, that is.)\nAfter all the misdirections and little twists on certain tropes it boils down to a very basic yet touching little story that's delivered well. It also isn't particularly gory or scary, but some might find it a bit depressing.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    Note: I ain't no english speaker\nMadoka Magica is overrated. That being said, Madoka Magica is a great anime. I have watched this anime several times analyzing and taking into consideration all the aspects that compose its essence, substance and style. Due to this analysis I've been able to reach different conclusions regarding what aspects of Madoka Magica make it a great anime, and in which aspects this anime fails miserably. Before hating, please I encourage you to read this review carefully.\nPRODUCTION VALUE\nOn this point I am pretty sure that nobody will argue with me: Madoka Magica is visually amazing and sounds beautiful.\nThe overall art style\n          \n        changes from joyful and full of colour to dark and creepy in a matter of seconds. But this transition is done with great animation, stunning effects and specially breathtaking backgrounds. Combined with moe characters, this use of art and visuals add a lot to the shock factor that the anime aspires to.\nThe voice acting was really well done and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura is masterpiece as always (although I am getting a little bit bored with her work).\nSTORY\nAlright, here is when things start to go downhill. I am not going to spoil anything but you should read MAL's resume in order to understand where I am going. Basically, Madoka Magica is supposed to be a deconstruction of the magical girl genre the same way NGE was a deconstruction of the mecha genre. Madoka bets on its shock factor: it deceives you into thinking that you are watching a cute and nice show about girls with pretty dresses and magic, and suddenly it turns into a dark world full of suffering and misery in which the threat of death is real and you need more than just \"the power of love and magic\" to survive. The combination of top-notch fights with stunning visuals, and absolutely heart-breaking situations in a dark and constantly deppressing world was a lot of fun.\nHowever, in terms of story Madoka Magica felt unsatisfactory due to two major problems: conclusion and pacing. The first one is easier to explain: Madoka's ending sucks, big time. Is a complete asspull \"deus ex machina\" that leaves enormous unsolved plotholes, unanswered questions and feels like it was made up at the last moment. And no, the 3rd movie didn't provide a satisfactory conclusion either. It just made the plotholes bigger and threw more questions on the table. The pacing problem requires me to talk about the characters, but let's just say that the series felt rushed. It was going too fast.\nCHARACTERS\nConsidering that Madoka was supposed to be a psychological thriller, you would expect Death Note-tier or NGE-tier characters that could drive the anime instead of the action and the story. Well, sadly Madoka Magica's characters are average at best.\nRegarding characters I feel obligated to discard both Mami and Kyoko. Mami is a Mary Sue, supposedly the most perfect of the magical girls, who lacks any personality beyond her super-confident attitude, any backstory or any motivation. As for Kyoko, she is your typical badass character, with not-so-clear motivations or objectives, a 5 min. speech backstory, and a rushed, messy and inconsistent development.\nKaname Madoka is one of the (if not THE) blandest main character in the history of anime. She lacks any kind of development. Her personality is  nonexistent, except for her obvious shyness and fearfulness, and the only thing she does is question herself for 12 episodes on wether or not she should become a magical girl. With the exception of the totally unsatisfactory conclusion, she plays no role in the anime. Literally Sayaka could have taken her spot and be a better MC.\nThis leads me to Sayaka and Homura, the two characters that save this cast from being downright terrible. Sayaka starts off as a naive and energetic character. Contrary to Madoka she has clear goals, and she has a multi-directional perspective as a character, meaning she has different worries and objectives. Her development is really well handled and she evolves clearly but with subtlety, turning into a completely different character (but not in a messy way). Unlike Sayaka, Homura lacks a multi-directional perspective. She has one goal and one goal only, although she indeed pays attention to different things and she approaches her objective through different means, meaning she has a wider range of thought than most characters. She also has a clear backstory that reflects her intentions, and a development just as well handled as Sayaka's.\nAll I am going to say about Kyuubey is that he is awesome and he totally rocks.\nBack to the pacing problem, it has a lot to do with Madoka. I feel that the anime didn't have enough time for her and instead they just threw her development on the last episode as a big ball of unexplained things. This seems weird, wasn't SHE supposed to be the main character? I am sure that having Sayaka as main and completely erasing Madoka would ended much better for the series. Or having more time to focus on Madoka might have gave us a well developed girl that transformed from a moeblob to an all-around 3rd dimensional goddess.\nCONCLUSION\nDid I enjoy Madoka Magica? Yes, I did. I did greatly enjoyed it. As a matter of fact I constantly encourage people to watch it because I believe is one of the most fun and well done anime I have ever seen. On the other hand though it is true that it poorly handled its main character development, its pacing and ending, thus leaving a bad taste in many viewer's mouth that maybe were expecting too much.\nStill a great deliver by Shaft that I higly reccomend.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=15,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Now I hated Sailor Moon. And I HATED Tokyo Mew Mew. I was just not a fan of the whole magical girl thing. It was boring, corny, and the powers were usually not that great. Needless to say, when Madoka Magica aired, I almost didn't watch. And after the first couple episodes, I almost dropped it. It's a good thing I did because if I did, I would have dropped a fantastic series.\nIf you were asked to sell your soul as a magical girl in exchange for one wish, how long would it take to answer? What wishes would you debate in your head? Would\n          \n        it be worth it? Just that alone is a dramatic scenario, and it peeked my interest, but only slightly since it seemed to me like it might end up like another mahou shoujo anime. However, three episodes in to Madoka Magica  I'm basically smacked across the face with something I didn't expect (you'll know when you see it). Basically, the girly giggly anime is nowhere to be found. Instead, a first class action drama is in its place. The story goes deeper than many anime I've see, and who would've thought that it would come out of an anime that looks like a kid's cartoon. A dark atmosphere combined with a top-notch scenario, however, couldn't be further than childlike.\nThe art is quite unique compared to other series of the genre. When the characters are fighting witches, the art is both impressive and disturbing, yet simple in its concept. That kind of art has been seen before such as in Tsumiki no Ie, but not in such a way that involves fast-paced action. The character designs are quite simple, but are effective none the less. However, this is not neccessarily an eye-candy series, so don't go into hoping for visuals that blow your mind. If that's the case, look elsewhere. Otherwise, expect above average visuals but nothing more.\nThe soundtrack floored me. Within the first minute, an insert (which also becomes the ED) sucks you into the action. In contrast, the OP conveys and innocence, and yet a sadness that matches the show perfectly. Also, the seemingly Celtic/Sacred feel of the BGMs is something the likes of which I've never heard before, and am impressed still. The soundtrack for this series is easily in my top five I've heard.\nThe characters are quite believable given the circumstances. Not only that, but when it all comes down to it, a human is a human. When something happens that affects them all, they all feel the same. Showing it, maybe not. But feeling it yes, and Madoka Magica shows this nicely. When faced with a decision that can change your life, how will you act? If you have trouble figuring that out, think about the characters of Madoka Magica. In half-assed anime, their decisions would be immediate with no emotion, but in this case, it is how it would be in real life, which is impressive. Madoka takes a cautious and somewhat cowardly approach. Homura takes a more friendly approach by accepting to be accepted. Sayaka takes a selfish approach by doing it for someone she loves. Mami takes a desperate approach because declining would result in death. And Kyouko takes the more thoughtful approach and accepts in order to better her dads career. Different people, different reasons, different outcomes.\nMadoka Magica will be an anime that will remain with me for a while. Compared to anime from the present, it is among my top 10. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who watches anime for a deep and dramatic experience, and I promise you will receive it.\n        "},

That being focused on Magical Girls. I have to say this was quite a shock on what I expected. But it wasn't anything too drastic. I found myself confused at the end on exactly what I felt about the show. \nI do have to say early on much of it was spoiled for me so when certain scenes came on they didn't have the same effect, which means for a good portion of it I\n          \n        was bored watching it. \nStory \nThe story was interesting. It started out slow and was difficult to pay attention. I found myself enjoying the first 3 episodes better before the show turned into the depressive state of a teenage girl. This wasn't particularly bad to view, but wasn't that interesting and I've seen similar happen plenty of times before; Neon Genesis Evangelion anyone? \nThe show really picked up at episode 8 and so the ending played out well in my books. The most important aspect, the story was enough for me to boost up my score as it did improve my enjoyment of the series. \nThis show was quite good for a show about selling your soul to the devil. \nTech \nWell this was the area which this show struggled the most. The artstyle was poor for most of it, with some pretty shocking style for the characters design. The witch fight sequences where interesting with the art direction, but those gave me the unofficial title which I had been referring to the anime; being \"The dangers of Gas leaks, the anime\". \nI have no real complaints about the background art, the designs of the characters, the prop art, music and sound. I did watch the english dub so the voice acting wasn't that good, but it wasn't that distracting from the story. I did cringe a little however. \nThe opening sequence really didn't suit the show well but the song was good; the credit sequence really suited the feeling of ths show well and I really liked that song and I listen to it often. \nCharacters \nThe characterisation of this show is the strongest point. The designs where all good and the personalities the characters had were well emulated. I didn't really find myself liking any character particularly more than the others however. I think I did like Mami more then the others, but not that much. \nI did think that they perhaps focused a bit to much on Sayaka for a while and her relationship with Kyousuke, which did steal away from who should have been the main focus, being Madoka. \nConclusion \nOverall I'm happy with how this show turned out. I enjoyed it and the only real negatives are from a bit of nitpicking. I was surprised how much I liked it in the end even though the ending was a bit lame. I think it earned the score which I'm giving it of 8/10. \nScore: 8/10\n        "},

Okay are you ready? Let's begin\n\nStory\nMadoka Magica is the story of a girl named Madoka-- just kidding, regardless of the name in the tittle its more centered around Hamoru as this stoic and almost emotionless mysterious Magical girl with a rivalry against the Pikachu of the show, Kyubey but this digimon reject is not what he appears, he's the one who makes contracts with middle school girls making them into Magical Girls, she seems to care alot about Madoka becoming a Magical Girl because as light hearted as it may sound a Magical Girls are serious bussiness.\nI enjoy the twist and rules set in the universe and how instead of everything being all magic and rainbows its actually filled with alot of tragedy and suffering, as fun as magic may sound when something irregular comes in contact with something normal chaos in bound to occur.\nThink about it, when a hero goes on an a magical adventure and he struggles alot and suffers quite a bit who's to blame for all this? Magic of course (well many series and genres have their own little abnormal things really) like seriously when have you ever seen a superhero with no villain like just someone saving people from burning houses and such, exactly thats just the starting point there can't be a hero if there is no villain its like ying and yang, The Joker and Batman like that you see.\nLike how for example in Fullmetal Alchemist Edward and Alphonse set off on a journey to get their bodies back but end saving the world along the way but what do they save it from? Alchemy regardless of the villain they use an abnormal power like the hero except with evil intentions but its still the same source so if Alchemy didn't exist neither would the villain, and Madoka Magica presents this with Magical Girls and Witches when a Magical Girl's Soul Gem becomes a Grief seed they become Witches, even though a Magical Girl's duty is to protect the world from Witches in the end they themselves become what they fight, its like they say \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain\"\n\nCharacters\nKyubey: ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼ Besides the fact he's plushy material there's actually some dark simbolism behind him, Kyubey sounds like Kyuubi which is a demon fox from Japanese folklore, a person sells their soul to a demon to get what they want, Kyubey makes contracts with middle school girls granting them a wish in exchange for their eternal servitude fighting witches, Kyubey isn't necessarily evil per say but him and his species don't possess emotions, without these emotions he really can't tell the difference between infringing upon someone's humanity considering he puts a Magical Girl's soul into a gem and their formal body becomes a container for when they aren't fighting witches. (INCUBATOR)\nSayaka: At first I thought she was just the tough girl of the squad and well she is but she actually has a pretty deep character this boy he likes he suffered and accident so he can't walk temporarily and can't play his violin (this isn't temporary) so when she becomes a Magical Girl her wish is kind and unselfish though she didn't get to have him like she deserved but thats just life I guess in the end she was alright with what happened and didn't really do anything to stop it, that takes courage to let someone go like that, massive respect.\nKyoko: my favorite character tbh she has a rough and dangerous attitude and at first I thought she was just a cocky trouble making girl but I later found out she just wanted to make her father and family happy, though sadly even though she had good intentions it ended horribly with her dad realizing what was going on, people only listened to his beliefs because of the wish she made so he went crazy and shit just got darker and traumatizing from that point, it was then that I understood why Kyoko acts the way she does, after all that honestly a person either becomes a depressed mess or grows with the experience into a tougher skinned person and she really has that talk the talk and walk the walk style of personality she's confident but she's earned it because she was quite powerful.\nMami: Oh Mami oh sweet sweet Mami, I really liked her character design she thicc was really looking forward to her character progression but then episode 3 happened, it seemed like a waste to get rid of a potentially motherly character of the group, I realize this was done to set the tone of the story but even then I expected Madoka to wish her back to life or something (oh well she killed Kyoko in a timeline so maybe this was for the best) since she appeared in the opening but it sadly never happened, her wish wasn't anything meaningful or special because she was dying and then Kyubey offered her a wish so really nothing to write home about it makes you wonder if Kyubey takes advantage of dying girl's like this on a regular basis its certainly a guaranteed method of doing it actually.\nMadoka: Even though she's the main character there isn't much to talk about, she doesn't have a traggic back story or is in love or anything she's just a normal girl with a normal life (until the Kyubey came along of course) she's willing to help and save a friend no matter what and her wish for becoming a Magical Girl was really intelligent in the end she achieved God hood and become an entity that shifted the universe to be less cruel, she made the ultimate sacrifice, a true heroin, despite what I said Madoka is not a bad character by a long shot.\nHomura: my second favorite and most people's favorite she's very cool and mysterious I found her to be this enigma that I couldn't rap my head around at first I thought she just didn't want anymore Magical Girl's in general but then I remember the first scene of episode 1 when she was fighting that powerful Witch it kinda hinted at the fact this all happened before because Madoka was having that dream, the whole time paradox event was foreshadowed by that, and you know her amount of skill in being a Magical Girl makes perfect sense because she's relived the month in which the series takes place in, a multitude of times so eventually through trial and error she got the hang of it all, she tried chaging Madoka's fate to become a Magical Girl then a Witch but she just made it worst because of all the collected energy of all timelines tied to Madoka but isn't a waste at all actually because it resulted in Madoka having an extremely powerful wish, she's been through alot in her life and I'm glad it wasn't for nothing.\nAnimation\nMadoka Magica looks fantastic it has excellent and fluid movements in the fight scenes, Witches and the dimension they exist in look trippy as hell, congrats to the animators because this looks fantastic you don't see that kind of animation nowadays it looks very kiddie but at the same time like the stuff of nightmares, the scenery is very well detailed aswell, and the final episode was a huge Gurren Lagann moment, thanks Shaft! You the best! would you mind taking on Toaru? J.C. Staff is kinda lazy and you guys can make everything looks much better\nSoundtrack\nI love Sis Puella Magica, really gives you that dark magic type of feel, the instruments include, a flute, cello, 3 guitars, harp, vibraphone and percussion, its one of those themes that just get stuck in your head, its great.\nThe opening and ending are nice, the opening is very misleading making you think its just a normal Magical Girl show when its so much more, the ending is when things actually get real as Madoka walks into the darkness passing her friends who do not move (perhaps representing the fact they die except Homura because she does move) and she starts running and later ends up in the eye of the Witch, believe this a reference to the eye of the storm and how Madoka is at the center of it all since she can become a Witch that can destroy the planet, and man is it creepy, reminds me of Majora's Mask oh the memories\nFinal Thoughts\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of those legendary anime that stand above their respective genre, like how Hunter X Hunter another amazing series is a deconstruction of the Shounen genre, honestly Madoka Magica will stand the test of time as one of the greatest anime ever made, it has joy, depression relating to how the real world is and that the world isn't perfect even with Magic and thats just a flaw we have to accept as a human limitation of this Earth we live on\nI give it a 10/10 though this is just my opinion btw and go watch it again because it is true Magic﻿\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    I’m going to be completely honest in this review. I was quite hesitant and sceptical about watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica purely because magical girls and all that jazz are usually something that I don’t like to watch. But I am pleased to say that when I did go ahead to watch this anime, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn’t know what to expect, though I had seen it floating around for quite some time. The first episode past and I was still not convinced on the show but after the second episode was finished, I found myself up to episode 8 just like that and before I\n          \n        knew it I had completed the show.\nThe concept and storyline is not like what you would expect from a ‘magical girl’ kind of anime. The theme of Madoka Magica is tragic and grievous, depressing and heart-rending. It follows the lives of a middle school girl Madoka Kaname and her friend Sayaka Miki who meet Kyuubey who is a ‘mysterious and friendly’ familiar who can grant the girls any wish they would like. All they have to do is make a contract with him and become a Magical Girl. Whilst the idea seems intriguing and fascinating little do they realise that with that power comes severe and serious consequences that would change their lives forever. I don’t want to really give the storyline away to those who are yet to see this anime but just know that Puella Magi Madoka Magica is not your light romance/comedy. \nThemes: The main themes in this anime are friendship, nothing is for free, and the manipulation of evil. \nFriendship is key part of this anime as it’s what keep the girls fighting through and battling each witch. But the power of friendship and loyalty is something I noticed occurring repeatedly throughout the show eg. Homura looks out for Madoka and protects her as best she can from becoming a Magical Girl. \nAnother theme is the manipulation of evil. Evil twists deeper and deeper into the storyline, Kyuubey as cute and innocent as he may look is quite deceitful and insidious. Since he cannot understand the values and morals that humans carry, he looks upon them as merely useless shells. The only part worth capturing is their souls which he can then make immortal. The lesson the girls learn and come to realise is that nothing is for free. Wishes may be granted but in turn, making someone else happy will create despair and doom for others. Changing destiny, is something that is not to be messed with, as it can alter and destroy all of what they’ve known. I found the story to be quite engaging, interesting, and twisting the usual spin on ‘magical girls’ was a surprising and new experience for me to see. \nArt:\nI found the artwork of this series to be very simplistic and different. I can’t say that I was a huge fan of the way the characters were drawn but I did enjoy the futuristic settings and environments in which the story is set in. The houses and schools in this anime seem spacious and ultra modern which makes the school setting different from most anime I have seen. The contrast between light and dark colours portray a statement in the ‘Good vs Evil kind of way. Though the colour palate can be quite gloomy and dreary at times, the contrast between their world and the characters clothing and colour scheme is something I seemed to have noticed quite a bit. It makes me feel like the characters are trapped in their world and cannot escape it until they fight off the darkness that is suffocating them.\nCharacters: The character development was like a journey through an electric storm. Thinking you know what to expect from these characters and then they surprise you with devastating and heart breaking backstories that changed the way I perceived the character. From Kyoko Sakura’s past to Sayaka Miki’s future. Each one is so depressing and some what emotional that it gives a depth into how magic can destroy lives. Through the character of Madoka, I feel like I can relate to how she couldn’t fit in or do anything really extraordinary. She wanted to prove to everyone around her that she could protect others too. Her dejected facade made watching this show interesting because you didn’t know what she was going to do. The characters are each individuals and have their own morals and values of what they believe is right and wrong. I found that the characters in this anime were memorable, my favourite being Kyoko Sakura. Homura Akemi, was the silent badass type which I immediately loved. Sayaka Miki started off alright but gradually disliked her more and more. A character that I absolutely loved was Kyoko Sakura. Her fieriness, her blunt and straight up personality is something that made her stand out in this series. I personally think she is the best character in this series and her backstory is quite tragic and depressing. All the characters take dark and twisted turns, but keeps the story engaging.\nSound: In many aspects, the soundtrack I found was perfectly suited for this anime. The opening theme Connect suited the atmosphere of the show quite well. I wouldn’t say it was my favourite opening or that it is one I found very memorable but it provided a nice touch to the series. I found the second ending theme Magia so perfect for this anime. It really captured the emotions and deep aspects of evil and manipulation that is conveyed in show. \nEnjoyment: Overall I think Puella Magi Madoka was worth watching. Everyone is obviously entitled to their own opinion but I can say that this show isn’t for everyone. I enjoyed the pace of this anime and the overall concept of themes behind it. It left me thinking about just how cruel life can get sometimes and the obstacles we have to face in order to live. I would give this anime a 8/10.\n        "},

And why they can't explain why do they like it if you ask them? Madoka is the worst anime ever I have seen. I still regret about time I've spent on watching this pathethic cartoon with no story, characters. I enjoyed only soundtracks of Yuku Kajiura and that's all. Besides good soundtracks there is nothing good to say about this cartoon. After watching this I've lost my respect to Shaft. The only good anime they did is Natsu no Arashi.

		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. \nSo, my number one complaint with this show is the pacing. I've seen people hype on this show all the time, so I decided to give in and take a look. \nSo for the first eight or so episodes, Madoka doesn't make a contract with Kubey and it's dreadfully boring because of it. There's some fighting here and there, some crying, some dark and depressing revelations etc., some other girl makes a contract and whatever but none of that matters. I started this show to see the title character, Madoka, get some fucking Magica on. But it doesn't happen. \nIt's not\n          \n        until the very, very end, episode 11/12, and I get that they're trying to do something different, pulling a bait and switch, but I don't think the execution was on point. They definitely subverted my expectations, but in a way that left me bored and frustrated rather than interested. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I know the packaging of this work is very off-putting and pink, but in its sweet creamy shell it hides a refreshingly bittersweet core. I have resisted this show forever, even though it was constantly recommended to me by Netflix and came up in searches for mystery/psychological genres. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or Puella Magi if it's easier on the eyes) takes a hot sec to gain momentum, but once you finish episode 3, it's liftoff from there. Each episode after that escalates the depth of its characters and both raises and answers questions. \nStory - 10\nMahou Shoujo is set up relatively simple and the\n          \n        world that the characters are in are explained quickly in the beginning. Madoka Kanama, a very average 8th grader, grows up with a happy family and has plenty of friends at school. She has a cute little brother, a businesswoman mom who's her best friend, and a househusband dad who cooks. One day, she rescues Kyubey, a cute critter, from a new transfer student at her school, she is thrown into the world of magical girls. Kyubey will grant a single wish to these chosen girls. In return, they must become magical girls and fight witches. Win-win, right?\nThe anime cleverly lulls you into the fantasy you hopelessly expect will happen, and then it peels it away layer by layer. The magical world is seemingly explained very briefly and efficiently in the first 2 episodes, and it seems like a basic premise. However, more information is revealed every episode, and the physical danger of fighting \"witches\" soon seems trivial compared to the true trade-off of the win-win deal the viewer has come to know. What is initially a fantasy about child heroines making wishes turns out to be the world you would expect in reality - no one gets a free miracle. Puella Magi accomplishes through excellent pacing. No scene is wasted, and each episode is densely packed with new findings, important details, and foreshadowing brought on by minute details and day-to-day conversations. Gen Urobuchi is known for making his characters suffer, and the emotional burden dished out in the story would overwhelm any preteen girl, yet at the same time the plot is believable. Urobuchi doesn’t betray his universe. The ending seemed confusing at first, but upon a rewatch, it works for me. \nIn many ways, the event of becoming a magical girl can be seen as a metaphor to real challenges girls must face, and it is no coincidence that the characters are teenage girls. Parallels of this event have been drawn to one losing her virginity (and each character’s respective reaction to that event), marriage, having children, or simply becoming an adult.\nCharacters - 8\nThis is where I think the show has opportunity for improvement, but it is by no means bad. The characters do carry an incredible amount of symbolism and are diverse in their attitudes. Their color schemes all fit very well. Madoka (pink) is gentle and has the happiest background lives of all the characters on the show. Many consider her to be quite ordinary, since unlike in any conventional series, the protagonist doesn’t just become a magical girl right away – rather, this is actually used as a plot device, because the actual event of becoming a magical girl is made so much more significant in this anime. Sayaka (blue) draws many parallels to the original Little Mermaid, even down to her fascination with music and perky, rash personality. Mami (yellow) is a believer in justice and doing the right thing, and her bright appearance fits that trope. Kyoko (red) is hot-headed and bloodthirsty but in some ways might be the nicest of them all. Finally, Homura (black) is the one darkened by her lack of hope of correcting a mistake she made. Her character is writing at its finest. Many of her actions and words may seem strange or inexplicable, but viewers will come to understand. Therefore, at the end, it actually makes sense to re-watch the show when you’ve finished after knowing her rationale for her behavior. The most incredible part is that Homura’s abilities and what she uses it for completely parallels the action of re-watching the show from the beginning. Kyubey (white)... well. The whiteness is a reflection of his blank characterization, and that’s pretty much all I can say. The other characters may lack buildup behind their actions, may seem to change their mind quickly, or requires a little push for some viewers to really invest in, Kyubey is a consistently strong character in that he represents a question very relevant to our real society. He... She... It? Values the greater good, which is something any emotional human being would consider important, only Puella Magi flips this idea on its head and show how our emotions can actually be at odds with the optimal outcome for society. It’s up to the viewer to decide what they consider more important, or if the greater good is worth the despair the characters have to face.  \nArt & Music – 10\nWith a decent budget, creative character design, and a futuristic universe, Puella Magi is a cut above many other shows episode 1-12. The flashes of the background scenery and animation of the world, the coloring, the fight scenes – they’re all great. The pastel colors are very pleasant and contrast with the otherwise ordinary and sometimes monochrome world. However, the “witch lairs” are animated like a weird LSD trip and it’s masterfully done – to the point where it earns the show distinction for its quality. While some underlying style is consistent among all of them, every lair is still very uniquely animated in its own theme and different from all the others. \nThe soundtrack is a masterpiece. The soundtrack isn’t as good stand-alone, but the scenes are expertly paired. The opening theme’s [Connect] lyrics are actually relevant to the plot, which just shows how thoroughly this was produced. The show has a few ending themes, but the one most frequently chosen is the sinister-sounding [Magia], which starts playing right after the true nature of the show is exposed at the end of episode 3. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    There are some creative works so good, so entertaining, and so powerful in their message, that they transcend the medium that they originated from and become something greater.  They become something  that any person who calls themselves a lover of art or story telling or anything in between must see.  \nMadoka Magica is one of those creative works.  Madoka Magica is a show that not only belongs on say Netflix or Toonami.  Madoka Magica belongs in fine arts classes, womens studies courses, journals on film and literature criticism, etc.  It is not just a good anime, it is a\n          \n        transcendent piece of art that if you ever want to show someone who is not an anime fan just how great the medium could be, this is what you pull out.  Not Naruto, not even Evangelion, Madoka Magica.\nStory- 10\nI wont bother going to far into the actual details of the story as I am sure if you are reading this you either A- already know the major twists, or B- don't and dont want to be spoiled.  I will just say that the surface level intrigue of this story and the way it manages to start so small yet become incredibly huge by the end while still holding at its seems is amazing.  \nMore significantly, i want to touch on the downright inspiringly awesome feminist subtext of this show.  Initially as the show began i thought maybe as a male i was reading to much into, but as the show continued i knew i was dead on.  Madoka Magica is a symbolic endictment of patriarchal social structures and the way that these structures use and abuse women for the \"greater good\".  Again, i won't spoil it too much, but the show has some deep messages about women in society and it is so good and perfectly woven that i suggest any person with any type of feminist slant in their mind check it out.\nSound- 10 Yuki Kajiura.  That is all.  She is the only composer i have learned by name.  That, and the ED is fricking epic.\nCharacters- 9.  Here is the only place where there is any semblance of weakness.  The characters in the story are not overly deep or complex.  They are tools.  They are there to represent ideologies and issues within society and they do that well, but it is at the cost of well fleshed out motivations and character build up.  The show is only 12 episodes long, it would have been impossible for the creators to make such a dynamic and deep story with such a big message AND have well fleshed out characters too.  So is still give this really high marks because the characters definitely do what they are tasked with.\nArt-10  The normal art and animation is nothing special, looks very similar to your typical Moe show. But that is the trick that makes it so amazing.  The moe style contrasts with the incredibly dark and intense reality of the show to further drive home the messages within the show.  Also, the battles and design of some of the villain characters are like something out of a Salvador Dali fever dream.  Again, it is an amazing work of art that everyone should see.\nEnjoyment- 10 There are only a few anime that i bring to non anime watchers in my circle.  Most of them have been stretches that i think they may like.  I have forced my wife to watch many things and only a few of them didnt make her roll her eyes.  When we finished Madok Magica we talked about it for a week.  Now mind you we are both blessed with high levels of education and scholarly minds that enjoy analyzing and breaking down complex and depthful things.  Still, even if we weren't the show has plenty of twists and turns that even at the surface level you can greatly appreciate it.\nOverall-10\nMadoka Magica is now my favorite show of all time.  It is so good and so impressive in its narrative and it's message that i dont even think it makes sense to call it a show.  I want everyone to see this, not just anime fans, not just sci fi/horror/drama fans.  EVERYONE should see this show and talk about it with their friends, especially their daughters and little sisters.  IT is that good and really it's probably the most important anime in recent memory.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Introduction:\nOn January 7th, 2011, the anime television series known as Puella Magi: Madoka Magica, aired its first episode and continued to air until April 22, 2011. Now before I get started I just want to say, wow, just wow... How many spinoff manga's, video games, and light novels can one anime get. I mean I know Madoka Magica is really popular in the here in America and in Japan, but there are so many spinoffs its crazy. With that being said I just want to say before I start that I know everyone has already praised this series to death, but I just really want\n          \n        to get my feelings out about the show because to be honest I don't know if I can contain them... Also I'm relatively new to anime shows so this may be a little clunky. Anyways on with the review.\nActual Review:\nSo Madoka Magica's story, without much spoiler, is about a girl named Madoka Kaname and her best friend Sayaka Miki. One day, after hanging out with their friend Hitomi in the mall, Madoka and Sayaka are confronted by this cute animal who is known as Kyubey. Kyubey then proceeds to asks them if they want to make a contract with it to become a magical girl, they only have to make one wish and it will be granted for the power to defeat witches, who feed on human grief and cause suicides. It all seems like an amazing deal, but with the mysterious Homura Akemi seeming to not want them to become magical girls, they begin to wonder, is the deal to good to be true?\nNow from this description it sounds mostly like a normal magical girl anime like Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. The opening, which I'll talk more about later, also suggests a simple, children friendly magical girl anime but it isn't. What Madoka Magica really is, is a magical girl anime in the real world, it dares to delve into questions Sailor Moon wouldn't dare ask! Such as: Who's Kyubey, where does he come from, what is the price for becoming a magical girl and granting this one wish, ect. ect. Of course with this added bit of information you may ask what is the result of this change to the formula of the magical girl anime? Well the answer is it makes the bar for future magical girl animes so high it makes my head hurt to think the next magical girl anime could just be another Sailor Moon.\nFirst, let's review the plot, since it is the main element of the show. The plot of Madoka Magica (which is written by Gen Urobuchi), in case you haven't already figured out, is very good. It really makes you feel for these characters throughout the story and you root for them because of this, of course it also doesn't hurt that the characters themselves are genuinely likeable. Of course you have your Homura and Kyoko, who are not likeable at first, but they soon get a backstory which makes them a lot more sympathetic and well after that you pretty care about every single one of the characters. \nAnother great aspect of the plot is definitely how it tackles making the magical girl  deal realistic and shocking. It really pulls some good twists throughout the whole 12 episodes which, by the way, are the most plot focused episodes I've seen in an anime, there is literally no filler episodes. I should also mention that the show does start out rather like a stereotypical magical girl anime, but looking back on it the fact that it's like this really helps cement the whole descent into darkness and trickery elements of the show well. Overall, the plot of Madoka Magica is well crafted and everything has a place and meaning in Madoka, leading to one of the most focused, well executed shows I've ever seen. In fact the only things that I think could possibly bother people is that it does take a while for itself to explain some aspects of the story, and that it's a little too cute to start off.\nSecondly, we must explore the animation of the show. Now this show was made by the animation company known as SHAFT, whose previous works include Bagemonotari and Hidemari Sketch. So right from the beginning one of the biggest things that sticks out like a sore thumb, is the extremely moe art style, which resembles Hidemari Sketch. From the previous descriptions of this show it seems like this would be a weird choice for what sounds like a dark and depressing show, but in the end it works really well, contrasting the show as a whole.\nThis brings me to how the animation actually holds up and to be honest it is extremely clean and beautiful animation. You can especially tell this, when the characters enter the various Witch Labryinths, in these parts of the show the creators use different types of art styles and techniques to make each place seem new and different. I'd also like to mention before I move on about the really amazing scene in episode 11 where Kyubey is explaining stuff to Madoka, for some reason that scene just seems extremely beautiful to me.\nFinally, we are going to talk about the music and the opening and endings, first let's start with that opening shall we. Now the reason I want to talk about the opening first is because this definitely sticks out in the final episodes of the show! You see like I said before the opening is a very happy typical magical girl opening, with very pretty animation by the way. The song on its own is good and catchy and trust after watching 6 episodes of the show in a row I can say that the song will loop in your head for hours afterwards. The opening may be a little out of place near the end of the show considering by then all remnants of the typical magical girl elements have been erased, but it also helps contrast the show just like the art style does.\nThen there's the endings and yes there are a multitude of them. The first is only in the first two episodes and plays over a non-animated picture of Madoka, Sayaka, and Hitomi. Besides that being lackluster the ending like the beginning is that kind of catchy j-pop song that may get stuck in your head for hours, good thing its only for the first two episodes. The second ending is the main ending of the show and is the only one with fluid animation, of course it's just a typical character running animation, but the song that plays over it, is great! It's dark and it fits the shows tone and atmosphere extremely well, it's also not a song that annoys you when it loops in your head! Then there's finally the third ending which only plays at the end of Episode 9, it fits the tone of that episode extremely well but is not that memorable.\nNow  to end of the music section of this review let's discuss: Yuki Kajura, Anime Score Composer Extraordinaire! So to many anime fans Kajura has composed the scores of many animes and all of them have been amazing. This is definitely the case with Madoka's soundtrack which is filled with beautiful choir pieces and pianos and strings alike. It's all very pretty and once again is another masterful work of Kajura's. Overall, the music is amazing even if the opening can be grating if it gets stuck in your head.\nThe Verdict: \nIn the end, Puella Magi: Madoka Magica, is a masterful anime that deconstructs the magical girl genre and makes us gasp at its twists and turns! It truly is a great anime and is really a work of art in its animation, writing, characters, and everything in general. The only complaints I can possibly foresee from someone is that the story does take a while to explain some things and the opening and some cutesy aspects of the show may annoy some. In my opinion though Madoka deserves to be watched by all anime fans and if you can you should watch it as soon as possible. Thanks for reading! "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    It's no secret that I love Magical girl anime. I love the upbeat atmosphere they tend to have. I love the characters. I love the tendency to include yuri. I love the way they're just fun to watch. \nThat being said sometimes an anime comes along that decides to do something different with the genre. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika is one of those anime. It's going to be difficult to discuss it without spoilers, but I can manage. \nThe story surrounds a girl named Madoka. She lives a normal life until she encounters a transfer student named Akemi Homura who gives her a vague warning\n          \n        about not accepting offers that seem too good to be true. She also encounters a small and very creepy looking creature named Kyubey who offers her and her friend Sayaka a simple contract, they can have any wish in exchange for becoming Magical girls and fighting against witches, supernatural beings who spread despair. He especially wants Madoka due to her vast potential. Unbeknownst to either of them they're about to embark on an adventure in which they'll learn several terrible secrets about Magical girls and the power they wield. \nThis anime deals with several complex themes that you normally wouldn't find in Magical Girl anime like corruption, temptation, sacrifice and duality. Okay, maybe you'll find the last two, but you probably won't find them this well handled. Urobuchi Gen is a very talented writer. Almost everything that comes up in this anime becomes important eventually and all the questions get answered by the end. The characters are well developed and have realistic personalities. Some of them are kind of annoying but they're annoying in a realistic way rather than an exaggerated cartoony way. I also like the way that the Magical girls get actual weapons as opposed to sparkly wands, microphones, castanets or anything like that. Yes, those are all real examples. My only complaint about the story is that, though they do eventually explain why Madoka has such vast potential, the explanation they give could just as easily apply to Homura. So why is there such a difference? This is never really explained. This is a relatively minor problem though, and it's easily canceled out by the ending. Mahou Shoujo Madoka has an amazing ending. It's easily a contender for the best ending I've ever seen, in anything. Problems are resolved, through logic, and that's all I'll say about it because I really want you all to watch this anime. \nThe art is mostly well done, but the way they do the faces for characters is kind of bland and the characters look virtually identical except for the hair and eyes. One thing that is really good about the art is the stylistic and surreal images they use for the areas surrounding witches and for the witches themselves. \nThe voice acting is really good. Yuki Aoi, Saito Chiwa, and Kitamura Eri all demonstrate a lot of range and Katou Emiri does a perfect job of sounding emotionless and artificial. The music is excellent too whether it's setting the mood or being used in a scene involving one of the minor characters playing the violin. \nI'm going to give it a yuri factor of 7/10. Since Homura's motivation is really homoerotic and there are some really subtext laden scenes. To be honest, this disappointed me a little since most Magical girl anime have canonical yuri and this one with a more mature target audience kept it as subtext. I realise that it isn't a traditional Magical girl anime, but they come so close to having canonical yuri between Homura and Madoka by the end that a slightly changed line or scene would have made it official and it bothers me that they didn't take that minor step.  \nIn the end there are a few problems with this anime, but there's nothing too significant. The story is well thought out and amazingly written. The characters are rich and interesting. The voice acting and music are both excellent and the graphics are decent. I give Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica a 9.3/10. I'm honestly tempted to give it a higher rating just for the amazing thematic content and ending, but its few problems are just enough to stop me from doing so. The bottom line is that you should watch this anime. Even if you normally hate magical girl anime you should check it out since it isn't at all typical of the genre and it's only twelve episodes. You know, since my review of Di Gi Charat every review has been slightly more positive. I wonder what's next? \nKing of Fighters: Another Day... Well, that's a combo breaker. \n        "},

Now in 2013 I can truly tell you there is one great magical girl anime. At least one good one, and thank god for that. This is because I generally  hate magical girl animes. As im\n          \n        sure you have all heard from many in the anime community that this this  is an amazing anime.you don't need me to tell you that. Yet is it the greatest anime of all time? is it the anime we all have waited for? No and no. \n        Madoka Magica is not as it seems, and you have probably heard this from every reviewer on MAL.  You have heard that Madoka is a \"deconstruction\". I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said otherwise. Now what truly got me hooked was not the fact of it being a \"Deconstruction\". When I watched it for the first time in 2012 I was such a shonnen lover that i didn't even know what  Mahou Shoujo meant (therefore i go in without any bias). After the first 2 episodes I was about to drop the show wondering how I ever came to watch such a thing. Then the 3rd episode hit, and like any fan will tell you $#@% gets real, real fast. To me it wasn't a deconstruction while watching because i had no idea it was a magical girl anime (I knew sailor Moon, but nothing else).  From episode 4 on Madoka  had my undivided attention, and I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the series.  For Madoka Magica its all about the story, which much to my surprise was insanely good. Yet, only so  if you go in open minded and look past the frilly dresses. The true narrative before you will then present itself(NO SPOILERS HERE). Yet the story results with enough suspense, intrigue, and feels to keep your undivided attention. Its more like Faust than a Magical girl show. It turn me from someone who watches FMA and one piece, to someone who watches Steins;Gate, Mushishi, and Mawaru Penguindrum. It is not the greatest story ever told, but pretty damn flawless IMO(10/10)\n\n          Now the Art style and direction is beautiful.  Yet not the greatest work SHAFT has ever done. Yet, IMO pretty close to it. Madoka Magica in its art has created some Trippe and dark moments. Mostly due to the \"Witch Labyrinths\". Now within these labyrinths are many examples of symbolism. Its this that truly got me going. Many of which I didn't see in-till a 2nd watch and are extremely obscure. They mainly allude to classic  literature such as: The Little Mermaid  or Faust (just to name a couple).  Now one thing that is the problem with the animation is the fact of SHAFT. They have a habit of rushing animation, and thus some things are not totally smooth. This is not noticed till a later watch. Yet, it is there none the less. May I suggest to you that you watch the DVD Ver. ? it has corrected many of the animation mistakes and will increase the Trippe lvls by a factor of 42 . (9/10)\n          The Sound of he show is top notch. Yuki Kajiura does what Yuki Kajiura\ndoes. Make an epic score. The Osts are wonderful, the best being Sis Puella Magica, the \"main theme\". Some of Osts are epic but more leaning at  beautiful. This is appose to her work in Fate/Zero, which goes more at Epic. In Madoka the score uses  weeping strings and flutes, with a combination of more epic pieces. Yet,  I would say the violin is the principal instrument. The Ed's are also is extremely amazing.  With Magia being so epic it is sometimes used as a battle theme.  Episode 9's aEd deserves some props and   \"and Im home\" truly gave me some feels (DVD Ver. only). Yet, out of the songs the op is probably the worst, yet is not bad, just later on in the series seems very misplaced...(9/10)\n\n           Now Characters are the hardest hit. They are in a 12 episode series that focuses on plot, and thus have little time for character development. Many people find this to be the bad factor of Madoka, and I agree. Characters themselves don't seem to last enough for us to grow too attached(oh gawd that is spoiler territory).  IMO its not the Character personality that makes them. But, that each character represents a concept(if you look for it its there >:D). Yet, the base personalities are pretty typical. Its not to say the Characters are bad, they are very good for the series size.... just not on par with the rest of this show.\n           As a final word Madoka is a great story, I would recommend it to most. I also would say it  will be enjoyed by most. But, will only truly be amazing to some. It also probably will leaves a few wondering how this could ever be good. With a pacing( episodes 4-12) that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tons of feels, an amazing art direction, all rapped up in a 12 episode package. It is no surprise how Madaoka has become on of the most popular, critically loved, and divided animes of the last decade. Madok Magica in my eyes is not, the greatest anime ever. Yet, is up there in the top 50. Weather you like it or not Madoka Magica has made an impact. It  is here to stay. and I proudly give Madoka Magica A (9/10)\n\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre, and I would say a very good one at that. It is a series known among its fanbase for being something that will take your expectations, cut them up, douse them in petrolium, burn them, throw them off of a ten-story building, rip their nails off, drown them, and hand those expectations right back to you two days later. It is an exciting ride full of twists and turns, and an enjoyable one, at that.\nSTORY\nMadoka starts normally, following the most stereotypical magical girl formula: Cute animal turns schoolgirls in to magical girls so they can\n          \n        wear puffy pink dresses, fight evil, find love, and all that boring material that WE HAVE ALL SEEN BEFORE. Ah, if only it were that simple... The truth is, this series is full of dark, depressing material, that only shows itself when you least expect it.  Being 12 episodes, it is completely lacking in that fatty filler material that many slice-of-life magical girl are sometimes known for, and thank god, too, because I quite frankly find filler to be quite boring, and lacking in any intellectual or intense content that I so love in anime. Other than those first few episodes, it is extremely intense and plot focused. And quite frankly, I am glad that those first few episodes are as they are, because it helps make the 180-degree turn all the more shocking. It has a solid ending (assuming you don't watch rebellion), and great character development. \nART\nI rather liked the art of Madoka, although in the version I watched it in had rather plain and simple backgrounds. This didn't really distract me though, and the backgrounds were not by any means the thing I was paying attention to, by the time the show made its massive switch in tone. For its characters, it used a moe art style reminiscent to one of Studio Shaft's previous works, a slice-of-life known as Hidamari Sketch. It might have seemed out of place had the show not used Higurashi-esque methods for the faces (though to a very low scale) and dark, dreary colors. Overall, it worked for the lighthearted bits, and oddly enough, it worked for the dark bits as well.\nSOUND\nThe soundtrack from Madoka was composed by Yuki Kajiura, and turned out very nicely. Kajiura tends to do work on the darker series, so it was a role fitting for Kajiura, and she did a very good job. Mami Tomoe's theme was very goiod, I liked Sayaka's theme, and Nux Walpurgis are all worth mention at the very least, but one particular piece stood out to me for different reasons- the ending. The look of the ending isn't anything really special, but the music is some of the best I have heard out of an ending theme as of late. I tend to just skip endings, but Magia was a very good song, that made up for the otherwise boring ending sequence, and was is worth watching, for that alone.\nCHARACTER\nThe character's are relatively stereotypical at first glance, but develop beyond those stereotypes that they were initially given. As the show progresses, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka, who are learning about the magical girl's world, and are considering  becoming magical girls, slowly crumble in to despair, depression, and even insanity... The other characters each have something that separates them from the stereotypes of their genre, be it ulterior motives, past obligations, or emotional baggage, all undergo at least a little bit of development, and even with the ones you don't, as the show goes on you get to learn all about each one respectively, and by the end you know and love each one as a character. I have two main problems regarding the character department; I felt one was rather lacking in screen time, and I felt that Sayaka was rather lacking in wisdom; she has a belief in justice, which is all good, but there is more to the world of both common humans and magical girls than justice, and she would have done well to understand that nothing comes without a price, and that you reap what you sew, as Kyoko puts it.  commend Madoka for not rushing in, and becoming a magical girl immediately, as that was an intelligent choice, and in a cruel world where not everything is as it seems, such a caution is a very good trait to have.\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\nAs stated above, Madoka is a thrill ride that is full of twists and turns, and has a deep and psychological story that will really grip and engross you until the very end, as soon as the show picks up. It is an intense story that puts the lighthearted, fluffy demeanor of the magical girl genre and drops it in to a cruel, realistic world, that uses your very own expectations to become great. I finished it in one night before I even knew what was what, and it was not something that I would ever want any lover of the magical girl genre to miss out on. The beginning is rather boring, and nothing that I haven't seen before, but if you get past the initial silliness of the thing, it becomes an enjoyable rollercoaster. Of the problems, the main ones are the slow start, the plain backgrounds, and character decisions that I considered lacking in intelligence sometimes, though chances are that won't bother you, as I seem to be among the minority in having that opinion. I can fully recommend Madoka to just about anyone, and similar shows include along with Princess Tutu (another dark magical girl), Neon Genesis Evangelion (a mecha deconstruction), and Tokyo Mew Mew, for those looking for a cutesy, stereotypical show. It streams all legal-like on Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Netfix.\nI hope you enjoy this series as much as I did, see ya later!\nKari-san\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\nWhen this anime came out many people were drawn to it. Everyone was raving about it and saying, \"WHY HASN'T ANYONE MADE A MAGICAL GIRL ANIME LIKE THIS BEFORE?\" The answer is simple. Because the point of magical girl animes is to empower girls and Madoka Magica is basically supposed to be the opposite because it's a seinen manga/anime. I think many of us seem to forget that Madoka Magica is of the seinen genre and not at all written for teenage girls which is why it's so dark in plot. You can interpret the fact it is of this genre in a couple of\n          \n        ways: it's dark to attract the male audience who is shunned from magical girl animes (supposedly) OR because some men in Japan enjoy watching girls suffer. \nHOWEVER, ignoring this fact Madoka Magica can actually be quite enjoyable to everyone because people can choose to ignore its origins and the darker side of Madoka Magica to take something good from it. And even if you don't care about any of this crap Madoka Magica is still very interesting and well put together for a 13 episode series. \nYou follow Madoka Kaname who is just an ~ordinary~ 8th grader and her friend Sayaka Miki in the beginning. Sayaka and Madoka meet this cat-bunny alien called Kyuubey who tells them to make a contract with him for in exchange they get one wish and after that they have to become magical girls and fight witches. This alone is already somewhat interesting despite being the premise for most magical girl animes (this other being finds some 8th grades, makes them magical girls, and then the rest is fighting the bad guys of the show, yada yada yada) and the way the rest of the show plays out is actually very human which is why I was saying you can choose to ignore the bad aspects you may find to pull out some good lessons. I don't want to spoil the rest of this great anime for you at all so all I have to say is to try it out (plus it's so short, why wouldn't you?). \nAs for the other aspects of the show, art is pretty great. You'll find it to be unique and interesting (especially the witches) despite how strange the characters might look in the beginning (well, at least I thought they were weird looking). The sound (music) is performed mainly by a band called Kalafina and it's just beautiful. The show really relies on the characters for the most part and their clashes and their friendships and in general, relationships so the characters are well established and interesting. As for enjoyment, like I said before, I can say that the majority of people coming across this anime will enjoy it. It's well known and I don't know many people who haven't at least heard of it. Overall, I'll give this anime a 9 and I recommend you go watch it. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    I'll be honest, I really didn't think I'd like this show. Sure, I heard tons of praise about it from many people, but I still didn't expect much from it. But when I finally got around to watching it, I couldn't stop. I was so engrossed in the Anime that I finished it in one sitting, haha. Anyways, on to the review.\nStory(9/10): The thing about Madoka Magica is, that it's not really a magical girl Anime as one would expect from its name. Right from the first few minutes, it's pretty clear that it steers clear from the typical magical girl path. Infact, this Anime\n          \n        actually takes all we know about the genre, puts it into a grinder, and then puts them back together. Basically, deconstructing it to form something entirely different. The story is actually really dark, which was actually pretty good. I'll give a brief coverage of the story without spoiling anything. Basically, a white, red-eyed cat-like creature called Kyuubey forms a contract with girls, where he can grant one wish of her desire, but they in turn have to become a Magical Girl and fight Witches. The story takes an episode or two to really get going. But from then, it just keeps on getting better and better, with dramatic twists that I didn't really expect. Finally, the ending itself is ambiguous, which was kind of a shame since I expected a bit more from it. Then again, in an Anime like this, a happy ending wasn't really expected.\n\nArt(10/10): Animation is done by Shaft. So there isn't much to say it about it. It's top notch, as expected. Head twirls, sudden change of camera angles, all the Shaft goodness is here. The action scenes in particular are beautiful, with brilliant effects and lighting and other such small details. The art really shines when the Anime becomes dark. The character designs are childish, which some people may find odd, but I liked it that way. \n\nSound(9/10): I have no complaints in the sound department. The soundtracks during light hearted and intense psychological parts of the Anime fit wonderfully. Yuki Kaijura did a spectacular job, as usual. The Ending is dark and moody and is really great. So great infact, that it was used in a few action sequences. As for the Opening, it's like a typical magic girl Anime's opening, which is a huge contrast to what the Anime actually is. So, it could've been better.\nCharacters(8/10): The main character, Kaname Madoka is a normal girl attending school. She's cute, shy and timid. But meeting Kyuubey changed all that as she had to go through a lot of ordeals which she had a real hard time dealing with. Still, she's a really likeable character. Now we go onto my favourite character Akemi Homura. Without revealing much about her, she has the most character development in the Anime. Initially she seems cold and devoid of human emotion, but we later get to know more about her dark past, which made me liker her the most. We also have Miki Sayaka, who is Madoka's best friend. She's cheerful, energetic but really does things on impulse on multiple occasions. Her actions actually hurt Madoka a lot, though I could understand her reasons for doing so. We then have Kyouko and Mami. Kyouko seemed hostile at first, she grew on me as a character, especially after we came to know of her sad backstory. As for Mami, she's probably my least liked character. Reason is that she really didn't have that much of an impact on me. Sure, we was a veteran magical girl and all, and we get to learn her backstory too(which was a bit bland to be honest) but I just couldn't care for her that much. Overall, most of the characters are great and will leave an impact.\n\nOverall(9/10): I thoroughly enjoyed the Anime. Sure, the ending could've been better and it had a bit of a slow start. But inspite of all that, I loved it for all it was worth. If you're looking for a unique Anime with a great plot that'll draw you in as you progress and one which you won't be forgetting anytime soon, then by all means, watch this. You won't be disappointed. I sure as hell wasn't. \n"},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    There are shows I rewatch to relive the magic, only to learn the magic has faded. There are times I fear the magic has faded, only for it to persist. And there are times the magic persists, and creates a miracle that improves a show. This is the show where the magic persists. This is the story where the miracle unfolds. This is the tale known as Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\nBut honestly, the miracle shouldn’t have happened. There’s no surprise to keep interest, but only inevitability in knowing what happens. And it’s no secret the story is now exposed at the basic level; starting as\n          \n        a lighthearted fantasy before falling on a web of despair spun by its own builders. But more standout than the entire web is the strength of each thread. None of them insignificant. All of them a sight to behold.\nAnd what viewers behold in the first few minutes is our titular character Madoka, running through a vacant hallway shaped by shadows and light filling the emptiness. It’s a fitting backdrop to establish what shapes the story VS what doesn’t. It’s also one of many stylistic choices used to great effect. The witches are chaotic, their designs equally so, while a certain character’s design grows steadily darker until it’s only a silhouette of despair highlighted by a smile of insanity.\nBut what makes these stylistic visuals work is how they’re not used to the point of ineffective. It punctuates scenes instead of the entire show, and allows normal visuals to do some heavy lifting. A veteran magical girl lectures two would-be rookies, but her own face is shadowed, creating a sense of uncertainty. A character’s dependency shows early on as she blindly searches for a facetowel before her mother slides one to her. And another character is usually eating, hinting at part of her backstory.\nIt’s visual cues like these that make every thread of this web so strong. Sometimes they’re obvious, sometimes they’re subtle, but all the time they move the story forward. Knowing a character has a doomed fate, isn’t the same as seeing them spiral to doom firsthand. Sometimes, a tragedy too obvious is the most painful to watch. Especially when the solution to their problems is clear, but young age and flaws stop them from making smart decisions.\nAfter all, tasking teenagers with the responsibility of essentially saving the world, realistically, wouldn’t end very well. It’s their necks on the line for one wish. Many of the character’s reasons for becoming magical girls stem from well-intentioned naivety, but naivety is still naivety. It’s not about being careful what you wish for, but the price you’re willing to pay for your wish. Some of them have already paid the price of their wishes, while others are dealing with the brunt of costly miracles.\nAnd it’s the cost of a miracle that makes up one of the major threads of the story. It deals with someone who tries to convince others she did the right thing, but can barely convince herself. Her story crosses paths with a feisty hothead who lives for herself, smelting a fire-forged friendship. Another thread works in secrecy, for a person shrouded in mystery due to the way her story unfolds. And the last thread, from someone seemingly useless, is actually about getting closer to making a wish; she’s stopped from taking action for most of the show, and it feels too convenient.\nIn fact, problems surface in the show’s writing because of ‘why didn’t they do this instead?’ scenarios. There’s also a problem with time. I would say people are fragile and can easily change, but the amount of time that passes in the story, for character development, can be a little fast thinking about it outside the story’s context. So the show isn’t perfect. The characters develop at a believable pace within the story but might not work outside of one, and the ‘what ifs’ of every situation will make the extra-nitpicky squirm.\nStill, the strengths of this show outweigh, outnumber, and outdo its nitpick-worthy problems. In addition to great visuals that paint a tight story and draw splendidly-written characters, is a music track that adds to its cast. The upbeat ‘Credens Justitiam’ matches the outlook of Mami, while the nostalgic ‘Confessio’ conveys jaded maturity for Kyouko. ‘Conturbatio,’ ‘Decretum,’ and ‘Symposium Magarum’ highlights how Sayaka changes through the story, while the ethereal ‘Sagitta Luminis’ is appropriately angel-like for Madoka. Finally, ‘Puella in Somnio’ and ‘Inevitabalis’ play different messages about Homura.\n‘Inevitabalis’ describes the show especially. I rewatched this show knowing what inevitably happens, and the surprise factor gone. But, surprises don’t make this show. Solid directing does. I noticed things on rewatch I hadn’t noticed the first time around. There were visual cues I missed, like the ‘exclusion’ of certain characters from episode 10, and lines of dialog I caught that made previously ‘weakly developed’ characters like Madoka and Homura much better than I gave them credit for.\nThis is what I mean when I say this show created a miracle. I rewatched it fearing I wouldn’t like it as much, only for me to outright adore it. It takes magic for a show to keep its luster, but it takes a miracle for it to shine even brighter. And though I can’t call it a masterpiece because my mind won’t forget its minor flubs, my heart will likewise never forget the absolute pleasure of reliving the magic. The magic of Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="                          \n    Ahhhh. Mahou Shoujo Madoka magica (yes i'll  be a dick and write the whole name). THIS is not your average magical girl anime. If you go into this anime thinking \"oh it'll just be another Sailor Moon or another Cardcaptor Sakura\", well good cause that means that you've seen them. This anime is a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. If you don't know what a deconstruction is then Evangalion is an example of a deconstruction for a mecha. So if this show is your first magical girl anime you won't admire it as much. Anyways.....\nThis show is a master of surprise. \nThe story\n          \n        is well written and well unexpected. I even thought this would be another classic magical girl anime. But, once you get to a certain episode, you'll see why this show is a master of surprise. This show is REALLY dark for the kind of genre it is in. But, it isn't as dark as other anime like Perfect Blue or Kara no Kyoukai. But compared to other magical girl shows IT'S FUCKING DARK.\nThe art and animation are choppy at times. But, the things that really bug me about the art is the differences on where you watch the show. The tv release looks shit compared to the blue ray, but the blue ray looks like shit compared to the movies (The movies are basically the show missing a few parts).If you don't like shaft's animation than this may be a turnoff. Also, the Witches look like a bunch of really fucked up shit put together.\nThe songs are pretty good. Especially the battle music (look up Magia on Youtube). But, the opening is kinda misleading  for the whole show being that it is pretty dark. The opening is like your classic magical girl opening. Happy and upbeat.\nIt's really hard to discuss characters without spoiling the anime so I'd say that the characters are really good except for a few characters that i find annoying.\nThe enjoyment is really nice especially if you like surprise.\nOverall, this anime is pretty good. If you have never seen a magical girl show than try to watch one before you watch this. If you don't I won't complain I'm a really lazy too.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is the first mahou shoujo that is nothing like any other. You would think from the artwork and sounds of the opening that it would be cutest but.. Im glad to say its nothing you would think it is. You have to remember this is a SHAFT show. So Its going to feel a lot like fate/stay night and others in some realms. This anime keeps amazes me every twist and turn is something new and its all about interaction. Im falling for Madoka.. SHE IS HUMAN. Her Ideals and such make you think really what does it really mean to be a magical\n          \n        girl.. Yest its grim ... and the animation can get silly sometimes.. But I can honestly say that I will refer this anime to anyone.. it appeals to girls and boys on some levels. The opening is adorable and sweat where as the ending is so dark and grim.. I love the twist to it. \nPlease give this anime a shot. It is definately worth anyones time. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=14,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I don't quite remember why I decided to watch Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, but I do know for sure that it was one of my finest decisions anime wise. It's a show that I always highly recommend to anime watchers.\nIt's easy to be fooled by Madoka Magica. As you start watching you feel the familiar mahou shoujo theme: a group of young girls who are approached by a cute talking animal who wants to partner up and help them fight evil, whilst in frilly and girly outfits. But under this illusion Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica reveals itself as a memorable masterpiece.\nThe Story:\nTo become a Magical Girl you\n          \n        are granted one wish. What will you choose?\nStarting out smoothly, this anime truly begins on the third episode. This is the point at which the viewer realises that behind the guise of a cutesy show lies the cruel and hard story of the reality behind being a Magical Girl. The turning point of the episode happens so unexpectedly that it left me dumbfounded for quite some time. However, this was but the beginning. \nAs the story progresses you are faced with the many perils of the the five girls, Kaname Madoka, Miki Sayaka, Akemi Homura, Tomoe Mami and Kyoko Sakura. Despite its short length Madoka Magica manages to flesh out all of its female leads, and given that character progression and development are central points in this anime it presents us with the girls' fears and expectations, their past and the motive for which they chose to make a contract, and while there was an undeniable favourite for me, Akemi Homura, I found myself empathising for all of the girls, their distinct personalities and stories with all of them having traits I adored and related to.\nThe most powerful moments of this show are key situations for the character's development and the story progress, and while I will not spoil them I can simply say that they were cruel, heart wrenching and utterly powerful, completely shattering the illusion created by its first episodes\nBy the twelfth episode I was fully aware of the show's emotional power and its ability to make me feel for its characters, having felt an almost full spectrum of emotions. However the ending managed to once again surprise me, succeeding to wrap up this tale in the most perfect of ways, twisting and turning the show's own world. Finale wise I am yet to find a better anime.\nThe Artwork:\nMahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica has two very distinct art styles. The normal one is the one present in the character designs being bright, colourful and somewhat simple and childish. However, as the girls find themselves in the witch realms the artwork changes completely, switching to something entirely unique, featuring a magazine collage like theme in dark, vivid colours, combining real and drawn elements in a delightful manner that still maintains its cutesy way.\nAs I see it this contrast contributes to further cement Madoka's genre, the twisted magical girl anime. It helps disguise the nature of this show's world, shrouding it in an aura of cuteness making you not expect all it throws at you. It's hard to see harm come to cutely-drawn girls in a fantasy-like witch world, and that is exactly why it is so good when it does happen. It plays with your expectations as a viewer.\nThe Music:\nThere are not many anime shows that have me listen to the entirety of their soundtrack after watching. But then again, there are not many shows like this one. The music is superbly executed, either blending eerie vocals into multi instrumental backgrounds or being purely instrumental, helping establish show's emotional tone. As a part of the series' soundtrack each magical girl was given her own theme song that subtly reflects her personality and dives into her views of the world, complementing both the character and her very own story. \nOverall View:\nBeing absolutely outstanding Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is an anime you should not let yourself be fooled by, and one you should definitely set as a priority, with its compelling characters playing into a rich, superbly written story guaranteed to make you feel even if you try not to.\n"},

C'mon people! Read the other reviews! Can't you see that this is better than anything you've ever seen before! Give this a 10! Now!\nಠ_ಠ...\nHow fucking low can the 10 rating go...

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    As you probably know the show starts off as a generic magical girl show, and the takes a dark turn by involving death and suffering. It feels as if it was entirely banking on this surprising the audience how ever, and if you know it's coming, it really just comes across as nothing but a cheap gimmick. Honestly, if you removed the magical girl aspect this show would appear as entirely generic. Just because Madoka Magica kills off a character or two, and puts them through some trauma, doesn't turn it into a deconstruction, especially when said characters are really just the archetypes from the\n          \n        magical girl genre. \nSpeaking of characters I find that is where Madoka Magica really falls flat, each one is either undeveloped or handled in a completely ham-fisted manner, and none of the characters motivations really make sense. First off you have Madoka Kaname herself, whom never really develops at all throughout the show, and for the most part doesn't actually do anything except exist for the sake of the others. Her personality is that she is kind, and that's pretty much it, so kind in fact that, at the end of the show, she is apparently willing to sacrifice herself to an eternity of limbo, for some girls, most of whom she has never met. Did I mention she's 14? I should also point out that she's an idiot, evident in the scene in which she throws her friends solidified soul onto a highway, because apparently that is the best course of action she can think of to prevent her having a fight. \nAfter her you have Homaru, who in reality, is the main character of the show, and thankfully actually has some depth to her, which makes it a pity that the show didn't focus more on her. At first she comes across as the generic mysterious, and distant transfer student, how ever she is like this because she has traveled through time, in order to save Madoka, experiencing many tragedies along the way, thus making her desensitized and jaded to the horrible things happening around her. The crux of this is that it relies on the audience buying her devotion to Madoka, who as I have pointed and isn't particularly likeable, and we also never really see much development between the two.\nThen you have Sayaka Miki, easily the most frustrating of the lot, which is made all the worse by the ridiculous amount of screen time she gets. Her entire dilemma is that she uses her wish in order to help the boy she is in love with, but then questions whether she did this for her own selfish desire for his affection. While this may seem like an interesting idea, it doesn't really go anywhere, and just turns out to be a petty love triangle, which she immediately gives up on winning for an incredibly flimsy reason, and then she gives up her humanity because of it.\nKyouko Sakura, is another awful character, within days she goes from wanting to kill Sayaka, to sacrificing her life so she can die with her. She  outright tells other characters about her past problems, and her childish world view, for little to no reason. She also eats a lot, because at one time she was poor, and thus hates wasting food, which might of been some decent characterization if it wasn't so blatantly spelled out for us.\nAlso you have Mami Tomoe, who dies 3 episodes in, after having about a total screen time of about 20 minutes, which makes me me wonder how anyone could possibly care about this plot twist, even if they didn't know it was coming. \nThe actual plot of Madoka Magica is surprisingly predictable, and towards the end turns into a cliche time travel narrative. It's also filled to the brim with idiotic contrivances, the whole reason witches and magical girls exist is so an alien race can harvest their emotions, and turn them into energy, in order to combat entropy. Why adolescent girls? Because apparently they have it way harder than anyone else in the world, move over starving African children, this bitch is upset about her teen-aged crush.  The wishes granted to the magical girls are also rather nebulous, the extent of what they can do is never really clear, and the nature of the wish also effects the powers they get as a magical girl, but this is only really apparent in two of the characters. It's also never really made clear why the alien race gives them a wish, or even gives them a choice to become a magical girl for that matter, this is even more confusing when we find out that the alien race apparently have no emotions themselves. Nothing particularly original nor interesting is done with the time travel element, and it only culminates into a completely nonsensical grandfather paradox. \nMadoka Magica's animation I find is somewhat hit and miss, while it is mostly well done, with interesting shot composition and background scenery, the characters designs look simply awful. Now I have nothing against moe design by itself, but the ones in Madoka Magica look far too angular and over simplified, to the point in which they barely register as humans, and look down right ugly. The fight scenes may be well animated, and the design of the witches is unique I'll admit, but they never really seem to have any weight to them, and it is never clear how much damage is being done. For being a so called deconstruction, nothing really interesting is done in terms of how the fights play out. A nice bit of background detail is that it seems to be set somewhat in the future, though this is never actually brought up by the characters, which I can appreciate, and the general architecture is also pleasant. \nThe only way I can see Madoka Magica being enjoyable, is if you don't know what it's about going into it, and even at that I cant really see it as anything but a cheap, one trick pony.\n        "},

Honestly, I'm not the type who loves the magical girls genre, and even this is my second mahou-shoujo-themed anime series that I've ever watched in the last 25 years, while the first one is Cardcaptor Sakura that I watched it when I was child. \nI gave it a shot after I read several comment in anime forums, plus I saw the rating for +17, which make me think that there's something fishy within. And I really didn't regret to watch this series because the content is great!\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica isn't a usual\n          \n        magical girl anime series out there, it includes some despair that makes you feel not right watching cute girls in shitty situation. I usually watching an anime that involve cute girls doing cute things, but in this anime, you will see cute girls doing hell things.\nThe plot has standard concept, but the execution isn't really for kids. You know, comes the magical girls who fight against the evil called Witch, and protect the justice. But then again, you will see some great reality that doing justice alone is mere a naive thing you may have here. So, in this anime, you won't see a world split by white and black, but the characters are in a gray area.\nJust like what I wrote in AnimeBibly.com, to watch this anime, you need at least understand about time travel, parallel world, and time paradox theory. Or else, you may get confused in the several last episode. Oops, without giving you any spoiler, make sure you learn about those three theory first.\nThe art is the strongest point here. Without this, the anime will only like the standard magical girl genre. The art gives a dark vibe, and really shake your psychological with the horror atmosphere. The characters designs are good, especially the main character who really stands out!\nOverall\nIf you love some anime with psychological thriller like Steins;Gate, or Death Note, or Mirai Nikki, then you have to try this anime. Just like the three of anime I mentioned, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is also a thriller but in a cute form. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I had some serious doubts about this show from the start, it looked like a show for kids. Whatever though, 12 episodes? I'll chance the first.\nAfter binge watching the whole thing in a night, let me tell you, this is Not a show for kids. I'm pretty sure this show gave me grey hairs. It's that good.\nMadoka Magica is a bit like a magical girl show written for adults. Yeah, I know, that sounds weird. Instead of all that pre-teen angst and \"who likes who\" class politics, this show starts messing around with heavier subjects like dealing with the death of close friends, fighting against\n          \n        fate when there's almost no hope of success, and questioning is changing fate a selfish act.\nYou've got a naive lead character, Madoka, who has to deal with growing up too quickly when she learns how dangerous and uncaring the real world is. The story follows her becoming a magical girl, and all the good and (mostly) bad things that follow, by signing a contract to \"become a magical girl in exchange for a wish\" without reading the small print. It gets bleak, but you'll want to follow it there.\nThe overarching plot is fantastic. Each episode gets a little bit darker until it reaches blackness by the end. There's some very heavy themes of loss, death, and despair here, but they're written so well that they become compelling. Each main character, especially Madoka and Homura, are very well fleshed out. They all have their own personalities, strengths, flaws, and goals. They're remarkably human.\nThe dialogue is fitting and the delivery is superb in the english dub. The pacing deals well with escalation while keeping the story from becoming overly confusing or stagnant. This is top shelf writing and delivery. This is one of the best tragedies I've ever seen in any media.\nThe art style is flat out incredible. It's rather experimental, the bad guys (witches) are all separately designed monsters from the art style of the show. It feels a bit like watching a painting move. The fight scenes are choreographed very well, each action scene with this many types of art is a goddamn feast for the senses.\nThe sound is very fitting, the usual background tones, especially choral singing that managed to feel really pleasing to the ear while remaining somehow off putting at the same time. It's like minor chords or something, I'm not a music buff. The opening theme doesn't fit this theme at all, but by the end, I really enjoyed how jarringly different it was. It felt like dissonance, musically and emotionally.\nYou know the phrase \"appearances can be deceiving\"? That's what Madoka Magica is. It looks like a simple kids show, but it's actually a surprisingly adult drama. This is the tightest 12 episode show I've ever seen, it never felt rushed or dragged in any part of it. This honestly made me rethink what genres I want to watch. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes good writing, strong characters, and being sad because a cartoon hurt your feelings. Homura did nothing wrong. Fight me irl.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\nDang, this anime is great. My friend was all, \"Dude watch it. Just watch it.\" And I went and watched it and was taken in by the first episode. I was always wondering what would happen next, and I was always thinking, dang, these are just 13 or 14 year old girls and they have more stress than most people 6 times their age will ever have. It's the kind of show that really gets you to root for the characters, and I loved it. Also I know most people say< \"This is so dark not for kids\", I honestly think while it can be\n          \n        uncomfortably dark, it is still kid appropriate depending on the kid. I would've handled this just fine when I was young. But then it might give other kids nightmares, so you're the only one who knows your kid and what they're ready for.\nStory: 9\n     The story was quite surprising to me, there is a Christian element that becomes very obvious in the end. The whole thing is very dark and made me think they would all die in the end, and well they do and they don't. I think this is excellent story writing, and I know many people criticize this show for being too short, but I really like the BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! way it presents the story. Event after event, no filler, no dating drama, no super long Naruto and Pokemon-style battles. I feel it may not be possible to have the same BOOM!-ness to it with a 24 episode series.\nArt: 10\n     The art is outstanding, and I was quite surprised by the art style of the other dimension they go into when they fight witches. At first I didn't really like the chubby fat girl look of all the characters, but it grew on me, and meshes well with the witch environments. \nSound: 8\n       I thought Madoka's voice sounded annoying, I watch the subbed version on Netflix. But all the other character's were fine, I think Homura's voice is quite nice. I like the music on the show, it is quite good.\nCharacter: 9\n      Sayaka, the blue haired girl, is my favorite character, and Homura is definitely second. It's crazy how long Homura suffered! You go girl! I'd probably had given up a long time ago if I were you. I see myself in Sayaka, and I really related to her. As for Kyouko, I think she was annoying, and I didn't like how she changed so quickly because most people in real life don't change that quickly. I feel an extra one or two episodes would help to flesh out Kyouko more fully, since she is developed mostly in one 5 minute monologue. Madoka is kind of just there until the very end when she plays a more prominent role. I feel like if the show had gone into her head more, then she would have been more enjoyable throughout the show, rather than in just the finale. I really feel for Sayaka though, she is so relatable to me yo!.\nEnjoyment: 10\n       I thoroughly enjoyed this, I was always thinking what might happen next, and about how the characters feel, and what is Kyuubey? And what is Homura? There is a lot of mystery to it, and it has just enough action and whole lot of tension. I was quite surprised by how violent this show is since it is about a bunch of cute middle school girls with magical powers, but it is used to its advantage and does not feel over the top. \nOverall: 10\n       This is exactly the kind of good anime show I was looking for, my friend was right! right! right! right! right! Definitely watch it. If you think the whole \"Make a contract with Kyuubey the demon\" thing is too creepy, or if you think the whole \"Middle school girls in colorful rainbow outfits fight evil\" thing is for kids, or if you think \"But I'm too busy with other anime\". Just watch it. And if you don't like it at the first episode I know you won't really care for the rest  of it. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    “Madoka” isn’t your father’s version of a magical girl anime anymore. Akiyuki Shinbo’s “Puella Magi Madoka Magica” is a haunted anime that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That’s because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This anime, and to a lesser degree “Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha” (also a Shinbo-directed work), redefine the possibilities of the “magical girl anime.”\n“Madoka” is not a simplistic tale of good girls who choose to gain magical powers to fight evil. The girls\n          \n        are good, yes, the witches are evil, yes. But “Madoka” poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The witches’ ability to bring death and despair to the citizens of Madoka’s hometown requires someone to step up to eradicate the threat. But is it worth sacrificing your mortal soul for all this? Enter Kyuubei, the cute mascot-like character who is more than a villain. He’s a Mephistopheles whose lack of empathy and amoral outlook pose dilemmas for all would-be magical girls, especially when many aren’t told of the risks and are too innocent to ask for the fine print.\nThe key performance in the anime is by Emiri Katou, as Kyuubei. Her rendition draws power from her matter-of-fact delivery. Though Kyuubei lacks the malice of “Bokurano’s” Koemushi, it is precisely the way Kyuubei’s lines are spoken that make the character more despicable. At least Koemushi was being purposefully cruel and even if we cannot condone such behavior, it’s not outside of our experience. Kyuubei’s actions fall outside the scope of what we’re used to as he takes a Machiavellian stance towards what must be done for the good of the universe. In short, he’s a sociopath’s sociopath. Throughout the anime, he continually nudges the girls to enter in the contract without a care for their fates, enticing them with the fulfillment of a wish as a reward. This Faustian bargain effectively threatens the whole moral foundation of the magical girl genre.\nBecause these characters and the situations they find themselves in are so powerful, and because the anime does not allow its spectacular visual effects to upstage the narrative, we’re surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eri Kitamura does an especially good job as Sayaka Miki, whose character is transformed by a simple wish into a bitter monster. The same can be said for Yuko Goto’s performance as Madoka’s mother, who dispenses with sage advice when called for, but who begins fretting for her daughter towards the end of the series. And let us not forget Kyoko’s final prayer. It is customary in an anime to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. “Madoka” slips around those defenses and engages us.\nYes, the visual effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate depictions of a descent into madness. The setting in which “Madoka” takes place is a wilderness of skyscrapers and unfinished construction sites that carry a hint of danger in their unbuilt state. Especially noteworthy are the alternate witch dimensions that seem like they were taken from Salvador Dali’s surrealist landscapes and Edvard Munch’s “The Scream.” It is through these worlds that the characters fight in and, ultimately, die in.\nThe plot involves nothing more or less than a girl’s attempt to save her friend from a horrible fate. Kyuubei’s deceit, combined with a tragic series of events, is what sets this all in motion to begin with. The twists and turns that come along are complex, with all credit going to Gen Urobuchi’s screenplay, which has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.\nShinbo also directed the previous, and excellent, “Le Portrait de Petite Cossette,” which explored the darkest corridors of the human psyche. Now, Shinbo has taken his experience from “Cossette” and materialized them into “Madoka’s” cruel twists. There are a series of flashbacks and time-jumps that make us realize that this conflict is borne by children who have fallen victim to cruelty — they compensate by trying to do good and fulfill their wishes, but when the final revelations come forth, all that’s left is despair. If they didn’t understand it then, they sure as hell do now.\nSomething fundamental seems to be happening with magical girl anime as a whole. “Cardcaptor Sakura” may have defined the classical high point of the traditional magical girl anime. A show like “Nanoha” allows its director to combine the excellent battle scenes typical of shounen series with the magical girl genre to bring to the attention of a male audience. But now, “Madoka” moves the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some anime viewers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And this reinvention of the magical girl genre is the most fruitful one for exploration.\nIn “Puella Magi Madoka Magica,” Akiyuki Shinbo has freed the magical girl character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For all the magical girls in “Madoka” face deeply troubling decisions, let there be no doubt, and if ever the despair begins piling on, it would not surprise me the extent of the harm these characters are capable of inflicting upon one another.\n(With apologies to Roger Ebert)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I should I say this, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica or Puella Magi Madoka(or simply Madoka Magica, as I like to call it) is not your average Mahou shojou anime. As I have deep rooted loathing for cute-looking, frilly dresses and cute transformation scenes, I never really planned to watch this anime. After reading such good comments about it I felt a bit left out, so I decided to try it without getting my hopes to high. After finishing it though, I was really amazed. How in the world did I not only watch the entire thing, but am still craving for more? Well, without further\n          \n        ado, let’s get on to the review and see the reasons.\nStory: Madoka Magica is more or less a story-driven anime, my kind of type. To make a brief summary of the story, it is about a girl named Madoka who meets a rabit-cat hybrid thing called kyubey, who will grant one of your wishes. In exchange, you will have to become a mahou shoujo and fight evil witches. To tell you frankly, the story seems so cliché that it’s painful to read but no, Madoka Magica is way more than just that. At the first few episodes, I could have sworn that continuously watching this might make me lose my manliness, and that I might have to wrestle with a bear just to get back my balls. Although at first it starts out like that, with cute stuff everywhere, no, it is just disguise that will enhance the eerie mood of the later episodes. What made the story so good is that the change in its theme, from a light-hearted anime filled with cute girls and frilly dresses to a dark anime filled with sorrow and darkness. Though that on its own would not have made it great, it was along with the execution that made it great. The transition between the two was so smooth that it completely took me by surprise because you don’t see it happening, it just happens gradually. Another good thing about it is that even though it turns dark later on, it doesn’t lose its core theme, which is mahou shoujo. Even though the setting turned different, it was still the same frilly dresses and the same cute girls, it doesn’t change. And with that, I give it a 10/10 for a story that despite its outward appearance, managed to pique my interest and make me question whether I should forget my hatred for this genre.\n Art and sound: The art is more of a hit and a miss. For me who’s more of a guy who likes the clean and slick animation that most new animes sport today, as well as more normal faces, I didn’t really like the art that well. Sure it cute and moe, I guess it just comes down to preference with this type of things. One thing I can’t deny though is the awesomeness of the fight scenes. As fight scenes in this anime usually happen inside the witch’s world, it would only be fitting for me to describe it to you. It is a very weird place wherein everything seems like it was hand drawn with chalk, with visuals that rival that of the randomness of Nisemonogatari. Now back to the fight scenes, they are wonderfully animated, something that I didn’t expect out of an anime in the mahou shoujo genre. The fights were fast, smooth and even epic in some scenes. As for the music, they were true masterpieces. The opening which has a lively, upbeat tone perfectly complements the beginning of the story while the ending has a sort of dark feel to it somehow gives a sort of premonition about the later episodes. All in all I give it another 10/10 in both fields because I have nothing to complain about them, they’re perfect.\nCharacter: Well, seeing as this is a mahou shoujo anime, you can expect a lot of cute girls. And what do girls do? They laugh, eat bentos on the rooftop, talk about love and boys? WRONG! Well, at least for this anime. Although those things I mentioned earlier aren’t completely incorrect, Madoka Magica developed the characters in such a way that over time, they turn dark, revealing things that you would never expect. Heck, even the familiar kyubey was developed into one of the more amazing characters I’ve seen. To put it simply, character development in this anime is wonderful. It wasn’t rushed, it wasn’t over the top, but just right.10/10\nEnjoyment: I really can’t tell you why I enjoyed it, it just is enjoyable. It made me laugh, it made me sad it made me excited, and it made me feel all fuzzy inside, something that the newer animes fail to give me. Overall I give it a 10/10.\nOverall: Nothing much to say, except that this is indeed one of the best animes of 2011, and I highly recommend it for everyone to watch. Just beware though because this anime can give you a bittersweet feeling at the end. I give this anime a 9/10.\nWait, WTF, why only a 9/10 when you gave it like 10/10 in all criteria? Well, this is a MAJOR SPOILER so if you are planning on watching this anime, turn back and don’t read it. Now, my reason is that I didn’t like the time travel concept in this anime. Yes, I know I might sound a bit biased but it’s just that Homura  creating multiple timelines, Madoka  becoming a god and changing the laws of the universe and stuff like that just didn’t tickle my fancy like other animes did, Steins;Gate for example. In other words, they didn’t do it well, or at least not as good as an anime focused on actual time travel but instead made a couple of plotholes at the very end of the story, making look messy and overall disappointing. For short, I didn’t like the ending. Although I said this, it might have been done deliberately in preparation for the movie and so, that is my reason.\nIf you liked my review, a simple click on the helpful button will help a lot.

It is the job of Mahou Shoujo(Magical Girls) to find and kill them before they have their way with other human beings.  \nIt sounds like becoming almost like an Hero in a movie where you can save people's life.  One life that could save many; it doesn't sound bad but almost too perfect.  If one useless life can save these people than there's no reason\n          \n        to hesitate...  That is what they believed...\nAfter their death, witches drop a small item called \"Grief Seed\".  These are used by MahouShoujos to cleanse their own \"Soul Gems\".  If it isn't cleansed for a while, the MahouShoujo will lose her life.\nIt didn't take too long for them to come to realization of their mistakes.  Like witches, they became invisible to everyone.  Their sacrifice was not there to be seen by the people.  Countless number of people were saved by their actions, but nobody was there to witness it happen.  You will not thank someone for something that you don't see them do; you will not praise someone that you cannot see.  This was now reality: you are risking your life for some guy you could possibly careless about and you will never be appreciated.  They too got sick of this and they no longer fought for anyone.  For pure reason of survival, they had no choice but to fight.  \n\nStory:\nMy only intentions for this anime was for some MahouShoujo Moeness.  From the very first episode, I do not see Madoka become a MahouShoujo.  Starting from episode 2, the only reason I continued this anime was to see Madoka become a MahouShoujo.(I will not be happy for a LONG time.)  Instead of Moeness I get ridiculous amount of drama.  I was totally dumb-founded and speechless by the end of the series.  Immediately I desperately searched the web for the culprit behind my tears.  \nGoogle: Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica - Wikipedia\nWritten by: Gen Uro- *FACEDESK*\nGen Urobuchi have clearly been proven to me that he is a dangerous existence.  The World started to make sense again.  The story of MSMM was very similar to Fate/Zero, where he proves the misconception of justice.  I would have prepared myself for this, but I did not even imagine him to be associated with a MahouShojo Genre.  He has rewritten the genre in such beauty; his story has brought me to tears once again.\n10/10\nArt:\nI found MSMM's art to be pretty sloppy in many ways.  Actually to reword it, It wasn't at the best works compared to many other animes.  The motions weren't very fluent and sometimes the characters seemed as if they weren't sketched at it's best.  Most of all, I found the wiggly worlds really unappealing.  The whole witch and everything were not even animated.  I was totally disappointed about how ugly the monsters were...  There was a cotton with a mustache that had butterfly wings as it's legs.  (That's damn creative, I'll give credits for that...)\nWell the reason why I'm not gonna go hater is because there's a really good excuse for this kind of art work.  To begin with, MSMM was produced by Shaft studio.  Starting from 2004 Shaft has been working on lowering their paint group and replacing them with the digital group.  Their digital group has been growing since then and the results have come out in 2009 and 2011.  Yes, Bakemonogatari & Mahou Shojou Madoka Magica.  Even the best studios in all of Japan is desperate for better paint group but lowering it was declaring that they wished to go bankrupt.  However they disguised the weakness of their sketches and paint works by many digital and computer affects in such genius ways.  I've seen improvements in Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica so I'd say they really deserve a pat in the head... or a round of applause...\n9/10\nSound:\nThe opening theme was very catchy.  I heard Claris sang it, who also sang the opening for Ore no Imouto...  It sounded more like a pop song of some kind but the opening video did a really nice job to highlight the dark theme of the anime.  The musics that they used in the \"wiggly land\"(I'll call it wiggly, cause the images are wiggling) were gave great impression of thrill and the chill.  Some of the musics really hit the spot to make me cry in the right moments and I've never really sensed any awkward moments where that one little note seemed as if it was lost...\n10/10\nCharacters:\nDespite being all depressing and dark themed anime, as MahouShojos all the characters still have their Moeness.  This is probably the reason that gives even stronger impact to the people.  It makes you wonder why these kinds of moe 2D girls have to suffer being a MahouShoujo...  Madoka's excessive kindness, Sayaka's sad yet energetic, Mami's lady-like senior, Homuro's mysterious background and extreme talent, Kyouko's tomboy attitude.  All of these characters don't seem to be the most original ideas.  However the story moves on while each of these girls' lives are being distorted and changed. \n10/10\nEnjoyment:\nThe story was never too repetitive nor did it ever slow it's pace.  It kept me impatient yet flowing in the right pace.  One episode never ran boring all of the sudden nor did the other standout excessively compared to the others.  It kept the right rhythm of the ups and downs like the graph of sinX.  I decided to stay up to finish the series despite the fact that I had SAT exam the next day.  Short but it has carried out a very heavy topic.  It's very easy to watch the series in one shot...\n10/10\n\noverall 10/10\nStory was good, not because it made me cry, but it also gave the most exciting ending.  Art was fairly interesting, but you really should prepare for the different style.  Music of the series really helped to keep the climax of a scene.  Characters were just unforgettable, and it kept the night before exam very enjoyable.\nuhh maybe not a \"masterpiece\" but probably one of the outstanding and must-be-recognized anime.  \nIdk about others, but I wish they'd finish this with a short OVA of a nice epilogue.  Nothing big like a movie or 2nd season.. totally disagree...\n        "},

It felt like the protagonists and antagonists  had been set out from the start. It seemed like it was a simple story of good against evil.\nThen came the third episode and onwards. At the end of the third episode I was crying. They attach you to the characters so much that it was such a shocking moment.\nAnd from there the series kept getting darker and darker. Every episode had some sort of bombshell, which something terrible happening each episode. And\n          \n        the backgrounds and colours would darken alongside the show.\nNothing seems out of place in this anime. The dramatic music is perfect. I felt like I was able to relate to a few of the characters myself. And the story is written so that you never expect what will come next. And the deception of the cutesy anime at the start was very cheeky of them to do, but it was a great touch for people who wouldn't like an anime which starts out with a terrifying beginning.\nOverall, I think that PMMM was a great anime and I'm glad that I had watched it. It is one of my all time favourite animes and I still remember some of the scenes that shocked me the first time through and there is a lot of value in watching again and again.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=13,   ["text"]="                          \n    It sometimes bothers me that people advertise Madoka as a morbid deconstruction of the magical girl genre. First of all, taking a genre full of roses and choosing to emphasize the thorns is not in itself an indication of quality. Furthermore, if that’s what you wanted you’d need to look no further than to the appropriately named Revolutionary Girl Utena from the late 90’s era. In truth, anime fans have peculiar ways of promoting their latest obsession which might have caused quite a few to perceive this show as the typical piece of generic storytelling so commonly adored by the majorities but ultimately unsatisfying. Surprisingly\n          \n        enough, they’d be incorrect.\nStory: 8/10\nYou’re probably familiar with the synopsis by now but this is a magical girl anime provided with a long row of increasingly dark plot twists. Unlike some shows that wait until the very last episodes to show off their unexpectedly sadistic agendas (School Days, Narutaru); Madoka is a process of gradual revelations that depict the lifestyle of a magical girl as anything but cheerful.\nAll of the clichés from the genre are piled up but are either altered or provided with emphasized significance; no decision is to be hastily made and the contractors hold little to no regard for any moral responsibilities it might be appropriate to respect when you make adolescent girls fight and die for your cause. Ultimately what the show produces is not only a thought-provoking story structure and almost flawless pacing (no scene here is ever excessive) but also a refreshing lineup of both familiar tropes like transformation sequences and relatively fresh material like the seemingly inevitable and hauntingly dark fate of any magical girl naïve enough to think her decision to join the battle was a good one.\nAnimation: 9/10\nBased on somewhat objective measurements like frame rates and coloring, Madoka is far from average. The character designs may look unappealing at first but are perfectly assimilated into the scenery to look distinctive rather than annoying.\nWhere the show, really, truly, shines though is when it comes to the battles. Interestingly enough, the antagonists in Madoka are witches capable of ensnaring their victims in nightmarish labyrinths where twisted imagery is combined with downright bizarre creatures and backgrounds for an effective assault on your retinas. Basically, what you get are various magical girls and their trademark weapon of choice battling their way through surreal worlds equipped with everything from industrial objects to sweets. It’s almost as if they took the artistic virtues of Lynch, Burton and Studio 4C in order to create something very comparable but in the end also very original.\nSound: 9/10\nAll the poor girls are voiced by competent actors and boast impressive performances under their respective archetypes; Madoka is naïve but incredibly kind, Homura is cold (for reasons later revealed) and Kyoko is fierce etc.\nAs for the background music, this is the first show I’ve seen with a soundtrack made by Yuki Kajiura. That does not, however, mean that I’m unfamiliar with her work. Oh no. That woman is a miracle worker capable of producing jaw-droppingly beautiful music. Here she uses a long row of various instruments to fuel her creativity only to top it all off with a powerful choir. Madoka’s soundtrack ranges from mundane, sad, often mysterious but is always well-made. In combination with strikingly haunting visuals, the music here is absolute gold.\nCharacters: 7.5/10\nAs previously implied, we’re dealing with rather common archetypes here. However, as the show makes progress their typically one-dimensional personalities are expanded rather impressively as they face tough decisions and encounter more and more powerful enemies. Much like Evangelion, a lot of the character development takes place during the witch battles themselves.\nAt the center of all the commotion is Madoka, a protagonist who receives surprisingly little screen-time and instead spends the first half of the show observing the development of her friends. In most cases it’s a bad thing to place such a minimal focus on a main character but it’s executed just fine. In the end, the personalities here are not particularly deep in and of themselves but when forced to interact with other entities, especially under life-threatening circumstances, they can produce absolute awe.\nOverall: 8/10\nYou’ve probably heard many things by now and I feel like I’m just jumping on the Madoka fanboy-wagon when giving the show such a high rating. I do not hesitate, however to call this the best anime to be released in the past few years along with titles like Kaiba. Its fans do a better job of poisoning its appeal to potential viewers than they do promoting it but that is by no means a reflection of its quality. This is a show that works fine in every single regard despite coming off as stronger in certain areas. Even if you end up feeling that the story and characterization were poorly structured (which I’d disagree with) you’re likely to still have enjoyed it based on its technical merits alone. There’s no real reason not to watch this!\n        "},

It had the gravity of dealing with death, maintaining normality, the brutality of repercussions, and the bonds of friendship. It was beautifully drawn, with a soundtrack to match, and storyline that will take your heart away. If anything else, why not give Madoka Magica a shot?\nSTORY: Madoka Magica was a roller coaster ride from the first ep to the finale, at first i wasn't sure what i\n          \n        was getting myself into shortly thereafter i was on a wondrous ride which just seems to have went by so fast. And fast it did go, in one night I finished this 12 episode show and am just hyped to write about it. At the end of it all I just wanted to stay and go for another ride. I couldn't have asked for another storyline like this, unlike Mass Effect 3 you feel a sense of satisfaction after watching and although you may want to change the course of things, well it just wouldn't be the same if you did.\nART: The artwork in Madoka Magical dealing with witches added the surreal feel that just fit in so well with everything else. It was beautiful and was exactly what it needed to pull me into this world full of witches and magical girls. Though the character designs were cute I couldn't help feel that every female character looked like an adolescent and I wasn't too fond of facial structures.\nSOUND: The music for Madoka Magica couldn't have been any better for the show, seamlessly flowing with the mood of the show, the action scene music is something you will likely youtube while you are in your own personal battle. \nCHARACTER: With a 12 ep show its hard to really grasp any character and hold onto them. Madoka along with Homura develop quite well, solidifying there place in your heart as characters you will not likely forget anytime soon. Kyuubey the cute emotionless cat like alien is adorable, but at times you may want to strangle him for acting like a douchebaggish salesman.\nENJOYMENT: Start to finish with only a break to answer my door to get pizza and koolaid I thoroughly enjoyed the show. While thinking to myself well it looks like a little kids anime, I found the popularity of the show to be absurd and saw myself having to check it out for myself. One of the better decisions as before the first episode was over I was sure I was going to love this show.\n"},

You can tell from the chilling, goosebumps-inducing ending theme at the 1st episode that is by far my favorite. But my question is, why go CRAZY over the word \"deconstruction?\" At the\n          \n        end of the day, this is just another story device like irony, deux ex machina, etc, that exists to elicit uniqueness and stand out from the crowd just like how EVERY OTHER anime SHOULD be doing IN THE FIRST PLACE. All this hype over deconstruction just tells me how low the bar for mahou shoujo genre has become that people are going crazy over a series that managed to actually stick out. This isn't a celebration of greatness. This is a living proof that this genre needs to improve significantly. With that main complaint out the way, I have some pros and cons.\nPROS:\nliked the opening. loved the ending theme. \ndoes do a solid job of actually executing deconstruction especially with Kyuubey. \ncharacters that I thought would be sidelined were developed more than I imagined (esp. one particular one that I was very impressed with).\nKyuubey became increasingly more horrifying with genuinely thought-provoking observations about human nature and his purpose and mission actually made sense. \nThe ending \"bit more than it could chew\" but I was still on board and was satisfied that it committed to its uniqueness until the end.\nno forced fanservice (to be fair though, fan service in this type of animation would've made me feel like a criminal)\nCONS:\nhated Madoka Kaname. she's the Lisa (Zankyou no Terror) of the series. bad example of using crying animation that ended up generating more annoyance than feels.\nfor a 12 ep series, pacing was slow --> it could use more editing (cutting)\nnot a fan of this kind of animation \n(personal cliche I notice as a student): why be in school if you're never, ever going to study...\nIn conclusion, if you're curious on what \"deconstruction anime\" means, give it a try. I don't highly recommend it for I think you can find better examples in other visual mediums and books. I don't recommend the third \"revolution\" movie either. \nWhat I want to lastly mention is the sad catch 22 this anime has. I think I personally would've enjoyed this much more (be surprised/impressed more) had I not known that this was a deconstruction. But given the state of mahou shoujo genre, I don't think I would've tried the series if nobody mentioned the unique factor of madoka magica. \n        "},

The textbook definition of what you'd call waifu trash.  They were continuously inconsistent, and overall cliched.   Madoka, girl who thinks she's useless (and she is), Sayaka, a girl who thinks she's morally superior compared to the other magical girl.  \nStory: overall, it seemed fairly inconsistent, when they would often say one thing and then say another thing later on in the series.  \nThis show was highly mainstream for a time last year\n          \n        and my friend was highly into it, and his obsession was borderline unhealthy.

It's about 5 girls who fight for justice and transform into different outfits that give them superpowers, so... it's almost identical at this point to Sailor Moon in many respects, but without much of the spaces in between and stripped down to fight monsters with special powers, ok well that did happen in Sailor Moon but there's a lot more to it, you know what I mean??\nAs PMMM goes along that\n          \n        really doesn't change, actually the best way the situation can be described is things start falling apart, which, is probably the safest thing I can say without spoilering anything.. \nIt's not really clear who is fighting what, when, why, or how long, and the other magical girls aren't even necessarily justice oriented after awhile, and actually there are some major spoilers there. \nI don't know want to be so negative, I think Madoka was pretty cool! Bbut there are so many details that are just missing that would make me really excited about it.. \nAnyway, while the other Sailor guardians such as Sailor Jupiter could be tempestuous or aggressive, hot-tempered, but that's not really the same thing as Kyoko Sakura who is often just wholly antagonistic and consequently becomes much more difficult to get behind, she isn't a mean person but..\nI feel like they were trying to tell me \"wait, she gets to be nice later on\" but I just was waiting too long for that part. I think it's true a lot of people have a kind of mean and soft side.. but her and the other PMMM characters I felt like took awhile to be super friendly. \nOverall rather than fight for justice these girls seem content to fight halfway, they are supposedly fighting against... it's a strange show I guess...\nIt's not all not fun though! \nI think Madoka is just a bit too bitter and sad, but it's got a hopeful energy at the same time. Like i said, they have their moments, Homura in particular seems designed to kind of say, yes it's tough being a magical girl, but she sort of finds a way to make it happen anyway. \nI think Madoka is an expression of sadness and despair but not a lack of hope, it is an interesting show.. it's really my favorite but it's all right! \nAnyway, all things considered, a 6 seemed somewhat appropriate for Madoka... but it's very solid as a 6, certainly in no danger of falling.

In this anime, you certainly get more than you bargain for, yet its deeply morbid themes and philosophical inquiries are no joke.\n Choices have consequences. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. What may start off as a good intention can turn into something far worse. All of these themes permeate the show, and bolster it into a sublimely rich, if not tragic, tale about some middle school girls who simply want to help make this world a better place. Yet, the supernatural realm that they discover quickly reveals its dark secrets, and they are truly terrifying. \nThis show is simply too hard to explain without being too revealing. Just watch it. See for yourself the true, terrible magic that exists in such a magical show. Just remember that the same rules apply for you too: If you truly wish to watch this show, then be careful.

I know many look at it (myself included) for the first time and go, \"Why would I ever want to watch a show about magical girls?\". Trust me this show is worth your time.\nI had zero expectations going into this show. I have never seen a magical girl show before, but had heard much about what they're like. I never in a million years would have thought that this show would become one of my\n          \n        favorites. \nWhile the main character of Madoka is a pretty basic character, its not her that you watch the show for. Actually the only character that is worth anything is that of Homura. Most of the characters are either initially unlikable or make bad decisions that lead them astray throughout the shows short 12 episode season.\nI will say, please don't quit on this show before episode 3. I know a lot of people talk about the 3 episode rule, but it actually applies perfectly to this show! Episode 3 is where it really picks up steam and you realize that this is no ordinary show about magical girls. Madoka Magica was written by the same guy who wrote Fate/Zero. If you have ever seen that show you know that it doesn't end happy, and don't expect this show to end with a happy ending either. This show is dark! \nFinally the art and animation are all very good! The characters lack a little something, but that is to be expected with only 12 episodes to explore them. I think I would have given this show a 8.5, but since MAL doesn't have that I gave it an 8. I feel like after a rewatch or finally getting around to watching the sequel movie, rebellion, that I might finally change it to a 9.

Studio Shaft really put a lot of effort and time into Madoka Magica.(except when it was airing Lazy Scumbags.JK) The blue Rei... I mean the Blue Ray release looks really good, the ost for the show is also great. It was Composed by Yuki Kajiura who is one the most gifted composers to have ever graced the anime industry. Madoka Magica was directed by one of my personal favourite anime director's of all time Akiyuki Shinbou his shows have a distinct style and feel that is\n          \n        good and different from any other anime director's style. Now is his directing a little pretentious? YES it is does it matter tho? No, cause his shows are almost always above average. Examples of some of his works:Monogatari series, Madoka Magica, Dance in the Vampire Bund, Nisekoi,etc.And now the writer Gen Urobuchi or his lovely nickname the \"Urobuther\" I could explain how he got his nickname but you figure that one out on you're own kiddo. Madoka Magica was promoted as a cute slice of life show but when fans found out that the Urobuther was writing the show fans got a little confused cause way would a writer who specialises in tragic shows would be writing such a show of basically cute girls doin cute things. Gen had to do damage control on Twitter. He kept saying it was a lite harted show till right before episode 3 aired he tweeted 'no one in the show has died. Yet.'\nAfter episode 3 finished airing Shaft put out a statement saying that Madoka was a Dark Psychological show. What happend in episode 3 gave me a headache...\nThis show is very different but when you see who made it you could have guessed that this show was gonna be dark and tragic. The bottom line is that Madoka Magica was a very intense watch the show got a hold of the viewer and did not let go and just took you for a ride and while you were on said ride you got hit by the feels in the FACE! , I got CuteGirlavitus and by the time I realised what happend it's too late for you cause your already on the struggle bus but it's not all bad cause you get complimentary Orange Juice. Madoka Magica has great repeat value. Madoka Magica had one HUGE Problem tho but it's not with the show it is what comes after all 12 episodes are over. Yes, I am talking about Rebellion or you can call it what I like to call it - This is (not) a cash grab. The score for Madoka Magica is 10/10 but Rebellion is a 7/10 only cause it looks Great. I recomend you watch all 12 episodes of Madoka but stop watching after the credits roll Don't watch the end credit sence it's bait for Rebellion. Rebellion is just unnecessary it wasn't needed.\n        "},

My feelings towards this anime are very mixed and I don't feel like going into detail so let me just say that there is something for everyone to love in the mess it is. The music and sound leaves bits and pieces to be desired like in most animes but don't appear as a noticable problem that would drag down the rest of the show. Except for my slight disagreement with how the story unfolds it feels like they truly brought out the\n          \n        full potential the bundle had to offer. Initially I saw the series and decided to move on with my life but I just had to watch the final movie because they truly shoved it into my face with it's great reviews. So I saw that one aswell. But as soon as it began I knew I was gonna add it to my regrets of life. I was kind of dissatisfied with the ending of the series but then they do the same thing again in a much more twisted way with the movie. I close my laptop. Open my window to find dark clouds lurking in the cold air around me. And I think to myself \"they fcked up another one.\" I close my review with an 7.5/10 because I have a headache and feel like relieving myself of some stress. Did I enjoy this? My final answer is that they didn't give me the time to notice if I did but it sure as hell is interesting.\n        "},

The fights are accompanied by guitars and symphonic orchestra, its there when its needed and gone when its not.\nA lot of haunting instruments like violin and cello, electric undertones to contrast with the classic to highlight the tone of the series.\nThe haunting harmonies of the Kalafina trio makes for an amazing theme song, Magia, which lyrics reveal a lot of the story, but one does not realize that until seen again. \n"},

The voice acting really fitted the characters and the songs are catchy and memorable.\nCharacter-8\nMadoka is definitely a plot-driven show, but that doesn't mean that the characters can't be good, because they are! Despite being somewhat clichéd and stereotypical, each of the characters have their own flaws, insecurities and motivations for their actions(even Kyuubei!)\n Enjoyment-8\nWhile the show is generally overrated (no, I don't think it's the best anime of the 21st Century) and VERY angsty, it's worth watching for all the reasons I've already cited."},

It's a bit of a turn off, but after finally understanding what the story is aiming for, I came to a conclusion that it is a good take on deconstructing the magical girl genre but was not enough to blow me away.\nThe idea of hard core sci-fi and abstract concept of emotion mashed together presented in the story did not blend well for me.\nMagic + Time Travel + Shoujo feels + Dark Atmosphere = Not really my cup of tea, or\n          \n        was now I would expect it to be presented.\nI guess I really love Steins;Gate so that any story that deals with time will be rigidly criticized by me.\nThe story was wrapped up nicely except on the extra scene at the end that is too ambiguous to understand.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Warning,This review contains minor spoilers-you have been warned\nDo you know what it takes to make an anime from a less known and non-serious genre to become a masterpiece, well you can find the answer to that question in this anime. Puella Magi Madoka Magica-which roughly translates to magical girl: Madoka. \nThis is a magical girl’s anime by definition but don’t let that fool you, for the story of this anime is very dark and sad. Let me  start this review saying that I do enjoy a lot of comedy and light hearted anime genres such as comedy and slice of life ; however they’re\n          \n        not the type that you usually see in a serious top 10 list and I wouldn’t consider putting it if I hadn’t watched it, but oh boy, thank Kame-sama I did.\n First of all, this anime was the first magical girl anime that I’ve watched, this is because I find the idea of little girls playing with wands with no clear story pretty bland, but saying that, I threw all my prejudice aside and watched it. One of the things that surprised about this anime is that it was made by the famous anime writer Urobuchi Gen; this is because most of his work is often characterized by tragic and very dark plots such as the Fate series and psycho pass franchise, so for Gen to be the writer of an innocent ‘magical girls’ anime is kind of absurd and bizarre. However, by the time I finished the third episode, I was completely and instantly hooked.\n The main character of this anime, Madoka, is your average, normal 8th grader who is very timid and shy. She loves her family and friends more than anything and her friends and family love her back. The anime starts with Madoka-the main character- waking up from very strange dream, and eating breakfast with her loving family. She then walks to school with her two best friends Sayaka Miki and Hitomi Shizuki. Sayaki Miki is your well-known best friend who hangs around with Madoka the most from all the other characters, and Hitomi who is your generic intelligent, beautiful girl. All was going well until a new transfer student comes in, named Homura Akemi. She is very athletic and intelligent but doesn’t talk much; however, the most surprising fact is that she is the same girl that Madoka saw in her strange dream. Her life was very normal until her encounter with the ‘Magical’ looking animal called Kyuubey. Madoka and her friend rescue him from Homura who was chasing him. Now this is the moment in which this anime changes. The magical cat Kyuubey rewards them for saving him and strikes a deal with Madoka and Miki. The deal is as follows,’ Make a contract with me, and become a magical girl.’ This quote then becomes one of the most important and notorious quotes in anime. \nAfter that incident, they meet other magical girls (2 to be exact) along with finding out that Homura was actually a magical girl herself. The two other magical girls are Mami Tomoe, the ‘role model’ of the series and the living definition of what a ‘magical girl’ should be. The other magical girl, Kyouko Sakura is seen later on in the series. She is introduced as a jerk and warmonger but later on we see that all her actions have been justified by her dark past. Due to the fact that this anime has a surprisingly small amount of main and side characters, all of the relevant characters grow and change throughout the series in ways most wouldn’t expect, we get to see the backstories of the characters, the reasoning behind their actions, their feelings. This emphasis on the character progression highlights what the characters are feeling and makes each character unique in their own special way. \nThe anime production company-Shaft- has worked wonders with this anime's smooth animation credits the great and cute art style the series provide. As for the characters, I like the “wide face” designs which gave the characters these “nice and kawaii” facial features, at the same time able to evoke such powerful expressions such as when the characters are sad, happy, annoyed, or worried. This wide face design allows the viewers to clearly see those expressions making it possible for them to relate and feel attached to the characters. The character designs used for the witches is a different matter, some look cute and very stylish (witch charlotte), while some looked terrible and will give this unsettling feeling of being watched and knowing its surroundings (Witch Gertrud), while some simply look too ugly and has a design that probably only the creators could love (e.g. Witch Oktavia von Seckendorff).Furthermore, the transformation sequences are all very, very detailed and impressive especially Tomoe’s,which is very fluid and ‘alive’. Also, Shaft has introduced its signature inhuman head twists, close facial shots and random camera angles into this anime which marks Madoka magica as one of its original animations.\n Last but not least, one thing that I don’t see a lot of reviews writing about is the music.  The OP song “Connect” by ClariS is very catchy and pleasant to the ears and makes you want to become a magical girl and dance. Although there are 3 different ED songs, the best one is “Magia” by Kalafina, this is because this ending juxtaposes the op theme as it has this very eerie feel on it which is very good in expressing the dark undertones and story of the anime. So after saying all this, I can say proudly that Puella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the most outstanding and revolutionary series up to date.\n It rarely is the case where a short anime, 12 episodes, could change how the audience look at that genre for decades to come. Before this anime hit TV’s, pretty much the entire population who watches anime would never think that a mere magical girl anime, made for moe, to be dark and so detailed. However, Gen and the Shaft producers changed that stereotype with their first original work since 10 years, and it is because of that I have learned not to judge an anime by its cover or genre. On a final note, I would suggest this anime to anyone who likes dark and detailed anime such as the Fate franchise, psyco pass and Mirai Nikki.\n        "},

As for the side effects, you only turn into a big fucking monster when you die from basically not eating\n          \n        (yeah, grief seed is basically eating), and the monster sprang from killing people and other magical girls, something that is no concern of mine whatsoever.\nSee this here is the problem with the core concept of Madoka Magica, after rewatching it again, I realized the core problem of the show is that the deal they are trying to portray as harsh and unfair, is a deal so sweet, so awesome, that if it ever existed in Touhou-verse would have people ripping other people's head off for it. Cause there is no actual consequences if you go by it in a smart way, if you have a brain this deal basically offers you immortality in addition for granting a wish.\nWhen Sayaka whine about being an immortal zombie, I look to the ghouls in fallout and say \"Wow, you sure are lucky women.\" And when they complain about becoming witches if they get depressed and starve, I ask the question \"Why would you starve yourself? And even if you are going to turn couldn't you just pop yourself before you do?\" The classic zombie apocalypse solution.\nThe entire conflict seems forced because it is forced, if the plotrilla (the big boss witch) didn't come stomping into town the entire plot is basically 5 girls complaining about a deal that many would kill for, tortured by non-existent problems, like Sayaka's really fucking illogical reasoning for not expressing her love (lady, you don't practise cannibalism, you don't eat brains, you don't have an extra limb, and you don't have the mindset of a monster, YOU ARE HUMAN who just have her soul out of her body.).\nSo basically Gen wrote these girls as victims first instead of having a logical lead up towards them being victims. And when the basic building block is bad the entire thing is obvious going to be fail.\nHere is an idea on how to fix it, how about instead of saying Kyubey is an emotionless alien, we make him a manipulate scheming mastermind, and instead of having the girls whining about their power, we have them using it in anyway they want (take out the grief seed, witch and all that bullshit), and slowly they use it more and more out-of-control and become a threat to society, in which case they are hunted down by new magical girls for being monsters not in their body but in their mindset and morality. And as the old magical girls die, their anger, despair and the negative emotions they generate from their surrounding is used to power whatever thing Kyubey is aiming for...\nOh wait, shit, I'm basically describing the premise of \"Touhou - Diamond in the Rough\".\nOr you could just watch \"Touhou - Diamond in the Rough\".\n        "},

I'm going to admit: I'm leaning towards the former.\nThe design of this show is probably one of the most unique things about it. Brightly designed characters in a dark and uncertain setting. This isn't something one sees very often, and it will shock the senses of expectation versus \"reality\". There's just something bizarre about watching a character who looks like Sailor Moon fight something from HP Lovecraft. \nAnother stand out quality is the sound. This is some of the best music you will hear in an anime. It drives the\n          \n        character's forward, builds suspense and perfectly fits the situation. It's a mix of pop, electronic and still manages to have a 'grand' quality about it.\nOverall, I'd say that the pure tragedy of this story is what I remember most. Not the characters, or even the designs (which were memorable), but the story. It's almost a call back to the Greek tragedies, a hero suffering and ultimately defeated due to pure human folly. \nI won't reveal exactly what happens, but you figure out something bad is going to happen from the beginning. It's the inevitability that is so heart-breaking. Watching these characters fight against their fate, and wanting them to succeed, even though you know it isn't possible.\nGive it a watch, form your own opinion. But love it or hate it, it's certainly memorable.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    When I think of the Magical Girl genre in Anime I think of an innocent light-hearted story about a bunch of young girls using magical powers to fight evil, and that would be as deep as it would go. That's exactly what I thought when I was going into the magical girl Anime 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica' but could I have been proven anymore wrong. This anime not only surprised me, but it heavily touched me emotionally, and it takes a lot to do that.\nThe animes setting revolves around Magical Girls, who form a contract with this white mysterious creature named Kyubey, where they can ask\n          \n        for any wish imaginable in return for carrying the duties of being a Magical Girl. A Magical Girls job is to hunt down and kill witches, which are formed from as Kyubey put it \"As Magic Girls are born from wishes, witches are born from curses.\" If they were not stopped these witches would otherwise continue to kill and torment innocent people, in the forms of accidents, suicides and other horrible outcomes, since normal people cannot see them, people are none the wiser to their existence. When they are near a witch, the magical girls go into a sick and twisted alternate world called a ‘labyrinth’ made by the witches, where all the animation style  changes and really creeps you the hell out. Still sounds like an innocent story right, WRONG.\nThe story of this anime is surprisingly one of the darkest stories I’ve seen, there being twists and tragedies occurring that cannot help but make you feel sick to the stomach, and scenes that will no doubt bring a tear to your eye. The anime centres around Madoka Kaname, an eighth grader of Mitakihara middle school. One day, she had a very magical encounter along with her friend 'Sayaka Miki' where they met Kyubey and the magical girl 'Mami Tomoe' and from there they were shown the life of a Magical Girl. The story contains an unbelievable amount of sadness for a Magical Girl anime, especially the last few episodes of the series where I couldn't help but have watery eyes for most of the time.\nAll the characters in the anime are done extremely well, where you feel a connection with all of them as you learn of their trudged pasts and the kind of challenges they really need to go through, the exception being 'Mami Tomoe' which I felt like was a character that didn't really get explored much, and was never really able to connect with the viewers.\nThe art style of the anime was absolutely brilliant, when in the normal world the art style is normal, with some high quality visuals for the scenery, great lighting, and great atmosphere. The character designs were top notch, both when they were normal and as magical girls. However when they enter the ‘labyrinths’ the animation style changes into a unique and crazy style each time. This not only makes the labyrinths seem crazier, but scarier as well, the kind of things you see seem like they came right out of someone’s worst nightmares. Each time it’s slightly different and brings a whole unique feeling to the anime as a whole; as it affects the viewer’s feel of the entire setting of the anime.\nThe sound was an absolute piece of gold, not only was it captivating but it successfully aided the scenes so much more, that it brought entire feelings of emotions with them, from joy to pure sadness. The sound effects used in the anime were outstanding, from the simple sounds of the ambience and such, to the awesome sounds of the magic and fighting sounds that occur, the sound effects are done supremely well. \nThe only negative I feel this anime had was how it didn’t explore into 'Mami Tomoes’ character, however this doesn’t negatively impact the anime for reasons that I shall not spoil for you. Another thing that some people might find a negative is the fact that from the outside the anime is a giant lie, from the cute and happy intro to the seemingly happy setting in the start, the anime can truly fool those expecting and wanting a happy and joyful anime, because when in the middle of it, this is absolutely not the case.\nIn the end the series has one of the most emotionally sad yet happy endings I’ve seen, it truly nails the ability to make me cry every time I see it, and every time I Think about it. However the anime did get a sequel movie, which is really a whole other thing to review, but I will say that the ending for the movie truly destroyed my very soul in a way I wouldn’t think possible, it has THE most heart shattering ending I have seen.\nOverall the anime was an enormous surprise to me; easily being one I can call a Masterpiece in all ways without the look of such quality on the surface. I personally believe every single person should watch this anime. Whether or not you like Magical Girl animes, this one will be an anime to never forget. A true emotional and heart wrenching experience.  10/10"},

I couldn't be more wrong.\nWhat compelled me to watch this show and revise my thoughts was the combination of Aniplex (for great animation), Yuki Kajiura (for wonderful music) and Gen Urobochi (for splendid story). That combination never failed.\nAt first, I thought the animation was a bit \"sketchy\" instead of fluid. Aside from the scene before the opening, the animation looks like it's sketched on a notepad. However! It's actually because of a reason in the story, specifically related to the bad guys. When I\n          \n        see them, I feel a sense of dread and horror like when you descend into madness. A twisted version of wonderland. Kudos to Aniplex.\nThe music is absolutely wonderful. It always sets the right mood for the right scene, whether it's sad, happy or dreadful, and listening back to the bgms makes me remininsce the scenes. I especially love the music during the ominous versions, when you feel like all hope it drained from you. Yuki Kajiura is probably my favorite musician right now. Oh, and Kalafina's \"Magia\" is going right into my playlist!\nLastly, the story. Like I said in the beginning, the cover is absolutely misleading, so are the few first episodes. It was first like a normal Sailor Moon anime where a young girl without confident begins to see wonders of magic and wants to be a part of it. And then BAM! Real world takes over and it only continues to spiral into madness from there on. While how the story progresses is not entirely original, it is rare enough to take you by surprise. There are definitely some sad scenes, though due to me having seen sadder animes, I didn't really feel teary. The only thing I can complain is the ending actually. While it's not what I expected, I found it somewhat lacking, like they just realized they are on the last episode and just had to throw something in.\nOverall, this is one of the best series I have ever seen and I recommend it for everyone.\n        "},

Basically, too much time is spent introducing characters and establishing setting with an imbalanced amount dedicated to key events.\nThe plot is consistent overall, although there are several key instances in which the protagonists’ actions are questionable. Granted that erratic behavior is common in stressful situations, several of the protagonists’ key decisions are simply inconsistent with their personalities. The challenges of the protagonists are easy to relate, making the story consistently thought provoking. In life, there is rarely an end: a semblance of resolution is often buried in suffocating despair; with happiness remains uncertainty; we as sentient beings are rarely fulfilled because these decisions are our existence.  Certain audiences may enjoy the translation of these realistic undertones into the story. In my case, I felt unfulfilled; as a number of the protagonists’ mistakes seemed to serve little purpose beyond setting atmosphere. \nStory (50%) \n-Premise: Positive (3)\n-Depth: Positive (3)\n-Logical: Neutral (2)\n-Pacing: Negative (1)\n-Entertainment: Neutral (2)\n11/15= 36.66 Points\nCharacters (35%) \n-Depth: Positive (3)\n-Development: Neutral (2)\n-Unique: Positive (3)\n-Interactions- Neutral (2)\n10/12: 29.16 Points\nProduction (15%)\n-Art: Positive (3)\n-Music: Positive (3)\n-Effects: Positive (3)\n9/9: 15 Points\nTotal Score: 81/100"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    If there is one anime that deserves a flawless rating, it is the Puella Magi Madoka Magica series artistically crafted by the Christopher Nolan of the manga/anime World, Gen Urobutcher, I mean Urobuchi. Herein lies the rub.\nForgive my vulgarity, but when I first dabbled into the dark magic known as Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica. I fully expected it to be your typical magical moe girl shit, I had assumed those who had rated it so highly were smoking some form of crack cocaine whilst tripping on Lysergic acid diethylamide. I am man enough to admit my faults, and I have seen the error of my ways.\n          \n         Being wrong never felt so good. \nStory 10/10\nI was so entranced by the gripping story line. Urobuchi took something ordinary (Magical Moe Girls) and took it to a whole another level, an extraordinary feat. Pure Horror, unadulterated violence, visceral gore, and a healthy dose of paranoia exudes the essence of the plot. These are themes not usually found in magical girl genre.  \nArt 10/10\nThe Art is top notch, a class act. Very reminiscent to another popular anime Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. No complaints from me here. Shaft spares no expense when it comes to animation. And they have the best animators in the industry, just look at the Monogatari series. \nSoundtrack 10/10\nInherently amazing, without a blemish. I listen to the (Connect) Madoka OP theme song every time I go to work, and when I come home. It is a ritualistic part of my day. As I absorb the Mozart-esque music into my eardrums. I like to pretend that I am a magical moe girl, defeating the darkness that would consume the universe.\nCharacters 10/10\nUrobuchi's characters are very dialog driven, much like Quentin Tarantino, most of his movies are dialog and character driven, the plot is almost secondary. The subtleties are all there, a great script and background music can transform an average piece, into legendary, mythical proportions. \n\nOverall 10/10\nIf there's one thing Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica taught me is that, to accept all genres, you never know when a serendipitous gem might surface from the ground. Please give this a chance, do it for Madoka!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Time to dive right into the atypical magic girl anime, Madoka Magika.\nPremise is that there's a young girl named Madoka, who's all normal and shit. One day, she comes across a creature named Kyubey being attacked by a girl at Madoka's school named Homura. Madoka soon learns about the Puella Magi, magic girls who are granted one wish from Kyubey at the expense of fighting witches. Kyubey takes great interest in Madoka and asks if she wants to become a magic girl. The story then goes on from there.\nStory - 10 \n------------\nStory may not sound too interesting to some of y'all but there's more to\n          \n        it revealed later on, which ultimately affect Madoka's decision on whether becoming a magic girl or not. It reveals a lot stuff, mainly Kyubey's mission on Earth, why Homura tried attacking him so much, some very tragic stuff involving the formation of witches and some other stuff. Overall, though, the story can get very depressing, which is usually unheard of in a magic girl anime (of course some of y'all may disagree, which is fine, we all have different tastes). I knew what the story was overall way back when since I spoiled it for myself, but I still loved it, especially the very bittersweet (IMO) ending.\nArt - 10 \n---------\nI really liked the art style in this one, especially in one aspect. The characters looked appealing enough for me, the scenery was very nice looking (or depressing looking) to me, but the big points go to anything involved with witches. I guess to show how corrupt and crazy these witches are, the art style was made so that the witches' \"mazes\" looked like a bunch of random cut outs mixed into a big collage of just unnerving and very weird imagery. It was trippy, to say the least. Witches also didn't look like the horror style witches I was expecting. Instead, they basically look like something out of Coraline, and if you know what I mean, yeah, it's pretty creepy sometimes.\nSound - 10\n-------------\nThis was also a big plus for me. The opening intro sounded both light and happy yet also sad in a hidden way for me, and the ending theme was dark yet also kind of badass. The OST also was very good to me. The music was successfully suspenseful to me many times, and also managed to be cheery, albeit, that is rare in this anime lol. Big points go to the more calm, melancholic, and sad pieces from me though. Those really got to me the most. Sound effects were also pretty damn well to me, but really, the music is what I liked the most. Oh, and props to the voice actors as well. I think they did a good job IMO.\nCharacters - 8\n----------------\nMadoka is obviously the main gal being focused on here, but the other characters also play a big role. Homura looks cold and emotionless at first glance but really, is actually extremely close to Madoka and Madoka herself doesn't even know it. Madoka was pretty standard to me but I thought she was very nice, so I cared for her. There's also a girl named Mami, who I also liked and thought was helpful, although she sadly has something happen to her early on in the show. There's then Kyoko, a girl who you may or may not hate because she first comes in with quite the bitch attitude. I personally liked her, especially for having such a sad backstory. There's also Madoka's friend who I unfortunately can't get the name fully right. I know it starts with an S though, I just don't want to butcher it. She is also a nice gal to me with good intentions but does have quite a downfall as the story goes on. Kyubey, much like Homura, also plays a major role in the show. There are also other peeps but I'm just rounding out the main ones. I give this an 8 though since there wasn't really one character I was very attached to. Don't get me wrong, I like all of them a lot, even Kyubey, but there wasn't one where I was very close to, but ah well.\nEnjoyment - 9\n----------------\nI really enjoyed this one. I was nervous to watch this one for a while fearing it would make me way depressed, but despite making me feel down, and almost made me cry a few times, I had a fun time. Those action scenes, the melancholic moments, the hopeful moments, the disturbing moments, and especially that bittersweet ending just all combined in making this a sad yet happy (if that makes sense) anime for me.\nOverall - 10\n-------------\nOverall, I am so glad I heard of this a while back, and I am so glad I finally got to watch it. The art, sound, and story were mah high points, and the characters also mixed very well into everything for me. It was sad, dark, depressing, creepy, maybe even scary, but also happy, joyful, and I'd say hopeful, especially at the end. I just love that ending so much. Now I gotta go onto the movies, as a way to basically rewatch the show in a different way.\nI don't like making recommendations since people have different tastes, but I'd say, if you want to try a magic girl anime that is quite different to the norm, or wanna tap into something quite sad and depressing at times, maybe you can try this one out. Either way, you make the call.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    This anime has an outstanding the story. The story is unpredictable for Maho Shoujo. At the first time, i think the plot was normal from begin till end or this anime was a sailormoon-like, but In one of the episode I realize that it was a looping. For the looping anime, it still keep the consistency for the whole plot. \nThe art is very great, I can see the details, such an episode that show Homura browing in internet, the flying sword because Homura stoped the time. \nFor the sound, it is very good. We can see from the homura voice, the changes was clearly.\n          \n\nThe characters was good. I think homura should be a people in title. But I am still waiting for the reason, why madoka is the main actor. The information that I have now is only, she has a great power when she become a puella magi.\nI am enjoying this anime especially for watching episode 10. One factor that I enjoy this anime was an predictable plot that usually has for looping time anime. I can make some possible ending, but, sometimes my prediction was wrong. \nOverall, this anime was great. I enjoy watching and I recommend to re-watch this anime because there're a lot anime details that very surprising. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Solid, solid anime, easy 10, but definitely requiring a second watch. On my first run, I gave it an 8, but there is just so much hiding in the story that cannot be picked up without knowing the context, which isn't given until later on in the story. I personally adored the papercraft style of the labyrinths, but it may not be for everyone, so that's a personal thing, and others have commented about the hatching on the eyes, which I feel gives the anime a unique charm and makes it stand out a bit more. Hard to say much about it without spoiling, as\n          \n        it is a very tightly woven anime, but it is definitely not your average mahou shoujo, and without a doubt, even people who aren't fans of the genre should give this one a watch for its universal appeal.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    I was very much disappointed by this anime show.\nEarlier I had read that it would do to the 'magical girl genre' what elfen lied had done to the 'guy finds cute girl genre'…\nHalfway through the show I most definably found that it did not.\nThe story did not engage as I had hoped it would. I was not able to really relate to any of the characters which makes it hard to really feel for their struggles. Also the grown ups in this show are incredibly stupid it seems.\nThe biggest buzzkill for me was that the show uses a very specific style of animation to depict\n          \n        the evil spirits in the anime and I did not care for that at all.\nOther then that the combat in this show for which I had high hopes (magical girls meet elfen lied!?) did not deliver!\nEven though I had high hopes for this one I'm fairly sure I would not have enjoyed it much even if I hadn't set such a high standard. Honestly the concept they went for was quite nice and original but I can't help but feel they could have done so much more with this…\n"},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="                          \n    If your anime list only consists of 3 - 5 titles, I wouldn't be quick to call PMMM a masterpiece. \nThat's not to say the anime wasn't necessarily bad, but it certainly isn't the critically acclaimed masterpiece that everyone makes it out to be. Seriously, it's like we're reliving the times of Elfen Lied and Higurashi (the anime adaption, not the VN— the VN was pretty good) when everybody thought tragic loli harems with gore were the best animes ever. \nIt's not doing anything that other animes haven't already done, and it certainly isn't a \"deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre like everyone makes it\n          \n        out to be. If you want an actual deconstruction, watch Revolutionary Girl Utena. Utena did a much better job at criticizing issues within the shoujo genre, oh, and the creators don't compare their characters to terrorists.\n(For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, in an interview Urobuchi compared the girls to Al-Qaeda.)\nDark themes aren't something unfamiliar within the magical girl genre. Princess Tutu was dark, Sailor Moon had it's share. Even PRETTY CURE, a mahou shoujo directed at 5 year-old girls, had pretty rad fight scenes. PMMM takes a bunch of elements from Magical Lyrical Nanoha, an anime made by the very same company. \nPMMM is just another tragedy with moe girls directed at a male audience (yes, it's directed at a male audience, the creator himself made this pretty clear) so dudes can fantasize about boning helpless woobie lolis. \nAll that being said, I did enjoy watching it. I just don't think it deserves all the praise it gets. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=11,   ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica is an anime that you are supposed to consider through the character's perspective, alike Elfen Lied. \nStory - 8 = The story is admittedly made very minimal. Firstly, there is a switch from the expectation of shoujo style magical girl into the very rare seinen magical girl genre. Second, there are a lot of people who should appear to be role models, only to show that the human heart is fickle and cruel when not being considerate enough. However, I will say that the theme of rivalry and friendship and befriending your enemy is very weak and contrived here and it takes up\n          \n        too much time.\nThe biggest story theme is caution and it is extremely vital here. It is possible to have great power, but it does not really feel like a power at all. This is the most realistic fictional analogy concerning what it takes to grow up because so many adults have power, but they act like they need something more or they put themselves in an endless cycle. This is why Madoka's hope is so vital to add conclusiveness to the world. She is the only true magical girl, even if she is afraid to embrace the magick. However, this is mainly because of how others keep pushing for her to succeed. They remind her not to make a dangerous decision time and time again, like adults in real life do, but she must make the most daring push in order to make for a fulfilling life.\nThis is the real way toward saving the world and it is masterful that it has been expressed here.\nHonestly, just this theme makes Madoka high art. While it might not have slow building character and arcs like classic literature is supposed to, but the slow building does not always work and the limited time frame only adds to the story. Additionally, literature focuses on making the characteristics of the world into ideas that deepen your horizon of understanding. Madoka Magica is very successful in that aspect and surpasses classic literature that is too grounded in reality and pessimism based on what is known to actually convey something meaningful.\nOne last theme is hope. Many people have died in the belief that a dream can come true. The only thing left is to hope that someone will arrive to adamantly carry the lost flame.\nMy opinion is that the 4th episode was super scary and the last two episodes were cohesive and artful. Yet, the idea about the history of magical girls feels a bit on the edge for me. Something about it was very poorly executed but I do not recall why.\nArt - 9 = The sci-fi landscape in this anime is incredible! Everything is subdued by the seeming blandness, but the amazingly advanced desks, holograms and such inside of the school give us the idea that there are many cool advances in technology that we never see. The fact that the power is never on in these rooms and such means that a lot of people are probably using all sorts of entertaining technologies. Leaving out the details is what Madoka Magica relies on and the fact that everyone is so sedated and mundane really lends to the need for Madoka's magick.\nThe characters seem like they would be completely cheery, but even the school showcases that things are not at all upbeat and everything feels industrial more than urban. Additionally, it does not feel like we could be looking at Japan. This could be Russia for how different the landscape is. For the sake of fooling us, the school has traditionally Japanese school uniforms.\nAlso, it is always sunset because things generally take place after school. This gives everything a very nice, provocative appearance that allows you to care about friendship and bonds in a different way than the plot does by itself.\nWitches are the main artistic area, of course. The witches all look like the background of a Klimt painting. There's also some Andy Warhol elements and probably something else. I did not really like it, but I think that the work was really complicated to do and should not subtract much from the rating. \nSound - 6 = The opening and ending songs are top-notch, but you will probably only remember one song that plays during the actual anime. Honestly, I did not like that song. However, I feel like there were probably some other decent tracks I did not pay attention to.\nVoice acting is pretty much fine, but a little stale. You have heard these voice actors before and I prefer arguably bad voice actors to those that are too familiar or too cool-sounding. Madoka is a great voice, though. Her mother might be, but I do not remember. She might just have that Rangiku voice actor who does a lot of mother voices.\nThe sounds used are pretty low. The witches could feel a lot more interesting with better sounds, but they just have distorted voices. Combat pretty much has five sounds at the most. There seemed to be a lack of sound when they were on the highway with many cars, which seems pretty lazy I suppose.\nCharacter - 7 = The nice thing about the beginning of the show is that the characters already feel a little desperate. Madoka and Sayaka are pretty much clinging to each other for support and Madoka's mother is never home and comes home drunk (rather unique for a mother character). Her mother is really a fleshed out character, but Madoka is dreamy and plain as a Disney princess although showing a tinge of unique personality so small that it might be impossible to pinpoint. But, Madoka is probably one of my favorite characters ever because she makes me feel like I am not the only one. The plot gives her more meaning than most people will want to appreciate or understand. Additionally, she and Sayaka seem to wander in their minds the most. Madoka is special for being the only support-based character despite being the most powerful magical girl. Everyone else in the story is very active, but Madoka is trying to compose herself and keep others more composed and in harmony.\nSayaka is pretty much your average tsundere, I guess. She acts tough, but hides a lot under that shell. However, she is pretty unique as a tsundere given that what she hides is being highly envious and poising dangers to herself in order to provide justice to the world. She basically represents your average shounen hero, but is broken down and becomes increasingly neglectful of love and respect.\nMami is a character that Sayaka and Madoka treat like a true mother figure. It was very endearing to see a stranger who was willing to focus everything on making a future for the others. Although, it seems like this is somewhat a facade of her personality, just like any kind person. She is a person strongly driven by motive and she is skilled at battling alone but her fault seems to lay in not being able to form strong enough bonds.\nKyouko is a nice character. She is very much an urbanite, but she has a past that was very painful. Her father seems to be a representation of offshoot religions like Mormonism or Scientology, but presumably, it was not such a negative religion. Kyouko just adds depth to what a magical girl behaves like, but I really do not remember much about her.\nHomura is a very important character who acts cruelly in the beginning. She really excels as a character in that she is a stoic who has a very strong sense of purpose, but she actually is emotionally driven, too. When it comes to Madoka, she puts her wellbeing above everything. She saves Madoka's life many times, but she also represents a deep pessimism, which you might have witnessed from some adults, in telling Madoka that nobody is worth trusting besides her. We are shown her development at the end of the story and it seems logical, but it actually makes her character a bit more artificial while adding a lot more to the themes of the story. Her determination is the world's strongest and reminds me of how I wanted to feel if I had something important to protect (before my life view changed).\nBackground characters are essential to adding more to this story and when you see how militaristic and homogenized the students are, the advanced world and its minor characters coalesce to show great disdain for the magick in the world.\nOne daring scene is where a worldly criticism is made by a faceless man on the subway or bus. He says, girls are trash and basically deserving of rape and domestic violence and everything. He says that women do not deserve anything because they go out and waste their money on clothes and accessories and such. This is extremely misogynistic and generalized if applied to the world in general, but for some people (like the usual magical girl type) they really do act in superficial ways that can exacerbate financial stability. They do this out of stress from abusive people like the boyfriend. (The blue-haired girl) Sayaka says that they are wrong to say these things because the girl obviously loved him a lot to stay with such a jerk. The important thing is that these apparent criminals might be strapped for both cash and freedom and instead of being helped, their lover is spending money for escapism (which can be applied to more than just women as well). While the man is not a strong person and this is why he mistreats her, he could really have a very stressful life. He is still wrong to do what he does, but we are given a deeper context to a very, very sensitive issue.\nKyubey is kind of a boring character, but his design is really good. However, it is fun to see the girls lash out at him.\nWhy is the rating only a 7? The characters interact in very artificial ways. The are more customized archetypes and tools for Madoka rather than people who interact with one another. However, I think the message being explained was worth the sacrifice.\nEnjoyment - 8 = The battle scenes are a little too fun to watch - I wish I could focus more on emotional content. The aesthetic is really good and the fast pace and focus on central ideas is something enjoyable to me even if it is a reason to dislike the show.\nOverall 7/10!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Spoiler free review!\nAt first I thought everyone was raving about this series because it was disturbing or something, and I would see little moe girls getting slashed and hacked into pieces-- but that's really not the case! This series is not disturbing at all. It handles dark themes but not dark in a ‘gory’ or ‘crass’ way but in a serious, mature and realistic way. In fact I think this is perhaps one of the best innocence/love/friendship stories I have ever watched. In short this is a must watch for anyone who enjoys anime, or if you are new to anime.\nI also recommend that this\n          \n        anime be watched twice to pick up on all the foreshadowing that you miss when you don’t know the whole story of what’s going on!\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    For a teenage guy who desires to quench his boredom by watching anime with heavy themes, carefully written storylines with some crazy plot twists and a somewhat mysterious and depressing atmosphere, seeing young girls form a contract with a pussylike creature capable of granting wishes (your typical fairy godmother) in exchange of service as magical girls fighting evil witches isn't usually the best idea. Of all the seinen mystery thriller drama series out there, why did I decide to watch Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, a story about such? I wonder myself. But was it worth the time I wasted? I would have to say it\n          \n        definitely is.\nStory\nIt would be very, very bad for this show to be spoiled ahead because of some plot twists, which, although do not boast of unique and well-formulated concepts, are still enough for viewers to love and enjoy the show. I definitely would not argue that the storyline was perfect; in fact I had to endure the temptation of dropping the show at first, because it initially felt like everything was going nowhere and the 8+ rating the anime has garnered seemed like a big joke. The story needed viewers who are patient enough to know more of the questions raised, whether implicitly or explicitly in the entire storyline. I'll just give a bunch of pros and cons of the story which I noticed other reviews have made, and honestly that was pretty effective in pointing out the good and bad things about the show (because that's what it does, duh) but anyway.\nPROS\n1. The story was well executed and it was clear that a considerable amount of effort was put into it. Enough mystery was emphasized to keep the viewers hooked and wanting to arrive at the answers; this was achieved by continuously raising questions, whether explicitly or implicitly, and, I feel, by providing incomplete conclusions at the end of every episode to make the viewers feel like, damn it, I want to know what happens next. \n2. Events raised in earlier parts of the episodes were significant in how they would influence the succeeding episodes, making it fluid and logical, and not made for what a great maker of reviews liked to call, plot conveniences.\n3. There were somewhat logical explanations for some details of the plot, like why one character was overpowered or why this event leads to this event, making the story conveniently believable.\n4. Overall there was enough reason to commend the story; it's not really unique or grand, but it was well-presented.\nCONS\n1. There was a really slow build-up of the story at the start; as what I have mentioned, I almost wanted to drop the anime because of \"what should I feel about this anime\" syndrome I have been suffering with anime with slow story development. I felt like it could have been better if the anime had hinted at the bigger picture at the earlier parts of the story to make the mystery feel like it was leading into a bigger sense.\n2. Along with the slow build-up of the story is the sudden burst of information on a limited amount of time to explain important parts of the story *cough, spoiler alert, cough*. I think that was in one particular episode nearing the end where explanations for why this and why that were presented. That one episode was exceptionally amazing, but since it wasn't hinted at the earlier parts of the anime, it felt like everything was pumped up in one episode and almost felt like it was not as related as it actually is to the entire story. The concept that was presented was actually not mentioned  in the previous episode but for a legitimate reason that it would ruin the suspense and the plot twist and entire good behind the show. I wish it could have been fleshed a bit or hinted a little in the first episode or so.\nCharacters\nHonestly, I thought that Madoka, the MC, by the way, if it's not THAT obvious, was annoying for almost the entire show - before the explanations or resolutions came to play. She's one of those characters we see in anime that are way too helpless, way too kind and shit like that, without any real character development (initially, at the least). She loves her friends so much, she wants to be friends with everyone, but she's way too helpless to protect them. Yeah, some would say that it's because she was literally helpless at the start - shit, I am almost close to spoilers - but I think the helplessness of Madoka was way more than the literal interpretation; she has that helpless will and personality. She wants to stop her friends from fighting, but instead she watches from the sidelines and wait for some savior to come and then rush to join the scene. I felt like the main character she was supposed to be wasn't really a significant role to some extent and just existed just to link the pieces of mystery together. The good thing about Madoka is that this helplessness allows her to sympathize the feelings of the average reasonable viewer - always hesitant to distinguish the right thing to do and the wrong one, always having the desire to set things right that will not compromise another, but lacking the will to do it because of the fear that it might not lead to the right path. That characterization of Madoka is essential for me, because it allows an avenue for doubt and hesitation, which makes the mystery even more worthwhile. The annoying thing though is that this personality makes Madoka do nothing in the end, which is dangerous for a main character, to be stagnant and passive. By the way the transformation of Madoka aka her character development in the end (fck spoilers) was really amazing and it was the kind of resolution that brings satisfaction to the otherwise plain and helpless Kaname Madoka.\nThe other characters have pretty solid personality, the MC's mother Junko was ever-motherly and was significant in being a guiding figure, not to mention being a badass at some point. Miki Sayaka was the character wanting to be a hero (or heroine, whatever), that strong and fierce personality was what could be the solid character for the MC *typical shounen alert* who although is very stubborn, still has the somewhat badass personality. I just felt that the friendship of Madoka and Sayaka should have more emphasis and it was not touched particularly by the anime. Kyouko Sakura was not really presented well. I felt like her motives and personal beliefs weren't characterized clearly, so it wasn't clear why in the end she became a supporting character and ended up cooperating with the team. However I felt that it was pretty good to have her backstory brought up in order to put emphasis on her as an important supporting character, as well as to provide explanations why she acts tough and independent. Tomoe Mami was solid and brought up a good introductory atmosphere in the story, although her character was not fleshed out well. I wished there were some parts about her that were explained better *spoiler alert*. Kyuubey is an interesting character. At first I feel really annoyed with how \"robotic and emotionless\" he acts, but seeing the explanations for his actions makes me really wonder about my existence. Lol. Akemi Homura, which is my MVP in this anime, is just damn amazing. The character development, or should I say, the revelation of how her character came to be is carefully presented, is logical, and spawned the entire existence of an anime so good it would definitely count as one of my favorites. The character was not your know-it-all and overpowered MC without any real personality (like Kirito). She has her weaknesses, she has her character motivations, and her actions and feelings are as realistic as it could actually be. Overall, there were interesting characters presented, though real character development, which is not a presentation of how the character came to be but a development of the current personality of the character through events faced, was not really presented.\nArt and Sound\nHonestly, I don't really care about the art and sound; you might as well say that I have very low standards on that matter. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica did probably okay with the art, although it faltered a bit short compared to other artstyles of other anime. It was annoying too that Madoka had a somewhat extra line drawn on the edge of her face that makes her look more of a drawing and less realistic, I don't know if that was part of the artistic portrayal. The villains too were animated interestingly and seemed like an abstract piece of art, which was nonetheless visually acceptable to me. The art styles of the different magical girls were somewhat generic, although it felt amazing to see the diversities in their special abilities matched with their outfits. I just felt that the outfits did not become impactful to actually say that they undergo transformation; it did not really make a difference. In terms of sound, I find the opening soundtrack pleasing to my ears, I won't say that it's good, because it's not my thing to distinguish good music from not. That's all I have to say about the sound.\nOverall Enjoyment\nThe concept that was going to be presented in the anime was not unique, I'd say. What I liked about the anime is that the concept they presented was successfully delivered to the audience. Moreover, deeper themes, more than the fact of being magical girls that save people from witches, were explored. Like even if how simple a premise that you will gain a wish, aside from your magical powers, in exchange for lifetime service fighting evil may seem, things like that are much more complicated. It may seem like a take-it-all deal, the characters realized that there's something much more to that. I also liked that even if the show was supposed to show magical girls doing magical stuff, the anime was able to bring forth an atmosphere of sadness and despair, which definitely proves that things are not always as they seem. In general, the show was amazing while being clear and understandable at the same time.\nMagic brings power and happiness, they say. But in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, magic brings more than such, and it is up to the magical girls to understand despair and the true meaning of sacrifice.\n        "},

You soon come to realize these characters are much like the ones in Claymores in more ways than one. All the characters have honest motives that drive even if they lose focus. I highly suggest giving it a watch and if you are a person who tends to tear up at sad things get prepared.\n"},

Everything might seem all jumbled up at first but bit by bit it is slowly woven together. The show only spans 12 episodes but manages to squeeze a lot in- it’s small but power packed.\nThe show is about ‘Puella Magi’, who are mages who gain their power from a peculiar cat like creature, some sort of alien. If\n          \n        the recipient wishes to have any single wish they have granted, no matter what the wish, they can have it come true provided they promise to become a mage- of course these kinds of offers don’t come without a catch. The show follows the lives of a few of these magi, namely Madoka and her friends. These magi must fight witches in order to keep the world safe from their evil deeds and on the face of it, that’s the entire story, so it’s nothing out of the ordinary. The rest of this review might seem a bit unfocussed on the actual anime but that’s because this anime is really not about the story itself, it’s about the bigger picture, it’s about the picture it paints for you to behold.\nAll that being said, this is where things start to get interesting, it’s all about the portrayal of all of their lives and what they have to go through that makes this show what it is. The show is more of a metaphor for what we go through in life and explores some really abstract themes through some equally abstract methods of getting them across. It is probably this aspect of the show that will polarise people- I can see why certain people would be put off by the extremely off-base nature of the show, however if you can look past that and actually appreciate what it is supposed to represent you can understand what the show is trying to explain.\nWhat probably surprised me the most was that this show tries to explore some really heavy emotions such as grief, death, misery and sheer hatred in such a forthright way. Now that is a far cry from what a lot of people, including myself would expect when they would first look at this show. When you look at the “girl mage” genre most people think the usual cutesy characters doing some magic. Oh, but how wrong is that. Right from the first episode you will realise this show is as dark as they get. The show is heavily focussed on the alien and the group of magi and how they get through life. Rarely would you see external people, other than at school, but even that is minimal. The whole show revolves and really fleshes out the personality and journey of each mage. Each of them has a distinct personality and while usually exaggerated to get the trait across, are all relatable to some sort of degree.\nThe fight scenes with the witches themselves are out of this world. The swords which magically pop out of nowhere to the massive guns which they seem to wield with such ease. Sometimes you find yourself wondering if you are actually watching a scene right out of some sci-fi movie! The witches themselves are abstract beings and the setting in which you fight even more so, the animation is not the usual animation you expect and it’s more as if you are staring at a piece from Picasso, inside which they seemed to be fighting. This type of art style really grows on you as the show goes on, the camera angles, the various ways that simple scene is projected, all of it is very interesting.\nThe story is not as important as the actual message and emotions it manages to get across and personally the story didn’t really intrigue me at all compared to just taking in all the emotions and events that occurred. By the end when everything does come together it really reinforces the ideas and messages to great affect and it’s like an “ahhh” moment where you appreciate everything that has built up to that moment.\nThe OP and ED were interesting and personally I while I found the OP pretty standard, the second ED was of particular interest, given the dark undertones. The sounds were also pretty well done throughout the fight scenes and kept the pace up. The art style is very specific and some people might not be so taken in by it, as again it embraces the different, edgy feel the show gives you.\n\nThe feelings you will feel while watching this show aren’t always nice in fact you will feel terrible at times and at others there will be sheer disbelief. The show is a roller-coaster ride- with more downs than ups. When you finish watching it, you won’t exactly know what to feel and it’s a really rare feeling upon finishing an anime. In the end you can’t help but feel that you have experienced something very different, something that very few anime can do.\n\nTukky12\n=)\n        "},

As a thirty-something father of two, I also certainly don't typically fall into the target demographic for this sort of show.\nIn spite of that, I decided to give the show a try since it had been talked about on so many Youtube videos as an excellent show.  While the series sort of gets off to a slow start, there are events that unfold within the first four episodes that make it very clear that this is not a typical \"moe\" show.  Very\n          \n        weighty and impactful things happen to the cast of characters.  It became very apparent that this show is not for small children children.  Years ago, a friend in college recommended Revolutionary Girl Utena because it was the first \"dark shojo\" and that it had a universal appeal.  I ended up watching the show and it arguably gave rise to countless shows in the 2000s onward.  This show can be viewed similarly for its impact on the magical girl genre...\nThe characters have depth and with perhaps one exception, none of them falls into an easy to define stereotype.  Every time you think you know where it is going, in terms of story, it throws you for another loop.  If there is any complaint about the story, it is that part of me wishes it were more than 12 episodes, if just to get a little more development of the side characters besides Madoka, Sayaka and Homura.  But that's nitpicking.\nThe art style is also fabulous.  Particularly when the girls enter into a witch's labyrinth, when the background is anything but typical anime.  The merging of the two art styles is done very well and if your enjoyment from anime comes from the visual aesthetics, you won't be disappointed.\nInterestingly, I was vaguely aware of the big twist that occurs at the mid-point of the series.  I can say this took nothing away from the experience and if anything kept me anticipating when the reveal would occur.  When it did, the specifics of it were still surprises and I was definitely impressed with the creativity of the writing.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica really is one of those timeless classics (albeit not that old) that really does cross genres and can appeal to everyone. \n        "},

I fully agree that it takes the magical girl genre and does something completely unique with it. It does it well, too.\nFor those who may be wondering: 1) Despite the cover art, this is a very dark anime, and 2) Despite the opening scene, it actually doesn't have that many action sequences. Madoka Magicka reminded me more of Steins:Gate than any other action or magical girl anime I've seen, because the dominant theme is karma. Cause and effect. I don't really know how to describe the story of Madoka\n          \n        Magicka besides making that comparison. It can be quite hard to follow exactly what is going on occasionally, especially at the end. Speaking of which, even though it was a little over-the-top for my tastes, it was one of the best endings I've seen, at least up until the sequel seeding.\nArt-wise, I really liked the style. The character art had a sort of pencil-drawn look to it. Meanwhile, the witch's labyrinth art was reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, and I felt it really added a lot to the experience, even if the detail level of the art was low.\nThe music was hit and miss, in my eyes. The Main Theme  and its variations ('Decretum'/'Ice'/etc) were excellent, but the rest didn't catch my ear. Though, after listening to the soundtrack in isolation, the music is definitely of great quality. It just didn't really register while I was watching. Whether that's a good or bad trait is up to the viewer, I suppose.\nThe main characters all felt fairly well-developed, with the possible exception of Kyouko (who isn't exactly a main character anyways). Compared to most anime though, the characters shine. I particularly loved how they approached Madoka as the main protagonist unconventionally.\nI'm finding this hard to rate overall. It's hovering around 8 or 9.\n        "},

It is what I consider to be the best Mahou Shoujo anime ever made, the best gender breaking anime of all time and the most emotional anime I've watched. \nStory: 8/10\nMahou Shoujo (or Magical Girls) animes mostly avoid investing time in world building. They mostly never ask questions like \"What are the villains?\", \"Why are they evil?\", \"Why do we have to fight them?\", etc. This one does, and it does it's job greatly. I was left with no question un-answered about the overall story or\n          \n        world by the end of the series.\nArt: 6/10\nIt's rather strange how they drew the characters in this series. I mean, they are not bad at all, but I wouldn't consider this a beautiful art style. But, it's understandable, it's an original anime and it's not on a film budget.\nSound: 8/10\nThis part is simple. The music was by Yuki Kayiura. That's it, that's more than enough to satisfy you.\nCharacters: 10/10\nThis is the part that I think Madoka Magica does the best. There is not a single character undeveloped. Except for the first death, there is not a single death I didn't cry to (although in the movie I did cry). Every character is so perfectly developed throughout the series!\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nThis is my second favorite anime of all time and, if I had the money, I would buy figures of ANYTHING of Madoka Magica that I see.\nOverall: 9/10\nThe little this anime fails in, is completly outweighted by the inmense amount of goodness that it has. I cannot recommend this anime enough. The series is not perfect, but, there is a trilogy of movies that, if you have watched and loved the series as much as I did, will make you fall off the edge of your sit and leave you laying on the floor of your room crying all day.\nThank you for reading.\n        "},

Well the thing that made me watch it a while ago is the anime community simply exploding and praising the hell out of it.. Were they right? YES, YES THEY WERE! \nStory: 9-10/10\nHere we have the story of Madoka, a normal highschool girl with a normal family,  and OH MY DEAR GAWD NO DECEASED PARENT(S), who meets a strange-looking-animal-thing, Kyuubey, that wants her to sign\n          \n        a contract with him and become a magical girl, yay.

There are so few shows that can present a girly outer shell promising action and ridiculous entertainment value, but then actually adding substance through a cautionary tale about getting what you want like Madoka Magica does. It easily slides into the initial guess of protagonist Madoka and Sayaka becoming magical girls into a downward spiral of tragedy and insanity in the face of dealing\n          \n        with the consequences of one's actions. \nSeriously everything in the show is either subverted or subversive in and of itself. As soon as the hopeful, colorful opening theme ends, you're hit with a psychological acid trip accompanied by haunting, epic operatic tracks to accompany the end (of each episode) and the action, and it really does the show well. Said acid trip action sequences are just as haunting, as it plays into the fact that the magical girls in the show are in for much more horror than they bargained for. \nThe first part that's important to note that sets the stage for the subversion of everything is the catalyst Kyubey. I won't say how for the sake of spoilers but you find out early in that he's not all he seems, and throughout the course of each episode, you find four very realistic characters being tossed around in a sea of deception; and this is what the show does best. Through his deception, you see a young, naive Madoka and Sayaka learn the consequences of becoming magical girls, and even more so through the past experiences of Mami, Kyoko, and Homura. I'm not saying the show is preachy, but the point behind the show is that you as the viewer are expected to be just as shocked at what happens to the characters in the story as they are. \nSo I can't say too much about the show without spoiling anything, but while the show expresses a good story about the consequences of not everything being what it seems, I was disappointed that the towards the end, the climax wasn't a dark mind bender and was instead a happier sequence of events that brought in Donnie Darko-esque time travel elements to fix the evil. That's only a minor gripe, and if you know me you know I don't like happy endings, and if you've seen the show you probably understand where I'm coming from. But you have to see the show to know what I'm talking about so I don't spoil anything. So overall, this was definitely a show that impacted me because of the seductively deceptive nature of it, so if you want something different and more subversive from anime, Madoka Magica can scratch that itch.\n"},

I initially checked it out because SHAFT (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Bakemonogatari, Arakawa Under The Bridge) was behind the project. Let’s just say that I’ve constantly enjoyed most of their work and was willing to look into Puella Magi Madoka Magica despite it being a genre I’ve never really enjoyed.\nSo what’s there to say about Puella Magi Madoka Magica? A lot apparently. This was a masterfully crafted story that injected new life to a tired genre without completely straying away from it. In a way, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is both a tribute\n          \n        and a deconstruction of the magical girl concept.\n\nThe show made good use of the 12 episodes it had, they wasted no time and used every episode to progress the story and develop the characters. Every character was important, each one was given sufficient growth and this made the tragic events have a bigger impact on the viewer. With all these important storytelling elements in place accompanied by unique visuals and gorgeous (sometimes heart wrenching) music, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has undoubtedly become one of the most remembered and revered shows of 2011.\nI think a lot of people mistakenly compare this to Neon Genesis Evangelion. And honestly? I don’t see a lot of similarities between the two. NGE presented itself as a mecha show that went on to write a completely different genre for itself. Madoka as I stated earlier, is more of a tribute and a deconstruction.\nIt has more in common with the grim Now and Then, Here and There delivering a story of hope in the backdrop of a despair-filled setting while still being somewhat loyal to the genre. Another commendable feat of this show is that it doesn’t sacrifice it’s plot for the sake of being different, it doesn’t blame anyone in particular for all the misfortune that’s happened and things still make sense if you think about it and the protagonists hardly act out of character.\nAs for flaws, the show doesn’t suffer from any major flaw but it might take some time to get used to the art style. Also, while the show did utilize the time it was given, the concept of entropy remains vague and isn’t exactly given a more concrete explanation. Other than that, Madoka remains to be a solid show I’d recommend to anyone. It now has a place in my all time favorites. Whether or not Madoka will leave a legacy in its wake is something only time can tell. It definitely has the makings of a classic, proving that you can still find a gem in this day and age when anime is saturated with mediocrity."},

Typically I avoid the magical girl genre, its just not my taste, but after seeing Madoka mentioned for the thousandth time in a week I finally relented to my curiosity and watched the short series the day after the last episode aired.  Much to my surprise, it wasn't half bad.  \nThe art in this series is heavily stylized, but truly fantastic and bursting with detail.  Given as much anime as i watch the fact that I can clearly remember\n          \n        scenes months later is a testament to that.  Sound quality is excellent and used to good effect.  \nCharacters in the series are likable (or unlikable when appropriate), but most are highly cliche and overflowing with girly angst (to be fair, its a feature of the genre).  For the most part they fall neatly into archetypes, but they undergo proper development as the story progresses. \nStory-wise, after the first couple episodes warm the series up Madoka stays enjoyable, though like most anime trying to be different it introduces plot elements that are frankly out of place (the big one is hard to mention without spoiling, but Ill just say that in a story that revolves around magic scientific explanations just aren't necessary).  Pacing is good, and a handful of twists (some which can be seen coming, but don't get tired) keep things fresh.  If you aren't a fan of the genre stick out the first couple episodes, they get progressively better after those. \nOverall, its one of the better anime in the last couple years and a treat to watch.  Groundbreaking?  No.  Thought provoking?  Slightly.  But its fresh enough and crafted with enough care to rise to the top of a genre that till now felt totally played out.  At 12 episodes its worth a watch for sure, you probably wont regret the four hours you invest.\n        "},

I think perhaps I was already in a dark mood when I first encountered this series, and it negatively impacted my viewing somewhat. Make no mistake, I think this is still an unpleasant series to some degree, but its shocking eagerness to tear apart the magical girl genre from the inside out kept a bitter smirk plastered on my face when it wasn't ripping my heart out. I've kept my original review mostly intact below, because I really don't feel like rewriting it, but I've bumped my score for it from an 8\n          \n        up to a 10. This is truly a great series, and I don't think it'll be long before it's held in the same sort of love/hate esteem that people reserve for deconstructor fleet shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion--though I can assure you that this is probably less-flawed than that particular program.)\nThis is a tough anime review for me to write, and a tough anime for me to assign a score to. I knew going into it that Madoka Magica was going to be a 'dark' take on the magical girl genre, and I was sort of prepared to hate it just based on that. I'm honestly sick of people equating 'dark' with 'good,' and have been for as long as I can remember. (Star Wars Episode III was praised to the high heavens for its 'darkness.' Am I the only one who thought that it was the worst entry in the prequel trilogy?)\nAnd I can safely report that I did not particularly enjoy this anime. Nor did I particularly like it. But I respect its artistry, and am positively in awe of its willingness to mercilessly and logically follow its initial rule-establishing through to its inevitable, bitter (sweet) end. Every episode is a wham episode, without any overt signs of contrivance. I'm not certain that there's an ounce of spare fat in the plot that could be done away with, other than arguably the first two episodes. Still, the first two episodes serve their purpose well--they set the viewer up for a cutsey, nice, slightly post-modern magical girl series before ripping the rug out from underneath you and allowing you to plummet through deeper and deeper horrors. \nIt sounds unpleasant--and I'm not going to lie, it sort of is. But it's also brave storytelling, anchored by fairly-well developed characters and a pervading sense of dread and tragedy that actually feels like proper tragedy--not just drama gussied up with heightened emotions and forced sorrow. And yes yes, it subverts this, that, and the other. Because we all dearly love our subverting, here.\nThe story revolves around Madoka and her friends, and their encounter with Kyubey, a weird cat-thing who tries to get them to become magic girls. Magic girls pay a steep price, hunting 'witches' who torment the general populace and drive individuals to suicide. The up-side to it for the girls, well, in addition to being magic girls, is that Kyubey will grant a wish of theirs. Of course, it's very quickly revealed that not all is as it seems, and things go to hell *very* quickly.\nSo, there's that. As for the art--well, the character designs don't do much for me--the ultra cute style never does. Unfortunately it also occasionally looks cheap, on top of that. The witches and the labyrinths, on the other hand... You know what? Just go watch this show. I'm no art major, and I lack the vocabulary necessary to explain to you just how awe-inspiring the art design is when the girls find themselves in a witch's labyrinth, each of which is its own unique place. \nOn the whole I'd say this is a series very much worth watching, even if it ultimately may be easier to admire than it is to like.\n        "},

Many of these shows are often filled with cheer while also spreading the message about love and friendship as the colourful band of girls battle evil with the aid of a cute and cuddly mascot character, find romance then go off to meet up for tea and cakes.\nHowever in January 2011, an all new\n          \n        anime series surfaced on TV in Japan that and changed Magical Girl anime as we know it. That anime was Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\nMadoka basically did for the Magical Girl genre what Evangelion did for the mecha genre in that it broke the mold by taking a more darker approach to an already well know genre. The first few episodes start out in the typical cheerfulness of Magical Girl anime, but this is merely a trick to cover up what's to come. After the third episode, the series goes down a much darker path with unsuspecting twists showing that becoming a magical girl is much like a deal with the devil and maitains a foreboding sense of threat. The characters go through so much pain and suffering that you actually feel bad. Even Kyubey, the token magical girl mascot of the show isn't all he seems and has a much more sinister agenda. This is defiantly a whole lot grittier than any Magical Girl anime before it. But this is really what makes it stand out.\nMadoka was picked up for a DVD release in the U.S. Valentine's Day 2012 by Aniplex before eventually being released in the U.K. by Manga Entertainment October 29 the same year and was awarded as Neo Magazine's favorite anime of 2012. And it's also become mine.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is a fresh new take on the Magical Girl genre with it's overall darker tone.

Not only how we think we want something, but also how far we're willing to go for that wish, what we're willing\n          \n        to do for it, and the consequences behind being given what we want. \nKyuubei, the wish-granter, is one of the most chilling characters i have ever met in the world of fantasy. And you end up empathising completely with Madoka and the other girls as their characters are so wonderfully developed within the series. The artwork is a mixture of cute-ish style and just plain wacked (you have to wonder how exactly some of these artists came up with them) and the soundtrack completes the mood so perfectlythat it all ultimately helps create an endearing and heartbreaking anime series. I've actually downloaded the entire soundtrack i thought it was so cool!\nThe basic idea is simple; everyone has a desire within their hearts, be it for themselves or another. What this series does is turn the whole concept of this idea and the magical girl genre on its head like you're watching a dark fairytale that you didn't even realise was actually a nightmare until it was too late to turn back.\nI fullly recommend this to anybody, because this is not your average run of the mill magical girl series, and it reveals that behind the cutesy-fluff of the genre there is a whole other side to it that no one ever wanted to believe existed. If watching this series doesn't make you shed a tear or get even vaguely watery eyes, then i don't know what will.\nA truely enchanting and heartbreaking series that everyone should watch.\n        "},

No question about it.\nHow to best talk about this one without making a too long review?...\nI'm pretty sure this is an epic piece. Going by what epic actually is.\nThe story is so incredibly great yet so simple.\nYou probably have already heard how this show seems cuddly at first but turns incredibly dark later. I knew that starting it up, and it didn't ruin anything... It's not a surprise you're being spoiled. I wanna say that even though you know the change in tone will come, it still happens so well and gradually creeps up, that the transition becomes smooth and\n          \n        yet sudden as a guillotine dropping the blade (pun intended).\nActually even when it hasn't really set off to become a dark atmosphere, there's a very creepy eerie tone. It's almost like with all the cutesy stuff going on there's always a ghost sitting on everyone's shoulder, staring them down with a malevolent smile. (Insert your \"Soon\" memes here.)\nWhat could seriously be a drawback, is all the cutesy stuff maybe seeming out of place, and possibly a bit over the top. But I guess it's possibly what creates the extreme contrast and personally it didn't bother me at all. \nThe plot along with the tones and atmosphere thoughout the show takes alot of turns, some more expected than others. Even when the explanation is on the table, there are questions and speculations the viewer can make still.\nThe atmosphere is really selling itself so well. It's backed up by some really interesting art design choices, with something that could almost look like fabric sewn onto the animation. It makes these creatures and setting look distinctively twisted, and there's never any doubt that it's something unfriendly. \nThis art design at times though, also fails and sometimes doesnt blend into the rest of the picture quite like it did in other scenes. I guess what I'm saying is that while it's really great, it doesn't stay consistent all the way.\nWhat does stay incredibly consistent though... and this will become unforgettable to anyone who's experienced it. Atleast definitely to anyone who enjoyed this anime immensely. (Just look above)\nAnd let it be written in bold letters!\nSound- 10/10 \"Outstanding\" ...\nYuki Kajiura made something really astonishing here. It's an absolutely amazing soundtrack, and probably my favorite soundtrack yet.\nTry and look up \"Credens Justiam\", \"Decretum\" or \"Symposium Magarum\" right now.\nThis soundtrack has the right set of emotions for every scene. Each track perfectly fitting, every time.\nIt has some of the most cheerful tones and the most tragic. There's a time for everything, as the saying goes... and the timing of the soundtrack is undeniably good.\nFollowing the soundtrack's example the lincensed songs are up to par.\nKalafina's \"Magia\" is just so iconic and grandiose. The song plays fairly early, in a scene that sets the show off to a great start, and which personally gave me shivers. The song becomes the ending credits theme for most of the episodes, while still playing in some scenes now and then. \n\"and I'm Home\" by Eri Kitamura and Ai Nonaka. This one comes into the show later and at the perfect time. I'd tell you not to look it up and first hear it in the show. It's a great song and really a favorite of mine.\nThe opening song \"Connect\" by Claris is a tricky one. Seems perfectly normal and mundane. While it's good, don't get me wrong, it just seems like a typical anime song. It seems really natural and fitting at first, but the further into the show you get, it just seems more and more unfitting. It's almost great how it becomes \"the odd man out\" you could say. The way that the song like a person oblivious to the change in tone in the show, just further cements the contrast that the changes have made. It's also a nice reminder that there were happier times before despair.\nAs for characters. Some characters seem to have less development than others. That's mostly supporting acts of course, but this good. Well no, not really... Let me explain.\nSome characters that fall off the wayside you genuinely start to miss. And others almost disappearing makes you grow distant to them in a way just like the main characters do. As the main characters spiral ever further into a constricting future, and things that they knew disappear. It feels real and relatable, because us, the viewer, actually experience the same feeling of growing distance to their lives and the characters. We feel their world becoming bleak, the same way as the main characters do.\nThis is either smart directing or really lucky coincidence. I can't tell.\nThe best character development probably lies with Kyoko and Sayaka. I won't get into too much detail on that, but they go through quite the change.\nThe others also have good character development, but those two stand out to me as the cherry on the cake.\nTalk about cherries... Many seem to think there's alot of lesbian undertones in the show, and I can honestly see where they get that from... \nWell. The problem isn't really that it might be lesbian, but more that it seems like it's there to cater to a certain yuri fetish crowd. It's most of the time harmless though and kinda funny. But there are a couple of moments where it just seems a little much. It's a shame that, those couple of times it is really immersion breaking. One of them is near the ending, which is rough, but thankfully doesn't ruin the ending.\nPersonally it didn't bother me much, but I can definitely see why it could be a serious problem to some.\nI overall really enjoyed this anime alot. I already feel nostalgic hearing tunes from the soundtrack. Offer me an apple, I'll remember Kyoko.\nI can understand one of the big otaku fanbases revolves around this anime, but I really couldn't give a damn. I'm not part of that fanbase, but I really did love this anime. If anything I can see why there would be a diehard fanbase for it, but I don't think it's healthy to go to extremes.\nThere is a real sense of magic to this anime (who'd have guessed. No, but really...), and also real sense of despair and hopelessness. I enjoy alot of gothic stuff, and this fits right in there.\nThe show captures the feeling of something otherworldly and epic really well, with and intricate plot and great atmosphere. You can question its aesthetic, but think this show relies much more on atmosphere and it has that in spades.\nNormally I need to think a bit about whether a show is a top favorite of mine. But like Hellsing Ultimate there was no doubt on this decision\nI can't guarrantee it's an anime for everyone, but don't discard it or underestimate it at first glance.\nI'd like to give it a perfect 10 out of 10. But keeping realistic and critical I have to keep it a 9. \nI definitely love and recommend this show to anyone though.\n        "},

Sacrificing other's lifes without any doubt, to achieve a goal, even if it is worth something?! Yes... and no. \"Evil\" is something that can only exist in the presence of \"Good\", you cant have one without the other. We define something as \"Evil\" because, in the counterpart as human beings, fueled by emotions, we have came to experience and understand the concept of \"Good\"! \n Thus without these emotions, neither of the two would exist. We cannot expect to understood a self that doesnt know what emotions are, we may try to, but fully comprehension\n          \n        will be impossible to achieve. So for this emotionless self, its actions maybe viewed purely by the logic behind those, so cataloging its evilness, is not correct, neither is it wrong, it is a relative opinion, based on our biological predisposition, the core of what means being human. \n We are what we are, we cant avoid it, it is how we work, not something that can be changed.\nThose who have already seen the anime, will understand what I m referring to. \nCharacters: 9\nThe story is what drives this anime, the reason why it is so different from other Mahou Shoujos! The easiest example, more for some than others, its unforeseen impact, from all those gruelsome events that the main cast has to surpass. \nAll characters in consideration, my 2 favorites are Akemi Homura and Kaname Madoka. \nWhile the major flaw of the anime, was being only 12 episodes long, thus the character development can only go so far... still it was very enjoyable to watch the relationship betweem both my favs flesh out. \nIt got me teary by the end, but a anime doesnt need to make your shed tears to be that great, so yeah it had various memorable moments.\nMiki Sayaka, Sakura Kyouko and Tomoe Mami, out of the 3, not getting into spoilers, each one had its showtime that I much enjoyed, no doubt, but they weren't as developed as the other 2. It is easy to see they weren't the main focus of the anime, but the support.\nSpecial mention for Kyuubey, which also added to the anime.\nEvery character felt realistic enough, their struggles and decisions felt extremely human to me! The \"villain\" was also a part of what made all this possible, some hate him, I dont. \nI just love it all.  \nIn all and all, I felt I could have enjoyed it a bit more, maybe because this is still a Mahou Shoujo, and while the characters are well built into the time-frame so short, it still has its limits. \n\"I could fancy with these girls still a bit more.\" \nBut a 9 is no doubt, a HIGH score, so while it may seem like a big flaw with all this focus, it really is not, it was simply overshadowed by the rest of what made the series so good for me.\nThis is a story about \"magical girls getting a reality check\", something one wouldn't think to see in the Mahou Shoujo genre, hence it is a descontruction of the genre. \nIt is not all that pretty, fancy, happy-go-lucky slice-of-life stuff, the story pushes the characters, that faced with danger and grief won't behave as perfect humans! They aren't flawless by any means. You wont be seeing the typical one-dimensional behavior. \nThese characters make mistakes, regret them, learn from it, but that doesnt lead to a \"everything is fine now, another barrier surpassed, lets go find more, and surpass it with the power of friendship!!\"\nIf you want, and expect the following to happen, while watching the anime, immediatly get rid of those illusions of yours.\n\nStory: 10\nThe story is a major point of interest, when one watches a story, \"the story is the river, and the characters are its streamflow\". \nEverything starts like anyother typical Mahou Shoujo, the girls meet the contracter, help him out of trouble, in return the contracter proposes them to became magical girls and other magical girls show up, etc, etc... but if you look well, ever since the first episode, from the first minute, its darkness is there! \nIt is, lying underneath of the Mahou Shoujo's troupes, you just have to look for it, between the lines. \nFrom the very first dream sequence, the music, the art, the atmosphere, look closer, those imply to something more! \nBreaking from the molds that defined the genre for so long, indeed not your cliche sunny scripted story, where the episode finishes with the classic, girls defeating the villains, and going all happy to their homes, living and preparing themselves for the next day of \"the rich new cheerful adventures, that awaits them\".\nTables will be fliped at a certain moment, sooner in the anime, be prepared for it, there were hints to something more darker. \nAnd let me say I had the opportunity to read/watch worst psychological/horror scenarios, than those at this point. I was prepared. \nI knew it would came to this, at a certain point in the story... but it still had that effect of \"ohh shit!!, stuff is getting real now\", from there on, it gets darker and darker, as plot twists are revealed, horrendous events unfold, as the harsh bitter truth strucks into their minds, human principles are bent and the characters reach breakdown point, going even further beyond, the perfect day-to-day reality crumbles and shatters to dust.  \nAnd thus the fate of being a Magical Girl is revealed! \nIs there any hope, a glimpse of light in the future reserved for them? \nCan the cycle of despair and loliness of a Mahou Shoujo be ended??\nEither way you wont be disappointed, Gen Urobochi the writter (which also wrote Fate/Zero), from a dying genre, he created in 12 episodes a fantastic and clever story! There is no short income of surprises adn twists, in a bold approuch, a fresh breath of genious, better than whatever you could expect in this genre nowadays.\nA well crafted plot, far more original, surprising and creative, AND at least as twisted when comparing to its other works.\nThe ruthless destiny awaits.\nI love how sick the story turned to be, whenever some twisted event took place I was begging for MOAR! More suffer, more great, unpreddictable, writting.\nI was glady fulfilled by the end. \nAnimation & Sound: 10\nThe characters designs while being good, were nothing sort of breathtaking, and the facial design being widder, was a bit weird at the beggining, but easily I adapted to it. \nNothing special so far, so why another 10, you may wonder.\nLets start by the dreams sequences, where most of the action happens. \nThese are that unique and visually different from the common stuff you find on anime. \nEach dream sequence is different, from how the enemies and scenario were drew and the angles used, to the colour palette used, ranging from the brighest colours to the darkest ones, now fused with awesome music like \"Gradus prohibitus\", giving that feel of entering into a dream-like stage,  you are like being draw to the dream, to the atmosphere, in a trance-like-behavior, just like the characters, you just fall deeper, \"following the dangerous light\" that could mark your premature end. \"Credens justitiam\" for some stylish transformations, and others like my 2 favs, \"Sis puella magica!\" or \"Magia\"(the ED true song), for the action scenes that will surprise you in the fluid and creative epicness, it is a blast! \nThe dreams sequences ARE a psychedelic experience, I was deeply immersed myself in every second of it.\nThe action also happens outside these dream sequences, and it just as epic and flashy, while the scenarios are more mundane. \nAnimation, Shaft, I love you even more now!  \nI mentioned the awesome soundtrack...this was the aspect of the anime where I was mostly pleasent surprised with, when I started to watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\nI was already expecting the OP, that didnt told me much at first place.  \nI got more meaning from it, by the end of the series (one moment the dark side of Madoka, the destiny, then it follows up with this happy OP song, the contrast was great), thought the first ED reeks, and that won't change. Couldn't care less...\nWhen you first face reality, it all ends with a bang followed by the true ED theme, Magia by Kalafina, and I have seen hers others workers, song-wise only, I prefer her's Sprinter more, but how Shaft fused the song with the ED visuals, it became one of the most memorable ED's for me, first on my top! \nIt symbolized the reveal in full splendor, of Puella's true nature, the first I seen it... one of the best moments in the anime! \nI was expecting the true ED to be more gore-like, less abstracted, when I heard people talk about it. But it wouldnt be as perfect as it is. It pumped my soul, and it still does, everytime I re-watch a episode. \nFurther into the void, the unknowed, your life flame burning way, ever more unstable, with each step the determination growns only stronger, which only leads to its self-destruction.\n\"The light of love you lit in your eyes one day... transcends time, \n and surely destroy one dream... of this world and hurries to its ruin.\n  Swallow down your hesitation.\n   What is it that you wish for?\n    On the path of yearning as greedy as this, \n    will there be a good future?\n     Like ancient magic... that I dreamed of when I was young,\n     with the power to slash the darkness,  \n     I want to meet the smiling you.\n      In these frightened hands of mine,\n      I have the courage of hand-picked flowers.\n      My feelings alone are all that I rely upon,\n      a wish that awaken... the light.\"\n\nI mentioned I expect more gore before... \nRemenbering myself, when I first came in contact with the anime, and people's thoughts about it, I did expect GORE, lots of blood, violence here, girls screaming and dying there, even more than before, when I realised something like Neon Genesis Evangelion was in the reccomendation box! \nDunno, I thought there would be some fanservice to people that like gory scenes... I was glady wrong, it seems I forgot this was Shaft! The way they do it, is less visually agressive, but still that impressive, with all those colors, and stuff I dont want to spoil for you folks. \nNothing could had fit the nature of Mahou Shoujo Madoka more, than how the fulfilled here! \nAnd after reaching the end of this journey, I came to realise, only Shaft could do something like this. \nNot really downgrading other studios (they have they strong points too), just the way Shaft has come to animate stuff, it is tricky to explain, but once you see a Shaft animation, you will understand its style, the abstract way to transmite information about the atmosphere and the characters, it is a charm exclusive to Shaft, its trademark.\nI have seen better character animations, in terms of fluidity, details and expressiveness, mostly in movies!! That have lots of budget to do so.\nThis anime probably didnt had that much budget, but with what it had, it was wisely implemented, because nothing felt awkward for me, the action even surprised me positively, along with the different take on Visuals (Shaft TM), the decisions of how to do stuff, everything felt in, improving further the immersion with one of the best OST's for an anime, EVER. Perfect.\nEnjoyment:\nMy first experience with the anime:\n\"First 2 episodes completed, ok anime, good OST and animation, this is different from everyother Mahou Shoujo, but I cannot quite get it yet... (progressing further) DAMM, the story is really becoming quite something!\"\nAfter watching the anime for the first time, I was confused, yes I did enjoyed it alot, and had already came to a conclusion with what I said above.\n\"Interesting till the end, shocking the viewers for the most part!\"\nBUT for the enjoyment segment, something was missing, I had to rewatch the anime, to fully grasp my thoughts about it, to clear my mind, put it into words 100 % correct , no exageration or mistake, and here it goes.\nColder reality, sweet despair, was never as sweet, sweeter than all those moe cliche mahou shoujos. Am I evil for enjoying it that much?? \nI enjoyed the characters and did at some point wanted them to be happy... \nSo why?\nWhy did I enjoyed the despair the story is built into so much, and so readily accepted such fate??\nSimple. I loved the concept that much! \nIt still falls onto the Mahou Shoujo genre, but the way it picks on the genre troupes and twists them till you scream, the way it fuses the great animation with godly soundtrack, the twists, the great \"villain\", the atmosphere!\nI can't recall the last time I watched a Mahou Shoujo anime, and that is because with the exception of the classics of my childhood days, most of them seem pretty boring, plain, predictable, not as complex, charming and interesting nowadays, when compared with those I remenbered from my childhood. \nWith the grown of the mind, I desired for something more convoluted.\nIn the Magical Girl genre, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is the answer to my \"Coming of Age\" ideology I have come to adquire in my last 6 years.\nThe ray of light, that shines on the genre, and enlights the vast amount of potential yet to be explored, the deconstruction & reinventation of the Mahou Shoujo genre, saved the genre itself from stagnation!\nFor such a short anime, great characters, and though it could only go so far in those twelve, the whole originality that the anime breaths of, clicked all the right notes, struck what I wanted for the genre, something that I had not came to release until I came in contact with the anime.\nFrom the slow start, to the finishing line, I deeply enjoyed Madoka and Homura life's story. \nI deeply enjoyed the ending, and I'm really eager to see the movies, and at the end, the third movie, the sequel.\nEnjoyemnt score :10\n\nIt is not every come of tea, I can see some type of people not enjoying it as much, either because of its unique style, or the way it approuchs and twists the troupes of the genre itself.\nIn the end, considering everything I said, while I dont consider the anime, the best anime ever, it is at the top tier of anime.\nSomething I would reccomend everyone to give a try and watch, even you if you will come to hate it, it is that different of the norm, that I think it is worth it to do so. \nSadly doing something like this to a genre like that, is not something I expect to see again, it really requires great writing to be achieved...\nEvery Mahou Shoujo anime contains LOTS of gem and \"shinning stuff happening\", this is the genre's darkest one, and still, shines brighter than all the other ones lumped together!\nOverall: 9,7 = 10  \n\n    --Don't forget.\n      Always, somewhere,\n    someone is fighting for you.\n   --As long as you remenber her,\n                            you are not alone."},

I marathon'ed the whole thing in two days, Easter Weekend, and I was enthralled.\nI don't watch much of any Magical Girl anime, but I know enough to know this is a very, very dark take on a lot of the genre's conventions.  The 'good guys' are far from protected by main character armor; don't be surprised to see apparently\n          \n        major characters start dying, and brutally fast.  And when the magical girls fight the 'witches', the evil protagonists they make deals with the creepy-ass 'QB' to battle, the animation turns into a bad acid trip.

I love the character designs, especially Mami-san, the old Magical Girl with the oversized breasts, drill hair, perpetual dopey smile and a huge arsenal of flintlock-style guns.  \nAlso, for once, a Magical Girl anime that uses absolutely no stock footage!

Your mind will be blown and you won't regret it at all.\nStory: The anime starts off a bit slow, admittedly. It's just getting across the point that Madoka and her friends live a normal life. But after meeting Mami and learning about Magical Girls, things become dark and tragic. At first glance, this seems like a cutsey anime. But it's not. In fact, this anime has one of the most haunting yet beautifully tragic stories ever.\nArt: The art is very cutsey. However, one very interesting thing the anime has done is the\n          \n        art they use for witches. It's something I've never seen in anime before. Basically, it isn't drawn--it's some sort of real-looking animation that's totally confusing and creepy and gives off the exact essence it's aiming for. It really adds to the anime in that sense, but if you don't understand why, then it's just awkward.\nSound: One of the most beautiful OSTs you will ever hear is Madoka's. The songs alone really tell the story and the tragedy of the anime. I pity anyone who has not heard this beautiful music. Also, \"Connect\" by ClariS is a great opening theme. However, \"Magia\" by Kalafina is kind of painful to listen to. All of the character's voices fit them nicely.\nCharacter: Every character is unique. Every character has their own story, their own motives and principles, and that's what makes Madoka a great series. When the character's pasts are revealed, your mind will be blown and you'll never be able to look at life the same way again. The characters are truly well-developed.\nOverall: This series gets a 9/10 on \"A Review For xx's\" scale.

Before, there was Princess Tutu, and before that was Revolutionary Girl Utena. But I think Madoka Magica can overtake them both in a mere 12 episodes, showing just how painful the life of a magical girl can be. The series could change the Magical Girl genre as a whole.\nStudio SHAFT's first original work has proved to be nothing short of a masterpiece and I regret not watching it sooner. Yes, the art has occasionally slipped into \"Meduca Meguca\" style at times, but for the most part it's not noticeable and doesn't take away from the\n          \n        experience.

Basically, if this contract is made, the girls get their wish fulfilled, and become magical girls for life.]\nIf you have an obsession with the “magical girl” genre, but want something new and different, I highly recommend this anime. \nPros: \n1)	This magical-girl show is filled with tragedy and uniqueness.  It’s not just about girls who are fighting crime, and bringing justice. There is a high amount of depth in this show. It goes away from the rainbows\n          \n        and butterflies of magic. \n2)	It’s a combination of various genres. It has a bit of sci-fi, action, drama, magic, etc.\n3)	Though this show only has female main characters, both genders will enjoy it.\n4)	For a 12 episode series, it answers a lot of questions we are thinking through out the show about the contract, Kyuubey, and the wishes.\n5)	The ending is bittersweet. The writers did an excellent job of concluding the show even thought it is predictable and pretty unoriginal.\n6)	The relationship that the main character has with the mom is something that should be done in more anime. We get to hear the wisdom and helpful advice from mother to daughter, and we are able to see why the character is the way she is. I just wish that they showed the other girls parents (where the heck were they?)\n7)	I have yet to do this, but rewatching the show will not kill the enjoyment. The first episode will actually make more sense after you finish the series.\n8)	I did not really focus on the songs when I was watching the anime, but it has been mentioned that even the songs (especially opening theme) starts to make sense when the show is in its final episodes.  It sounds bright and cheerful, but is it really?\n9)	The artwork was intriguing. The “other realm”, the background, the fighting sequences was done brilliantly. You might not understand it in the beginning, but like everything else in this anime, the pieces of the puzzle seems to come together by the end of the series (might be a turnoff for some).\n10)	There was character development. You learn more about the characters that you actually want to know more about.\nCons:\n1)	I absolutely did not like how the characters were drawn. The eyes, hair, and the facial structures were not my cup of tea. 	\n2)	Although the characters had development, the characters role in the story was obvious. They were very irritating in the beginning, because they were the typical archetypes of any anime. \n3)	Even though the first episode might have hooked many people to continue the show, for others (like me), it’s only when we’re half way through the anime (approx. episode 5-6) that we start to fully enjoy it.  \n4)	Though I said this anime does not follow the cliché’s of the magical theme shows, there are a lot of unoriginal content; I cannot really mention them because it contains spoilers. Some people might not be emotionally invested in this anime because of it. I think the thing that saved this anime was the fact that it did well in its presentation/execution of the storyline. It made up for those unoriginal moments.\nThings you may want to know before you watch this show:\n1)	There is blood and violence.\n2)	There is little to zero romance.\n3)	There is nudity by the end of the series (nothing too explicit or detailed). Actually, it's really nothing.\n4)	It does emphasize on friendship. \n5)	The storyline is not shallow; it’s not just about happy people.\nI have not seen many anime of this genre (I didn’t even bother watching Sailor Moon when I was little), so I could not completely appreciate the originality of this show. Though I enjoyed it, I believe many others who are familiar with the magical theme will applaud it. I would recommend some people to watch it! \n…12 episodes wouldn't hurt anyone, right?\n"},

Especially amazing was the art direction regarding the Witches and their Labyrinths, and the way it contrasted so much with the rest of the world.\nSound - 10 - The sound kept to a high standard throughout the show - the OP is probably one of my favorite songs from an anime right now. The music played is appropriate for the scene it's shown in, and it always sounds absolutely amazing.\nCharacter - 10 - The characters all had believable backstories, realistic reasons for becoming a Puella Magi, and solid personalities at the time of the show. The character development was executed well, especially in the case of Sayaka and Homura. On the surface, they didn't seem like very relatable characters - how do you relate to a character in this sort of scenario? - but, as we uncover more of the characters' lives and backgrounds, they become more and more easily relatable to the viewer.\nOverall - 10 - What can I say? This anime was beautiful in every aspect. Can't wait for the movie!\n        "},

At first glance it seems like a shallow magical girl straight-to-DVD sort of thing. Even slice of life, at first. While such a thing has it's own merits, it doesn't sound very thrilling on the surface. But Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (hereafter MSMM) isn't famous for what's on the surface. The series will pick you up in the first episode and you won't be able to stop until the final.\nStory: 10/10\nInitially, things seem sort of vague and rushed. You're rather abruptly introduced to some of the fundamental plot elements, which would normally prevent this series from getting\n          \n        a 10/10 in this category, at least from me. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that it only gets better. I loved everything about this story, and I'd be willing to bet that you will, too.\nArt: 8/10\nThe animators for this series were boldly creative in their representation of the normal world, the warped, lethally bizarre labyrinths that witches inhabit, and the characters. There's a sort of endearing moe motif in the girls, which draws the watcher into caring for them. However, where this series really shines is in the scenery. The represented Japan is futuristic and sterile, in sharp contrast to the maddening, colorful worlds in which the magical girls combat their enemies. The art shift can be jarring, but I think that it's for the best.\nSound: 6/10\nMSMM isn't exactly a star example of stunning audio in anime, but this isn't a deal breaker considering the stunning quality of nearly every other aspect of the show. Overall, the OST and dub are average, neither adding to or diminishing the effect of the series.\nCharacter: 10/10\nThis is another area in which MSMM shatters expectations. The majority of magical girl genre characters are, well, just little girls with magic powers. There's not much to them. MSMM takes the trope of the cheery, ever-capable magical girl and smashes it to bits. The characters are complex and their motivations make sense, after a bit of exposition. Again, it's not easy to elaborate on what exactly makes MSMM stand out in the character department without spoiling some major plot points, so unfortunately I can't flesh this category out much more.\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10 - 9/10\nMSMM is, surprisingly, one of my top 20 favorite anime, after having watched it. This series is filled to the brim with almost all of my favorite situations and subject matter. As expected of Gen Urobuchi, you're in for it in the emotional department if you decide to watch this show. To anyone looking for feels and stunning characters, this is a show for you.\n        "},

Amazing characters, amazing story, and its genuinely tragic and sad. The animation and art design is beautiful arranging from a nice vibrant area to crazy fast paced area to a deep and physiological, complex exploration of the witches labyrinth. The sound was great in the Japanese version... the English on the other hand is fine the jap. version is just better.

So here are the few problems I had with this anime and I will say this before hand they are very small problems that most people would not find distracting in any way and it took me quite a bit of re-viewings to find them now there might be more that I missed even after 5 re-viewings, but that just shows  how small and insignificant these problems  are to your overall enjoyment. 1) The TV version had a few stretches and mishaps in the animation department mostly dealing with the lighting it was a bit to dark to see things BUT they fixed this on the Blu-Ray and DVD version. 2) I cannot spoil the ending I don't even like telling people what this is even about I just want them to go in dry, but at the end of the series there is just a small bit of too much talking to explain a certain plot point.. but its payoff is brilliance. 3) I don't find this a problem as much as others might this is a very complex anime, and some might not be able to understand it but does a good job at explaining what goes on.   \n\nSO overall  Story (10\10).

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    \"The Magic of Madoka Magica\"\nWhen people say that Madoka Magica is a masterpiece, I find it hard to disagree! Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an anime released back in 2011 that was quickly touted as a masterpiece for its intelligent storytelling and creative subversion of tropes associated with the magical girl genre of anime. But to throw this in with the rest of the magical girl fodder is completely unfair to itself and the creators of this great anime. \nWhy is that? Because Madoka Magica is a hard deconstruction and reconstruction of the magical girl genre. It starts off slow and boring, but after about\n          \n        the 3rd or 4th episode, Madoka Magica stops fucking around and gets down to business. It has no problem killing off characters unexpectedly, dropping emotional anvils on the viewer's unsuspecting minds, and turning characters that appear cute and cuddly into vile, despicable, monsters. I don't really agree with that last one, but I'll get to that character later. Madoka Magica does everything in its power to subvert the audience's expectations and it an immense challenge on the viewer to keep up. That's one of things I admire greatly about it. It challenges the viewer to make sense of it all and if you can't, you'll be left in its dust.\nLet's brush over the story real quick. As stated, Madoka Magica deconstructs and reconstructs the magical girl genre in absolute flawless fashion. It flows seamlessly, has no plotholes I could find that weren't addressed later or in one of the movies, and can carry a certain emotional weight to it depending on who the viewer is. But what is a deconstruction or a reconstruction? Well, a deconstruction means that a piece of literature deliberately takes many of the tropes and clichés of a specific genre, and goes in a completely different, more realistic (usually) manner than is usually par for the course. Not only is this incredibly difficult to do without breaking flow and natural storytelling, but it also takes immense knowledge of the genre and a lot of focus to pull off correctly. Somehow, Madoka Magica does it flawlessly. It rips the magical girl genre down to its bare bones and creates something far more dark and interesting than your Sailor Moon or what not. \nFor the happy, girly, everyone wins tone of the average magical girl anime, Madoka Madica embodies themes of sadess, betrayal, decay, the cruel hand of fate, the sad reality of ulterior motives, and even heavy religious commentary, among others. Needless to say, Madoka Magica is immensely deeper and more intelligent than what you would expect from something that would take on this genre. But just when you think it's going to end in a grimdark, bleak, dry heave, Madoka Magica pulls another trick out of its metaphorical sleeve and reconstructs the entire genre again seamlessly. \nI won't waste time explaining what a reconstruction is, but it's basically the opposite of a deconstruction. You're re-creating what the usual ending would be for a genre despite breaking the tropes down into something completely different to create the story. Basically, it's like taking a door, breaking it, and then putting it back together. \nNormally when a piece of literature does this, the door isn't quite as functional or aesthetically pleasing as it was before you ripped it down, but again Madoka does it in stride and pulls off an ending that is nothing short of mindfuck. It's incredible. But I could go on for hours about the story, so let's just go over the other elements, shall we?\nAs for the art, it's mostly good. The visuals for the witch realms are incredibly organic and creative, as well as dark and a solid match for the tone. The only complaint I have is the models of the main characters. They're a bit block-headed and they tend to have the same proportions aside from their hair. It's a bit off-putting, at least to me. \nThe music is pretty good, too. It's emotional and atmospheric, but never in a manner that distracts the viewer. It's mostly meant to accompany the narrative, rather than be something you would want to listen to casually. There's nothing wrong with that, so I have no problem with it. All I can really say negative about it as that I find most of the music blends together and feels hard to differentiate. That's more of a personal gripe, though. All in all, sound design and music is very good.\nAs for the characters, they're far deeper than I would have imagined and more interesting, too. They're surprisingly complex and not one of them feels like a bad stereotypes that doesn't belong. To put them plainly; Mami is motherly and welcoming, Sayaka is caring but a bit jealous at times, Madoka is frail but very kind, Homura is initially distant and emotionless but ends up being easily the deepest character present, and Kyoko is fiery and feels more like the grey area moral character. They're all unique and ineresting, which significantly helps differentiate them (which is needed due to the samey art style they're drawn in). \nThere are 2 main gripes I have with the characters. The first is with Homura. Homura's character arc is, to put it bluntly, absurd. I can't really get into it in detail without spoiling her genius character development and the emotional way it unfolds, but I'll put it as vaguely as I can. At one point, it's clear what causes Homura to be the way she is at the beginning of the show, and I found it completely absurd. She did a complete 180 in her personality and I found it incredibly hard to believe, even if her motivations for doing so were clear. Not a huge deal, but it still bugged me. The second gripe is Kyubey. Seeing as how I make a big deal about good vs. evil being childish drek, it should be no surprise that I disagree with the notion that Kyubey is evil (this is what I was referring to earlier). As odd as this may sound, I don't find his actions to be particularly malicious. In typical genius fashion by the writers, Kyubey isn't quite on the same page as humans (as any alien creature probably would that tried to interact with them). But people seem to think that just because Kyubey left several details out that would seem manipulative if left out, that automatically makes him a hell spawn. I don't necessarily think that is the case. It seems clear that Kyubey doesn't really have a clear sense of morality like humans do. To blame him for not really understanding that he should have told them everything up front is understandable, but ultimately childish. Whether or not he was being malicious is up to debate, but personally I think it makes sense as to why he didn't. From a cold advantage standpoint, he did everything that would make sense and revealed everything in a manner that would serve his purposes the best. It makes perfect sense. [Mild Spoiler here] His motivations are also pretty clear too. He wants to prevent the universe from certain doom in the form of heat death, if I interpreted it correctly. I think that pretty well justifies a few instances of careful manipulation. [/spoiler] Overall though, great work with the characters.\nMadoka Magica is and will continue to be a unqiue and intelligent take on something not usually associated with the themes it tackles. It sticks out, but not in a manner that could be considered negative. It's refreshing to see something so smart come out of a genre I usually refer to as \" boring gobbledygook\", and I also recommend you check out the movies if you're interested. From what I gather, the first 2 are small summaries of the anime, while the 3rd is a completely new story with 1 new character. I've only seen the 3rd one, but I've heard from some they consider the movies to be better than the actual anime. Either way, I strongly recommended you check out Madoka Magica. Just stay away from cute things with contracts.\nMadoka Magica earns a 9/10.\n        "},

After beating it around the bush for years, I finally buckled in and watched it.\nPMMM is one of those shows where it looks cute on the surface level, but as soon as you start getting into it, you realize the cuteness is just a facade for something of a completely different level that reshapes the entire Magical Girl part of shoujo manga/anime.\nStory: 8/10\nPMMM follows the life of Madoka, a pink haired girl who has the ideal life for herself. She has\n          \n        a family that loves her, and some friends that mean the world to her. Then, the typical \"new student in class changes the life of the protagonist\" cliche hits, and it's all \"fun\" and \"games\" from there.\nThe story itself is fairly well put together for the amount of episodes to the show.\nForget about the typical tropes that are common in the Magical Girl genre, for while this show has the traditional transformation sequences and themed attacks, there's not necessarily a \"good-guys-always-win\" mentality to this show. It may be what's popular with most Magical Girl shows, due to the fact that most are designed with younger audiences in mind, but this one is not. I would not recommend showing this to younger children.\nArt: 6/10\nPersonally, I was not a fan of the art style. This show was made with a certain style in mind, but some scenes are downright cringe-worthy to look at, due to the fact that bobble-heads tend to appear and their faces aren't always proportionate. The colors were bright and fun and beautiful, and there were some scenes where the animation was just gorgeous, but there were a handful that were not, and thus it got a lower score in my book.\nSound: 8/10\nI am always a sucker for the orchestration behind things in the media. It's often what makes or breaks it for me. Madoka Magica had a very nice soundtrack, with plenty of music to fill where music should be. There were different themes and styles that all meshed and helped shave off the cute surface level that so many outsiders see it as.\nCharacter: 6/10\nSome of the characters had very nice backstories built to them, even as supporting characters, but others do not. The Protagonist Madoka fell rather flat for me, as she was a rather cowardly, wimpy character that spent a good portion of the show crying about her situation. Granted, with everything that happens to these characters, I don't blame her, but she doesn't get that much character development. This may be because of minimal time to build her character, but the supporting characters have more development than she does.\nOverall, it's a great anime. It all comes together fairly well, and if you want a short anime that's not as it seems, I say go for this one. It won't let you down. Just be ready, for if you're of a softer heart, you may need to keep tissues nearby. This one had me nearly in tears.\n        "},

Sounds good right? yes, indeed, but with every wish there is a price to be paid. I have to sacrifice something in return. This is the theme of Madoka Magica and how everything is simply not given to you just becouse you want it. You have to pay up.\nMadoka Kaname lives a happy life, she has a mom working for a company,her dad takes care of the family, her brother greets her every\n          \n        morning with a happy smile and she has nice friend waiting for her when walking to the school. She lives a life a lot of people would wish for, during the same day at school, a new transfer student named Homura Akemi enters her class. She is the \"popular type\" of student, admired and respected but Madoka seems to recognize her for some reason due to a dream she had last night. Madoka Kaname does not realize that very soon, her life as she knows it will come into question, she will experience the stuff she is foriegn to and will change her. This is here that i will stop wth the plot elements becouse the best way to experience this show is that you dont know anything about it.\nDeconstruction of an genre:\nMadoka Magica takes the magical girl genre and changes it, previously you had an girl, a animal of sorts shows up, gives the girl some magical power and bam, she is fighting the enemy. Madoka changes that, not only does the main heroine get those powers but as i stated before, there is allways a price for that. The show treats this in a very mature way, it establishes the characters and their motives and gives the reason why the girls is so called \"the magical girls\". That means that every character has a reason to why they want to become one, the plot tells us those stories that are simply belivable and touching at the same time, i cant talk about it but when you are watching you will see for yourself.\nThe shows antagonists is in the form of \"the witches\", instead of being evil for the sake of plot, they are established very well too, what are they, what do they want, why are they doing the things that they do?. This is also well explained.\nNow just becouse it is a deconstruction of a genre does not mean that the show is good just becouse it changes things around, it is good becouse it does a very good job of making all those elements work and makes it a far more mature experience than you would belive by simply watching the front cover of this show. Simply put, this show has to be experienced in order to see why it does an amazing job.\nSound and animation:\nAs soon as Madoka starts playing, you will see that studio Shaft put some good effort into the design and special attention to art and backgrounds. This brings the feeling that we are in for a super treat here and it brings the feeling that the writers wanted. Combining Shafts designs with the writing of Gen Urobuchi and you know you are in for a treat.\nThe soundtrack is produced by non other than Yuki Kajiura and i have to say, some of the tracks are pure gold here, the haunting sounds combined with her usual style is simply amazing. It brings so much to this show that the words cant describe it. This is perhaps her best work since her glorious days of Kara No Kyoukai soundtrack, which tells you something.\nConclusion:\nAs you perhaps can see by now, i dont talk about the characters that much, i just mentioned them by simply taking about the show. This is becouse the show is only 12 episodes long and talking about all of them is simply going to ruin your experience, this is a review after all and not an analysis article, the less you know, the better. Madoka Magica does so many things right and it will shock you with suprises it has in store for you. It treats you with respect and does not allways hold your hand, you have to pay attention to what is going on and how it all wraps up to what i consider to be one of the best told and planned out story for such an short anime like this one.\nMadoka Magica to me is an anime sent from heaven,the ost, animation, art design, writing and characters are simply amazing and Madoka Kaname is a very good protagonist, you will understand why once you are done with this show. There are flaws as well too but they are outwaged by how much good that is in this show so i could not care less about them. This show aired back in 2011 and still today i have to find a anime that touches my heart as this show has, it makes you think twice.\nThis show restored my faith in anime, it shows that anime can be a very powerful medium when comparing it to the movies and such, it fact, this show does more serious work on script writing than Hollywood can ever dream of doing.\nMadoka Magica is simply a masterpiece and a show that i will allways care for and love with all respect.\n\n"},

From all that I heard about it I was genuinely expecting something along the lines of \"cute, cute, cute, BAM violent twist\", which would have been stupid.\nThis series instead establishes pretty much from the start that nothing good can come from having one's wish granted by magic, and rolls with it in a downward spiral of bad choices and even worse consequences.\nNow, that taken into account, I do think the first episode is quite bad, as it establishes a \"suppa-kavvaii\" atmosphere that really, will never come into play again nor work with the subversion of the\n          \n        genre. Sure, it's introducing us to the characters before the bad things start to happen... but actually it is not, as the personalities we are presented with in the first episode seem to not have much relation with how the characters are shown in later episodes (where they are naive but also very thoughtful and relatively mature)\nThe story is, as mentioned, a nice subversion of the magical girl genre, equiparing the \"magic will solve all your problem\" trope with faustians deals. Which, yeah, is a very interesting way to go about it, especially when delivered through characters who speak in flat theatrical monotone sentences while fighting dada-inspired monster which seems to have jumped straight off some Grant Morrison comic. Sadly though after some episodes of cool mystery answers have to be given (well, no they don't, but the author obviously wanted to give them to us) and that ends up soiling a bit the mystique of the whole affair.\nDon't get me wrong, some reveals are actually very good, like the actual identity of the transferred student, but I would have honestly preferred that things like the identity of Kyube or the reason for Madoka's \"potential\" would have been left ambiguous and implied through visuals. In general I do feel that this series does do WAY too much overexplaining, ruining again, a bit of the fantastic mood it manages to set through visuals.\nOverall it's quite a good series, although I feel that it could have been so much better if it didn't tried to have a \"pop\" appeal.\n        "},

Here, she meets Kyubey, who claims that can offer the power to help that mysterious girl. Next morning, a new girl, named Homura Akemi, joins her class. This girl looks exactly\n          \n        like the one Madoka saw on her dream and things get even weirder when Homura speaks to Madoka in private and asks her if she values her family and friends. \nWhile this seems like a cheerful anime at the beginning, it rapidly becomes very dark and deep, with a lot of sad moments.  For such a short story, that has only 12 episodes, the plot changes extremely fast, going from a kawaii fairy tale to a gloomy and psychological drama. It sure is fun to watch how the story gets darker and darker, but it could have been more developed has they don’t show us what are the Incubators exactly and what is their story, for example.\nCharacters: 9/10\nWhen the anime starts, you see your ordinary little girl with a good family and friends that are just like her. But, has the show the starts to evolve, so do the characters. They start to seem different and show us that they are much more than pretty faces. It is certain that one of the things that makes this show so good was the way the characters were so different form each other, having such distinct personalities.\n{MADOKA}\nAs said several times before, Madoka is the usual kawaii girl that, just like any other girl, wishes to have magical powers. However, thanks to the efforts of Homura, she only becomes a Magical Girl in the end of the show, when it is truly needed. Until there, she lives without knowing what to do as she is pushed by Kyubey to form a contract with her and allway neglecting it. In the beginning of the anime, she seems very childish, without any strong determination whatsoever. But as her friends get killed through all the show and she has to endure all the pain and suffering, she grows up to be a very mature woman who makes the right decision at the end.\n{HOMURA}\nIn the beginning, Homura seems to be just the new classmate of Madoka but as soon as we discover that she is a Magical Girl everything changes. We even get kind of lured to think she is the villain of the show due to her dark personality. The fact that she keeps Madoka from being a Magical Girl and doesn’t stop trying to kill Kyubey leads to a completely misunderstood and lonely character. Only when her past is revealed, we discover her sad fate that is to protect Madoka, no matter what.\nArt and Animation: 10/10\nThe artwork of Madoka Magica is one of the most original I have ever seen.  As the show changes, the art and animation also change, adding more dark tones to the show. All of the animation is awesome, especially during the fights with the witches and when they are in the mazes. The way they drew the characters is also very good and extremely different from other anime. The best moment of the anime, in terms of animation, is when Sayaka loses her head while fighting a witch, refusing to feel any pain.\nSound: 8/10\nThe music of Madoka Magica is very good and it definitely has one of the best endings in the world of anime (Magia). The opening is also very good, despite of being a misleading.  However, the rest of the soundtrack is not that awesome and it lacks a bit of originality.\nOverall: 8.5/10\nMadoka Magica is awesome show. It sure has its flaws, just like any other anime but the fact that it fooled the viewers in such an original way makes it up for the show. The anime allways keeps a good pace and the way the characters change is also very nice. I truly enjoyed this anime and I even shed some tears on the last episodes. Nonetheless, it could have been a better show, mostly because of the small number of episodes."},

Wait, woi is death right there? So, have ye ever wondered, what if the magical girl gene had a plot twist and became dark? Well, you have come to the right place! WELCOME, TO THE COLOURFUL LAND OF MADOKA MAGICA!!!!! Lets get started:\nSo the story is about a girl named Madoka Kaname, who one day along with Her friend Saiaka Miki, discovers a cat rabbit thing named Kyubey who can grant people magical girls and a wish. Well, they save it. They have to decide whether or not they\n          \n        will become magical girls until......oh well...........im not spoiling anything so yeah\nThe art is fantastic. Its from studio shaft, who often uses several different art styles in one show. The character design is pretty simple, but that makes for some very fluid movements. Well done, shaft. Well done. The animation and art alike hold up today, 5 years later.\nThe soundtrack is very amazing, one of the most memorable in any anime imo. I don't usually play attention to background music, but this was an exception. The OP is gr8, and the reason why ClariS is one of my favorite artists. The ED is gr8 too, one of the best. The English dub is very good and fitting. The only issue is that homuras voice wasn't always fitting but besides that, it was funimation level.\nThe characters were mostly gr8. Every character is well developed except for Madoka. She could have been a bit more interesting and wasn't very developed. I rlly hated the green haired girl, she got annoying the second I saw her. Also HOMURA IS BEESSSTTT GIIIIRRRRLLLLLL!!!!!!!!\nI loved every second of Madoka Magica. From Episode 1 to the very end, it was a blast. Its one of the few anime I consider perfect. Well nearly perfect, if it weren't for the lack of screen time for certain characters.\nHere are the categories and scores for verdict and junk:\nPlot: 10\nArt:10\nAnimation: 10\nCharacters: 9\nSoundtrack: 10\nVoice Acting (ENG): 9.5\nEnjoyment: 10\nOverall: 9.93\nMy Score: 10\nAn Absolute Must Watch!!!!\n        "},

So, the art is original too. Anyway, the art is according for a \"Magical girls\" show, and in this case, the art contrast perfectly with the plot. In my opinion, that art was a really good trick from Shaft Studios..\nAnimation: [10/10] I only have to say; if you pay attention you would can see the budget flowing frame by frame (remember it's a 2011's show)... \nSound: [9/10] The OST is pretty good... I though it could have a bigger OST, more songs maybe. But the show have a really good OST instead.\nCharacter: [10/10] The show develop every main character correctly, and the support characters have firm personalities as well, so, in my opinion that was enough for a perfect score.\nStory: [10/10] For a original, short season show (only 12 episodes), it's have a pretty good developed background history, also, give us enough data to understand the history and plot by oneself...\nEnjoyment: [9/10] I gave it that score because I though the show was unnecessary slow sometimes. The show's mystery made me pay attention all the time, but I felt a bit bored sometimes.\nOverall: [10/10] Anyway it's a pretty good Show, from a pretty good Studio, with a pretty good Director and with a pretty good Budget. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    [MAJOR SPOILERS, AND A LOT OF THEM, AHEAD]\nSHAFT, the studio behind this anime, really need to be congratulated. One of the best anime I have seen to date, Madoka Magica explores the idea of being sent back in time to re-do your mistakes and to save one's life to no use, as the past can no longer be changed. How determination can't be everything you need and that great sacrifices must be made in cases that warrant it. I came for a mahō shōjo, I left with a shattered heart and nine gallons of tears.\n[STORY] (contains one ridiculously major spoiler)\nIn short, it's about an asshole\n          \n        cat-like creature called (In)Kyubey(tor) who persuades some high-school girls to become Magical Girls for the reward of being granted one wish. This, however, turns out to be miles short of a worthy reward, as the pain of being a magical girl is nothing but pain and desperation until you die. The story has various plot twists, intense moments, side stories, and incredibly well-executed events that made me feel ridiculously \"in the world\" and concerned for all of the characters' (besides Kyubey, fuck Kyubey) well-being. One bit that made me lose my (emotional) shit was when in the last episode (SPOILER!!!) Junko asks Homura \"Who is Madoka? Is she some sort of cartoon character?\" after Madoka's little brother draws her in the ground. That gave me a feeling that I can only describe as \"Oh my Jesus stop or I think I might jump out of the ninth floor window\".\n[ART]\nExtremely well-done animation on SHAFT's part, Madoka Magica doesn't fail to please with it's unique style of animating battles that remind me of coloured paper cut-outs, and the way that characters are drawn is a unique and enticing aspect of the art for me. It's a break from the usual style (think Azumanga Daioh) of drawing. The style is captivating and unique, and I found it to be an important part of the series. +5 points for the epic animation of the Walpurgis Night and +20 points for the death animations. The art in MSMM is nothing to be laughed at, and nothing short of perfection in the genre.\n[SOUND]\nThe BGM is badass, character voicing extremely well done, and I went as far as to purchase ClarIS - Connect, the OP. Each piece fits the situation the characters are in and the tone expresses how they are feeling. I didn't really pay an incredible amount of attention to the sound when watching, as I was too focused on the gripping story and unbelievable animation rather than sound, however I did note it was of a very high quality, just like the entire anime itself.\n[CHARACTER] (Has super major spoilers, don't read if you don't want 99% of the series spoiled)\nAll of the characters in Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica are characters that I enjoyed and would like to see more of. All of them are largely original, and don't really follow a set pattern (e.g. I would classify Kyoka as a tsundere if I had to, but she's not even that, she's more of a protective but always initially hostile character), which I appreciated when watching. A large amount of them die, however. And you would think that it'd just give you the feeling of \"Oh, they're gone. Well, shit.\", but it didn't. For me, it was much larger, for the reason being that I developed some sort of strange emotional bond with the characters. I understood what they were going through and, as the internet would say, \"felt for them\". When any of the characters died, I usually locked myself within my room for a day and spent it in a miserable mood knowing the character wouldn't be there anymore. And when [censored] died, I literally spent an entire school week crying - I have, by the way, cried about seven times after the age of seven as of writing this review - and didn't talk to almost anyone for said week. That's a major feat for an animation if you ask me. Kyoka's sad past also had an impact on me.\n[ENJOYMENT]\n0/10. But I wrote 10/10 for the reason that this is by no means an anime meant to be enjoyed. This is an anime that's supposed to make you cry a river (as it did), not make you proclaim your love for the in-series ships. It's supposed to make you shut yourself in your room for a week (as it did), not go out and tell all your friends to watch this when they're sad. And it succeeds in every last inch of that. It entices you in with a cover and song suited for a happy schoolgirl Mahō Shōjo, and leaves you wondering how you fell for this trickery, when it's not even the 1st of April. A masterpiece among quite a few masterpieces, MSMM includes such intricate detail and gripping story that I honestly think that it was created over the span of 20 years.\n[OVERALL] \nDo you like happy schoolgirls?\nDo you like the Mahō Shōjo genre?\nDo you like cute kittens with ear-rings?\nDo you like magical battles that always result in a win for the main character?\nWell, look no further, because you've gone about as fucking far from that as you can.\nDo not watch this if you're feeling down.\nDo not watch this if you can't take a sad anime ending.\nDo not watch this if you like your characters to stay alive.\nDo not watch this if you're normal, watch this only if you're sure you can take the 300 minutes of emotional rollercoaster that Madoka Magica is, and even then come prepared.\nRated \"K\" for \"Kyubey should be burned at the stake - even if he's invincible\".\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica's an interesting anime. It's one of those shows which comes along every now and then (excluding the seasonal hype shows) which tends to split the community: either it's praised as being unparalleled in some way and being revolutionary, or it's considered bad and overrated. I'd fall closer to the latter. (This review contains no spoilers but there are allusions towards certain events.) \nArt: 8/10 \nIt's good. Nothing extraordinary, but the creative backgrounds and character clothing is fairly well done. There's also some bits in the show which are animated amazingly well. \nSound: 9/10 \nIn my honest opinion, the soundtrack is the best part\n          \n        of this entire series. A few of the songs--namely Theme of Puella Magi and Inevitabilis--are some of my favourite of any anime score. They convey a sort of deep, eternal bittersweet melancholy and sadness after watching the show which stays (at least with me) even years after having finished it. \nCharacters: 5/10 \nThe characters' development and interaction is supposed to be the cornerstone of this series (from what I can tell) and this is where I found the series falls short. I can't go into much detail without spoiling anything so I won't, but almost all of the characters either annoyed me or I didn't care for. \nI couldn't care less for Homura. She was simply a mysterious know-it-all character until one of the later backstory episodes of the series. Her motivations weren't nearly fleshed out enough--I thought it more of an extremely creepy obsession than anything. \nThen there was Madoka who was painfully annoying until the very end. She was, dare I say it, like one of the shounen characters who continuously cried about wanting everyone to get along and no one to get hurt. \nSayaka was all over the place with drastically varying amounts of mental fortitude throughout the series and just... ugh. \nKyoko was hella sick tho. \nStory/Overall: 6/10 \nThe idea was interesting, just badly executed. There are parts of Kyubey's reasoning which bother me (albeit that's more because of the physics behind it) and things which I would've liked explained rather than \"they happen because of [this]\". Much of this series's main appeal comes from the aforementioned \"dark and depressing\" themes which I couldn't think of as anything more than shock value. It's not all bad though: parts of the soundtrack are beautifully done and the series is worth a watch for those alone. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    I was skeptical of watching this due to reading the manga first and all the spoilers floating around the internet, but after getting somewhat pushed into watching it, I found it to be better than I was expecting.\nEven though I knew most of the plot points, the story was still good enough to keep me watching, the characters are fairly well written, I felt a bit of forced drama with one of the characters, but it's a minuscule complaint.\nThe art is great, both the pretty colors and dark shadows are well drawn, not a big fan of the blushing drawn on the characters and some\n          \n        of the pointy chin characters though.\nI will admit that this anime got me into tears the most out of the other animes that I have seen though, it's pretty good at playing the sad card.\nCharacters are generally great, plot is great, art is mostly great, 8.5/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    I believe that this anime is too overrated.\nThe genre of magical shoujo does not always give us nothing new, it is not surprising. And yet, we turn to the story, it is rather dull and rather banal, and by the middle of the anime you know what's what, in spite of this, the recent series may surprise. At the expense of graphics and music, I have always been neutral, there is probably nothing to stick, on the contrary, this anime original style depiction. Opening theme is not lousy, but it is not cool to name the most common opening theme, as the ending theme. The\n          \n        characters do not have a strong pattern, which is a plus, but you'll guess the question, \"So who is the villain?\". Despite the boredom of this anime, the theme with the time always seemed interesting to me, which helped watch this creation. Many are at odds, which is actually the ending? Good or bad? It depends on perception, for me personally, it's something in between. So if you want to see something exciting, then forward, but take it seriously anime it will be difficult.\n        "},

It is really nice and um... sketchy and reminds me of some cool doodles. I hadn't seen an anime with that art style before.\nThe characters are a bit bland. Kyubey is very weird because of his facial expression. It is permanently like that, annoyingly. Unlike the manga.\nI totally/kind of disagree this anime is Yuri. Just because there are a bunch of girls together as friends, doesn't make it. It is just friendship and teamwork! Homura is a really good friend, actually!\nThe show has lack of humor, and the songs are\n          \n        very BORING.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    *This is not a review of Madoka Magica analyzing its \"goodness\", any further than how it changed my life. Needless to say, it's fairly personal. \nThroughout my life, I’ve had a fairly ironclad set of self-serving ideals that drove me to tread one vapid path. Looking back, I can’t quite put my finger on what separated me from the individuals with a lack of conscience and mindfulness, whom I despise today. What changed me? I can’t express it in words alone, and maybe it’s best that way. However, perhaps It could have been fate, or just plain luck for me to eventually stumble upon Japanese\n          \n        script writer “Gen Urobuchi”s heartfelt anime series “Puella Magi Madoka Magica” (Madoka Magica for reduce), after experiencing the darker periods of my life. \nYears ago, I watched the first half of Madoka Magica, though was quick to drop it because of how conceptually bland it felt at first. Simply put, I thought it was generic, or even as a substantial part of what inhibited the anime industry from being the colossal titan it could eventually become. Fast forward two bittersweet years of my life, and I decided to give it another chance. Needless to say, I began rewatching the series with low expectations. \nTo begin with, I re-evaluated the opening sequence that I had formerly considered an embellished “sample” of life itself. The music was far too upbeat for my liking, and lacked consistency in tempo. Its art-style was too pretentious for me to appreciate. Surprisingly, however, my second viewing of it portrayed stellar visuals, with vocalists “ClariS” clearly speaking to my heart. Even though the vocals were upbeat, they still managed to convey this interwoven sentiment of despair and misfortune. Even though its tempo was erratic, it coincided perfectly with the intricacy of the series itself. I refused to let anyone call my description of the song an exaggeration, though that’s still true, even now.\nAfter having my view shifted by the opening sequence, I was perplexingly conflicted when thinking about what the story would be like. To my surprise, the latter half of the series took a dark, death-filled turn, with main characters leaving the spotlight left and right. It was then that I became fully immersed in the fictional world of Madoka Magica. \nAt some point, there was a heartbreaking moment where character “Homura” revealed that she had made use of time travel, using the concept of “world lines”, in attempts to prevent the protagonist’s recurring death. After many time loops without success, I legitimately felt as if there was no way for the tragic status quo to be reversed; similar was mindset of the nearly-dead Homura. Time had then really stopped in reality, as the protagonist whispered; as if directed to me, saying “If someone ever tells me it's a mistake to have hope, well, then, I'll just tell them they're wrong. And I'll keep telling them 'til they believe! No matter how many times it takes.\" To cloak hopeless and despair under the facade of hope was beautiful in and of itself, and I can’t forget that feeling upon realization of this. \nAt that point, it was difficult for me to hold back my tears. I questioned why I made such a big deal out of something that was fictitious. Finally, I realized that though characters may be concepts, the emotions they convey are real. Never before had I felt this strongly about something. My tears whispered to me in similar fashion to the characters that I had come to love. I could see that my fixed ideals and cynical outlook did not separate me from others, where I previously had thought that those traits made me “objectively better”. My past self was washed before my eyes, and it felt entangling to lie in between the bewildering rift of the past and present. \nUltimately, perspective can really change after a few years. Because of how I had yet to feel connected to a person enough to evoke an emotional reaction, I had stayed cynical and uninspired to understand the way others thought and felt. I'm glad that Madoka Magica was the first to do this for me. It's not something that can be analyzed further than the morals that it instills in viewers. But it's not a show for everyone. Now, my ambitions have become clear, perhaps translucent. I aspire to be a writer in order to illustrate my understanding of people, pulling my viewer’s heartstrings at every turn. And trust me, if anything, the Urobutcher does that time and time again with this series. \n        "},

Yes, I finished watching “Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica” just now, and here goes my thoughts on the anime.\nWhen I did a bit research on the anime before watching it, I thought it was gonna be a cute, magical anime with adorable characters. I just couldn’t be more wrong.\nThe anime started with a very startling scenerio. I didn’t understand what it was about, but it sure seemed like something worth looking forward to.\nAnyways, as the anime went on, I kinda’ started to like it. The\n          \n        music is just unbelievably amazing. One just cannot help falling in love with the soundtracks. The artwork seemed pretty unique at times. But the episodes seemed somewhat slow. I was about to drop the anime, but people’s comments and its rankings surprised me. So I held onto it. Up until the eighth episode, it seemed pretty much average. It seemed as if there’s not a stronger story to it.\nBut then came the plot twists.\nI can assure you, you’ll never see this coming. Yes, after knowing about the twist, you’ll be like, “Oh, okay! That happened before!” But you won’t see it coming in this anime. It seems all cute, after all! And the story afterwards, is just a masterpiece.\nThis has been one hell of an emotional roller-coaster ride for me. I kept feeling sorry for everyone, I kept feeling heartbroken myself, I felt so pathetic at times. Trust me, by the eleventh episode, I was completely shattered. Homura’s despair, Sayaka’s paranoia, Madoka’s helplessness…I felt as if all of those were familiar to me. Regrets, sadness, loneliness, despair…we all go through this. I guess that’s why, they all seemed so familiar. But to be very honest, I loved this emotional ups and downs. To me, that’s what the made the anime worth watching.\nI cursed Kyubey so many times while watching this anime. I guess I’ve never hated a character so much before. But in the end, the story of the anime made me forget about that li’l brat. So don’t worry if you hate him, you’re supposed to! ^_^\nThe character development in the anime seemed great at the end. Yes, you might be as bored as I was while watching the first few episodes…but if you hold on, you’ll just know that this was worth watching. You’ll just know.\nIn the end, when Kyosuke was playing the violin, and Madoka and Sayaka were sitting together…I just felt empty. That tune and their conversation just gave me the feeling of an unknown sadness.\n\"Miracles aren’t free.\nWhen you wish for hope, it creates an equivalent despair.\"\nStill, the anime didn’t end the way I thought it would. In the end, right after the credits, this scene came up…that said,\n“Don’t forget.\nAlways, somewhere, someone is fighting for you.\nAs long as you remember her, you’re not alone.”\nThere’s no word to describe the feeling I went through after I saw this on the screen. As someone who always looks down upon herself, who’s always thought that she’s not worth anything to anyone…this just made me cry. I know, it might just not be true. But this anime gave me the hope that it is the very truth, that I do have someone…who’ll fight for me till the very end.\nAnd I felt grateful. I really did.\nI’m glad I watched this. I’d recommend this anime to everyone. Please hold onto this anime no matter how boring it seems. There are just 12 episodes, right? Trust me, you won’t regret it.\nAnd yes, a quote from the anime.\n“This maybe a world with no salvation, where nothing but sadness and hate repeats itself…but even so, this is a place that I’d like to protect.”\nYes, I definitely would. :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    (Spoiler-free) Miracles come true, not free.\n- Story: 9/10\nMadoka Magica is a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, where a magical creature turns a young teenage girl into a magical girl in order to fight off the evil in the world. This is what happens in Madoka Magica, just not the way we're all used to. \nThe story progression is a bit slow at first but picks up after the first few episodes. Throughout the story, Madoka learns what it is to be a magical girl and all the things that come with it, good and bad. She must make a choice and decide whether or\n          \n        not she wants to accept Kyubey's offer, as tempting and promising as it is. The show is well-executed and the pacing is just right, and left me wanting to watch the next episode every time. No point in trying to hide it, this anime isn't always cute and happy. It gets quite dark and deep at times, and has its fair share of twists and turns. The characters and their choices have a large impact on what happens in the show, and they must deal with the consequences of those choices in their own ways. This is where Madoka Magica does a great job of showing that your decisions are important and there will always be repercussions for them. \nThe ending was conclusive and gave closure to the story, and I was personally satisfied with it. And then Rebellion was made. But that's another review in itself. By the way, you don't need to watch Rebellion, but I recommend you do so if you really enjoyed Madoka Magica (which I believe is likely to happen). Just know, you'll either like it or hate it. \nI would go more in depth, but doing so would spoil some of the plot, so I won't. I'll just say that the story is great and conveys a good message, and it definitely is one of this anime's many strong points. \n- Art: 9/10\nMadoka Magica's art style is very fitting for the show, with its bright colors and moe-style characters. The witch labyrinth scenes are artistic and a treat to watch, and the fight scenes are also well executed. The show also has its own alphabet used for magical girl and witch items, which I find cool. Animation is fluid and consistent for the most part, but there are a few derp shots, as I like to call them. Also, some scenes (backgrounds, especially) are not as detailed as others are since the production was done on a week-to-week basis, making the animation look somewhat rushed. However, this is resolved with the blu-ray release and the movies, which are consistently beautiful. \n- Sound: 9/10\nThe OST is exceptionally great, although I am a bit biased because I like Yuki Kajiura's work in general. The BGM helps set the tone in every scene and I don't find the use of tracks repetitive. The opening, Connect, is catchy, upbeat, and lighthearted. Just from watching it and listening to it, you'd think of the show as a typical middle school slice-of-life shoujo anime (it's not). The ending, Magia, however, contrasts the opening's happy tone and is instead epic and dark-sounding. It's my favorite song from the anime, and one of my favorite ending songs to date.\nThe seiyuus portray the characters well with their classic high-pitched moe voices, and do a good job of conveying their emotions. I actually enjoyed the dub, and I think Cristina Vee did an excellent job on Homura, specifically. The dub is worth watching if you're too lazy to read subtitles (like me). \n- Characters: 9/10\nThe characters of Madoka Magica don't exactly get much development, but we get to see them react to situations and problems in their own ways. They have different opinions and different values, much like people in real life, which causes them to clash at times despite being friends. For the most part, however, they try to help each other despite their problems. The friendship between the girls is heart-warming and you get to see them in their ups and downs together. Now, some people say that this anime has shoujo-ai themes, but I think that depends on viewer interpretation. If you want to ship the characters, go ahead. Personally, I'm not a fan of shoujo-ai type anime, so I see it as close friendship between girls who are battling similar problems. To each their own.\nMadoka, the titular character, is actually the only character I find to be genuinely honest in the sense that she acts the way she truly feels. The other magical girls, however, at times act one way but don't actually feel that way on the inside. A lot of people act this way; I know I do it. It's not necessarily a bad thing all the time. I think this is mainly because they're pubescent girls and of course feel strong emotions at their age, especially when placed in the situations they're in. This makes them seem more realistic since there are times when you may even dislike them. My personal favorite is Mami since she's relatable, but character-wise I like Homura the most. Despite seeming like an emotionless person (bitch) at times, later on you get to see the more human side of her and learn about her motives. \n- Enjoyment: 10/10\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and loved watching every second of it. It's right up my alley with the psychological elements, great characters, and enjoyable story. Madoka Magica is one of my favorite anime and one I would recommend watching even to friends who aren't avid anime watchers. I highly recommend this anime to anyone interested in watching it. Chances are, you won't be disappointed. \n\"She fought to protect the hope in this world, despite all its despair. That's why... I keep fighting.\" \n\n\n\n"},

I came in not knowing much about the show and found the various surprises in the plot to be that much more enjoyable. All that is necessary to know about the story is that everything isn't as it seems. \nArt:\nThe art is where this anime suffers a little bit for me. At certain times the characters look a little bit wonky in their faces. The animation of the witches was highly unique, though not really my tastes. The\n          \n        character design is what really saves this category. The character's outfits are beautiful. \nSound:\nAbsolutely amazing soundtrack! I regularly listen to the tracks outside of the anime. They aren't boring to listen to on their own without visual accompaniment. Yuki Kajiura never disappoints me!\nCharacter:\nThe characters change a lot through the course of the anime, and it is interesting to see each girl's motivation in choosing to become a magical girl. The characters are incredibly likeable and are my main reason for enjoying this show as much as I did. Homura is my absolute favorite and is one of the most well written characters I have ever come across in anime. \nEnjoyment:\nThis show is highly enjoyable and nothing really compares to it. There is not a single show in my list that gives the same vibes as Madoka. It is one of the shows I recommend the most to people! \nOverall:\nMadoka is an easy 10/10 for me! \n        "},

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nWhen I stumbled into the world of Madoka★Magica, I already had a sense that the anime was not what it seemed to be, as many of the original viewers had found out by the third episode. Being the curious person that I am, I decided to check this anime out, since the magical girl genre is my favorite. Low and behold, I was not wrong.\nMadoka★Magica has very harrowing themes and dark stories behind the mask of cute characters and the moe art style. Despite these things, the characters and the plot work in conjunction to make\n          \n        the anime we have now. While Madoka★Magica excelled in the area of fleshing out the plot, there were still a lot of things the anime and its movies did not explore.\nFor example, although the characters were well developed throughout the original anime series, many of the character arcs were left open. This includes Sayaka Miki and Kyoko Sakura's arcs. While Sayaka had a lot of attention in the series due to her involvement with Kyosuke and becoming a magical girl later on to save him, I felt her arc in the end could've been explored further, especially when she had fallen into despair and became a witch. On the other hand, Kyoko's arc was left widely open, and I thought her involvement with her father could've also been explored further.\nLastly, I also thought magical girls and Kyubey in general could have been better explained. The series spent little time explaining the theory of magical girls and their work in preventing entropy. I also felt Kyubey and the incubators could have been further explored since they were barely touched on upon the series, especially their origins.\nTo conclude, Puella Magi★Madoka Magica is an anime that has not only great visuals, but a great story and, despite having a weak side in character arcs, and is a great anime for anyone who enjoys dark, psychological shows.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Overview:\nEver since it first premièred back in 2011, \"Madoka Magica\" has been notorious for changing the way we view the magical girl genre forever, adding a very dark twist that, at the time, was practically unheard of. As someone who was unable to enjoy the likes of \"Sailor Moon\" or \"Cardcaptor Sakura\", I consider this series a big breath of life into a genre that was previously known for being childish and monotonous, even if it is definitely not easy on the feels.\nStory (8/10):\nThe story opens with our heroine Madoka Kaname having a mysterious dream about a black-haired girl fighting strange creatures. Even more mysteriously,\n          \n        that same dark-haired girl (named Houmra Akemi) comes to Madoka's school the next day as a transfer student and seems to know her very well, despite Madoka having no memory of her. Not long after this, Madoka and her friend Sayaka Miki encounter a strange creature called Kyubey, who wishes to form a contract with them. Simply put, they become Magical Girls and fight mysterious creatures called witches and he in turn will grant them one wish, whatever it may be.\nSounds simple enough on paper, but the reality is actually a lot more complicated. We've all heard the saying \"Be careful what you wish for\", right? Well, never has that had a stronger meaning than it does here, as soon enough the girls discover the consequences of their wishes and how empty and nihilistic the life of a Magical Girl really is. Further complicating matters is the fact that Kyubey isn't what he appears to be and is prone to withdrawing important information. And, needless to say, the amount of pain the girls go through over the series' twelve episodes is downright heartbreaking to watch.\nThe dark twists are plentiful, which is expected since the writer is none other than Gen Urobuchi. The creators even went through the trouble of having a really cute ending theme for the first two episodes, just to make the sudden change in tone in the third episode as shocking as possible. There isn't a whole lot I can say as nearly everything is a major spoiler, so I'll just say that while not an awful lot happens, the story manages to hold itself together all the way up to a rewarding conclusion.\nArt & Animation (8/10):\nThe art, for a lack of a better word, is strange. The girls all look pretty cutesy, appearing to be ten when they're actually teenagers. This feels out of place when the story starts to fall into dark territory, as the character models look very ill-fitting for such a dark series. Thankfully, this is made up for by the witch labyrinths, which, to be perfectly honest, made me think  drugs were involved when they were designing the series. Seriously, the visuals when they're in a labyrinth are absolutely insane, with everything besides the characters themselves becoming a wild collage of symbols and strange creatures that symbolize the Witch and her obsessions. They are downright disturbing and look very unique.\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, as expected from Yuki Kajiura. It's best described as orchestral with a few electric tracks here and there. As I mentioned before, the ending theme abruptly changes when the show reveals its true colours, and the new ending theme, 'Magia', sums up everything about the series perfectly. Other tracks that deserve mentions include 'A Duel with a Witch', 'You Should be a Magical Girl' and 'Decision', though that is definitely just to name a few. The voice acting and dialogue aren't bad either, with Christina Vee and Christine Marie Cabanos delivering great performances as Homura and Madoka, although Sarah Williams, Lauren Landa and Carrie Keranen are all very good as well. All in all, the absolute highlight of the series.\nCharacters (8/10):\nWe'll start with Madoka. While the series is known for being a deconstruction, Madoka herself is a deconstruction as well. Specifically, she's a deconstruction of the typical magical girl protagonist. Her personality is actually quite common for the genre, but what's uncommon is the fact that these traits are handled in a much more realistic fashion. Magical Girls don't just fight witches. They also fight each other sometimes, and Madoka is horrified by this as she considers it to be senseless. While this certainly isn't a bad thing, the others unfortunately either don't care or view it as a cold, hard fact of life. So, for once, the one who wants everyone to co-operate is also the one who nobody listens to. She also clearly has self-esteem issues, as she wants to become a Magical Girl because she views herself as otherwise weak and unremarkable. The poor girl just wants everyone to be happy, but trying to do anything to help would also mean having to throw her life away.\nBut let's be honest, the real stand-out character here has got to be Homura, who is, in many ways, Madoka's opposite. She has been a Magical Girl for, well, a very long time and so has seen it all. This has caused her to develop a very cynical personality, which is best summed up with this quote:\n\"A person becomes naïve if they're too kind. Careless if they're too bold. And no matter how hard you try to protect others, there's no gratitude. Those who can't comprehend such things aren't fit to be Magical Girls.\"\nBasically, she knows the horrors of being a Magical Girl but since there's no going back for her, she just accepts it. And you really cannot blame her considering what she's been through. She starts off seemingly emotionless, but then we suddenly see her crying out of frustration in episode 8, having had enough of Madoka acting like she doesn't matter. Then we see her  backstory in episode 10 and suddenly it all makes sense. I usually prefer really nice characters like Madoka, so for me Houmra is living proof that sometimes the anti-hero is simply the better character.\nThe other girls are all very likeable as well, and all are forced to endure a huge amount of suffering. Sayaka deserves a special mention. She really wants to become a Magical Girl who helps others, as she views others as selfish people who only use their power for themselves. Unfortunately, no matter what she tries, she can't seem to accomplish anything and the wish she makes ultimately ends up being for nothing. Eventually, the pressure gets far too much for her and... well, we won't get into that.\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\nThe torment the characters go through can get pretty excessive at times. Gen Urobuchi has never been known for being fair with your feelings and that is shown to the fullest extent here. I've seen quite a few people who just got sick of the whole thing, as at times the world seems to exist just to psychologically torture its characters until they break. That being said, if you can get past that, you will find a very emotional ride, with a few really epic fight scenes.\nOverall:\n\"Madoka Magica\" has brought a stale genre straight out of its shell. If you didn't like typical magical girl series, then this is one you should definitely give a go, especially if you're a big fan of female characters like I am. Just make sure you'll be able to handle it, or at least have a box of tissues nearby. All in all, Gen Urobuchi delivers as usual.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    If you have the idea that this show will be something like other magical girl shows like Sailor Moon or Sakura Card Captors you are very very wrong. This anime is really dark and you will realize that in about 5 or so minutes into the first episode, and to be honest this \"darkness\" is really what makes this an awesome anime.\nStory:\nThe story centers Kaname Madoka, a normal high school girl that one day meets this animal like creature called Kyuubey, who offers her and her friend Sayaka the task of saving the world by becoming magical girls and grant them one wish. The task\n          \n        is pretty simple, you have to defeat witches because otherwise they will kill people. \nSo far there is nothing different from other magical girls anime. What makes it different is that with every people they save, with every piece of joy they give to the world there is an equal amount of \"despair\", as it is said in the anime, that affects the girls. This principle of equivalence( yes, the same as FMA) is what really makes it dark and of course some really messed up scenes.\nThis is definitely not an anime for little girls, I would say the target  audience are people that can understand well complex anime like Death Note or Psycho Pass.\nCharacters:\nThere aren't many characters in this anime. Because of this, you can't really get to know them, their personalities, their past, their reasons for becoming a magical girl and ultimately their individual wish. This is done surprisingly well considering that the show only has 12 episodes.\nKyuubey, well there is not much I can say without spoiling anything so I'm just gonna say that in the same way as in other magical girl anime you don't really know where this creature comes from or why does he(I'm guessing he because of the voice) give girls powers or even how does he do it. And one more thing, as cute as one may think he is, his face just seems way too creepy for me.\nArt:\nThe animation for the anime was done by SHAFT and if you have seen any other SHAFT work(i.e Nisekoi, Monogatari, etc) you will instanctly notice it. However, you really don't get the fanservice that characterize the other shows, not that it is a bad thing, in fact, I appreciate this a lot, because with other works the fanservice is something that takes almost 70% of every chapter and it gets annoying after a while.\nThe problem I had with the art was the character animation. To be honest, it was bad, to the point that if it wasn't for the story I would have stopped watching it from the start.\nSound:\nThe soundtrack was made by Yuki Kajiura(SAO, Kara no kyoukai, etc), so this already makes this a really good soundtrack. Most of the soundtrack really suits the dark mood of the anime and it does so in a way that all the sad parts seem to be way sadder than they really are, which is a good thing, at least for me.\nIf you didn't think that the fact that this anime was about magical girls was deceiving enough for you to think there is no mature themes or something like that, well the opening does that. You can't really get an idea of what the anime is really about, and I don't really like that. This is the same thing that happened with School Days, the opening had no hint of what the anime was really about, not that it would've helped at all considering how incredibly bad the anime was.\nThe ending suits the theme of the anime, despite the fact that the animation is just the credits and the characters walking, but it was a good song. \nOverall I really enjoyed the anime, it was nothing I had expected it to be and you will not be disappointed by it.\nIf you can buy it go buy it, the blu-ray actually has better background graphics than the ones from streams, unless the streaming sites already changed them.\n"},

It's not completely original (the story has often been compared to Evangelion as well as Princess Tutu), but as has often been said by many an author, there are perhaps somewhere less than 10 truly original stories in the annals of humanity. Good writing happens when you can pick, choose, and mix\n          \n        up the best elements from those stories, and Madoka pulls this off with flying colors. Fans still argue whether it falls under the technical definition of a deconstruction of a magical girl show, but whether you consider it a true deconstruction in the Derridaesque sense or merely a dark subversion (see \"Subverted Kids' Show\" on TV Tropes), one can't deny that it puts some...unique spins on the stories of Sailor Moon and her spiritual descendants.\nIt has been said that purpose of art is simply to create an emotional reaction in the viewer, and in this again Madoka succeeds at all levels. It wasn't the first show to use a simple, candy-colored, child-friendly character design to lull us into a false sense of security, but remember what I said about using the best elements. In this case it works, especially in how it clashes with the otherworldy, Warholian \"Witches\" (which are often animated with collage artwork and designs by the Russian-inspired duo Gekidan Inu Curry; go watch a film called \"Hedgehog in the Fog\" to see where they're coming from) that these magical girls are tasked with fighting in exchange for making a wish with a mysterious creature called Kyubey. Kyubey, in terms of design, floats on the boundary between the seeming softness of the \"real world\" and the eldritch horrors of the Witches, making him at once huggable and at the same time somewhat eerie and off-putting. A good choice, for reasons which will soon become clear. And of course the artwork of the Witches is, after Kyubey, what many people will take the most away from after watching. Resembling various familiar objects such as rosebushes, butterflies, computer monitors, suits of armor, and even classic works of art torn to pieces and reassembled helter-skelter by a mad artist, they could fill an art gallery on their own, and possibly win some awards.\nBut most important of all, there is in fact a method to this madness; a rather deep comment on the nature of selflessness. Do we ever do things solely with others in mind, or simply as a backhanded way of getting something in return? Kyubey's deep, beady red eyes (like a doll's eye!) are the abyss you'll find yourself staring into to answer this question.\nMadoka Magica isn't perfect, of course. It is primarily a plot-driven drama as opposed to a true character-driven story, which seems to be Urobuchi's forte. As a result, the characters, while still quite sympathetic and somewhat believable, are somewhat rushed along like actors in a play as opposed to real people. One of the more glaring examples is how for about two episodes the characters Sayaka (Madoka's best friend and a new \"contractee\") is fighting veteran magical girl Kyouko to the death, only for Kyouko to try to open up to Sayaka after a minimum of transition. But all in all, you still will be able to relate and hope that somehow, these characters will be able to pull through their horrible travails, and that somehow some sense of hope can emerge from the suffering.\nWhether or not you'll think it's a masterpiece, I would still consider PMMM to be worthy of its fame, and recommend any anime fan to check it out at least once.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    It took me a while to warm up to the prospect of watching a story based around a mahou shoujo theme, as it is not my usual cup of tea. However, in the case of Madoka Magica, what started out looking like a typical sugary sweet slice of life story about friends being magical girls quickly turned into a philosophical mind trip that had me too taken in to even blink. \nThe premise of the story centers around Madoka, a very kind, (too much for her own good) girl who encounters a magical furry creature Kyubei, who can grant wishes to girls in exchange for\n          \n        their service in defeating witches. So, typical good versus ultimate baddie? Wrong. The writers of Madoka-Magica display a great aptitude in being able to lull you into a false sense of story regarding the direction with excellent voice acting and impeccable timing and pacing of the story before turning what was once a light hearted story into an emotional rollercoaster. \nThe artwork and the music in this story were masterfully utilized in pushing the story along. Color and music effects gave subtle hints to the viewer in nudging along the direction the story was moving towards and coincided well with tone of the scenes. The backgrounds of the scenes were especially striking in unique art styles in almost abstract, random way.  The character designs were flawed, but consistent, (I didnt particularly like the squarish faces all the characters had). Between the incredible background artwork effects and the acoustic setting, it was often easy to piece together the story even without the help of subs. I often would rewind and pause during many scenes because they foreshadow a lot of things with their striking background visuals loaded with detail.\nHowever, the story was what unequivocally won this anime over for me. Taking into account the larger questions SHAFT was willing to indulge, such as utilitarianism and universal thermodynamics.  Being that I watched Steins; Gate prior to this, I must say that this anime reeks of a lot of similar themes (I know that madoka came out first). Most studios would require at least a full 24 episodes in order to setup and flesh out such meaningful and deep issues, especially when you start with a premise as ridiculous this. With that being said, SHAFT executed the pacing of the overall storyline MASTERFULLY. Not one second or scene was wasted towards anything other than the progression of the overall storyline. What's even more impressive is that everything the writers tried to sell in terms of character actions and development felt believable and fully explored. \nProbably the one qualm I have about this anime, however, is the resolution, or lack thereof. Trust when I say this, I probably read through all of the comments on the last episode after I watched the ending and the main reason for this was mainly to the WTF? factor. I had no idea what had just happened; the clear absurdity and the convenience of the last wish of Madoka clashed with every theme the writing staff had efforted towards in the previous 11 episodes. It was almost too clean, and illogical considering the consequences of the events leading up the finale. However, I can't exactly fault the studio writing staff for writing such an ending ( the one I probably had planned was probably too polarizing). That in itself, was the only thing that prevented me, a shonen lover, from giving this a Masterpiece 10 rating and watching it again, knowing how dissatisfied I was with the ending. Despite that issue, this anime still gets a healthy 9 from me and probably takes 2nd behind steins ; gate for 2011. I havent watched penguindrum or usagi drop. (i think I would be too confused in the former and too shaken up from the tearing up in the latter.)\n        "},

Not great, but not bad. \nSTORY:\nThe story for me was slow. For most of it to be honest. infact, by the 7th episode I literally yelled at my phone to hurry up and get to the good part already not realizing my roommate was in the room, lol oops. It's not that it wasn't bad up to that point, it's that I felt that we still hadn't even been introduced to the real probelm of the story yet, and in fact we\n          \n        hadn't. The real problem the story deals with doesn't even start until the 10th episode, and from there on out it's great. But that's only 3 episodes that are phenomenal, while the rest left me wanting for the story to get to the big picture already.\nART:\nThis was one of the things that set me off the most about this show. The animation was choppy at times, the fight scenes weren't exciting at all, and the contrast in art styles wasn't great to say the least. I get that they were trying to be artistic with the choppy scenes and the clash of styles, but it didn't work as much as other animations have for me. And it wasn't a problem of \nSOUND:\nThis was actually my favorite part about Madoka Magica. The Theme song was amazing, the ending was great, and the songs that played throughout every episode actually helped put some excitement into a story that wouldn't start. Soundtrack is amazing.\nCHARACTER:\nI actually really liked a lot of the characters in this show. Character is definitely a strong point of Madoka Magica. From Homura, Sayaka, Mami, to even Madoka herself, all of the characters had their moments where they really shined through and showed that the writers of this show definitely knew how to write strong characters. Even the side characters are loveable, one of my favorite characters in the show is Madoka's mother, Junko, who gets just enough screen time for you to grow to love her, but without her getting in the way of the main plot. \nOVERALL:\nOverall I was disappointed with the slow movement of the story, and art style. While the characters and soundtrack were splendid, and it was a good show, it was nothing more than that: a good show at best, with a cute ending.

(I will avoid saying anything further about the characters as while they put too much focus on the main supporting cast it's still extremely interesting watching them evolve)\n\n-Enjoyment-\nI throughly enjoyed Madoka Magica and it's dark theme and I appreciated it's decomposure of the Mahou Shoujo genre and while I think people are putting it on a pedestal way too often I'd still rank it in my top 10 animes ever thus far but I think overall the best way to watch Madoka is to watch it with as little knowledge as possible.\n\n-Overall-\nI tend to be very heavily influenced with my overall scores by enjoyment and as to avoid that I have simply taken the factors of Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Ending and with the help of math arrived at a score of 9,17/10\nAt the time of this review I have not watched either of the Madoka films and as such I am only using the anime as a reference.\nIf you did watch Madoka Magica and liked it I'd recommend you check out \"Princess Tutu\" which is another great decomposure of the Mahou Shoujo genre.\nOr the all so famous \"Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni\" as it too has a very dark theme.\nThank you for reading this review and I hope it helped you decide whether or not to watch this series, forgive my grammar mistakes and enjoy the show.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Going into this show, I knew little about it. I had been recommended to it by a friend of mine, who simply told me it was a \"magical girl\" show. I'm not super familiar with the various genres and tropes of the anime world, but the name brought to mind Sailor Moon. So I figured it was going to be a cute, fun, if a bit lighthearted ride. \nI was pretty much dead wrong.\nMadoka Magica opens up with three lighthearted episodes. It builds up the concept of a magical girl, which are tasked with protecting the world from the nefarious witches. It introduces us to\n          \n        a few characters, who are all thrilled at the idea of becoming this \"magical girl\". And then the show plummets into very dark material. All the preconceptions you made about the series are thrown out the window, and it completely knocks you on your ass. The plot is filled with twists and turns, exciting revelations, and the occasional drop of blood. It's not what it seems, I can tell you that. The story is quite intricate and complex and will surprise you constantly. The ending is also well done, though it does drag on a bit too long. All in all, the complex story is really the strongest aspect of the series.\nThe characters are a bit weaker, in my opinion. The title character, Madoka, is usually on the sidelines for the majority of the show, watching her friends suffer and despair over the terrifying events that take hold of their lives. Her attitude makes sense for her character, but it is also ceaselessly annoying. She gets better as the series progresses, and her character slowly develops, but it can still be grating to hear her constant whining.\nThe rest of the cast, though, is quite good. Sayaka, in particular, goes through quite a bit of development as the things she's doing and seeing begin to weigh on her mind. Homura, who initially seems to be cold and stoic, is revealed bit by bit to be more than what appears. There are others, but I don't want to drag this review out for too long.\nThe animation and artwork get the job done. The highly stylized character designs stood out for me, in a good way. They also go a long way in deceiving viewers into believing this show is something it obviously isn't. The rest of the art is good, but not amazing. The animation seemed fluid enough, but I did notice a bit of stiltedness in certain scenes.\nThe soundtrack serves the show well, mirroring the emotional highs and lows the storyline goes through. It can go from lighthearted, uplifting fare (in the early episodes) to downright dark in some tracks. The opening in particular is very good, I have that on repeat right now.\nI've gotta be honest, the show didn't really connect to me emotionally. I mean, it's not like I didn't care, it just felt like the climax should have got to me a bit more than it did. Despite some character issues and some mild plot holes (which really shouldn't be held against the show, the plot is so damn multi-layered and broad that it doesn't really matter), I really enjoyed this show. It's not quite as good as I expected, especially after seeing reviews and reactions online. Still, a very enjoyable ride and I do recommend you give it a watch.\n"},

(it just connected with me personally) .Yet, there are flaws that may affect some people.\nStory:10/10, Ok not many people argue against that Madoka has an amazing story. With so many twist and turns your left mind blown, and with a roller coaster of feels.  Thus a 10 out of 10 (wont spoil anything)\nArt: 9/10 would be 10 out of ten, but somethings are not rendered smoothly and thus sometimes the charters don't look like they belong there(only noticeable after many re\n          \n        watches 1st 3 times blinded by story).\nSound: 9/10 Generally Great, many amazing songs, yet i personally thought the op should have changed in latter episodes(you shall see why). Yet, the ost's are amazing. They fit right in the moment. They are dark when its called for, epic when things get real, and just plain beautiful when the feels hit. Thus due to the op not changing to fit the story a 9/10.\nCharacters: 8/10 The weakest link in Madoka. The characters personalities are stereotypical and Madoka is a winy you know what, for about 90% of the series. Yet, over their stereo typical personalities the characters do change. They become insanely human as the story progresses. Its not the personalities that's the good part of the Characters. Its what that person morally represents that is good. Yet, the lack of good base personality results in an 8/10\nEnjoyment:  10/10 (results may very upon tastes) Madoka Magica isn't for everyone. it is a serious emotional tale. it is a good watch for most, but is only truly amazing to some. thus results may vary.\n\nFinal:9/10 Madoka magica is a wonderful tale. with amazing music and plot twists that a sure to satisfy all, but only truly amazing to some.\n        "},

It manages to tell one of the most complex and engrossing stories in any anime, rivaling Code Geass, which, mind you, is 4 times as long. It's pacing is excellent and only occasionally going into BS territory, the infodump on Kyubey's relationship with humans is the only one that comes to mind. The ending, while confusing on a first watch, is still clear enough to understand and is incredibly satsifying, and is so\n          \n        good it warrants a second viewing. \nART: 8\nWhile the character designs are versatile and endearing and the animation very fluid. The off-focus \"Meguca\" designs, especially during early episodes, are quite laughable. Also Shaft's signature weird camera angles are not really my cup of tea, including THE DRAMATIC PAN UP, and not to mention THE WORLD- FAMOUS SHAFT HEAD TURN. The frequent art style changes are subtle but noticible, from live-action cotton monsters and wallpaper monsters. Also the \"Screw You, Shadows\" art style is also a staple. If you don't like creepy camera angles and live-action cotton monsters this anime is probably not for you.\nOn the plus side, the use of lighting and color in this series is an artistic treat. Unless your watching some bootleg stream from the TV version, the backgrounds are also very appealing eye candy. \nSOUND: 9\nYuki Kajura is at her prime here with the soundtrack. While some of the soundtrack is in her somewhat predictable Orchestra and Choir style prevalent in SAO (I have yet to watch it) and F/Z, she also employs lighter styles in this surprisingly dense OST and it certainly sets the mood perfectly. The first ED nearly makes my ears bleed tho.\nConcerning the Dubs/Subs argument, I watched my first and second runs completely subbed, but I actually watched most of this run dubbed. The dub is actually pretty good and fits the personalities well, but the delivery is occasionally awkward, particularly the pronounciation of \"Akemi\" and \"Magical Girl\", I prefer the sub, but if you want to watch it dubbed it's a perfectly suitable alternative. \nCHARACTER: 10\nThe series goes for quality over quantity. With around 10 important characters, 6 of them being the magical girls and Kyubey, it leaves plenty of room for characterization and learning more. Most of the characters are utilized well and serve some purpose. I'm too lazy to mention the characters in detail, but they are well-developed and kick a lot of rear in the process. Except Hitomi, because she's just whiny. \"Omigosh! Gurls can't love gurls!\". \nFINAL VERDICT\nYou'll laugh, you'll tear up, you'll squeal in cuteness, you'll cheer, and most of all, root for good to prevail.\n10/10\nRECOMMENDATION: VERY HIGH\nNEXT TIME: Kanon '06. God help us all"},

My first impression was regular but when you think about it, this anime has so much packed into each episode. The witches have a unique way of being presented, that at first I hated. But when I noticed why they had done it, I was amazed! They had made them seem foreign to anime itself, only making the witches uglier. Adding on to all this is the pure fact that all the back stories hit on the correct type of mood. Even the fans\n          \n        made some pretty good assumptions about each character and their background stories. The fact that it's short is not a bad thing too, its the perfect size.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\nAlmost 3 years after Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica was first released now might seem like a redundant time to be writing a review for it as many people within the anime communtity have already seen it, discussed it and come to a final opinion on it. Despite this however I realised the other day after trying to sell the series to a friend that even though many people have heard of the series and how its actually really good despite its minimal fluffy exterior its still very difficult to get other 17 year old males such as myself to take it seriously. While they often\n          \n        hear about its dark themes they don't feel like experiencing it for themselves for whatever reason. But I  will state here and now that this series is definitely a must see.\nStory-The story of Madoka Magica is most likely the thing most widely praised about it along with its animation. It is written by Gen Urobuchi who is sometimes nicknamed the Urobutcher due to his dark and brutal works which should give a preliminary idea of what kind of story this is considering his other works(Psycho pass, Fate/zero) and while this series is very different to those ones the style of writing is quite similar. Madoka magica is a top-tier example of brilliant tragic storytelling with a perfect grasp on twists and turns, weaving complex themes into a narrative and keeping you guessing the conclusion until it smacks you in the face. While some of Urobuchi's other works (including the 3rd Madoka movie) suffer from disjointed ideas and odd pacing this series blends everything it has to say together without feeling forced, rushed or leaving anything unfinished. It's the kind of series that gives you an understanding of its world and concepts to ease you in and then suddenly turns EVERYTHING on its head in one jaw-dropping moment to make you rethink everything you thought that you knew. Its crazy and could have failed in a lesser written series but it manages to work here without feeling like a deus ex machina or a cheap writing decision because of how much sense it makes when you think about it in retrospect. I'm only talking in broad narrative terms here because of how much better it is to experience this series with minimal information about the actual plot. The series covers themes of Hope, despair, self-sacrifice, nihilism and faustian concepts and countless others many of which it explores and resolves without you even noticing on first watch which gives the show a high rewatch value. There are a few minor problems with the narrative such as some concepts introduced later on that don't make a whole lot of sense under scrutiny but they don't manage to topple the thematic palace that the show builds throughout its run.\nStory-9.5/10\nCharacters-Now this is the aspect of the series that Madoka-sceptics like to rip on the most and generally divides opinion with watchers of the show. A quirk of Urobuchi's writing style is that his characters are generally designed to represent 1 aspect or flaw that defines them and leads to their downfall. People who dislike the characters often claim that they are bland and uniteresting but I do not find this to be the case. This is only a 12 episode series that focues mainly on plot and themes more than anything else and if it spent too much time on characters navel gazing it would detract from all the other aspects. The characters definitely have personalities and traits that serve to aid the ideas at play in the story but it dosen't make them feel inhuman or unrelatable mainly because they act and react very realistically when faced with the heart-breaking decisions they have to make and you really do feel for these characters. Even if you know things probably won't work out for a character you still want it to as you know they didn't want to be in the situation they are in but they deal with it and keep going until the very end. You can relate to the emotional turmoil they must be feeling and that makes all the heart breaking scenes you witness in this series even more emotionally resonant. No, they're not really complex or original but that's not the point, they do feel like real people and without them the story wouldn't work as well as it does.\nCharacters-8/10\nArt-This is the bit that even sceptics agree is really, really good. Madoka's art style is an eclectic mixture of styles that while vastly different to each other manage to create a blend that mirror the plot and ideas perfectly. The character designs were part of  director Ayiyuki Shinbo's original idea to market the series as a cutesy magical girl series targeted at a younger audience than it actually is and as such are very typical of the genre and of production studio Shaft's other works. The trademark big eyes and almost pencil-like aesthetic to the characters is probably what puts a lot of people off. It is true that it seems kind of jarring at first to have such disturbing content with such cute looking character designs but it really only makes it more disturbing than it already was and adds to the overall impact of the series. The rest of the art style is really weird but effective, from the near-future aesthetic of Mitakihara city to the bizarre and psychedelic witch mazes and the escher-esque dream-like landcapes the art style of Madoka magica takes you on a journey equal in splendor to the story itself.\nArt-10/10\nSound part 1:Music-Yet another brilliant aspect of this series is the heart-achingly beautiful music penned by Yuki Kajiura, it not only compliments the already incredible emotional tension the series has but also creates its own beautiful atmosphere that melds perfectly with the animation and dialouge. Kajiura's music is mainly a mixture of strings, electronics and guitars that blend in an explosion of different feelings and moods. The creepy and foreboding 'A duel with a witch' uses distorted guitars and a haunting choir to build a creepy and disturbing atmosphere while tracks like 'Decretum' and 'Inevitabilis' are indescribably beautiful and reach the exact wavelength of emotional resonance that the story reaches and manages to say so much about what the characters are going through that it has made me shed tears once or twice and i'm someone who rarely ever cries. The opening and ending themes are polar opposites to each other, The opening theme 'connect' is a very stereotypical magical girl anime theme song (for more of the director's misleading) but is so damn catchy that you won't really care how out of place it feels after a few episodes of dark, faustian tragedy. The ending theme 'Magia' however is a dark, gothic song performed by Yuki Kajiura's band Kalafina which feels much more like the tone of the show and is also a really awesome song.\nSound part 2: Voice acting-The japanese track is something that I don't believe I have the knowledge to discuss as I do not speak the language and do not know a lot about the voice acting industry in Japan but for the most part it sounded great and managed to convey the wide emotional ranges present in the story very well. The english dub however was not perfect, don't get me wrong its not bad by any stretch of the imagination it just dosen't compare at least not for me anyway. The casting is quite stereotypical and while there are some stand outs like Cassandra Lee as Kyubey most of the girls sound too girly and typical of the genre for such a dark story. If they had cast more natural sounding voices it would have worked so much better in my opinion as many of the emotional scenes just don't work as well in the dub.\nSound-8/10 but only due to mediocre dub without it music alone gets 10/10\nEnjoyment-This is a hard one to discuss as my enjoyment of a series very much relies on the above categories. Enjoyment in this series is tied mainly to how emotionally gripping it is, due to this I had to limit myself to 1 episode day on first watch because of how intense each episode is. I enjoyed it on the basis that I wanted to see what was going to happen to these characters and how such desperate situations were going to turn out in the end, I would be legimately suprised if anyone was able to drop this series mid way through due to all the twists it throws at you that just coaxes you to go one layer further into the story. Overall watching Madoka magica was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and was riveting, engaging and heart-wrenching from episode 1 to 12.\nEnjoyment-10/10\nOverall verdict-\n+ Well written, complex plot, unique and beautiul art style, fantastic and fitting music, a thoroughly engaging watch\n-Mediocre dub, some may be put off by character designs\nFinal score-9.1\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="\n                          \n    Every action has an equal and opposite reaction - Isaac Newton\nI don't like Magical Girl anime and while I like the idea of deconstructing a genre I find that most deconstructions spend more time trying to throw ideas at a wall and hope they stick instead of breaking apart the genre. So what makes Madoka Magica so good? Simple, the execution.\nMadoka Magica takes pretty much every stereotype the Magical Girl genre has and brakes it apart to see how it works. Why is this stuffed animal trying to give us superpowers? What are Magical Girls? What are the psychological effects on a little girl who\n          \n        has to fight evil? All these and more are drawn out in great detail over the course of the 12 episodes.\nWhile I do like all the characters I don't really consider them to be in any way the focus of the show. They all play a role in telling the story but if they were replaced with a completely different type of character I doubt it would hurt the show at all. Ask yourself; if you were to slap purple hair on Sakura and make her all sweet and nice do you think that would change the show even a little bit? in my option no.\nThe art style and animation are both great in almost every episode the only exception being episode 9 when Madoka is sitting on her bed talking to Kyuubey. \nWhile I typically hate moe-ish character designs and think it is a lazy way for animators to draw the same characters over and over in different colors I feel it works to Modoka Magica's advantage since the show in a nut shell is breaking down a children's cartoon. Art from a show like Mushishi or a movie like Redline (while technically better in every way) would warp the tone of the show and lessen the impact of the story.\nThe backgrounds on the Dub version are so detailed and clear so even when the characters are just talking there always seems to be some form of motion or eye catching event going on and doesn't seem to cut any corners (other than the bedroom scene in episode 9). I just love the chaotic art style used in the labyrinths and the shading colors that the show uses to give such a dark vibe to the cutesy little world of Madoka Magica.\nThe score also adds to the tone of the show, turning the art direction from \"dawww how cute\" to the shit that fuels nightmares without feeling like it is jumping all over the place.\nMadoka Magica is the perfect example of how to deconstruct a genre the right way. Couldn't recommend this show enough.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=10,   ["text"]="                          \n    Honestly speaking, I have to say I'm very impressed with how this show went about. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica started off a slightly slow, uninteresting note, but it just continuously kept building up on top of it's previous episodes, culminating in some breathtaking scenes in the final few episodes of the series. There are a ton of things this series does right, but it does have it's fair share of flaws too. However, the flaws don't really hurt the show as a whole, and it ends up as a great watch that always perks your interest and gets you speculating. Considering it was Shaft behind\n          \n        this series, I was very wary of this being a hit or miss series initially; obvious it turned out much more of a \"hit\" than a \"miss\". And who in hell would have thought that a Magical Girl series could be this dark and chaotic.\nWhat is nice here is the actual production values for the series. The animation is solid, and the art is really out there; the crazy Shinbo style witches really adds a unique flair to the atmosphere of this series, and does add a touch of that \"bizarre, crazy\" feeling that works so well here. There are the odd quirks to Shinbo's animation style all over the place here, but if you could get over all of that, the artwork was surprisingly fitting for this series. The Hidamari sketch-styled character designs did feel a bit awkward at first, but after a few episodes it's rather easy to adjust to. The music to this series was just as good, with Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack here doing a great job at complementing some of the haunting scenes. I'll admit that it's not her best work, but some of the music adds much more depth to certain scenes here. The music also contributes greatly to the overall atmosphere, and I have to say, the music and animation fits the darker-toned story itself very well.\nThe story itself does have it's flaws here and there, with a select few pacing issues early on. That pretty much got ironed out by the third or fourth episode, though, and the story just kept piling on the intrigue from there onwards. What was Kyuubey? What were the witches? What is Walpurgis nacht? All the questions that this show kept prompting, in combination with some stunningly haunting scenes and moments, created a compelling plot that was worth following through until the end. The mysteries here all kept the series gripping, always managing to perk curiosity. The finale, in all it's grandiosity, was truly unique and unexpected. The scale at which it happens, and the huge implications of it all, was a pretty epic, bittersweet,  yet satisfying finale. Of course, the finale does feel too \"convenient\" and \"happily ever after\" in some ways, but I personally feel it is a fitting way to end such a depressing series with a bit of hope.\nNow the biggest contributor here, yet also the biggest flaw, would be the characters. There were some pretty well fleshed out characters, such as Kyoko, and Sayaka, but there were also some rather odd twists to some of the cast. For one, while Akemi Homura was indeed one of my favorite characters here, the extremely sudden change in character around episode 9-10 felt very out of place. Yes, I do understand there are good reasons behind why she suddenly changed in personality (or perhaps the better description would be she stopped hiding her real personality), but her sudden change from stoic, cool-headed Akemi to \"Madoka, Madoka!\" crying Akemi was a huge shift that could have been transitioned into a bit better. What was lacking here was a sense of character development for the two main characters to this series, Akemi and Madoka, whereas Kyoko and Sayaka got much more development as characters. Don't confuse character development with likability here; Akemi and Madoka both turned out to be very memorable characters, it's just that they don't get much of their character development until literally the last two or three episodes.\n\nThe big thing that must be noted here is that Kyuubei has to be one of the best villains we have seen in a long time. The way in which his intentions were slowly, but surely, revealed to Madoka and the others just heightened the tremendous impact his presence had in this show. For an evil white furball, Kyuubei was probably the most interesting, attention-captivating character in the entire series. Without his presence, the plot would have probably lost much of it's compelling aspect, so I do have to give credit where credit it due.\n\nAll in all, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica redefines the entire magical girl genre in many ways; it took the stereotypical \"girls get magical powers\" idea, and twists it into a compelling, dark plot that captivated audiences all over the world. It introduces the idea that not all magical girl shows need to be happy, sugary affairs. And in the end, this series introduces a breathtakingly original, very gripping human tale.\nAnimation/Art: 9.0/10\nMusic: 8.5/10\nCharacters: 9.0/10\nStory/setting: 8.5/10\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.8/10\n        "},

This is nothing like that, this show strives to show dark side of being a magical girl. \nEach character is unique and has it's story for becoming a magical girl, involving either tragedy, love or personal interest. \nIs this for kids, or teenagers? I do not think so, this show is very hard to comprehend even for an adult. It is based and makes reference to Faust, Hans Christian Andersen tales and it also has Buddhist/Christian\n          \n        references as well. \nThe references are masterfully hidden in the show, in the witch barriers, in the characters themselves.  The best way to see the show is to watch an episode, read the forum here related to the episode and then re-watch it to understand exactly what you saw. I would also recommend you watch the dubbed version, I found it pretty good, the subbed it hard to follow since there is quite a lot of meaningful dialogue which makes it hard to follow and watch the art unfolding on the screen. \nNow coming to the art ant animation, this is where the show could have been made awesome.  Probably the budget was low and they did not expect it to be a success, therefore many scenes are \"rushed\", the frames do not stay on the screen long enough for you to take a look at everything presented there. Also the art in the witch scenes is full of symbols related to the witches life and to why it became a witch but the scene being rushed you don't have time to visualize everything (it's like I show you a Picasso for 3sec then you should understand everything there). A great example and it might be a spoiler here, in one of the scenes a ballistic missile has \"SHAFT\" written on it (the name of the studio), however it's shown so fast that you do not see it, I only found out about it by reading the forum and re-watching the scene.\nThat's why I recommend to watch it, read about it, re-watch again.\nThe music in the show (Yuki Kajura) is just amazing and it's well synchronized with the scenes depicted. \nThis show is amazing, it will definitely play with your mind, emotions and the way you see anime in general. If only we had more shows like this. What a masterpiece this is. \n"},

I once found it in a YouTube video and decided to check it out, as it's praised to be \"dark\" and \"more unique\" and other Magical Girl animes out there. I really throught that there is another \"typical\" magical girl coming, but it didn't stopped me of watching this. And after Episode 3, the \"oh-so-cute\" mask of the anime fell down to show it's dark and true nature. \n\n- STORY - \nThe story follows a 14 year old student named Madoka Kaname, which is your typical cute protagonist. Pink hairs, pink eyes and always\n          \n        kind and friendly. Nothing in her life was wrong. She had her friends and everything was good. But all that changed as her and her friend Sayaka Miki saved a white-cat like creature named Kyubey from a black-haired girl, which also entered Madoka's and Sayaka's school as new student. Thanks to that, Kyubey offers the both to get a wish fulfilled - it doesn't matter which one - but in return, they become magical girls and will be dutied to fight against creatures named witches. What sounds like a alright-deal, turns into a nightmare. From Episode 3 on, everything gets darker. But I won't go much into it, because I don't want to spoiler.\n\n- CHARACTERS - \nMadoka Magica has a small amount of characters, but therefore a lot of character development. We get to see the pasts of those characters and the reason for their actions and such. Their storys gets to points where you didn't really expect those to go.\n\n- ART AND MUSIC - \nMadoka Magica is from the studio \"Shaft\", which also did other good animes. The art is unqiue from other magical girl animes. It's kinda strange, but you get used to it after a while. The music is also good. Every track fits perfectly to the scene where it plays, might it be a witch battle or a past of an character. It's opening, \"Connect\" is your typical upbeat magical girl opening. Really happy and nice. It's first ending still tries to keep the typical atmosphere of a magical girl anime. But beginning with Episode 3, the ending turns to Magia, which is the real ending, which shows that Madoka Magica is dark, darker than you could expect. The music is very good.\n\n- MY OPINION -\nMadoka Magica is awesome. It's unique from other magical girl animes. If you think this one is cute, you are really wrong. The character development is very well made, the story is full of plot-twists and heartwarming moments, rounded up with a really good ending and both Art and Music is really well made. This anime will give you a different look to the genre. You shouldn't judge anything too early, since Madoka Magica will take you on a ride of hope, friendship and despair alike. It's worth to check out. 10/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    This is my absolute all-time favorite anime, and I find it extremely hard to believe that anything could ever top it for me. It holds a very special place in my heart, and I cannot possibly praise it enough.\nStory - 10\nThe level of believability, tragedy, and logic that this universe presents is astounding. The plot twists are shocking, heart-wrenching, and well-placed. 12 episodes seems to be too short of a time frame to deliver this drama, but the pacing is, in my opinion, perfect. The story will take you on a roller-coaster ride. And the ending... no words can possibly describe how much that ending\n          \n        meant to me. The scale of it, the way it wraps everything up in the neatest bow you could find, the hope that it gave to me. I bawled for the entirety of the last episode, and couldn’t be less ashamed. It’s a perfect ending. Perfect is near impossible in fiction, but in my eyes, Madoka reaches that level. Not only did the story throw my emotions around like a chew toy, I believe that it gave me hope in reality as well. This show changed my life, and I cannot give it anything less than the highest respect.\nCharacters - 10\nThis is one place where I’ve seen some criticism of the show, but I disagree with those people. The development of the characters and their ideals is never forced or unnatural, and there is a layer of nuance to their characteristics that many don’t see. Some people think Madoka is a bland goody-two-shoes crybaby, but that’s far from the truth. Madoka is a pure, sweet girl with low self-esteem, who is thrown into a situation that brings nothing but misfortune to herself and the people she cares about most. If you think she’s a coward because she cries so much, you clearly aren’t paying attention to what this poor girl is going through. The change in Homura from a mysterious anti-hero to a broken-hearted time traveller is interesting at the beginning, but by the end, you realise that she was the hero all along, as well as the girl she loves. Sayaka’s downfall is painful in the best way possible, and, in my opinion, the most tragic character arc in the show, though she has competition. Seeing her smiling and laughing at the start when you’re rewatching is equally difficult. Kyōko was my favorite character the first time through, and I still love her. I ship her and Sayaka so hard, but not in the lewd fanfiction way - their relationship and their song (more on that later) is that of two people who are meant to be, but not allowed to by fate. Mami is a favorite of some people, though she isn’t in the show long, and I never adored her but still respect the dimension she has even being alive for three episodes. Madoka never forgot her, and the memory of Mami lives on in the hearts of the characters. Kyuubey is a complicated villain in that he actually has a damn good point. He doesn’t die or have his plans defeated - a sort of compromise is made. I could argue Kyuubey’s side of the story and have plenty of evidence to support it. That genuinely complicated morality is quite thought-provoking. I adore some of this show’s characters, but they’re all great.\nAnimation and Music - 10\nMadoka Magica is gorgeous. Even the regular style of the series is unique in its ironically explicit moe nature. The action is great when it comes around, too. But the real star of the show is the witch labyrinths. They are nothing short of trippily beautiful, if rather disturbing at times. The soundtrack is my favorite of any anime that I’ve seen thus far, and I’ve heard good ones. Yuki Kajiura perfectly captures the emotion of what’s happening with stunning grace. Decretum nearly brings me to tears, Sis Puella Magica! is an amazing main theme, Numquam Vincar, Surgam Identidem and Nux Walpurgis are epic, and Sagitta Luminis is... beyond words. The whole OST is pure gold. All hail Kajiura-sama.\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\nI knew all the twists before I saw the show. That didn’t stop me from feeling, and crying like a little baby over the ending. If you can, go in blind, as your experience will likely be optimized. This show is spectacular and thoroughly engaging. I couldn’t put it down.\nOverall - 10\nIt’s impossible to explain how much this anime means to me. It may be my favorite piece of fiction ever. Puella Magi Madoka Magica hold such a special place in my heart, and is my absolute favorite anime of all time. You NEED to watch this show. This is what anime is capable of, and it would be a crime to miss it.\n        "},

When I looked at the promotional poster (I'm not sure if that what it is called, but I'm pertaining to the picture above alternative titles.), I expected the story would be all about 5 cute girls slaying dark monsters and doing cute stuff with their pet Kyubey. Ladies and gentleman, when I finished the anime, I heard Kyubey's voice whispering to me, \"It does not how it works, you sh*t.\"\nYou can't blame me though, when you hear the words, \"magic\" and \"girls\", they are compatible enough for you\n          \n        to think that they are related to some sort of fairies, always being happy and doing funny stuff when you say it together. Well, it really doesn't work like that. To be honest, it exceeded my expectations of a viewer myself.\nI admire this anime because of how they presented the story.\nLook, it started with Madoka's slice of life moments, hanging out with friends and other sort of fun stuff of a cute happy girl would normally do. Then Kyubey comes saying, \"Hey imma grant yo wish but you will be powerful and you need to fight witches.\" which is the contract needed to be fulfilled in order to be a cute magical girl. Well, at first, you will think it's a win-to-win situation since you have your wish granted and you will be powerful as well. You won't mind the dangers after seeing Mami-san's power in defeating witches as she demonstrates it Madoka and Sayaka, which makes you think that you're damn powerful than the witches. So in that kind of storyline and mindset while watching the anime, what will make you curious is what are they going to wish for. In the first episodes, they even have a cute ending song. One moment changed the mood of the anime, Mami just freakin' died like \"whut?\".\nIn that scene itself, many emotions can be felt. One is the sadness of losing your magic girl senpai and the fear of being vulnerable even having that awesome powers. That thought already changed the mood of the story. The anime focused on what are the troubles of being a magic girl. The revelations of being a magic girl grew from the fact you can't avoid risking your lives in slaying witches to know that you are no longer a person to the fact that you are life ends being a disaster itself. With those revelations, the art of being able to present the story from giving false assumptions what the anime is all about to slowly giving realizations found by the characters themselves. Then there's Akemi. One episode dedicated to her made the story itself. You will realize that there's something big about to happen. The slow buildup of the story actually made me kind of disappointed. The story ended is just too great for a sacrifice that can't even hold of my feels anymore.\nIf there are downsides of the anime, well most of it are more on personal necessities like \"what could've have done\" things. Like the characters of Hitomi and Kyousuke. I felt like Kyousuke just apologized to Sayaka since he regained his control to his hand and how Hitomi brings up the matter on how he likes Kyousuke and some sort like it came out of nowhere. Well, I told you it's more on personal reasons why I hate that scenes and if it doesn't go in your perspective, I need to apologize for that.\n\"If you ever feel like dying for the universe, just call me.\" - Kyubey.\nFor those people who watched this anime, I know how you feel. This anime is just too damn good. \n        "},

How good can that be !?\nThe story is the main feature. My prejudice only strengthened it. The start was seemingly slow, and confusing. I was convinced that after one simple unveil (power explanation), I will be able to just predict the rest of the series. Well, this point came around 6. or 7. episode (need_check)... And I played myself. Fooling myself never felt so good.    Rest of the story totally exceeded all my imaginations and expectations. It was emotional, and it was rational. Combination\n          \n        that ,I thought, could never be done so well. It was very captivating, immersive and originality of the story made it very satisfactory to watch , and to finish (I am so happy that ending was not just some cliche \"and all lived happily ever after\"). Combining emotions, rationality and story that is remarkable and actually makes sense, sprinkled with light cogitation about being human(, humanity, greater good ...) is what pleasantly surprised me. Big part of this are complex characters that actually felt like humans. The art was funky in some parts, but somehow, it felt appropriate, it has no positive nor negative effect on me. Besides great story and characters, what really catches my attention was \"battle song\" which is in my playlist now. \nI believe you should give 10/10 only to thing that managed to do something that you thought was impossible. And for me, that is a magick girls anime that was so perfectly crafted, that the few semi nude scene that were in it (to prove the point, I presume) felt innocent and nonpervy.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    \"Whenever we pray for somebody's happiness, someone else must be cursed in exchanged.\" - Sayaka Miki\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (Madoka Magica for short), is a psychological thriller, drama, and magic genre that made it's debut in early January of 2011. Since the time of it's release, the show has received a lot of praise and high scoring reviews over how much this show changed the magical girl subgenre. Madoka Magica is not your typical lighthearted magic anime, it delivers a deep and more darker message and portrays situations that the character's are in maturely to it's audience. With such a show that's cause widespread critical\n          \n        acclaim, is it worth the hype it deserves? Let's find out. \n\nStory: 9/10\nWhenever I think of the phrase \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" now, Madoka Magica is the first thing that pops into my head. Gen Urobuchi wants you to be fooled by the cute and lighthearted image, opening theme, and first 2 episodes. In truth, this is a much more darker and deeper story than any other magical girl genre has ever produced.\nIn its first two episodes of Madoka Magica, two cute and young girls, Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki, run into a cat-like magical creature named Kyuubey in a shopping mall. Kyuubey then offers them a contract: he will grant any wish they desire. In exchange however, they will gain 'magical girl powers' and fight witches, who are natural and phenomenon forces of evil of unknown origin. After the first 2 episodes and end of episode 3, Madoka Magica evolves from an lighthearted story to a much more dramatic plot that explores the girls' relationships, despairs, and the price they must pay for fulfilling their wishes.\nThe main overall themes the anime explores, the build and set-up on the cold and dark truth of the Magical Girls, the sinister tone and dark themes it uses to portray the audiences interest and keep the show from dragging on, the immersive plot and overall picture makes Madoka Magica's story very unique, interesting, easy to follow, and enjoyable to a more mature audience who appreciates these kinds of themes. \n\nArt: 8/10\nThe artwork done in Madoka Magica is very well done in doing both the lighthearted aspects of the film (character models, magical girls outfits, Kyuubey, etc), as well as the dark themes and sinister witch designs. The scenery and futuristic artwork of the school Madoka attends, the skyscrapers, landscapes, and environment surrounding the show is done in a very well mannered way. The character models, while first looking at them, may not be as attractive as to the design 6 years later, still holds up nicely if you take the time to get used to it. \nThe artwork done with the witches and their dimensions, or labyrinths, is really what sticks out. The concept is very unique in making the witches and surrounding areas stick out from most of the current artwork in the film outside the labyrinths. They looked mysterious, Coraline like, which I really appreciated a lot.\nOverall, the artwork is definitely not for everyone. Some may find the character models to look funny and or goofy, and some might not be a fan of how the witches and their labyrinths are designed. Personally, I enjoyed it a lot and it holds up the dark tone the show gives at times.\n\nSound: 10/10\nThe sound in Madoka Magica is outstanding and shines the brightest in the mood the show wants you to feel and interact with. The opening theme for the show is one of my all time favorites, the singing and music in it is very well choreographed. Once again, it tricks the viewers who are watching to think of the show as a cute lighthearted series, when it's in fact the exact opposite.\nThe end theme after the third episode is probably the best soundtrack that comes into play. Kalafina's track 'Magia' sets the atmosphere as being a creepy and dark track to invoke the audiences shock of the drastic change the show undergoes. I found myself humming to both the opening and ending themes a lot and still am as I write this.\nOverall, the sounds, music, OSTs, and opening/ending themes are a masterpiece that really helps set the score high for Madoka Magica. I enjoyed every minute of the music and never skipped the opening and ending themes.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nThe biggest drive and success that I found while watching Madoka Magica was how the characters really stuck out and all felt important in the show. The characters throughout the show go through very meaningful and enjoyable character development, especially with Madoka Kaname and Homura Akemi, the girl Madoka was dreaming about in the first scene of the show. I felt an emotional attachment and deeper understanding for the character's motives, goals, and feelings throughout the show.\nMadoka Kaname sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, always doubting herself and what she's capable of. After seeing Mami Tomoe, another Magical girl who she befriends, fighting against witches, she now wants to be a wonderful and cool Puella Magi like her. Madoka always cares about others and puts them first before herself. A very lovable main protagonist who people can relate to.\nHomura Akemi is my favorite character in the show. She's a mysterious girl that Madoka dreamt of in the first episode. After transferring to Madoka's school, he seems to know Madoka well and has a constant goal to prevent her from becoming a magical girl. Her motives are unclear in the beginning, but as the show progresses, you learn the truth about Homura and why she has such a big and important role in Madoka Magica. She's also, in my opinion, one of the rare well done Kuundere girls out there.\nThe other main characters: Sayaka Miki, Mami Tomoe, Kyouko Sakura, and Kyuudey, all play a very critical and important role in Madoka's life and the overall story. Each having their own motives and agendas. The cast is short, but has a big impact on the viewer, as the show constantly has character development happening in each episode. The characters are what drove the show in the right direction with a strong story-line to follow. \n\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nMy initial take on Madoka Magica was very different from how I feel now about the show. I was one of the many fooled ones who thought this show would be lighthearted and cute. Boy, I was in for an amazing experience. Almost every single aspect of the show stood out and made an impact on how I felt after each episode was concluded. I loved the themes Madoka Magica used to portray the plot and suspense, I loved (to a certain degree) the art design and aspects of how the witches were designed, the sound and characters were flawless and easily a perfect score for me. \n\nOverall: 9.2/10 (9)\nMadoka Magica is one of my many gems that I'm glad I took a chance on and watched. It's definitely left an impact on me and I truly found everything to be better than average. You can forget about any kind of fan service, stupid story plot-holes, bland characters, and being bored. \nIf there was one thing I would criticize about the show, is how some of the supporting characters didn't have too big of an impact with how the show played, as well as some of the design choices with the artwork in certain aspects. These unfortunately stop me from giving it a 10/10 rating.\nIf Madoka Magica taught me one thing, it's how a wish you make can really impact someones and your own life, for better or for worse. I enjoyed this anime a lot and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan with a darker, yet lovable approach to shows like Madoka Magica.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has everything it needs to be considered a \"masterpiece\". Deconstruction? You've got it! Badass action scenes? You've got it! Philosophy? You've got it! Experimental art? You've got it! Plot twists? You've got it! Realistic characters that have great chemistry between them? You've got it! Drama? You've got it! Waifu material? You've got it! Time travel? You've got it! Horror? You've got it! SHAFT? I'm in complete heaven. You've got it all right. So, further ado, let's get started!\nStory: 10\nThe story is a genre bend, so the concept is a bit dark when you think about it. The concept of Madoka Magica\n          \n        is that magical girls fight witches, but only having the fate of turning into one in the end. This is the main idea of the story. It causes many plot twists and story opportunities!\nIn Madoka Magica, each episode it leaves you with questions that all have answers. These answers are full of plot twists for the explanations of why things the way they are. The characters are the ones who execute them perfectly. This is what makes this anime so hooking. It's such a magnificent story. Especially considering it's not based of another material. \nNow, what are the plot twist formulas like? It's like this: you assume that a certain character is horrible, or useless. Then, a plot twist comes along to give the character purpose, and likeability. It moves the story along to even more plot twists and turns. (Skip the rest of this paragraph section if you have never seen Madoka Magica) The first plot twist is when Madoka keeps on being persuaded into a magical girl from a magical girl named Mami. It sounds all good and fluffy until Madoka sees the real deal. But still, she's interested. However, Sayaka Madoka's friend, ends up becoming one. Madoka choses to go with Sayaka on her journies of fighting witches. Over time, she discovers more and more about other magical girls and the concept of being one! See! The first plot twist leads to many other plot twists in the series along Madoka's journey. In the story, Madoka is more of an observer when it comes to the story. She's like a reactor to all events in the story so the creators of this show so the plot twists can happen.\n\n\nArt: 9\nThe art is very experimental. Especially with the fight scenes! It's a great contrast to the shiny characters since the witches are very tinted. The fight scenes are also very awesome because who doesn't like moe magical girls fighting enemies as if they are shounen characters? However, the flaws I've had is that the TV edition had poor backgrounds, and the shining was horrible. But the flaw that got me the most is that the characters are a bit of a copy and paste. But still, the witches were extremely experimentally designed.\nSound: 10\nEverything about the music is beautiful. Dramatic orchestra music is often played during fight scenes! Not only that, but the OP and ED were both catchy. Especially the ED, Magia. \nCharacter: 10\nAll the characters play a major role in the story! Every character has a purpose. But why? Let's find out!\nMadoka: \nMadoka is the reason why all these events occur. In reality, it's all for her. All the characters to all these things to prevent her from becoming a witch since if you are a powerful magical girl, you'll become a powerful witch. So, she causes all the drama and story. You might think that her mundane personality is a flaw. However, I beg to differ. I think it simply just works!\nIf she were to have a genuine personality, it would cause a butterfly effect in the story. This will make it not as good. I'd say she's more of a useful object.\nSayaka: \nSayaka adds extra drama to make the magical girls to go into conflict because if she remains selfless, she'll eventually die quickly. So, the magical girls start fighting.\nHomura:\nHomura is the girl trying to protect Madoka from becoming a magical girl. At first, she seems as an asshole. However, she plays a major role in the end once the majority of the other characters are eliminated through becoming witches. Homura causes the conclusion.\nKyoko: \nThis horribly bratty girl also causes conflict in the story! She's like Sayaka, but leaves a different effect on the other characters.\nMami: \nShe's the one who pulled Madoka and Sayaka into the situation in the first place.\nEnjoyment: 10\nThis show is very entertaining due to all the drama and plot twists!\nOverall: 10\nIn conclusion, Madoka Magica is perfect.\n"},

I believe it wasn't an anime that was meant for the \"magical girl\" genre fanatic, but for the anime fans who love crazy visuals and stories with dark twists. \"\nThat said, i'm not meaning that magical girl genre viewers would not like it, but if you watch it expecting to follow the canonical way in which that genre is\n          \n        constructed, you will be really disappointed. \nMadoka's real plot is disguised as a Magical Girl series in their exterior, when in reality is more closed to the psychological thriller genre. I actually suggest people not to read about this series before watching it, as it is much more rewarding if you watch it without knowing what to expect... the series is full of dark unexpected plot twist in most episodes, and spoiling them makes you loose half of the experience.\n  I can't promise you will like it, because, as i said, you have a love/hate thing going on in here, but i can promise enjoyment and a bunch of surprises. \nThat said, there's ONE thing that all viewers agree in: The visuals are AMAZING, original, they blow your mind. And the animation sequences are really fluid, and if you are an animation fanatic you will get really excited. \n"},

Other than that it was a solid anime, I suppose. Also the first one I completed on one sitting. At least it was that interesting.\nStory was okay good but was getting more and more complicated towards later episodes. It started to even cause paradoxes if you didn't get the point of the plot which started to seem like it was cheating. But the first half was really nice, actually. It was simple enough and gave a nice reason for characters to act so.\nArts, as\n          \n        usual, was really nice for me because it just has to be a cartoon to guarantee a 9. It still seemed to be low-budged due to looking much like hand drawn at times but I didn't mind it. Just a small details some people might pay attention to. Music was surprisingly good because I immediately started to nod with the rhythm. It's something I don't do often. Also I found it very fitting for multiple occasions.\nCharacters were nice overall. Some of them, however, were not always explainable and had some gimmicks or weird moments even that just didn't seem to fit them too well, whether to not explain it or not fitting their character. \nEnjoyment was mediocre. I first started to like it but it started to get more and more complicated, as stated before. I might have been too drunk watching this but that's what I felt like. Either way there was too much plot stuff and weird turns and things in it to not like it too much. I wished there was more humor in the series because it would have greatly balanced out the sadder parts.\nOverall, it was a solid anime but I was expecting a lot more from it due to recommendations. Still I didn't cry and didn't find it too sad to be honest. It's just slightly confusing anime that you might like if you like complicated plots and sensitive girls.\nAlso I wasn't supposed to write this long review.\n        "},

This show is intense, sad, and best of all misleading. It starts out making you think that it's your average schoolgirl magic. It takes you that way until turns out to be a drama action, thus folds itself into a haunting psychological thriller. This goes into the deepest depths of regret, dreams, hope and despair. It is gorgeous!\nStory 10/10 \nIt seemed cliche at first, but when I got to the deeper parts of the series, it all made sense to me. From my point of view, it was\n          \n        all successfully put together.\n\nArt 9/10 It worked well enough with the story for it to be great. It completely lacks fanservice and looks good with the nightmarish tone of the series. I respect it a lot.\n\nSound 10/10 I have so much to say about the heavenly tone and melodies by Yuki Kajiura.

I can't say exactly why but, the emotion it builds up in me everytime makes it so enjoyable. \nOverall 10/10 Funny how there was no part of it I disliked. I nearly cried from sadness, then joy.

Generally speaking, magical girl anime is seen as being more light-hearted and full of friendship. Madoka Magica tip-toes along those lines but then goes into darker territory and does not return.\nOne of my favorite parts of this anime is the animation that occurs during the various labyrinth scenes. It is quite unique to anime to have the labyrinths animated in such a style. I enjoyed it because it was refreshingly different and new, while being slightly disturbing at times.\nI\n          \n        have rewritten this review several times due to my feelings about Madoka Magica. The last couple of episodes flew by because of how amazing they were. After the last episode ended, I found myself simply staring at the screen, trying to process everything that had just happened.\nI did not like Magical Girl anime before Madoka Magica. Great story, great characters, happiness, despair, it's got it all!\nYou might enjoy this if: You want a dark fantasy version of magical girls. In addition, if you are not a fan of magical girl anime but you enjoy the psychological horror genre, check out Madoka Magica.\nYou might not like it if: You hate having your heart torn apart by a blender of emotion.\nNote to the Viewer: I have said it once and I will say it again, the labyrinth scenes are something else.\nEXPANDED REVIEW: \nThere was a lot of positive comments stated about Madoka Magica. Several people enjoyed the animation style, and especially the style during the labyrinth sequences. There was a lot of positive comments regarding the story towards the end of the season. It seemed to the group that the season was split up into two separate mini-seasons. A few group members enjoyed the first mini-season while the majority of the group enjoyed the second mini-season, from episode 8 on. Most of the group had not watched a lot of magical girl anime before Madoka Magica, but it was agreed that this anime is a good magical girl show to watch. An interesting point that was brought up was how the glyphs shown on the show were part of an actual language that was made up for the show. This was one of many aspects that showed the depth of the story. The story was light-hearted at times, but developed into something dark, twisted, and psychological by the end.\nThere were also negative comments about the show. Some group members thought that the fight scenes were too short. A great comment brought up was that instead of a fight buildup, there was emotional buildup before the fight, and then the actual fight would conclude too quickly. There were mixed feelings about some aspects of the show. This included the emotional aspect of the anime. Some people thought it was well done, others thought it was too much or it was boring. There was a lot of emotional moments at the end of the anime when Madoka makes her wish.\nThe last thoughts from SLC Anime on Madoka Magica were regarding Kyubey. It was this mysterious creature that was very convincing towards the girls. The main questions that were discussed were: 1- Would you be convinced to become a magical girl by Kyubey, and 2- What would you wish for?\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Anyone that says this anime isn't a masterpiece is full of shit, plain and simple. \nNever has an anime been so thought provoking, so realistic in depiction of characters, so questioning of morals. I loved every single aspect of the anime; every character, every little story, the soundtrack.... there is nothing I can think of that I didn't like about this anime. Everything was utterly fantastic. I loved this anime so much so that when I saw bullshit reviews, I had to create an account just to call them out on their bullshittery. \nFirst, my review---\nThe art-gorgeous. The alternate universes look exactly like what I\n          \n        think \"another world in the human world\" would look like, if such a thing existed. The music- fantastic. Without bias, I would still say the series has some of the best OSTs out there. And not just one, but a large number of them are REALLY good. It's almost mind-boggling how one anime can have so much great music. \nThe characters in this anime were pure gold. They were some of the most realistic depictions of people in any anime. To put it simply, the characters acted like normal human beings the entire way throughout the anime. For example, the main 2 characters, upon hearing that they can become Mahou Shoujo and save innocents from invisible monsters, DON'T jump on the chance to save innocents. Instead, they think about what sacrificing their normal life would mean to them, the dangers of fighting such monsters, etc. Some people didn't like this, as the characters were \"uncharismatic\" or even \"bland\". Well, they're two regular high school girls. Wtf did you expect. \nBut this doesn't mean they're boring. Watching how they react to different extremely morally ambiguous questions are entertaining to say the least, and watching their answers play out is also great.\nDeconstructing the mahou shoujo genre- in the genre, to put it simply, girls are given magical powers to combat the forced of evil. This anime does a great job at deconstructing such a genre, delving into such questions as, what happens if one of them dies? Is devoting your life thanklessly, to save innocent people really worth it? Overall, this anime deconstructs the established genre really well, exposing how unrealistic the genre in itself is. \nI've never seen an anime that posed so much moral dilemmas in only 12 episodes. To get the full effect of the anime, I wouldn't recommend watching the anime passively. Instead, I recommend taking an incredibly aggressive way of viewing it; when a choice is presented to a character, instead of just blankly staring at the screen, reflect on the question at hand. What would I do in their situation? What are the repercussions? Why would I do this? Usually, there are no \"right \" answers, so getting to an answer requires you to really examine yourself. It's sometimes a frightening experience to realize what you would most likely choose to do in incredibly stressful situations, but re-examining who \"you\" are is a very precious experience. \nNow onto some of the reasons why the anime was downvoted- bc only girls can be mahou shoujo , characters are non-charismatic and average, the pacing is horrendous, anime wasn't particularly gripping before episode 10, even the accusation that Madoka was designed to be a smash hit.\n1. Girls can only be Mahou Shoujo bc Mahou Shoujo translates to magical girl in japanese. Why can't a guy be a magical girl? Ridiculous question. \n2. Some people also thought it was a \"plot hole\" that only girl's sorrows are harvested, bc aren't girls and boys emotionally the same? Is the series saying that girls are more emotional than boys? That can't be true. Well, my response is, in that world, cats grant you wishes while harvesting your sorrow as you turn into monsters, and girls can pull 8 rifles out of their skirts. So maybe in that world girls are more emotional than boys. For god's sake, don't expect political (or biological) correctness in fucking anime. Seriously.\n3. Characters are non-charismatic- as I mentioned earlier, the best part about this series is how all these girls realistically react to anime elements. That's what makes this anime so \"realistic\" and thought provoking. Besides, there are no linear characters; all the characters go through change throughout the course of the story, and all have their own interesting background stories. In fact, Madoka changes incredibly throughout the story, changing from shy, timid, \"I'm not good at anything\" girl, to a very brave, and mature, respectable person. \n4. The pacing was beautiful- I can't even believe anyone would suggest otherwise. There were no filler episodes, every single mini-plot of the story contributed to the bigger picture, and there was always something very interesting going on, provided you weren't absent-mindedly staring at the screen. \n5. Madoka being designed to be a smash hit is possibly the most ridiculous accusation. Because it  can't be further from the truth. I'm not a anime director, but if a guy were to propose a story in which mahou shoujos face real life dilemmas, I would have probably have laughed in his face. There is no audience for such an anime to cater to- mahou shoujo fans wouldn't watch something so depressing, and people that like dark animes would much rather watch elfen lied or deathnote. So why was it so universally loved? \"Because everything about it was so very beautiful\" would be my answer. If the writers weren't so fantastic, this anime probably would have been a festering dump of an anime, pretty much a second School Days. In fact, with a plot catering to no particular audience, and the girliness pushing away all but the most experimental of viewers, it might have even been worse. I too only gave it a try bc one of my friends insisted it was the best thing he has ever watched. \nHonestly, this is by miles the best thing I have ever watched, or even read, in any medium. Immensely thought provoking, this anime really takes you for a dream-like ride, keeping you thoroughly entertained, as long as you really delve into the anime. Calling this anime a masterpiece isn't giving it enough praise- I wouldn't call this anime ABSOLUTELY perfect, but this, and the Steins;Gate opening are about as close to perfect as anything in this genre has gotten.\n        "},

Also, by the end of series, I noticed one or two...I guess plotholes you could call them, or just unclear story aspects that could have used some explaining from the show itself, other than speculative fans. One big example involving QB's ability to grant wishes, going by the show, he could do almost anything and grant ANY wish, and yet, it isn't till Madoka wishes for something specific that the world is saved or whatever. Is it a\n          \n        Genie type thing where he can only grant wishes when he makes a contract, can he do it just by will? If so, why didn't he magicallyDon't say it isn't magic, cause it is, some people have tried to convince me otherwise, in a magical girl show at that. save the universe himself...um, him...selves....whatever, you get my point.\nAll in all, I think it's alright, not bad at all really, but not particularly great either. So the constant praise by the fans, the outrageous popularity, constantly topping the popularity polls, on a lesser note, constant threads about it. I feel irked, as I don't see why it's so damn popular and praised so much when I feel it doesn't deserve THAT much attention and praise.\n - Recycled themes and elements from other shows: Godlike main character fixes everything at the end.\nTime travel plot is complete bullshit (a middle school girl wouldn't go through all that just to save a friend)\nAlready explained why the pacing is shit.\nAll the characters are stupid, unbelievable and vapid. None of their actions are believable or make sense blue girl is obsessed with that boy for what reason? That was a completely avoidable situation, but then they wouldn't have a character they could mind break!\nThere is no subtlety in the writing: \"HURRR I WENT HUNGRY SO NOW I EAT A LOT, GET IT? LOOK AT ME EATING IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE I AM FEATURED HURRR\"\nthe red haired girl was utterly worthless to the plot apart from being a shit character.\nForced drama I can't remember a single episode where Madoka or one of the other girls didn't cry or didn't drop their life philosophies on each other every other minute.\nThe \"sci fi\" element in this show is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen. The writers take a scientific concept that they have obviously not a single fucking clue how it actually works, and they force it into their magical girl animu. Entropy does not work that way, energy does not work that way, the idea that they have to take energy from pre-teen girls to save the universe is utterly ridiculous.\nDialog: \"waaahh im a zombi\"\nIn conclusion:\n1. Terrible animation\n2. Disappointing finale (especially the Walpurgis fight)\n3. Mado and Homu feel shallow and one-dimensional, the show would be much better if it focused on Sayaka and Kyouko (it IS much better in the Sayaka episodes)\n4. Plot is predictable as fuck, there is only one surprising thing about it:\n5. Entropy bullshit. Anime writers can't into science, so they should stop trying explaining stuff with science\n6. There's a bunch of incredibly cheesy, kitschy scenes that really ruin the mood. Sayaka's boyfriend concert on the rooftop, etc. - soap opera tier directing.\n7. The soundtrack is pretty good though.\nAnd I don't even think the whole show is bad, it's actually pretty decent imo. Still, there's a fuckton of reasons to hate it. Though I still enjoyed it I give it a 8/10, I do hope the movies are better and make a better use of this death and despair mahou shoujo concept."},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Madoka Magia is a deceiving show. If you have only read the synposis and looked at the big happy picture on this MAL page, then you have to ask your brain to do a 180 degree turn. This show slowly becomes more depressing as you go, so enjoy Madoka's 10 minutes of a happy ordinary life. \nWelcome to a world, where witches exist to bring misfortune to people. They are unknown to normal humans, and it is up to the Mahou Shoujo to save the day. In exchange for risking their lives to fight these witches they are granted a single wish. Now normally plot\n          \n        shielding makes everything fine and dandy for our heroines. If we consider mahou shoujo at the pinnacle of happiness, by plunging this genre into the depths of darkness, well a slight hyperbole, Madoka Magia creates a bigger impact with its twists.\nOf course, these twists are half the show. However, the background of the truly mysterious characters like Homura and Kyuubey who are at each other's necks are very well done. Don't take the Mahou Shoujo lightly, as it also has its own secrets. Death is also a very influential part of this show making action scenes a battle for one's life for once in an anime.\nThe characters all at least have a average backstory. In truth, there are only a few characters that have a truly unique background. It is in the execution of the storytelling and its incorporation into the story that makes it acceptable. Madoka is a completely average girl who just wants to help others out. There really wasn't any other trick to her. Her best friend, Sayaka, is deeply in love with a violinist who injured his hands, and can never play again. Homura well… She makes sense in a way but her background is way out there. \nOf course background isn't everything, as they all have their own personality that plays a part in how they react to the story. By the end of every episode I was either excited, sad, amazed. Sometimes it was only because a cliffhanger after a text heavy episode. There are only 7 battles in the whole series a handful between rival Shoujo and the rest against the witches within their own lairs that look as if Willy Wonka did their interior decorating.\nMadoka Magi was a very enjoyable watch, and the story was one of the best I have seen in a while for a one season show. Although I was not pulled in by the first episode by the finale which blew my mind and space time apart I became a fan.

They aren't really fleshed out that much and are not as important as the plot. They could have been better. \nSound: (15/15) Go on Youtube and listen to the song \"Magia\" right now. That should tell you how good the sound is (The english\n          \n        cover is also very good too).\nAnimation: (14/15) All around great. The character designs fit this show to a T and the Witches are just stunning to look at. You will wish the whole show looked as good as when the Witches are on screen. \nOverall: (89/100) Watch it now. \nMadoka Magica is a fun little show about a bunch of magical girls fighting crime with their furry little friend and living happily ever after... Not. Don't let the first few episodes fool you, Madoka Magica isn't your normal magical girl show, as it is a lot more dark and serious than say, Sailor Moon. It is essentially a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, which means that it uses the same tropes or plot devices (cute girls fighting crime, a cute furry cat that gives them the power, etc.) but uses them in a totally different way and to get a different effect. One problem with this is that you have to have seen a magical girl show before to get the full effect, and if you are like me, you probably haven't seen many. The plot in this show is very good, and knows how to take its audience for a ride. (33/35)\nThe characters are the only letdown of the show. They aren't bad per say, but they aren't particularly memorable. Because the show is so short (12 episodes), they don't feel very fleshed out. The characters felt like they served their purpose and that was it, as if they weren't an important part of the show. Thankfully, the show didn't mess up the characters, they just didn't give them enough attention. Granted, they weren't as important as the story, but I think it could have done a better job in this area. (26/35)\nThe production values for this show are stunning. The score is done by the amazing Yuki Kajiura (also know for the .hack series, as well as Kara no Kyokai and Fate/Zero) and is one of her better works. The music is truly stunning, especially the ending song Magia, which is probably my favorite ending theme of all time. (15/15) The animation is also very good. Because it is a magical girl show, the character designs look like your stock magical girls, even though the show is much more dark. The best thing about the animation are the witches, which were animated just beautifully. Overall, I have seen better though. (14/15)\nNext to Steins;Gate, this is one of the best shows of 2011 (that I have seen). An amazing plot, with amazing production values. The characters could have been better, but I'd say they are adequate for the story and play their roles well. If you have time, watch this show ASAP, and if you don't have time, make time. Of course, try and watch at least one magical girl show before doing so. \n        "},

I didn’t bother to work up any more magical girl anime…..until 2012, when I keep hearing about Madoka Magica even though at that time, the show got an English dub (it aired in 2011 in Japan) and\n          \n        I heard a lot of praise for it, even doing the impossible of getting people not into the magical girl genre to watch it. Plus, knowing that Urobuchi and Akiyuki Shinbo, famed anime director of Negima!?, The SoulTaker, The Monogatari series and……(eep!) Dance in the Vampire Bund is helming this, it could go into a different direction that no one would ever suspect.\nAfter experiencing a bizarre dream, Madoka Kaname, a kind 14-year-old girl, encounters a magical creature named Kyubey. Madoka and her friend Sayaka Miki are offered the opportunity of gaining magical powers if they agree to make a contract with the strange little being. He will also grant them one wish, but in exchange they shall risk their lives by accepting the responsibility of fighting witches. Invisible to human eyes, witches are catalysts of despair in the areas they inhabit. An ally of Kyube, a magical girl named Mami Tomoe, befriends and encourages the two girls to accept the contract. For an unknown reason, another magical girl named Homura Akemi is determined to prevent Madoka from accepting the deal. \nWell, after watching all 12 episodes of the series and possibly once again upon doing the review and this needed to be said, this show absolutely, utterly, unknowingly……impressed the hell out of me. No, really. I think this show actually does a great job deconstructing the magical girl genre and while this can be a mindfuck of a show, it isn’t like Evangelion where it does deconstructs, it also self-construct with what they were going for and well….you’ve seen the final 2 episodes of that or End of Evangelion (which I haven’t….well, not yet)? Anyway, for the first few episodes, everything is basically like a magical girl anime and just when you least suspect it, the twists and turns come hitting at you. Also, in the show, it shows the basic tropes of what you see in any magical girl anime and shows that while it may seemed all good in the end, but really, it isn’t all sugar and rainbows and all that hunky-dory stuff, as in many moral implications and consequences that happen when you know eventually things will turn for the worse. So, in layman’s terms, I really dig the writing of the show and as a matter of fact, this show actually got me looking more into Urobuchi’s other material.\nFor characters, I really don’t have a favorite character per se, as I enjoy all the characters of the show even Kyōko, who actually was annoying when I first saw her but I actually got used to her. Also, despite Madoka being the title character of the show, it showcases every main character of the show just about right from Madoka to Mami to Sayaka to Homura, who is the interesting character of the show in my eyes as while the first impression of her may be underwhelming, she gets her chance to shine later in the show. Kyubey is practically the most infamous character on the show as that magical pet who grant the girls’ whatever wish they ask for and you think it would be helpful but……you know what, I said too much about the characters as it would cross into spoiler territory and I don’t do spoilers.\nThe animation team responsible for this production is SHAFT, which I did mention time-to-time that they did this show and the fact Shinbo does work with them on his shows and the art style of it was very unique and a bit weird (actually a whole lot of weird but SHAFT is definitely known for that kind of art) The city settings is futuristic, thinking that the time is further into the future than today and the main character designs are very moe style but then again, that is what they were going for; “breaking the cutie” and they certainly broke them a lot in here.\nYuki Kaijura may be one of my favorite anime composers (next to Yoko Kanno herself and few others) because the music in here is fantastic and befitting to what the show is. “Connect” by ClariS is the track that I listened to multiple times without even watching the show and it held up well, but possibly the most talked-about song is “Magia” by Kalafina as the song represent how dark and twisted the magical girl world can be and the show does use the song either as background music or the ending theme. There were two other ending songs used in the either first two episodes (\"See You Tomorrow\" by Aoi Yūki) and later in Episode 9 (\"And I'm Home\" by Eri Kitamura & Ai Nonaka) and while they were good (mostly the latter) but nothing that stand out.\nFor those who wonder what I think about the English dub, the one that Bang Zoom Entertainment did for Aniplex of America, and it is that this is actually a good dub. It’s not the Holy Grail of dubs, but its great enough for those who likes English dubs. I heard too many people saying the dub wasn’t that good or underwhelming to the Japanese but here’s the thing about that; if this would have been FUNi doing the dub, people would have praise it but I would find that highly predictable. I like that Bang Zoom got the dub because they make some interesting casting choices in their shows. For one thing, the standouts for me are Cassandra Lee as Kyubey and Cristina Vee as Homura as she brought out her emotional range during the last few episodes. I did like Christine Marie Cabanos as Madoka, although her range is limited here but I believe she can go farther with her role. Sarah Williams did fine as Sayaka, Lauren Landa as Kyōko was good, Carrie Keranen as Mami did sound a little too adult for her character but nothing too major and I would have never suspect Carrie Savage to play the mom as she is more calm and resolved in here than most of the dubs she’s been in (whether BZ, Funi, or any other).\nFINAL VERDICT: I would definitely recommend this show to anyone, at least, anyone who’s already into anime but not into magical girl anime. Watching this show got me hooked on to the characters, the story, and does what no other show of that genre (that I already watched and know of). It made me give a damn about it and it helps that it has no filler for being 12 episodes. Madoka is definitely a must-see for anyone into the medium.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="                          \n    Before I begin with the review I’d like to start with a disclaimer for all those who were told Mahou Shoujou Madoak Magica (MSMM) in anyway resembles that of Mirai Nikki, Death Note or any other anime with a dark nuance, while it is a dark take of the magical girl genre, it is just that, a take and for the resounding majority less a few key moments is a lighthearted magical girl anime comparable to that of Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura.\nI doubt that any fans of the aforementioned anime would be attracted to MSMM unless they are also fans of the magical girl\n          \n        genre however If this still sounds like a show you may be interested in there is a short spoiler-free review below.\nStory-\nThe story is an interesting interpretation of the classic magical girl genre, it combines both elements of consequence and realism to a genre that is generally devoid of both making MSMM a breath of fresh air in an otherwise cluttered category lacking variety.\nArt and Sound-\nThe art work in particular is especially brilliant, coupled with classical and tasteful modern music complementing the feel on the anime. While not a fan of the art used for the characters (especially facial expression) the backgrounds and environments were very well done.\nCharacters-\nThe characters have been hailed as the only let down to an otherwise superb anime and at times I agree that they lacked depth and variety however as they responded to the events of the series they grew as a result.\nOverall-\nMSMM is unfortunately a victim of its own success with the fact that is not a typical magical girl anime being common knowledge among fans which unfortunately takes away some of the fun and surprise of the initial twists MSMM is still very well received and popular and it is clear to see why."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka Magica is one of those animes that will be remembered as one of the greatest in the anime history, not only because of its amazing story and music but because it took its genre and gave a complete twist to it, just like Evangelion did with the mecha genre. I'm sure you will not regret watching this awesome series and you will be amazed at the awesome ending. This review will have minor spoilers!!\nStory 10/10:\nThe story starts with Madoka the main character, and her friend Sayaka living their normal lives at school.  Homura, a transfer student, is introduced to the class and starts\n          \n        to talk to Madoka and warns her that if someone tells her to change that she should ignore it and stay the way she is After school Madoka and Sayaka are trapped in a weird maze where they are saved by a magical girl named Mami who introduces them to a small white creature named Kyubey who was being chased by Homura. This creature tells Madoka and Sayaka that he will give them Mahou Shoujo powers and will concede them whatever wish they have, with the condition of fighting against witches in the city.\nAt first I thought it was the generic mahou shoujo for kids, with cute girls, cute dresses and magic powers, so I dropped it at the first episode because I have watched a lot of generic mahou shoujo's and was looking for something new. Oh how wrong I was, I started reading comments about how awesome this series was, so I watched it again, everything normal until around episode 4 where all the plot twists, suffering of the characters, and the true purpose of Kyubey start to happen, and you realize this anime is not for kids. The story combines current psychological problems of teens like jealousy, love, friendship, hate, family problems, death, with dark fantasy elements. The story is tragic, emotive, and will bring tears to your eyes. The story is a masterpiece and every episode is worth.\nArt 10/10:\nThe art of Madoka Magica is another of the aspects that make this anime awesome, at first you will find it weird, but that is what makes it awesome, because you will not find another anime with a similar art. The environments are the part of the art that I like the most, in some parts like the witch mazes the art suddenly changes into a weird environment with unique creatures, which at first may seem creepy but for me it was something new never seen before. The characters are kind of different from normal animes, the girls still have huge eyes but they are different compared to a lot of other animes, especially the body structure and the head...I suck at explaining art ._. \nSound 10/10:\nWhat made me love this anime more than everything was its amazing music, every song brings shivers down my spine because it reminds me of a sad or happy moment in the anime, every scene has a song that describes it perfectly and brings emotions to it. As for the opening ClariS made a great job with the op, it’s a really nice song that fits the theme of the anime perfectly, same with the ending. \nCharacters 8/10:\nThis is my only relatively low score, but it's mainly because the anime is only 12 episodes long and it mainly focuses on Madoka and Homura, I would have liked to see some more development, but still it's not bad, they did a great job with Madoka, Homura, Kyubey and Sayaka.\nOverall:\nPros:\n-Awesome story with a lot of twists and tragedy\n-Great music\n-Awesome art\n-Awesome ending\nCons:\n-Really short\n-Some characters lack development\n-If you love mahou shoujos this anime will break your view on this type of genre\nThis is my first review so any kinds of feedback is welcomed, thank you for your time and believe me when I tell you, this anime is a masterpiece, and you will not regret it."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=9,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    You must be wondering why did I choose to review this when I haven't even completed my articles on Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha (for those who are wondering, I did one on the 1st Movie a few days back). Well, I got hold of Volume 2 of the manga adaptation of this series today, and frankly speaking, despite having already known what would happen, the plot twists and such, the manga still managed to entertain me. So since my excitement after reading the manga still hasn't subsided yet, I decided to review on the anime version, which is where the story of the manga came\n          \n        from.\nSTORY:\nGen Urobuchi, you bastard.\nI could not fathom the reasons for his writing being despised by people. He's probably one of the best anime writers I've ever known. Indeed, he tends to go for dark, moody, angst storylines in his works, but is a valid reason for hating his writing? \nAnyway, like most of his previous masterpieces, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is also greatly influenced by his writing style. DO NOT be cheated by the merry, whimsical tone you see in the first and second episodes, it's a trap well-done to engross you to watch further.\nI must say that I'm glad to fall into the 'trap'. As I watched more and more, I couldn't help but applaud Urobuchi's ingenuity. Puella Magi Madoka Magica has truly, a well-devised plot with perfect pacing. Though the many Faust symbolisms utilized may confuse you a bit, but overall, it's a great story that incorporates the elements constituting a successful show. \nPuella Magi Madoka Magica had made me excited (Homura's appearance), astonished (TIRO FINALE), shocked (Charlotte), sorrowful (almost everything), go into 'what-the-hell-am-I-watching' (Episode 10) and eventually, it still managed to put a smile on my face. That's what a successful story should be. I could not expect any better from Urobuchi. \nOn a side note, do not treat this as your ordinary Mahou Shoujo genre show. Urobuchi had twisted this so that it's more like Neon Genesis Evangelion, focusing more on the psychology part.\nART:\nNow here's where I don't like Puella Magi Madoka Magica a bit. Like many other people, the character designs initially scared me off a bit. I mean, are those human beings? Flat, big faces with a disproportionate body. What the hell.\nDespite this, I like the animation of the show overall. It's smooth in general and like many of SHAFT's works, I absolutely loved the imaginative, conspicuous style adapted in the Witches' scenes. Good job, SHAFT. \nSOUND:\nIn addition to its excellent plot and art, Puella Magi Madoka Magica also boasts an awesome soundtrack. The OP, \"Connect\" fits the overall depressive, melancholic mood of the series well, more so for the ED, \"Magia\" by Kalafina. In fact, I like the ED more than the OP. \nOn the other hand, the background music was done by Yuki Kajiura, another great anime OST composer (the first one was Shiro Sagisu). Judging from her previous works, you would expect a great job from her, and I assure that you won't be disappointed. The background music were done very well, and I'm more impressive by the fact that the quality remains high for all the tracks. The orchestral pieces were particularly outstanding, they managed to emphasize the grandeur of the show. \nCHARACTER:\nI could not imagine how much time did Urobuchi put into crafting the characters. EVERY MAIN CHARACTER, and yes, EACH OF THEM had a unique personality of their own, which blends with the personalities of other people well. And ugh, each of them had such a sad backstory that you could not help but weep at their respective fates. All the characters also had a fair amount of screentime, including even Madoka's mother, who played a very important role in the final few episodes.\nOVERALL:\nIf you had heard from other people that Puella Magi Madoka Magica is the \"anime of the year\", you are not hearing anything wrong. For an anime that received a godlike 12 awards in the 1st Newtype Anime Awards and whose DVD/BD sales were one of the best ever, it certainly lived up to its reputation. Now I do hope that I would see another anime that can be on par with it. Better if it were to top it.\n"},

If you do, please let me know.\nSTORY: 10\nMadoka Magica has a weird plot. You expect this anime to be of dreamy and pretty magical girls who try to save the world doing cute things. Well, this anime is never what you expect it to be. At all. Never. I won't do any spoilers so as to making your watching of this anime as enjoyable as posible. I'll just say that the final chapters are gold.\nART: 7\nThe clothes aren't bad. The\n          \n        school uniform is ordinary, but the magical girls' dresses look realy good. One thing I hated were the eyes of the characters. They are drawn strangely. Also, when the girls found a witch, the animation changed completely and I sometimes kind of losted my mind. It's really weird.\nSOUND: 7\nMusic is a bit average, but on the battles, they know how to put a great dramatic music piece.\nCHARACTER: 7\nI didn't like any of the characters but Homura.

But I was watching it with a friend, so I didn't dropped it, but just in the next episode things started making sense, and I just couldn't quite my eyes of the computer. I enjoyed it pretty much. The final part is the best one, though.\nOVERALL: 8\nIt was really nice watching Madoka Magica, and it made me think about quite a lot of things.

Some people might not like it but it is truly unique and quite interesting. It balances quite well the cuteness and the despair.\n- I must say that the series is in fact really a classic cliché when you think about it, but what makes this anime great is how differently it unfolds, a totally new different perspective which makes you wonder about all the other magic girl series.\n- This is not a anime for little girls, it is quite harsh and takes the bull by the horns with the many hard themes which the happy magic girl series normally overlook, but it still have a lot of that classic magic girl glamour. \nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons\n- The main plot topic is predictable but none than less it is presented in a different way and I was enjoying more the part of how it came to be than what it would end up being.\n- The characters are still quite develop but still many of them fits really well to the classic archetypes. That is both good and bad ^^ \nI enjoyed the emotion roller-coaster ride, it had many feels but not being overly too much, I enjoyed it more for its philosophical questions and its setting.:)"},

But alright isn't enough these days.\n  When i started watching it i wanted to see some actual horror and in the and i was quite disappointed.  I see what the creator were aiming for- making a horror anime without too much horror and violence. The story itself was so complicated that  it really needed a lot more episodes, time in general. They held on a straight pattern in the  episodes and in the last few \"bombarded\" the viewer with information trying to explain what was going on. However there were some nice aspect of\n          \n        the work. The ending and the sound, particularly the ending theme were great. \n All in all a solid 8 out of 10, but not any higher.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n         This anime is probably one of the most interesting. At first glance, it appears to be a cliché magical girl anime, but it's much more than that. I won't get too much into the spoilers, but it's surprising and it is quick to get interesting. The story and concepts in the show are very intriguing, and each episode pulls you in--it's kind of addicting, just like a good anime should be. The art is wonderful, but since I prefer more realistic styles, I rated it only an (8), but the style really is different from most other anime regarding texture\n          \n        and linework. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and there is not a piece in the show that I wouldn't like to listen to again. The opening is lovely, and really captures the show in its beat and lyrics. The characters are all very likable, and endearing. Even the villains are memorable, and they are not easily forgotten like the characters featured in many other anime. I greatly enjoyed this anime, and still remember nearly every detail, even though I watched it exactly four years ago, when I was still younger and didn't really understand much of it at all. I remember crying for hours on end, and drawing so much fan art I had to throw much of it away. It is a very emotional anime and it really pulls you in and makes you feel for the characters within the story. All in all, it is a very interesting anime, nothing like the cliché magical girl stories everyone knows. It's one of the best anime I've ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone who likes action and doesn't mind the unusual. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka is something I personally can enjoy looking back at my childhood of Cardcaptor Sakura. It is deeply moving and is exploitative of the fact that these girls go out and do what they do, yet never actually think about the fact that they could die. It’s a heavy concept that Madoka deals out quite well, it comes together and is impactful to the viewer. The problem’s with Madoka lie in the ending that leaves me scratching my head. And while I know that I have commended anime for this before, that I enjoy anime with really odd endings, this one is odd in the\n          \n        fact everything comes together somewhat, but it’s such a mish-mash and so many things just happen and so many of the final scenes are so forced and unimpactful because of that force, that the anime ends with you half feeling good, half wondering what the hell just happened. Especially the after credits sequence that completely leaves me bamboozled and if anyone can explain that final forty-five seconds or so to me, please do.\nStory\nMadoka shines in the story department. It’s a well thought out system of magic and as the story progresses, it certainly maintains a sad tone that just gets sadder; but it also exudes an air of hope. It’s also an anime that seems like it will be predictable, but characters are totally different from what you’d think and you are constantly surprised. That’s not to say you are always surprised, the story does have some “duh” moments, but overall the story works well for me. It’s full of symbolism and I guess there is some inherent message it is trying to get across that I’m too lazy to mull over at the moment because it’s approaching one o’ clock and I’m sleepy, but it all works well up to the ending that seems to tie everything up at episode eleven. Then episode twelve comes and it’s necessary, especially the first half, but after that it becomes a confusing mess. I don’t want to spoil anything for those who haven’t seen it, but I will say that the forced parts where Madoka meets with her friends just don’t feel right and don’t have the same emotional impact as when Homura spills her guts and cries on Madoka’s shoulder at her house. That part was genuinely sad and made a tear come to my eye, but the rest of the “sad” scenes just didn’t work for me.\nAnimation\nThe animation for the show is a mix of traditional and LSD inspired insanity. The traditional side looks good, but isn’t anything to write home about. Characters look like loli girls and background all look good. Action is fluid. The LSD inspired action sequences when the girls battle the enemy witches are fantastic and I personally enjoyed the different styles. It was one of the best parts of the show to see what the next witch hunt would bring to the style.\nSound\nGreat voice actors compliment the show and bring emotion to the characters. The opening is good, though I thought it was too upbeat for something like this. At least Elfen Lied had that terribly gothic and kind of sad opening with the bells and the lady singing in a very creepy yet soothing voice. This one has a J-pop opener that seems to be trying to make things happy. I mean, the lyrics aren’t happy, but the song is too upbeat for an anime so seriously depressing. The ending is at least a bit more depressing.\nCharacters\nHere is my biggest fault with this anime. The characters are…not the best. Not that they are bad, but most fall under traditional conventions and I couldn’t attach myself to any of them besides Homura who I found to be the most fleshed out character of them all and the most likeable. Madoka is a good character, but she is kind of cliched up until the end when you see a very strong figure. The supporting cast is decent but most are just conventional-type characters who are put in a terrible situation.\n(SPOILER)As I said in the story section, the relationship between Homura and Madoka is the best in the show. Madoka has her friends and they have decent relationships, but I found Homura and Madoka’s friendship to be very, very touching and probably the series best point was when you find out Homura has been fighting to protect Madoka, unbeknownst to Madoka, for so long. And when Homura spills her guts to Madoka inside her house, it’s a very emotional scene that does bring a tear to the eye. This relationship is great, and works well with the ending of the series.\nOverall\nMadoka is a good anime. It is well done, and you will feel bad and depressed for these characters while, and even after, watching it. Despite the flaws in the cast (generic characters mostly) Homura still stands out as a great character and it does have one of the most powerful scenes I’ve ever seen in an anime. Despite this, the anime really loses points from its forced ending. It should have been sad, I should have really felt bad, but instead it’s just a bunch of randomness that never congeals into something I can understand clearly. I know what happened in the end (minus the after credits thing), but the ending is just so hard to clearly understand. You’ll get the gist of it, but you’ll feel like your missing something, a lot of things, both because of the forced nature of the sad moments in the last episode, and the random scenes that just don’t add to anything and confuse even more.\nThis is a good series. It is definitely something you should check out if you haven’t already, a fantastic new take on the “Magic Girl” genre that is sure to please even those who have never seen a “Magical Girl” anime before. But be warned that while the ending does complete the series, it is also where the series starts to lose its touch.\n        "},

I'm not saying that because this is a hit-or-miss kind of series where you love it or hate it, I'm saying this because you can't expect this to be just another magical girl series.\nStory 10/10: by giving the series a general plot of \"we must destroy the witches!\" they give themselves a lot of wiggle room do do whatever they want. Guess what? They use ALL of that wiggle room to make one hard-hitting,\n          \n        mind-blowing, overall great show. The biggest question you may have throughout the entire show is \"aright, so when does Madoka become a magical girl?\" Prepare yourself for the answer.\nArt 10/10: Every encounter they have with a witch is an acid trip all its own, I can only imagine what kind of time the artists had while making this show. All of the character designs and abilities are also wonderful and perfectly animated.\nSound 10/10: Tbh, I can't really remember any music that particularly stood out (its been a while since I watched the series), but what I do remember is that the background music was a perfect fit for the current mood of the show.\n／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼\nCharacter 10/10: No main character in this series ended where they began in terms of development and how you feel about them.

Also this will be spoiler free.\nWhere to start with Madoka Magica? Well, I planned on watching this series a long time ago, but the main image it transmits is that it's a kinda childish and girlishy anime. Boy, how could I be so wrong?\nI finally watched it and I regret I hadn't done that earlier.\nI'll try to portrait my reaction troughtout some episodes:\nAfter episode 1: Oh, I was right, this is just a girlish and simple anime...\nAfter episode 2: Right, this is trippy as well.\nAfter episode 3: Okay, this is getting interesting (and\n          \n        dark).\nAfter finishing episode 12: Mind = Blown. I was never fooled like this before! (In the good way)\n* Story:\nAs I have stated above, this is NOT the typical Mahou Shoujo genre anime, and its target audience is definately not little girls. This anime is actually dark and has a bizarre and heavy atmosphere on many occasions.\nThe story develops extremely well for a 12-episodes series. It doesn't feel dragged nor rushed at any time.\n* Animation and sound:\nThis anime is made by Shaft, so you can expect lots of their characteristic animation style and unique camera angles.\nThe first impression of character design may not be the best, but you can easily get used to it and realize they were made like that on purpose.\nThere is also the use of an awesome animation style everytime the characters enter the realm of a witch, it's hard to explain in words but the final result is a unique art style.\nThe Opening for this show is ClariS, by Connect and it fits the \"Mahou Shoujo\" genre well, but as I said above, the main atmosphere of this series is pretty dark, so I gotta say the Ending song for the majority of the episodes is the one that fits this anime perfectly: Magia, by Kalafina. The OST is awesome and full of emotional songs.\n* Character:\nThe cast of characters on this show is not really big, so the character development is well made throughout the 12 episodes. Each character develops in interesting ways towards the events of the series. I must say none of the characters of this show follows usual patterns.\n* Overall:\nDon't make the same mistake I did, don't postpone to watch this. Don't get fooled by the image you may have of the Mahou Shoujo genre here (Like judging a book by its cover).\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magika is for me a masterpiece and made to my top 5 anime of all time.\nFinal score: 10/10\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This anime was something I've been meaning to watch for a long time, but I just couldn't pick up the energy to watch it. But after a bit of free time and nothing else that I really wanted to watch, here's my review.  I'll try to keep my review as spoiler free as possible. I won't go into specific details, but there are things that must be told in order to provide a proper review. \nThe internet is a cruel place, and a lot of my friends told me that this was a dark anime. So, I was rather looking forward to the anime\n          \n        itself. I love dark stuff, things which make me question the morality of both the characters in the anime and my own morality in choosing which character has the moral upper hand. But this was pretty straightforward for most characters. Unfortunately, it wasn't as dark as I had expected, although it did have some very memorable moments. \nStory: \nThere was a striking similarity that I found with this anime and the Fullmetal Alchemist series. \"Everything has a price\". The premise is that these girls are approached by Kyubey, a magical creature which offers to grant them a wish, any wish, in exchange for them becoming a Magical girl, to fight the witches. We are told that witches are born in an exactly opposite manner of how magical girls are born, by a curse, and that's fairly true. But the story opens up to a wider perspective. \nThe girls quickly realize that their wishes have a price. They quickly learn that nothing in life is free. They struggle with their decisions, and the plot twists the story throws at them. The ending was something that I was somewhat disappointed by. It tried to wrap everything up and give a somewhat melancholy ending to a story which, I personally felt, shouldn't have had such a clean ending. Overall, I give the story a 9/10. \n\nArt: \nOne of the main reasons it took me this long to pick up this anime was the art. It really frustrated me that the art wasn't to my taste. It was too moe and cutesy for my taste. If I had to pick, I would have chosen an art style with a little bit more maturity, even though the girls themselves are quite young. But I'll have to say that the cute art style is deceptive for an anime this dark. So, I'm on both sides of the field for the art style. \nOne thing I really loved with the anime's art style was the depiction of witches. It wasn't shown as a solid concept with solid characters, but with a lot of abstract art. I loved that as soon as I saw it. I wish more anime would take the same departure and mix it up a little like MSMM did. Kudos to the entire team for a brilliant job done on the art for the witches. That's the only reason I'm giving art a 7/10. \nSound: \nAbsolutely brilliant is an understatement for the sound and voice acting in this anime. My personal favorite (which, I suspect, is also the favorite of many others) was the first ending song, Magia by Kalafina. It captured the anime's mood like no other song that I have heard in anime before. It almost felt like it was exclusively written for the anime. \nThe voice actors in this anime (Sub), did a brilliant job in giving voices to the characters. I particularly loved the actors for Homura and Madoka during the very special flashback episode. The moments in that episode gave me chills that I still can't shake. I felt like I was listening to the emotions of the characters themselves. A solid 10/10 for sound. \nCharacter: \nCharacter development was done very well for almost all of the characters. You initially think that Homura is just a cold bitch out for her own personal reasons, but her story is explained with stunning beauty exactly when required. Madoka is initially annoying as heck, along with her classmate Sayaka. Sayaka had some of the best development in the series. In my personal opinion, she and Homura were the main reasons the story went as far as it did. Madoka is something I really can't agree with. For almost the whole series, she's annoying and the development at the end makes zero sense whatsoever with her personality in focus. But other than that, I really don't have a problem with the character development. Character development is a 7/10 for me. \n\nEnjoyment: \nYes, I fell prey to the infamous Episode 3, although I saw it coming early on in the episode. But the anticipation made it so much better than I expected. Each episode is paced well, and the mood generally gets darker and darker. It played well with my liking of dark anime. Nihilism is core in the story, and as a nihilist myself, it tickled well with me. So enjoyment is 8/10. \nOverall, the anime is paced well, has a few very endearing characters, some annoying, and the story is brilliantly written. My only qualm with this is that it should have had more gore than what it showed (not that it showed any). This is a story where the characters are continuously battered and scarred. A nice amount of gore would have been nice to further the mood of the anime. Other than that, I have absolutely no qualms with the anime. A very respectable 9/10 overall. If you haven't watched this, I strongly suggest that you do. If you liked Fullmetal Alchemist (Not brotherhood!), then you're surely in for a treat with MSMM. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Despite all the hype about this anime, I have not really heard much of it myself until early April this year.  Puella Magi Madoka Magica is, to me, one of the best magical girl deconstructions that I've ever seen, and I'm quite honestly surprised at the material that they've managed to stuff into this rather short anime.  It does have its flaws, of course, but I'll be mentioning them later.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica begins as any other magical girl anime would go, and tries (of course, we still all know it's going to end horribly) to somehow manipulate the viewer in the beginning\n          \n        into thinking that this is going to be a light-hearted slice of life magical girl anime with its cute-but-shy female lead who has an outgoing best friend and another who seems to be the perfect girl, despite being a tad childish.  And, if you don't know what genre of anime you were watching, you'd probably be fooled into thinking this.  Don't forget; this anime was NOT written for five year old girls.  One of the most important elements used to create this atmosphere is the art, which is cute, but not often used for animes.  It varies from this style (used mainly for characters) and strange, almost gothic cut-out pictures for the witches, reminescent of traditional fairy tales.  All this provides great contrast, unsettling the viewer and creating an environment full of suspense.  The graphics are quite smooth and in high-quality; the style may be unique, and many may not like it, but it is quite obvious that much time was spent in the animations.  It also fits quite well with the music (composed by Yuki Kaijura, though she's straying from her usual style, making it difficult to exactly say whether or not this is one of her better works) as well.\nNow that I'm done talking about what I love about this show, I'll move on to what I dislike about it; the characters.  While I do have to say that I do not dislike any characters in particular (you can see that Miki Sayaka is in my top five favourite characters of all time), I do have some problems with the characterizations.  While each character do have their own different goals and backstories, they don't exactly have much drive in the story.  Yes, one of the characters is responsible for much of the stories' events (I won't say who), but it's done it a way that feels less character-driven and instead more forced by the plot, though it's pretty far from being a simple plot device.  The characters have been created in order to suffer in this world, and it's hard to say that they get much deeper than that.  It's true that they're all sympathetic enough, but more characterization is needed to make the characters all feel realistic.  Some of you will not disagree with me, but I do truly think that the characters were some of this anime's greatest weaknesses.\nDon't let any of that keep you away from the story, however.  This anime has many plot twists, one of the major two happening near the beginning of the story and is sure to unsettle for those watching this the first time.  The story keeps going at a thrilling and rapid pace, and doesn't leave you much time to catch your breath.  However, watchers should try and watch other magical girl animes first and get used to the cliches and plot devices of the genre in order to get the full experience of this wonderfully done deconstruction.  This show may not be perfect, but it was one of the best shows that aired in the 2010-2011 winter season.  If you are an anime fan, you need to watch this.\n"},

This series has got to be one of the BEST series I have watched in a very long time. If you just watch the opening don't be fooled, this series gets VERY dark and later when the series is dark they don't even play the opening so the mood isn't ruined. It's actually really hard to describe just what makes this series so great without spoiling anything. I think part of it is\n          \n        that in the first three episodes I believe you have the basic type of girl characters you get in most magical girl series, Madoka who's sweet and innocent, Sayaka who's the overly hyper one with a softer side, Mami who's the experienced magical girl, and Akemi who is obviously the character everybody is supposed to hate. Once it hits episode three however that's when it begins getting much more serious. The way this series makes magical girls is this. A creature named Kyubey finds girls who he believes will make good magical girls, he then tells them if they become a magical girl he will grant any wish that they have. The girls then get something called a Soul Gem. This is what they use to transform, use their magic and find witches which they are supposed to hunt and get rid of. After they defeat a witch they get an item called a Grief Seed which they touch to their Soul Gem in order for it to become completely pure again so the magical girl can use their magic again and wont become a witch themselves. The real secret behind why magical girls are made though is awfully dark and I found it rather creepy. As the girls begin to learn the truth their mental limits are pushed to the edge and the series becomes very emotional. As you watch you'll want to understand the past of Akemi Homura who is the mysterious girl nobody knows about. You don't figure out her story until closer to the end but once you do you can't help but suddenly reason with her and just feel awful for everyone in the series now. Everything about this series is just fantastic and I finished it in one day. I just love how something that seemed like it would be the overly happy, predictable magical series turned out to be something so beautiful and different.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    SPOILERS*\nTo be blunt Madoka Magica isn't as amazing or genius as some people say it is. It's not a bad series but it's not particularly good either. I started the series trying to keep an open mind, I've already heard a lot of good things about it and I can say I was a bit hopeful. I finished the series in one sitting and I was left unimpressed and maybe a little disappointed.\nBelow are some of the reasons on why I liked/disliked the series.\n- Story -\nI didn't find the story to be too intriguing. Yes, it's a dark mahou shoujo anime with tragedy, so\n          \n        what? A lot of the elements that are in this anime has been done before in other animes and mangas, just because it's been done with a mahou shoujo genre doesn't mean it's anything new or refreshing. It had nothing much to offer.\nThe tragedy part of the story was indeed tragic but only because the series tells you so. They continuously threw sob stories in my face telling me to feel bad or something but not once did I feel any sadness or grief over the characters, the reason will  be further explained in the - Characters - section. \nThe connections of mahou shoujos and witches was interesting but at the same time I found it funny that teen angst is what was fueling the universe.\n\n- Characters -\nThis is where I am ready to unleash myself.\nI disliked the characters very much. All of them. Especially Sayaka.\nThe characters are just very poorly done in my point of view not because the characters themselves are bad (though some are and they're are pretty stupid) but because of how they are presented.\nMami... I remember when she died I was laughing from the surprise that she was actually dead because a second ago she was talking about how she wouldn't be alone. I didn't find her death significant because there was nothing about her character that the show gave me a reason to care about. All I know is that the writer wanted us to see her as what a mahou shoujo is SUPPOSED to be and that's it. As a character? She's very dull and meaningless.\nSayaka is just a bad character overall, I suppose she's the example of what the fate of a mahou shoujo is meant to look like in the series... but that doesn't excuse what an idiot she is. She makes on bad decision after another and refuses to acknowledge that what she's doing might not be working. In the end rather than a character she's just an example, kind of like Mami.\nKyoko... I actually liked her for a bit, she kind of had her shit together. I didn't understand why she was suddenly kind to Sayaka, I didn't see a reason for it at all but I shrugged it off and just tried to go with it... then when she chose to die with Sayaka so she won't be alone anymore... Ugh... That was just really dumb. NOTHING LED TO THIS, nothing showed why she was suddenly nice and why she cared so much for Sayaka. If it's because they all share a similar pain as a mahou shoujo,  I still can't see that as a good reason. All I can see her as if a disposable character to add to the tragedy... and maybe because they needed someone to be the color red.\nHomura... I have the biggest problem with Homura. She's our big tragic heroine who has sacrificed everything to save Madoka... and yeah, so what? The show doesn't explain clearly enough as to why she's so desperate to save Madoka other than having a girl crush on her. We aren't given a clear view of why Madoka is IMPORTANT to her. We're just told that Homura has gone through all this mess just to save her and it's a good idea but as a plot or a plot twist, it was poorly executed.\nMadoka. I don't care about Madoka, there's no point to her to be honest, other than having the potential of being the strongest mahou shoujo and witch. I found the reason for her potential to be quite dumb, if people with the most sorrow can become a more powerful mahou shojo, wouldn't that be Homura instead of Madoka? Also the reason why she has that potential shouldn't just apply to Madoka, it should work with the other girls as well. It really didn't make any sense to me. \nOverall the characters are poorly done, they don't develop and when they do, it's not done well or in a way we can see. I'm not saying all characters have to develop for the good of the character, I'm saying characters should develop properly and in a way that's reasonable. If you're trying to tell a story, you need to show people where the character began, where they are going, and how they get there. Things shouldn't just happen for the sake of plot and unfortunately Madoka Magica is a good example of characters being sacrificed for the story.\n If anyone makes an excuse saying that the reason the characters were shown this way was because the anime was only 12 episodes, bite your tongue. That's no excuse, that's bull shit. \n\n- Art/Animation -\nThe character designs are cute, not my style but cute. I very much disliked the animation and art for when they enter a witches domain. I felt like it was disjointing and didn't well together with the rest of the series, it felt kind Tim Burtony.\nOne of my biggest dislike was how they used the animation to hold your hand and spoon feed you emotions and reactions. They'll use different angles of a shot to tell you THIS IS SIGNIFICANT or just keep changing perspectives and highlighting reactions or expressions telling you FEEL SOMETHING.\n\n- Sound -\nNothing about the music stood out to me so not bad or good. Just whatever.\n\n- Overall -\nTL;DR:\nThe story was interesting but wasn't nearly good enough because you need good characters for it to hold together, sadly the series did not have that. The characters were merely sacrificial lambs for the sake of the story. Despite what people say, this is not a that great of a series nor is it a good deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    I've read many people praising this show for its adult perspective on the magical girls genre. But I just couldn't get into it. Didn't like the pacing of the episodes, too much talking (and walking) - not enough showing, and while the characters asked adult-like questions (although, never asked for Kuybey to explain the contract in full) they were cute magical girls so I couldn't suspend my disbelief that they would ask such questions. It was like the concepts were 3D, but the characters were still 2D (no pun intended). I also never really cared for any of the characters, which I think is necessary\n          \n        to enjoy this show. How they show Madoka's family life in the first episode, to make her relate-able, was necessary but felt kind of forced. It adds to her story, but doesn't really make me care what happens to her. \nMaybe it's because it's a magical girl show, and I didn't think Tweeny Witches was that great either. Both series have similar animation, so maybe I'm biased. My partner immediately compared it to Sailor Moon, but I've never seen Sailor Moon so I can only take her word on it. I wanted to like Madoka, but I found shows like Xxxholic and Shakugan no Shana more entertaining from the first episode.\nA big problem for me was the lack of humor. For a show that was based on the concept of balance, I found it overly dramatic, and took itself way too seriously. Just a little bit of humor here and there would have made it SO much more watchable, but serious introspection and consequences can only take a show so far for me, and it became depressing in episodes 7 and 8 (just as I was starting to care for Sayaka). I did find their idea for the greatest source of energy in the universe pretty funny, although I probably wasn't meant to. \nEpisode 10 (showing the adventures of Homura) was good. More-show-less-tell. But having seen Serial Experiments Lain, I found the final episode predictable. In some ways Madoka may be this generation's Lain, except Lain kept its concepts mysterious and open to interpretation, while it felt like Madoka spoon-fed them to me. I'll concede Madoka looked fantastic, and it's only 12 episodes so I don't feel too bad about watching all of it, but I feel I wasn't its intended audience so I can't recommend it."},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    As a little girl, or even as a thirteen year old girl, I remember wanting to be just like Sailor Moon (specifically Sailor Jupiter). Or one of the Magic Knights (specifically Fuu). Or a Power Ranger (the Pink one of course). How cool would it be to have magical powers and be brave and strong and wear an adorable outfit and have a cuddly, kawaii animal sidekick that can only say Puuu? \nWell this show is out to prove you dead wrong.\nDon’t let cute, pink, little Madoka fool you; once you get over the establishing episodes, this is a full out deconstruction of the magical\n          \n        girl genre little girls grow up with. It takes every character, trope, and cliche and turns it over on its head. \nTo begin with, the art and the music for this show are both stunning. On the surface the show looks pretty average, and the girls’ forms with their petite bodies, rainbow hair, and sort of squished heads start looking way too cute way too quickly—but to be fair, that’s sort of the point. It looks fine most of the time. But it’s when we leave the real world dimension and fall into the underworld where our magical girls have to fight their enemies that the artistry really comes alive. It’s so hard to describe, you just have to see it.\nEach new enemy manipulate’s the physics of their own dimension and creates its own world. Every witch battle presents a unique world with its own style and wonderfully surreal and symbolic images that’s either thematically representative of one of the characters, or is perhaps a cultural critique or point the show is trying to make, or just for the purpose of looking weird and beautiful.\nThe music was also really wonderful, with terribly fitting opening and ending themes that subtly clue us into what’s going on before the show even gets rolling, as well as a beautiful soundtrack. The score matches the mood of the show perfectly—whimsical and beautiful, and yet there’s an odd sense of foreboding when listening to that haunting choir, something that feels off. It swells in all the right places, but also knows when to back off always complimentary to the mood.\nThis series is only 12 episodes long, so there isn’t much to say about the plot without giving much of it away ((it’s paced nearly perfectly—there was one raspberry-colored character arc that stretched a twee too long, but it’s not much to complain about in a series this short)).\nTo be a magical girl sounds like a dream, but such things come at a price. Even though the chosen ones get a pretty transformation sequence, not all magical girls get along; not all immediately find they have the talent for it. Fighting demonic spirits is very dangerous life-risking business. Not every wish is worth the price paid. The series takes on a very Faustian view on the whole situation ((you can pick which version you’d prefer to go with, neither one is wholly appropriate for the direction the series turns)). And Madoka is witness to all of the disturbing consequences that follow making a contract with Kyubey as she tries to make her decision.\nIn many ways our titular character isn’t what we would normally expect from this sort of series. She’s not the red (or pink) leader like Hikaru or Ichigo; Madoka’s very much a blank slate and observes as all the tragedies of being a magical girl as they continue to stack and sack on top of each other. If anything, the typical leader personality is found in Sayaka (the blue one). \nI like that about this show. I mean, even if I was given a pretty outfit, a sword, and the ability to shoot lightning at people, I sure as hell would have been eaten by a monster the second I became a magical girl. \nAs you can imagine, the series quickly spirals into something much darker and more thought provoking than Tokyo Mew Mew ever did. It forces each of the five protagonists to deal with the harsh realities of becoming a magical girl—the danger, the loneliness, the self-doubt, the fear, attempting to reconcile their fatal choice. \nAnd that’s the conflict in this show. It’s not a final boss battle with Walpurgis Night, or even our ‘villain', but it’s the decision to receive one instantaneous wish for a lifetime of servitude. Which wishes are worth that, if there are any at all? It renders the girls incapable of reconciling their normal lives with their magical ones. It drives some to insanity and others to despair. The show isn’t about magical powers and fighting witches, it’s about the physical, psychological, and emotional consequences that would stem from being made a magical girl in any world that even resembles reality.\nLastly, most of the weapons these girls are cool. One literally pulls rifles out of her skirt and then finishes her enemies off with a rocket launcher thing. I’ve never even seen that in a shounen series let alone a magical girl show.\n        "},

Within in the first, oh let's say three episodes?, I figured out that the witches were people. Why? Because if you used a bit of common sense, people are always the bad -.- There are no demons or witches or whatever that come out of nowhere and cause bad things to happen, it's people. Anyways, let's get on with the review\nStory: I gave the story 5/10 because I didn't consider it\n          \n        to be anything new. It starts off as a happy, slice of life type of genre. (And honestly, I would've liked it better if they kept it that way.) Then in episode 3, it supposed turns dark because something happened to a character. I didn't feel any attachment to the character and there wasn't any shock to me. What was I supposed to feel? We had a little info on her background and that's it. There was not enough time to get attached so I didn't feel any remorse. Then the next few episodes focus on Sayaka and honestly, it made me think \"What happened to Madoka?\" She uses her wish on her childhood friend and when things don't turn out the way she wants, she blames life. (hip hip hooray) Somewhere along the lines, Kyoko shows up too and tries to kill Sayaka. And because of their little fight, Sayaka thinks she is \"better\" than the other magical girls, even though she's yet to meet them all, and becomes \"the defender of justice\" or whatever. And as I said, things don't turn out well with her childhood friend (you made a wish on him, but he didn't know so why would he confess his undying love for you?) and she loses it. And I remember somewhere along the lines she says that she wanted him to be happy (No, you wanted him to give you love because true love is wishing for the person you love to find happiness, even if it isn't with you.) After this sometime, Kyoko tells Sayaka her background and why she's concerned for her, which Sayaka just disregards completely and lets it go in one ear and out the other. Eventually, Sayaka and Kyoko are taken out of the story and we are left with Madoka (oh, she was there?) and Homura. We see Homura's past and we understand where she is coming from. We also have Kyubey explain to Madoka about why there are magical girls and their use. It's a bit of a long stretch because they're using the \"from outer space\" explanation of what Incubators are. Kyubey tells Madoka how that's how the world works. You have to make sacrifices for the greater good, but Madoka refuses to listen and says it is too sad. So in the end we have Madoka become \"god\" and she prevents witches from existing. Now it's all shiny and hope-filled, but the only thing I saw was \"But they're still dead.\" The story wasn't anything new to me, it gave an occasional tugs on the heart-strings because of cheap cliches, but it had a bit of potential. \nArt: It was interesting and new. Though I think the fight scenes were what was focused on and not really the character designs. \nSound: The music was nice, except for that background music that came when things were \"dramatic\" and instantly told you something was wrong. The opening and ending were nice.\nCharacter: I did not really like the characters, but Kyoko would probably be my favorite\nMadoka: She is a rich (ain't no middle class -.-) girl with a happy life and she probably doesn't understand much about suffering which is why her brain does not wrap around the concepts that Kyubey tells her. She's pretty weak and she's just there (until the end). I didn't really like her character and she probably is just a moe blob.\nSayaka: She's the spunky friend who is strong minded. She faces troubles because of her love interest and if it wasn't for him, she would have no story and would be a happy, mindless moe-blob like Madoka. She later despairs because he doesn't love her back and one of her friends says she's going to confess to him. Honestly, I understand her (heartbreak is tough), but she did not really make any direct attacks. Sure she visited him and brought him CDs, but she didn't do anything and she took it out on others instead. If you took out the magical girl aspect, she could still fling the same words about Madoka not understanding how she felt. She later decides that she'll be justice and that she'll take down anyone, even if they were a magical girl. Honestly? Doesn't that make you a bad person too? But whatever, Sayaka is the defender of justice and peace and stuff.\nKyoko: Kyoko was a character that I liked. They went into her background and you could feel something for her. However, her dad getting drunk and killing her family was maybe a little too rash? Didn't fit in. If he was a priest or whatever, and their family was barely surviving, where did he get the alcohol? She was a cool character and she understood her mistakes so she had some development. \nMami: Honestly, what am I supposed to feel? She's supposed to be the \"cool\" senpai. We go into a bit on why she became a magical girl and we're supposed to feel some remorse. Actually, that is a pretty common case for making contracts so nothing too new. She brings two girls along with no powers, even though she told them it was dangerous an they might lose their lives. Really? Ugh.\nHomura: Homura is the cool, mysterious character. She constantly tells Madoka not to become a magical girl and is always saving her butt. Then we see a bit of her past and the reason she is so keen of Madoka is because she saved her. But that's all we see. We don't know why Madoka likes Homura so much (maybe she's just nice?) and that's that. I felt bad for Homura since she had to keep protecting Madoka, but why not explain it? I mean, she said no one would believe her, but what about Madoka? Weren't they supposed to be ultra super best friends? Wasn't she supposed to be a really good person? Maybe things could've been fixed there. Maybe, but then the whole story would fall apart.\nEnjoyment: 5/10 I didn't really enjoy the story and here's where I go into it. I didn't like the concept that Madoka was from a rich family because usually magical girls are like suffering or something. She was sheltered and I honestly did not see that she had anything to worry about. I didn't like how these characters had not seen despair before. Maybe it was part of the message, but that just made me annoyed. Another thing that annoyed me was the once again, blatant acceptance of magical girls and powers. Sure Mami explains things and tells them it's dangerous and such, but do they question it? Noooo. And even when she tells them it's dangerous Sayaka decides to be a butt and want to go on a witch hunt with Mami. Why the hell would you want to?! Then the fact that Sayaka is just some butthurt girl who got her love life taken away from her and she then goes on a rampage for that. So much for the greater good. I guess it was for self-fulfillment. I can understand the hurt from unrequited love, but girl you have to tighten yourself up. Again, rich girl knows no problems. And Madoka throwing the soul gem off the bridge. Are you kidding me? Simply running away with it would've sufficed -.- And why the fuck (excuse my language) did you not think about it before? SOUL gem?! IT'S IN THE NAME!!!!!!! And then you get mad at Kyubey for not explaining and for once I agree with him that you didn't ask. It pisses me off when magical girls just say \"Okay, magic powers. Sure. I'm not going to ask about them or the consequences or anything.\" And all of a sudden Kyoko tells her background story to Sayaka and she wants to be chums with her. What?! You were trying to kill her one episode ago, but because you know the truth of the soul gems you want to talk it out with her? Bah, bollocks. Which reminds me, when Madoka said they could talk it over and Sayaka refused? What is she, a first grader? \"No! We have to fight it out!\" Because we can't be civilized adults and talk things out. Oh wait, I forgot. Rich people with no worries. Then the fight scene of Homura and the Walpurgisnacht. Like, when did she prepare all those explosives? Who did she steal it all from?!?! But okay, let's just throw logic out the window, because hey, magical girls, am I right? And then Madoka because \"god\" and takes all the grief. She shoulders it upon herself and makes sure that witches were never formed. And then they pull a cheap heart-string trick by having everyone forget her except for Homura. And we end it by having it like a normal magical girl show. Oh wait, in all this ranting I forgot about the dark aspects. Where were they? Oh, you know. Just the depictions of EVERYDAY LIFE. I'm not a truly cynical person, but it takes someone with some life experience to see that the things that went on occur naturally and it's not some fantasy. Of course witches are within us, we have have despair and sadness. But maybe the theme was hope? I don't know. \n(I just remembered something else. When Hitomi and that mass group were going to kill themselves and Madoka had a flashback. What a convenient flashback that her mother told her about those exact two chemicals. Hmm)\nAnd before I get rants about how her life wasn't tough and such, I'll explain it a bit here. I didn't like how she didn't START out with anything. Of course, if something bad happens later on in the story it will affect the character. However, I wanted something to happen prior that would cause the deaths to seem more valued, more impacted. Some might say \"That was her best friend\" or something, but I don't know. Maybe it was because they died. Death is the easiest way to cause grief to grow in someone so maybe it was that. Anyone would feel grief if someone they knew died. So if something beforehand (like a trauma) the death would impact way way more and make me feel more attachment. But to each their own.\nOverall, the show was okay and I enjoyed it somewhat. The story was nothing too new. The art was fine. The sound was nice. The characters were lacking, but I'll still give it a 5. At one point, I was interested, but then it turned back to Madoka and I just lost the feeling. Maybe if we had a main character with a bit for life experience I would've liked it because her choice would be justified. (Don't tell me her friends died in front of her is good enough, because it isn't) It was the most exciting and wasn't my favorite, but I think the music is what left the nicest impression on me.\n        "},

At first I was sceptical and was unsure whether or not I would like this anime. But man once I started watching it I had to finish it. What drove the anime for me was, well everything. The characters were seemingly ordinary high school girls, but then dragged into this story and their lives are changed forever. Its crazy its the first time that I had so many mixed emotions at one time. Such as annoyance, pitty, saddness, forgiveness, and the list can go on and that is just for\n          \n        one scene, I felt this at almost every scene. But what really stood out where the story and art style. So not to spoil to much these girls are made to hunt witchs and in order to do so they had to go into the witch's which had an amazing art style. The story on the other hand is freaking amazing and its one that deffinilty needs to be experinced. The only problem I had were the characters but its only a minor issues, its just the way they looked might turn off some people but I highly reccomend that you stick with it regardless of there gigantic heads and eyes. \nAll in all its the first anime that I finished and was just speechless. I couldn't find one bad thing to say (only recently did I relalize there heads are way to big). It was just a great combination of story telling, art style, and they mixed it perfectly to tie together one of the best animes that I have watched. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Oh hey, did you know I already reviewed this on Youbtube? It's true! If you look up my real name (Or is that my pen name? Who knows!) on the Tube, and find my channel, there's a detailed, three part review of this and its manga spinoffs, but since the plebes on MAL decree that this can't be used as links to a video, I will rewrite this to summarize my thoughts on PMMM. A shortened summary for those who don't wanna bother with my Powerpoint (LOL) vids.\nRegardless, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an anime original property by Shaft, made by the \"Dream Team\" of\n          \n        Akiyuki Shinbo (everything Studio Shaft makes money on), Gen Urobuchi (Phantom of Inferno, most of Fate Zero, and Nitro Plus golden boy), Ume Aoki (Hidamari Sketch) and Yuki Kajiura (Music of Fate Zero, Noir, Pandora Hearts). This was guaranteed to at least generate attention, and my God, it did. This has been hailed as the second coming of anime, and also derided for being overrated. Where do I stand?\nStory: It's like Sailor Moon: a girl named Madoka Kaname meets a thing called a Kyubey. Kyubey says it can make her a magical girl, so long as she signs a contract. She wants to, but this other girl named Homura Akemi doesn't want that. Being a magical girl grants you powers, and a wish, but you have to kill witches, which are really trippy. (Remember, this is a shortened review by my present-day standards)\nSo yeah, basically Sailor Moon, but with no cheesiness, and no filler. This takes itself seriously, and much like the Gen fans love to point out, is darker than most other mahou shoujos. Luckily, it doesn't go too overboard in that regard, the story is well-paced, and the twists are interesting. The ending's really good too. However, there only 12 episodes, and this setting could be explored further. Other than that, good stuff!\nArt: Why make the girls look like Hidamari characters? I do not like that art style. Oh sure, I like the magical girl costumes, and the backgrounds, but the art isn't too great. Even the upgraded blu-rays have a few faults here and there. For what it's worth, it is better looking than a few other Shaft shows.\nSound: You still can't separate music and voicework? Whatever. Normally, I find Kajiura's music overrated. Listen to any soundtrack she does that isn't Pandora Hearts. Are you tired of hearing synthesized Middle Eastern choirs yet? Well good news! Most of Madoka's soundtrack isn't that! She now ranks higher than Hitoshi Sakimoto in my book! Listen to \"Sagitta Luminis\" if you don't believe me.\nThe voice acting is really good too. Sure, in Japanese, a lot of them have the typical high clean girl voices, but they work super well here. And despite what weeaboos claim, its English dub is really good too...except Kyouko. She's noticeably worse in English. But otherwise, take your language of choice!\nCharacterization: Really good stuff. Madoka is sweet but indecisive, Homura is cold-hearted but not in an unrealistic fashion, Kyubey is....different. And then there's Sayaka Miki, one of Madoka's friends. Oh Sayaka, I see so much of my younger self in her.\nOnly downside is a girl named Mami. Without saying too much, she gets little characterization, and seems to exist mainly as a plot device. Here's hoping the movie sequel corrects that. Oh, and also, I think Homura is a crappy \"kuudere\" throughout most of the series, but she gets better. Trust me.\nEnjoyment: Bad news, this isn't the best mahou shoujo ever. Princess Tutu is. But it's still really good. At least as good as Cardcaptor Sakura, albeit for entirely different reasons. See the first six or so episodes and judge for yourself.\nOkay, now that that's out of the way, back to more reviews.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    What has been said about this show that already hasn't been said.\nThe plot of Madoka Magica is the deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre. It takes the genre and puts it in a real world scenario and see how it will all pan out. The main character Madoka one day comes across a white cat looking thing named Kyubey who says that he/she could grant one wish if she becomes a magical girl to help defeat the witches. However, he/she is always getting stopped by Homura who tries to prevent Madoka from becoming a magical girl. Homura is revealed to be a time traveling magical\n          \n        girl that has been trying to prevent Madoka's death from the witch Walpurgisnacht. The other magical girls in this show are Mami, Kyoko, and Sayaka.\nThe animation in this show isn't that great as to what I was expecting. However, whenever the magical girls enter the witches den the animation is just insane. I really love the design of the witches in this show. They really stand out and the animation used for them are memorable.\nThe characters are what I felt could have really been more fleshed out. For example when the previous timelines of Madoka as a magical girl are shown they never really explained as to why she became one in the first place. Now there are only three characters that deserve mentioning Madoka, Homura, and Kyubey. The rest of the magical girls I could give two shits about. Not that I didn't think they were good characters, but yeah I  didn't care about them. Besides that all the characters are solid and the chemistry between them are done well.\nNow about my enjoyment. Holy Shit! This show was a delight. The obvious thing that I should mention is the ending of this show. Arguably one of my favorite top ten anime climaxes. It was just incredible. I thought that this show deserved an 8/10, but after re-watching it I have grown to appreciate it more than I did. So I am going to give this show a 9/10 and highly recommend this show to everyone.\n        "},

Now that it finally came into its conclusion, I'm still left mind fucked , so I'm trying to decipher this anime as i write this review so if i start contradicting myself ,just accept that the theory can go both way. \nThe anime explores the Human nature : \n Keyword : 'Death drive' - to find oneself grappling with the difficulties inherent in the topic of repetition. It is the drive to self-destruction and the return to the inorganic and inanimate state. Further, it suggests that every person has an unconscious wish to die and goes beyond the pleasure principle by means of reiteration: “the death drive is only the mask of the symbolic order.”\nTrauma in 'death drive' tells us that the subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact disturbing experiences to reminisce a painful situation. As we have witnessed, of all the characters, Homura is the most fully explored for this definition. She has a strong driving factor to search for the timeline where she can save and change Madoka’s fate. In order to do this, countless times she negated time despite the fact that every reiteration she does is giving her some pain and numerous times she wakes from her nightmare in the hospital room. Hence, through such a compulsion to reiterate, Homura attempts to ‘bind’ the trauma, thus allowing her to return to a state of quiescence.\nFreud capitalized on the concept of ‘narcissism’ and realized that the ego is not simply a kill-joy, concerned solely with the suppression of libido, but is itself an erotically-charged figure within the individual’s economy of desire. \nIt is apparent that Homura’s ego is not only the ‘headquarters’ of her libido but is also liable to become—itself—an object of her own desire. For instance, Homura always claims that she’s fine alone and can triumph the Walpurgis Night unaided. She also keeps on saying that there’s no way that Madoka can understand—her feelings. Hence, this narcissistic act has been deeply rooted from Homura’s intensely repressed but yet extremely sexually desire to Madoka, and as a result she was able to transform herself from being lame into a badass heroine.\nSayaka Miki Hero complex eventually destroy her as she end up regretting her decision as Tomoe mami say's \"If you use your wish to grant someone Else's sake , you should be careful to know exactly why you're doing it. Are you doing it for someone Else's benefit, or the opposite? Your doing it for someone Else's everlasting gratitude. The motive behind a wish is what matters most, you know. If you're not 100% sure why you're doing it, you'll most defiantly regret it later. \" \nI'm not going to lie i kinda knew Sayaka was going to regret her decision later on if she wished on somebody Else's happiness since the price she going to have to pay for that wish will defiantly wont be worth it - the wish for curing your friend incurable hands and legs for the cost of your life doesn't seem worth it to me . \nTomoe mami it was her stubbornness that  constantly course her to die in every time line , she may seem completely selfless person who try's  to save everybody but in reality she selfish and willing to put innocent in danger so she doesn't feel alone anymore. she got too big headed and didn't heed Homura Akemi warning and thus ended up dead .\nI still can’t understand why some people think that Kyubey is evil. The example of treating human as cattle clearly tells us the terror of humanism. We humans tend to think that we are the center of the universe. We question right from wrong when things don’t go on our way, and most of all we define morality when in fact we couldn’t even accurately discern the exact boundaries of morality and immorality.\nUnlike what human do with cattle , Kyubey doesn't force anyone to do anything. he may lure them in with the flowery idea of a wish and then hit them with the hard cold reality that you're no longer human and you're going to turn into a witch and  die inevitably. \nHe has the ability to grant ANY of YOUR WISHES , the price in return is not going to be cheap , but with the whole system it doesnt matter how small your wish is your still going to get the same price of everyone else - your inevitable death . so your going to have a strong resolve to wish for something .  \nin miki case : her wish to repair her friend hand the price in the end was her life (kinda a waste of a wish if i say so)\nin Madoka case :to eradicate witches from the past ,present and future ,in the end cost her ,her life (she became a goddess) wish spent wisely . \nKyubey doesn't have emotion so he not going to understand the whole concept of his action , he like a child in a way - they can destroy something a still feel okay because they don't understand good from bad .you can say he doesnt know the concept of life and death either .\nhis action do not arise out of disrespect for Humans or out of a desire to hurt or to do injury. Rather eager to discover what would happen if it took a particular action. he really unable to shift perspectives and the human's point of view. so you cant blame him if he seem a bit heartless \nMahou shoujo madoka has a childlike innocence to it . apart from the fact that the children . \nfor example , when they're fight the witches in their domain it almost like it drawn by a child , it chaotic and some of the familiar is what you expect to find in a nursery book .\nfunny even after all this thinking i still feel mind fucked ...\nI have seen other SHAFT anime, and what I can say is that they have a very… unique way of presenting materials. Their intricate, abstract artwork is both famous and notorious among anime fans. SHAFT is also infamous for their cost-cutting measures, such as overuse of Kanji frames, animation frame reduction among some other things, which is the reason that SHAFT tries to stick with animating writing-driven works with less frames to work with, thus, less costly to animate and i have to say i wasn't particularly amazed by the art.\nthe story was a masterpiece one of the few i voted  a  10 \nthe art was not amazing but it was bearable so i voted a 7\nsound hmm ... i kinda forgot the soundtrack but i think it perfectly set the mood so i voted a 8\ncharacter were realistic and fitted their role perfectly so i voted a 10 \ni genuinely enjoyed this when i wasnt in a state of ambivalence so i gave this a 9\noverall it was truly a masterpiece a well deserve of my 10    \n\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    When it comes to the \"magical girl\" genre most people (including myself) automatically think lots of color, girl power, happy go lucky type anime. However, this  one not so much. \nI'm not going to lie, when I first saw this series as one to watch I thought it was going to be like the everyday typical magical girl anime, but I was 100% wrong on that theory. Now dont get me wrong here, it is very much a magical girl show and there is absolutely no doubt about it, however one thing that I found that separated it from the others of the genre\n          \n        was the fact it was dark, and somewhat heavy. The plot liine is one that kept you guessing, and at first I was skeptical to even go through with watching it. But once the girls were visited by the Incubator and offered to become magical girls, thats where they began to put Madoka in a different category. \nNow when it comes to the art work, I myself wasnt to thrilled about it, but after seeing what happens when they go into labyrinths and fight the evil witches the art work in itself was completely different then what I was used too. It was co.colorful and abstract, and that's something i'm not used to seeing, so after I got over the 'this is kind of weird' feeling I felt like it made up for the what seemed like minor effort on the rest of it, eg: the characters, although, it hasnt been the worst artwork i've ever seen and therefore it was bearable.\nBasically, when it comes to this series, putting it all together, it was enjoyable, fun, emotional and colorful. The plot line didnt suffer and it kept me  hooked and with that said I'd probably even watch it again if given the chance.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    If you glanced at my scoring, no doubt you noticed something odd. There is a 2 at the Enjoyment column and yet the overall score is 8. Let me explain...\nMadoka Magica is about wishes. If you had been granted one wish, anything in the world, what would it be? Think carefully! Are you sure you are ready to deal with the consequences for the rest of your life? \nMost anime fans know who Urobuchi Gen is. Some see him as the second coming of Akira Kurosawa and Edgar Allan Poe. Some see him as an overrated, talentless hack. Some see him as something else. However,\n          \n        one thing is for certain: everything he made and every project he was involved in became incredibly controversial. He takes long standing concepts and tropes in anime, and turns them on their head, he makes fun of the entire medium in his own twisted way, and yet he always manages to leave something profound behind. Something, that sticks with you, but you don't want it to. It's like the scab after you fall off your bike.\nMahō Shōjo Madoka Magica is a magic girl anime. Well, duh, it's in the name, right? But that's the trap. If you go into watching this series expecting something like Sailor Moon or other mahō shōjo series, you will be surprised. Like being sucker-punched with a bowling ball surprised. I'll be blunt, this anime is full of anguish, suffering, crying and nihilistic dread. It's the Urobutcher's signature world, where kindness is naivité, courage is recklessness and self-sacrifice is meaningless. Where all good deeds earn their due punishment. There is no empirical \"good\" or \"evil\", there are no clear cut heroes and villains, everything is subjective. Gen creates the kind of anime, that doesn't hold your hand, but it teaches you the hard lessons about life no other anime would dare touch with a ten foot pole. It drags your soul through a field of glass shards, but the weird thing is, after all said and done, you'll be thankful for the experience.\nSHAFT's art style and Urobuchi's writing is a match made in haven. It not only shows off the tremendous power behind the story, but the switches between animation styles and color schemes creates an incredible visual experience. It's not \"weird\" for weirdness sake, every bit of detail on screen has it's own meaning. Even when the visuals don't make sense or confuse you, it's because it meant to confuse you. To incite feelings you won't get watching other anime. Confusion, despair, pain, loneliness, feeling lost or hopeless, to know exactly how the characters on the screen feel. The music and sound plays a huge role in this too.\nThere is something profoundly beautiful about how utterly open and unapologetic this anime is about feelings, human lives, hopes and dreams. It's not the sanitized \"kids anime\", where the hero always wins and you can achieve everything if you just fight hard enough. There is a balance of suffering and happiness, and you never get something for nothing. Everything you do has consequences, and you must be prepared to deal with them.\nAs for that 2 in my scoring, I think it's pretty obvious now. I did not have fun watching this anime. During some parts, I felt flat out horrible, I wanted to turn the whole thing off and never touch it again. But somehow it compelled me to see the series to completion and I'm glad I did. The payoff is not a great story, not some great characters, not great visuals, but the things I learned about myself and the world around me. What separates a good anime from a great one is what sticks with you after you finished watching it. And as much as I hate Urobuchi Gen for making me feel these horrible feelings, I'm also thankful that his stories help me put these feelings into perspective."},

Furthermore, the characters all have vivid personalities and opinions, they are very emotive and easy to become attached to.\nBut i have saved the best until last, the drama. This is the most dramatic show I've seen yet, the plot is gripping, deep and it defies logic. Combining this with the peril i mentioned, the struggling of the characters in relation to their situation and you're onto a winner. This show will gradually make you question the definitions of life/being alive, sacrifice, and the greater good - all in 12 episodes which despite everything I've said so far, don't feel rushed.\nI really can't think of any anime audience that wouldn't appreciate this show,   and if you start, i urge you to make it to the end, as the story will continuously shape your feelings until you truly understand what's going from the get go.\nI have done my best, but putting this anime into words has been difficult. Perhaps a final point would be that across the board: from the art, to the sound, to the characters etc. this anime scores highly on all fronts for me. It really is a must-see!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    A deceptively dark and emotionally complex story about the sacrifices of being a magical girl.\n★★★★\n“What is entertainment?” You can answer that it’s anything fun, something that makes you laugh, or whatever keeps your attention. And you’d be right on all of that, but if you cut it down to the most basic idea between them all then it’s that entertainment is really about giving you an emotional experience.\nNobody goes home after a 9-to-5 to watch some asshole go grocery shopping. You already feel like a soul-less, meat husk at work so why do the same thing on your couch? I don’t think anyone hates themselves\n          \n        that much. Action movies are exciting, romance novels are about love, and Holocaust stories are (usually) tragic. It’s great to experience the spectrum of human emotions. Shit feels good.\nThat’s why stories and plots don’t have to be perfect. They don’t have to be airtight with logic because it’s not the point. This is the fundamental behind the suspension of belief. If the story engages you enough—if it connects with you, if it makes a bond—then fuck any cracks in logic. But this isn’t to say a story can be random and silly. It only has to feel consistent.\nEasy examples are time travel stories like Edge of Tomorrow or Bioshock Infinite. They need to be taken with leniency. If you break them down then their stories are nonsense. When you’re watching anything you must actively decide if the sudden plot hole is enough to ruin your enjoyment.\nLiterally everybody who has seen pictures or promotional art of Madoka Magica thinks it’s a show about cute girls doing cute things. It’s not—okay, a little, but it’s about these girls being recruited to become “Magical Girls.” Basically, girls with magic powers, but the show goes deeper into the sacrifices and what it means to be one. It’s not just fun and games.\nThe soundtrack is great, and the art is unique and surreal. The story has this cold tone of isolation. But what I loved the most about the show was how surprising it was. Again, I won’t summarize or spoil anything (because I’m a good person), but Madoka Magica is NOT what you think it is.\nSome warning, but don’t be put off by the first two episodes. Finish episode 3. It starts slow,even confusing. It’s the show’s biggest flaw, but once you finish the series (it’s only 12 episodes), the slow start will make much more sense once you’ve seen the full context of the story.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shojou Madoka Magica, or as I like to call it, \"Higurashi with magical girls\".\nWell, I know what you're thinking, \"HOW COULD HE RATE THIS BELOW A 9!?!?!\"  Well I'll explain why right now.\nSPOILER ALERT (kind of)\nStory, 6/10\nFrom a story telling prospective, the pacing is just flat out bad.  I'm sorry, but \"Madoka\" is the title, and she doesn't do anything relevent until episode 10.  They throw the entire plot at you all in a single episode, and the ending just seemed like a copout to me.  Now that the bad is out of the way, we can talk about the\n          \n        good.  Despite what I've just typed I DID enjoy the story.  Though the pacing isn't good, it does manage to keep watching from episode to episode wondering what's going to happen next, so for that I give it a 6/10.\nArt, 9/10\nThe artwork is great, not much to be said here.  I loved the animation, especially in the fights against the witches.  The characters move fluently and the witch animation made me feel like I was on some sort of psychedelic.\nSound, 9/10\nIf sound means \"Did the seiyu do a good job?\", then yes, phenominal. The music was awesome too.\nCharacters, 5/10\nProbably the anime's biggest downfall.  Only one or two of the main cast is really developed at all, I'm talking, of course, about Homura and Sayaka. And furthur more, after about halfway through the series, Madoka goes from being a character to a plot device, making everyone's decisions dependant upon what she does, and that really is my biggest problem with this anime.  I wish they would have expanded a little more on the characters, 10 - 12 more episodes would have done this show good in my honest opinion.\nEnjoyment, 7/10\nThis got docked 3 points for the reason mentioned above.  However it was still a hell of a ride to watch.\nOverall, 7/10\nDespite everything in the story, and characters section of this review, it IS a good anime.  It will make you want to know what's going to happen next, which I admire, it's not predictable, but again, in my opinion it doesn't quite live up to the hype that was created, still good, so I do recommend giving it a watch.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    I just got through watching this anime. To say the bare minimum this is the most interesting anime I've watched.\nThe story ties together many ideas, concepts, themes and elements such as magical girls, logic vs emotions, sacrifice, good-intentions vs alterier motives, aliens, and a bunch of other stuff, but to me, the core theme was always the emotional side of things. Half way through the anime, the big twist reveals itself, I won't spoil anything but it has to do with both emotions and the lack of emotions. Now at that preteen age we fluxiuate between hope and dispear to the extremes to the point\n          \n        of extremes but I think this can speak to anyone really.\nI think this is a great anime not because it's smart or clever but because I think it understands what it means to be over emotional and I think understanding counts for more than a clever, well-written story and it's presented in a really cool, imaginative and entertaining way.\nI think the directing is great for this sort of thing. Yuki Kaijura did the music, you may know her work in Tsubasa Cronicles, .Hack//Sign and Nior. Her music really helped the show a lot, I don't think I'd enjoy the show if it had terrible music. This isn't Yuki's best work but it helps to make the scenes more interesting and when it does show off the best songs, it REALLY shows off.\nThe art/animation/cinematography is really worth noting. It works with the music, almost coregraphed to it at times. The action scenes are great, the dramatic scenes are beautiful, but what I was most surprised at is the talking scenes. I can't remember the last time I was entertained by listening to a plot twist being explained and lectured to me. The part I have in mind is in episode 9 (or was it 10?) The reveal, the secret exposed.\nSo with that, I have to say that Madoka is an amazing anime but I can't promise you'll like it if you lack sympathy, empathy or what-not and that's not a bad thing, also you'll probably won't like it if you hate melodrama because this series is chalked full of it but it is sort of nessesary to the theme of the show so you can't really blame it for that :P\nBut if you are looking for a very unique, cool, sad, emotional, epic,  MODERN TRAGEDY check this show out.\nAlso, in my opinion, this is one of the best directed show out of any anime, movie, TV Show to come out since the year 2005.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    For my second review, I thought I should review an anime that I enjoyed, one that everyone has probably heard of. “Puella Magi Madoka Magica”, or  alternatively “Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica”, or “Mahou Shoujo Philosophical Nonsensica”, or just “Rape”.\nI went into this anime pretty much how I imagine everyone else did, as an innocent child… right. But this anime took that \"innocence\" and beat it to a bloody pulp.\nWhen I first saw the art and description, I thought it was going to be one of those animes that would warm my heart and stuff, with cute little magical girls doing cute things, where hilarity\n          \n        would ensue and I would puke out rainbows so on and so forth. Right... (apparently I missed the “Horror and Psychological” tags)\nAfter the first episode I was left confused, wondering “When do I get to see Madoka fly into a pole?”. I was thinking, that would maybe kick in the next episode. But so came the next episode, where aforementioned scene was nowhere to be found, and I was left even more confused. Which led to the infamous 3rd episode. \nI was starting to enjoy this anime, sure it wasn’t all what I had expected, but the character of Mami was total badass, and Madoka was finally going to join ranks with her, and my hopes of 'Madoka flying into a pole' were looking up. But then they took all that away from me and the anime proceeded on to become one of the darkest animes I have ever watched. From there on, with each episode spiraling me deeper and deeper into despair, the only thing keeping me going was a box of tissues and some Viagra… I mean… Zoloft.\nAnd then it brought me episode 10 which finally brought hope back into my world, only to be shot down again almost instantaneously *sigh*. At this point I could only wonder how the ending could ever give me any closure. Well..\nAs for the ending, I’m not quite sure how to felt about it. It had me more confused than you probably are now reading this review. It seemed like an ending written by Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, and the director of Inception, trying to mindfuck you so hard, you end up getting an aneurysm, giving up on all reason, and just accepting what they throw at you. At least that’s what happened to me. \nTime isn‘t a constant? Okay. The universe started as an infinitesimally small point? Seems legit. The universal laws of physics don‘t apply to black holes? Sure. The moon is made of cheese? Why not. At some point I gave up trying to think too hard and just accepted it. \nDespite being violated in body mind and spirit, I quite liked this anime. It was interesting and original. I did think that the middle episodes were a tad bit slow. However it kept me looking for that light at the end of the tunnel… which happened to be a train -_-’ . . . a train of philosophical bullshit and theoretical nonsense, yeah thanks ‘Shaft’. I do wish I got some warning beforehand, although I suppose if the pedobear were walking around town carrying a sign saying “Warning: Rapist” it would raise a couple flags… then again any bear walking around town carrying anything would raise a couple flags. Where was I? Oh right.\nAll in all I 'would' recommend this anime. It is definitely something different and is worth a try. The music is absolutely amazing with the soundtrack from Yuki Kajiura still giving goosebumps every time I listen to it. The opening song by ClariS was nice and catchy, even if the opening animation was just a pack of lies. Might as well play “Friendship is Magic” as an introduction to “Grave of the Fireflies”. The animation was a mix between square moe blobs, to magazine cut outs, to cotton balls with mustaches... um...  ‘Shaft’? What the hell were you smoking? \n(This review is a reflection of what I thought of the anime, would I recommend it, so on and so forth. I didn't want to risk spoiling the anime, or write a boring regurgitation of plot and character. You can find one of those on wiki :p. I wanted to keep this short and entertaining. With that said, I do hope you enjoyed reading this review.)"},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    I never thought I would give a magical garment girl a chance. Not my type of anime at all. I saw that SHAFT put it together and I decided to give it a run for its money. I love SHAFT's way of artwork and putting stories together. Boy was I shocked when I watched this.\nStory: Is about a group of middle school girls who struggle between making a wish so they can become the magical girls. But when they crossed over into the witch realms things turn into a DARK anime all of a sudden. The story is so dark that I'm in love with\n          \n        it. This took magical girls to a whole different level.\nArt: SHAFT presented this category in the most amazing way. The real world is sort of cutesy and everything is normal. When they jump into the Witch zones everything becomes artsy and demented. It's one of the coolest things I've seen in an anime to date. It's like everything is drawn with crayon and colored pencil packed into a can of Hi-Def.\nSound: Not much said, Sounds great.\nCharacter: The building on the characters is actually quite incredible. You feel yourself on an emotional roller coaster with every single one of them. Bonds will be formed.\nEnjoyment: I feel bad saying I enjoyed such a dark anime about magical middle schoolers.  But, this anime was quite an emotional great ride.\nOverall: If you don't enjoy magical girls, I suggest giving it a try. The dark story it has takes everything to a whole separate level. It's very much worth watching at least one time around. The transformation scenes aren't drastic nor take up more then 5 or 10 seconds on screen. It's focus is more on the story then the visual impact of the magical girls.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    When you first hear this name, to be honest, it doesn't sound appealing. Magical Girls are such a large stereotype in the anime world. They simply appear too often and are overly repetitive plot wise. However, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica completely goes out of the box in this aspect.\nSure, theres magical girls but it isn't like sailor moon (not that Im saying its bad... just an example of a stereotype). This anime goes much deeper down and shows some conflicts of life, and how your decisions can effect people. Its unique storyline drags you in immediately. The second you hit play on that episode you\n          \n        know its much different than just about any other magical girl anime you've seen. There is still a main protaganist, but the reason behind the powers are much more explained and not extremely random like, \"I'm a creature made from magic, I'll grant you powers!\" It actually shows great reason behind, but not taking it to a comical level.\nNext, the art. The art in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is..... decent. It isn't the BEST art I've seen. It is more of a simple style, less complex in a way, in fact the background has more detail than the characters in some scenes. Now that doesn't mean the art was TERRIBLE. It went with the anime quite well, and it didn't add a comedic value which would have destroyed the atmosphere throughout the story. \nThe animation and sound were quite well done. Sometimes it feels like you peer a bit too much into the characters minds. There are no choppy transitions or any over exaggerated actions. Well... an over exaggerated action would be nearly impossible considering this is still a fantasy-action genre..... The music was quite unique as well. It helps add onto the serious story of the anime. There wasn't much silly tunes, or music that seemed out of place. \n\nNow I give this anime an 8-9 for its superb, and unique storyline. This review is constructed out of MY opinion and under no circumstances does it put your opinion down. Not recorded on my profile, but I've taken experience from the 100's of animes and mangas Ive seen into this review and done my best. All I have to say now is, YOU MUST WATCH THIS ANIME, well at least try. \n"},

It is rather a story about the horror of what magical girls could be. It answers the who they fight, why they fight, and who gave them their powers all with a sinister twist. So my recommendation is really high unless you are looking for Sailor Moon or Tokyo Mew Mew, because that is far from what this show actually is. It is rather a deconstruction of the magical girl genre that is so pervasive in anime, and showing the potential darker side of magical girls.\n          \n        This anime is available in subbed and dubbed, both of which are good.

I had tried to finish others in the past but they were too slow, had pathetic characters, and much more... This show however through me for a loop... It was a DARK MAGICAL GIRL SHOW!!!! \nDark in the sense that people died, background stories were dark and twisted, and one could not help but feel sad. It was greatly entertaining for me. I suggest that only teenagers and older watch this show... for it is not a lighthearted show for children, even if the art suggests\n          \n        that. \nThe audience for this show could be anyone who is a teenager or older, for it has many mature and interesting themes within it. \nOnly complaint: did not like the ending too much... I don't want to make a spoiler, but I thought there could have been a better way to end it... but it was a good ending overall. :) So not a really big complaint.\nAlso: before I rated the story I watched an anime review on youtube by arkada, so some of the numbers may be influenced by that.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="                          \n    This is not a child’s magical girl show like Sailor Moon. It is extremely dark and asked questions that may just make you feel very small in the world. Seriously, this show depressed me slightly with its sort of morbid idea of what a magical girl does. We follow a young girl who is given a rather rare chance to make one wish come true but in doing so, she must become a magical girl and fight evil known as witches. A no brainier right? Who wouldn’t want to be a hero and get their wish granted at the same time? But like all good\n          \n        things in real life, there is a price that has to be paid. Sadly, to tell you would ruin the whole mystery behind the show and so it leaves me at a loss, how do you review a show that you can say very little about without spoiling anything? \nI will try to do as best I can without losing the mystery. We will start out speaking about the characters. Madoka Kaname is well… she was boring to me at first. A girl who was the typical cute and moe anime girl who had nothing bad going for her. Hell, at times I even thought this show was going to just be about how even more perfect she could become but I was soon mistaken as not only the story went down a dark path but also the imagery. She and her friend soon find themselves following magical girl after magical girl and their own takes on what it means to be a hero as well as what they wished for. Her friend had already picked her wish, so what would a girl who is so happy want? That was what kept me going, wanting to know more and more about what was going on. After a bit, it felt like they were just pulling me around. \nThe imagery is slightly troubling, sometimes rather clean and perfect and then other times it looks like puppetry. I’m not saying it’s bad, far from it in fact. The artwork is stunning but there are times like for the witches where the characters feel like they are paper puppets moving. Anything in the witch’s world is also this sort of puppet style with odd squiggles and designs drawn on them. The colors normally look like they are dark and settle. When you are outside the witch’s world, the show actually feels very minimalist and clean lined. It’s very futuristic with bright, almost blinding, lights and pastel colors. Surprisingly for Shinbo’s work, there is not all that much of the little girl naked images that we know from him so that was a bit of a plus for me. There was some but not much.\nThe dub voices are another matter though. Many of the voices just feel they don’t work. Madoka’s was just annoying at times because of her sweet and innocent voice that was so high pitched. Some of the other voices seemed a little to childish but then again, they are middle school so I guess it’s alright. In the end, the sounds were what brought everything all together."},

Another thing I like to add is that tries hard to make you feel emotional and sympathize with the characters is utterly corny and unappealing to me. The emotions of those little teenage girls is completely nothing to the sheer scale of the universe and it makes me gag when they try to impress with their timid\n          \n        visuals. \nThe show tries to show how our decisions our not as black and white as we think but in reality everything is grey and no matter how emotional we are, we are not even a speck in the universe and our actions are just the will of a natural order or chaos. Humans are no different than animals and we just like to think we are different from them but were are just creatures who are only pawns in a universal game of cruel chess. \nIn other words this anime wasn't awful but I do not dare call myself a fan of this highly overrated girly anime for silly fan boys obsessed with magical girls.\n        "},

story play out, but I have to say that when I\n          \n        initially watched I didn't totally get it until the end and I only now appreciate it.\nI had never seen any of the magical girl anime's before and now after this, I find it hard to find any other good ones that had story like this and despite it's cutesy, innocent art style it was a pretty dark show, there are a few plot twists here and there that are complete spoiler material so I can't really get into to many details but the main concept was there was a cute cat thing named kyubey who searches for young girls to make a contract with him to become a magical girl that fights witches for one wish.\nThis show goes into the realism of being a magical girl as it shows how dangerous it can be and many of the magical girls suffer from some form of PTSD, not to mention the fact that there is a price to becoming a magical far greater than perceived.\nAgain this show's art style is misleading but is beautiful in it's detail but the only thing that I didn't like at first was some of the almost live action like objects strewn about the battles with the witches but eventually I came around to accept it.\nSoundtrack:\nLike the art style of the show the opening is a little misleading but is still pretty good and fits in for about the first 4 episodes but after that when the tone of the show completely changes the opening just didn't make any sense.\nthe main soundtrack is probably among one of the best soundtracks I have heard and was conducted by Kajiura Yuki.\nBottom line the soundtrack was good enough for me to mention it.\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this anime were about average to me but in their own respects they were pretty well developed and even complex characters at times, this anime keeps it's character count to a minimum so it can focus on them.\nThe first character I want to address is Madoka, our main protagonist who isn't really my favorite character but she does keep the story going, now if you are expecting to see her turn into a magical in the first episode then you are going to be very disappointed, Madoka really never turns into a magical girl and almost seems kinda useless at times when her friends who turn into magical girls and she can't really do anything until, a major plot twist occurs, that is all.\nThen there is Sayaka who is madoka's best friend and person who turns into a magical girl first and fights witches while madoka watches from the side lines, but it is though her character where we see the entire process a magical goes through which is kinda tragic.\nHomura Akemi who is likely the best character starts out like kind of a bitch who is always preventing madoka from become a magical girl by even killing Kyubey (who regenerates anyway) and it's unknown why she does it until the first major plot twist.\nThen there is Sakura who is basically a sort of badass tsundere/spear wielding magical girl who kind of becomes a problem at first until she becomes more friendly later on, at first she seems like a mean loud mouth character but it comes to a point when you kinda need that character and her point of view.\nKyubey, I hate Kyubey.\nFinally there is Mami who is the first magical girl madoka meets and pretty much informs about how the whole magical girl system works and doesn't get much development but that was mainly because she was already developed and mature so there wasn't any where else for her to go but she remains one of my favorite characters because of her maturity.\nSub vs. Dub:\nI'm going to have to say in terms of voice acting this is a draw, the voices in both japanese and english are very close and despite slight differences the characters are very well portrayed in both versions.\nAs far as other things go I prefer the english dub because this show isn't particularly straight forward and it's pretty complex in it's story telling for which the sub got confusing wile the english had the benefit of interpreting all of the aspects of the story to me, so I could pretty much get it's point.\nThe sub is a little better for re-watching after see in the english dub and fully understand the story.\nFinal verdict:\nI'm giving this anime an 8,\nit wasn't the best anime I had seen at that time and it took a while for me to really appreciate it,\nbut this is the sort of anime that you have to sort of watch twice or more after you totally understand it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if your not into complicated stories.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Madoka Magica is one of the most popular animes to date because it's the darkest magical girl genre anime. What do I think of it? Well, let's see:\nStory (10/10)\nOk, It's hard to explain the story without spoiling it so I won't explain much. Basically, a cat named Kyubey visits a young fourteen year old moe called Madoka and her immature yet sister like friend, Sayaka. What does Kyubey want to do? Make her a magical girl! What is a magical girl? A bunch of chicks with a gimmick like power who fight witches for the rest of their lives! Madoka and Sayaka come across two\n          \n        girls: Homura, a new student in Madoka's class who's later revealed to be a magical girl. She's mysterious and tells Madoka (Not Sayaka) not to become a magical girl. The other girl is Mami, a sister like figure who shows a demonstration on what magical girls do within two episodes. Mami also seems to be a good friend of Kyubey's and knows Homura from somewhere. So that's pretty much the synopsis. I had given the story a ten because everything is explained. And it all fits in. Even though people say the first two episodes are boring. I find them average. The ending? It was downright AWESOME!\nArt (7/10)\nNow we get to the weakest part: The animation. Now, the animation is not bad. I just don't like the character animations. They make it more obvious that the show was fake then Attack on Titan did and yes, I do mean that. If it weren't for the witch world, the art would have gotten a five but I like the witch world a lot. Even though your six year old brother may have nightmares by episode 3 because of it. But I really like how the character animations blend with the witch world background animations. To be honest, this would have gotten an eight if it weren't for the witch world's one flaw: I THOUGHT I WAS HIGH THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT!\nSound (9/10)\nNow, Madoka Magica has one of the best anime soundtracks I have heard to date. Not THE best but one of them. Before, you ask, I liked the ending theme better then the opening theme. The reason I gave sound overall a nine is because in the English dub, the acting is... Bad. But English dubs always are and in the Japanese dub, Homura and Mami sound... the same... DON'T FANBRAT! I didn't like how the conversation between the two guys on the train was an ACTUAL conversation in the Japanese dub. Yeah, the voice acting wasn't dislikable but it was clearly lazy.\nCharacter (10/10)\nMy favourite part of the series... Again, don't fanbrat.\nMadoka is a pretty nice protagonist. She doesn't want to harm anyone and is pretty relatable to the viewer. She's also brave and gets stronger as she experience all of the violence she is experiencing. Soon, she has a heart which makes her capable of being an almost invincible magical girl stronger then all of the main five combined according to Kyubey.\nHomura has got to be my favourite character. Mainly because of how developed she is. When Madoka and Sayaka first meet her, she's a stuck up, yet mysterious girl who Sayaka hates but Madoka is slightly interested in. It turns out she starts off as a typical moe girl and can't do math or sport. She meets Madoka who is a magical girl but she and Mami gets killed so Kyubey turns Homura into a magical girl and her wish grants her the power to travel through time. She keeps trying to save Madoka but keeps watching her die in the same way over and over. She then grows cold and sly where she takes out her braids explaining the split in her hair and she gets fantastic at math and sport after repeating it in a time loop. This time, she is determined to save Madoka in the time loop the anime takes place in.\nA lot of people hate Sayaka and no, I do not see why. I can't talk about her because it would spoil ALOT (Technically what I just said about Homura is a spoiler) so I'll just say I like her.\nMami\nI like her. Although, her full backstory isn't explained in the show but is explained in the game, I think she's a nice sensei like character... I LOVE OLDER SISTER FIGURE CHARACTERS!\nKyoko is a very likable character. She starts off as a typical brat but it is later revealed that she has a good reason to be that way. Sure, like Mami, they go more in depth with her backstory in the game but the anime gets it pretty straight fowardly explained.\nKyubey... IS A PEST! Ok, I know he has no emotion but this guy sent me into five minute depression! You should know what I'm talking about when you watch it but in episode 3, HE JUST SMILES! I DON'T CARE IF IT'S HIS ONLY EMOTION IN THE ANIME, AT LEAST CAN HE TURN AROUND? SHIELD HIS EYES? HIDE WITH THE GIRLS? ANYTHING!? Sorry, that got away from me. Meh. I have met a lot of worse characters then Kyubey but still.\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10)\nSo yeah, this anime was awesome. Now, is it my favourite anime of all time because it's one of the only animes I gave a ten? No. My favourite is Railgun and I gave that a nine so what do you expect? Hmm... I wonder what I would look like as a magical girl?\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Now, think of any memorable anime of the magical girl genre. The first thing that would come to mind would be Sailor Moon. If you were me, you would say Cardcaptor Sakura (Can you blame me? Those asshats at the Indian network wouldn't let me see the former. Even then it was great, and you should totally check it out subbed). If you were a fan of Go Nagai, you would say Cutie Honey. These anime set the standard of the magical girl genre, with Cutie Honey setting the standards for magical girl transformation. However, by today standards, it didn't age well. Now, don't get\n          \n        me wrong, these animes are pretty good (If you don't believe me, check out the Nostalgia Critic's review of Sailor Moon, though he wasn't mostly positive about it [The guy almost got shot for it!]. But mentioning it was good enough for me), but not many people would be drawn into it today. Kids might get a kick out of it, and we may be no toddler, but we can grow to love these shows too. But showing it to someone else is like showing your mom your hentai collection, it's really uncomfortable. So, Akiyuki Shinbou decided to save the seemingly dying genre, and show fans everywhere, that the way of the magical girl still had that magic. Good news - It worked! It was critically acclaimed and loved by fans, to point of making their own community. It was a cutesy enough to fit the genre, but mature enough for the older audiences. The Bad news.....Gen Urobuchi is the series writer, so childhood memories will burn. So, let's grab our magical talking cats, don our flashy sailor uniforms and dive into the bright, magical, sick and twisted world of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\nStory - 9/10\nNow let's take the common elements of the magical girl genre and give it a good ol' twist. In a magical girl anime, we have the girls who gain magical powers to save the world, the cute mascot who gives girl said powers, monsters whose job is to wreck shit up, and the villains who wants to, stop me if you heard this one, take over the world *OF COURSE!!!!*. So, let's twist it a little. Instead of monsters, let's add witches who hold an eerie secret. And instead of a clear villain, let's give them minor ones who will only last an episode, but help interpret the eerie secret. Instead of a cute mascot, let's give them an even cuter mascot, who is responsible for witches who hold the answers to said eerie secret. And let's have the girls go out and save the world, only to lose their shit when they learn said eerie secret. See a pattern? The plot is basically a dark twisted version of the common elements of the magical girl anime. Some people think that a certain overused trope will grow and turn stale after a while. But in the case of Madoka Magica, you can point out the tropes, and notice that it isn't as stale as they make it out to be. Kind of like cheese, you keep it out long enough to remove its 'CHEESINESS', and it tastes great. If you love the magical girl series, you'll love it. Some of you might be riding on you experience and memories to get any enjoyment out of it (Although highly recommend AGAINST depending on the latter, otherwise it will end up breaking up like an egg under a steamroller with DIO doing Gangnam Style and calling you a pussy). If you want to introduce it to someone who just got into anime, then what the FUCK is WRONG with you?!?!?! Oh, and do watch something light-hearted afterwards, it may or may NOT help recuperate your newly added scar.\nArt - 8/10 (7.65/10)\nDon't let the low score fool you, the art is very well handled, considering the fact that Studio Shaft was behind the pencil of the series. The character designs were cute and very well designed, fitting for the genre. It definitely helps mask the dark themes and undertone. The transformation sequence, which is a staple in the magical girl genre, was pretty good, and it gets an even shinier coat of polish in the Blue-Ray releases. But by far my most favourite part of this department has to be the witch fights. At first glance, the witch's labyrinth looks like a psychedelic drug trip, but when inspected closer, it actually shows an image of who they were. Like the mask that Yamask holds, it reminds them of who they were in their past life. And you know what's even CREEPIER? It's the fact that the anime and the Pokemon Gen 5 games were released in the SAME YEAR! THAT'S #@&*ING CREEPY!! Well, Pokemon conspiracy aside, these battle scenes are very well drawn and choreographed. The witch's design and movement varies from one to another. One may look like a shadow puppet, which adds more to the aesthetic considering they are cruel puppets of fate due to aforementioned eerie secret, to something that came out of Merry Melodies on CRACK, which even helps in showing their inner crazy. Some shot compositions are very well done, showing the emotions and inner workings of the character's mind, even showing scenes where they feel like gritting their teeth and grimace. You ever felt like you want to punch somebody in the face, but you can't because that asshole is your boss, and he is marrying your sister, AND he is giving you a salary of a whopping $500,000, PER WEEK? Kind of like that. So, why the low score?\nThere are some scenes that fall in the 'what-the-#@&*-happened-in-the-middle' category. There are some scenes where the character's actions feel pasted in, and the middle part is cut off. It's like watching someone dive and that someone is Diavolo. He is up in the air, ready to dive, and the next second he's skinny dipping with Rihanna and a Tunisian Fashion model. WHAT THE #@%& HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE? And there were some scenes where the character's mouth wouldn't move much. I can let it slide, if budget was the cause of this anomaly.\nAll in all, it's showcases what Studio Shaft is good at, pulling a Shaft, and that's a plus in my book.\nSound - 8/10\nNothing noteworthy in the Seiyuu (I watched the series subbed, and by the way, the Seiyuu for Kyubey is spot on), or in the OST department, unless we are talking about the battle music, with the opera and choir, in the background. Now let's talk about the OP and ED. The OP is pretty nice and beautiful. Definitely says, 'This is definitely NOT a psychological thriller'. The same can be said....for the 1st Ending. It's the 2nd ED, where it reveals the show's TRUE colors. This is 'Magia' by kalafina. Its dark, it has sweet guitar riffs, and definitely matches the tone of the show. For some reason, when I watch this ending I feel like I want to watch the next episode. It's like a glass of water. After you're done with the main course, and one glass later, you're ready for dessert. There's a reason why Watchmojo placed it at #1 in 'Top 10 Best Anime Endings'. It may not be MY favourite ED, but it's definitely ONE of my favourites. That’s a bit contradictory when I think about it.\nCharacter - 10/10\n***************Warning - Minor Spoiler Ahead. Skip this bit to enjoy the experience of the best part of the series***************\nIf there's someplace where the series REALLY shines, its character.\nLet’s look at the characters and see what we have here? We have Madoka, the innocent main character, who wants to help save the world. Sayaka, she is the hopeless lovebird who can't find the time for love due to her responsibilities. Kyouka, the smug bitch who is competitive, who is basically a tsundere when boil down to it. Mami Tomoe, the one who introduced the girls to the world of magic. But I guess the best term to describe her would be (if you're a Megaman fan you'll get this) 'Zero'. That means a paramount figure, encouraging the protagonist, or in this case-the girls, to become stronger and better than who they are now. Kyubey is a, as I established before, a REALLY cute mascot who is, since the comic book 'The Sandman' by Neil Gaiman, is an accurate portrayal as the devil. But by far, my favourite character has to be Akemi Homura, who at first looks like your dark and mysterious anti-hero, who is kinda like the opposite of the main protagonist, but once you get to know her story, you want to give her a hug.\nNoticed something funny? If you thought, \"they were unique\", well, with the exception of Kyubey, no. But you were pretty close. After all, unique elements come from original characters with a good ol' twist (YEAH!!!! TWIST IIIIIIIIIT!!!) If you chose \"Hey, I saw those characters before\", well, with the exception of Kyubey, yes. In fact, you DID see them before, but with a much lighter tone. What Urobuchi did is use those character archetypes and gave it a splash of grit, reality and BOOM! You have the best characters ever concocted by Gen Urobuchi, let alone in a magical girl anime. And can we talk about the side characters, with the little time they were given; they contributed SO much to plot and character development. Especially the mother, BEST MOM EVER! Madoka, you're a lucky bastard (And that's a compliment, considering the fact that the person who said that is living in the Bowels of Pain).\nMany people usually complain about Gen Urobuchi's heavy dialogue and exposition. But he will always land an uppercut of good writing and excellent character that would give Charlotte a run for her cheesecake (I'M NOT KIDDING! There's a picture of him beating the poor thing!). But then again, we have the exposition-go-round from Fate/zero, so I see where you were coming from.\nEnjoyment -9/10\nDid I enjoy it? Gee, I don't know, maybe the 9/10 wasn't good enough to convey the fact that I loved it. My only issue would be the one problem I mentioned in the art department, but does that really matter in the end? I mean, it’s good, no wait, that’s an understatement. I mean, it’s a masterpiece. The charm of the magical girl elements, mixed with mature themes really added to the enjoyment factor. The series twisted elements, that fans like us would appreciate, EVEN today, and what other modern day viewers would deem *ahem* \"dated\". That is, of course, until they come knocking at your door and asking for a DVD copy of 'Sailor Moon', who definitely watched Madoka Magica, and are now, eating their words with a dash of irony (EAT IIIIIT!!!). It definitely was the anime that saved the magical girl genre. Look at 'Yuki Yuna is a Hero', 'Penguindrum', 'Kill la Kill', 'YuriKuma Arashi', 'fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya' (TwiTcH tWitcH) or the 'Cardcaptor Sakura' manga reboot. If not for Madoka Magica, they would not be here today. For you see, Madoka Magica was to magical girl, what Neon Genesis Evangelion was to mech. However, if you're a magical girl veteran, you might get a kick out of it (Why not? You ARE a veteran, right?). My other issue might be the fact that there will NEVER be a show like this, EVER AGAIN. However, word in the grapevine says, which is weird and creepy considering grapevines do not talk, that Gen Urobuchi is working on a light-hearted magical girl anime. Yeah, why don't you tell that to Lupin III (Maybe we would've believed you, if you were Junji Ito)!\nOverall - 9/10\nDo I recommend it? Yes, mostly. Like I said, if you like magical girl anime, you'll love this one for its dark, mature take on the genre. If you love shows like 'Psycho Pass', then you'll love it too. If you are a newcomer to the genre, RUN. Stay AWAY from this anime and watch 'Sailor Moon', ‘Cutie Honey’, ‘Princess Knight’ or 'Cardcaptor Sakura' instead. RUN, before you find yourself under a steamroller, with Heaven's DIO convincing Kriemheld Gretchen to join his legion over Ginger Tea and Scones, while Vanilla Ice, not THAT Vanilla Ice, does the Can-Can and calls you a bitch. Honestly, I heard there was a movie trilogy, and I can't WAIT to check it out.\nNow, if you can excuse me, I need to work on my next project. Elf spotting, Doppelganger fishing and, of course, a ride to.......the.....FUTURE!!!! Minus the hover boards………*Bummer*."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Slight spoilers, nothing major but I would wait until you've watched the series to read this.\nI think the best kinds of entertainment are those that are unexpected, the ones that take you by storm in ways you never thought they would. They leave you unable to even put into words how great you think it is.  By those standards, Madoka Magica is one of the all time best, most beautiful, well rounded pieces of media I've ever experienced. From start to finish, Madoka Magica is a tour de force of thrills, twists, deep emotions and stellar design. It’s hard to prepare yourself for the\n          \n        sheer amount of content it holds, but after it’s all said and done, nothing I’ve seen has left me in awe quite like Madoka Magica.\nAt its core, Madoka Magica appears to be about magical girls. Madoka Kaname stumbles across Kyubey, a being that can grant wishes and turn you into a magical girl. But the further in you get, the more it twists the genre until there's nothing left that you recognize. There's clues and hints smattered throughout the first two episodes, but after the third episode, the reality of what these girls are up against hits you, and it's not pretty. And that's one of the best things about Madoka Magica is the huge amount of subtext. Not only is it a complete destruction of the magical girl genre, it's themes are rooted in a wide range of places. Themes of German folklore, religion, and human history are just the beginning of what you can expect out of the series. But none of these elements overshadow the main story or characters. These themes work as supplements to further the mythology of this wonderfully crafted world and leaves you wanting to learn more. For a show about magical girls to become this deep and complex, and to work as perfectly as it does, is an absolute miracle.\nI would love to go in depth to the story (especially the ending), but I would hate to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it. I can say this: in 12 episodes, Madoka Magica tells a more complete, wholly satisfying story than almost any long form story I’ve ever seen. The twists and turns that the main characters experience are all meaningful, and every decision and moment in the series matters. There aren’t any moments I can think back to that don’t add up to the conclusion. There are certain character decisions that have been questioned by the fanbase, but they aren’t illogical enough to detract from the rest of the story. While the ending is up for debate in some people's minds, I found it justified and a satisfying finish.\nThe art style/production design of the show is top notch. The magical girl designs themselves are deceptively cute, making it even worse when everything goes batshit. It's a great parallel to see such innocent looking characters battle the Lovecraft-ian witches. Each time a character travels into a witch's' labyrinth is a treat to the eyes. The harsh mix of cartoony realism and grim colors in said labyrinths is a treat to the eyes. The soundtrack is an unexpected masterpiece, truly fitting of a series so unique. If you heard any track outside of the show with no context, you'd probably never guess it's from Madoka. From beautiful violins to ominous chanting, Yuki Kaijura created a soundtrack that is pitch perfect for every scene.\nBut a series is only as good as the characters within it, and our heroines are no slouch. If any one of the main characters was left out, the show would suffer, as they each teach an important lesson in the world of magical girls. I can't say everything I want without spoiling major points, so I'll keep it brief. Madoka herself is a great heroine, a (seemingly) normal girl who is thrust into a world of hell and terror. Her ending is a bit rushed, but watching her grow and accept her role is great. Mami, as the mentor, brings up one of my only complaints: we don't see enough of her. However, her lack of inclusion is completely justified by her role within the story. The same can be said about Kyoko, and learning her tragic backstory makes you sympathize with her brash and obnoxious personality. Sayaka, to me the weakest link, is still a highly personal character. We can relate to the reasons behind her actions, but ultimately we understand why they would never work in this universe. At the end of the day, though, the story is truly all about Homura. To see what she goes through to get to where she is at the beginning of the story is awesome. Her arc is hands down one of the most well drawn out and executed stories I've seen in an anime. And don't forget Kyubey. Don’t forget that little rat bastard.\nIt's hard for me to think of a show that's stayed on my mind as much as Madoka Magica has after I've finished it. It's rich layers and themes have stuck with me for months, and probably will continue to for a long time to come. Even going in, I knew there was more than meets the eye, but I was still unprepared for the whirlwind of emotions I was about to experience. I absolutely cried like a little bitch at the end, and will most likely again when I rewatch the show. If you're a fan of deep, complex stories, watch Madoka Magica. If you're a fan of magical girl anime, watch Madoka Magica. If you're a living, breathing human being with a brain, watch Madoka Magica. Don’t be sad that it’s over, be happy that you lived during a time where you could watch it."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Wow. I mean... wow! Talk about a anime, that took me completely by surprise! When people say, don't judge book by it's cover, this must be, what they're talking about! \nWhen I first picked this anime up - again, being the last one in the hype-train - I was... well, how to put it... nervous? Not because I wasn't ensured time and time again, that I would really like this anime - which I did - but because the cover, to me, wasn't really... eh, promising? I mean it was nice, and all, but of my sweet sugary Santa Christ, was it ever so girly,\n          \n        and colourful, and so... so peppy, and cheery, and... argh! But when I put it on to play, sat down, and watched the whole thing through - whit one sitting, mind you, 'couse of the 12 episodes lenght - I was genuinely without any thought, or emotion, when this was over... and it was a good thing, because soon after that, I cryed, I cheered, and I put it back on, and watched it again, humming the most beautiful musictracks and opening/ending themes, that I've heard in a long time!\nThis anime, is like if a disney, and studio Chibli had a love child, with multiple personalities and slight depression - it starts out innocently, with nice colours and sweet characters, but when it's let on loose, you get straight in-your-face- moments of sorrow, disbelieve-filled horror, and bittersweet happines, that to me, it was really hard to keep on going, without taking any breaks to breath in time to time! And since the story isn't really anything that deep, or hard to undertand, the characters, their stories nad the themes of the story, are where the strenght of this little anime lies. All the characters had their flaws, their own personalities, and their realistic-yet-tragisch strong points, that kept them memorable, enjoyable, and most of all... relatable. All of them had their own reasons to do, what they were doing, following their very on personalities, their experienses on which they lay their decisions and values upon, and their goals, wheter or not those goals led them to disaster, or not. These characters felt real, realistic people to me, with past, present, and dreams and hopes, that may, or may not come true at all... all because a simple twist of fate, or because 'it wasn't ment to be.' Even the very root of all this misery, that through manipulation and false sence of support and comfort, shatters any inocent and pure dream and soul that it came to contact with, seems somewhat understantable, yet never really someone, that you'd like to understand, or support - like any great villain should be. The characters, good or bad, all do and work, together or their own, depending who they are, and what's their purpose in the story - either sacrifice everything, to save something you hold dear, and be sooner or later punished because of it, or selfishly get all what you can, and accept your place, your purpose and your fate. This doesn't make them look, or feel like a puppets - at least to me - but more like a martyrs or victims in a circumstances, that they'd themselves had little to no way of knowing, or say to really say 'no'. \nAll in all, the situations for these girls, to me, where they had to make a wish to become magical girls, and literally sell their souls away, were like a horribly put-together- weaved plot, to make these girls do things, that they themselves would never do, or want to do, off of their own free will, unless push far enough, and I really felt sorry for them, because of that - wanting to help your father, or save your friend, shouldn't be something, that just bites you in the ass, because of the reasons! But, if some random creature would come to me, when I am my at most vulnerable and unstable state, and said to me, that if I ask any wish ,and it'll come true, to make me better - without any mentionin about the price, or consequenses - I honestly wouldn't know, what to say, or do, to that matter. Sure, we all have one wish, that we would like to come true, just like that and for free, but that's simply not realism - no disney-logic here! Everything has a price, and if you wish something - be it for yourself, or to someone else - you'll always have to pay for it... and these girls payed maybe a little more, than what it was worth! \nNow I know, that I'm at my very best, when reviewing something that I hate, but with a anime, that I just fell in love with... Screw that, I must find something bad to say too! Some of the characters - especially the Madoka herself, wich is a big problem - if often times very weak, and to me, simply annoying most of the times, and even some of the supporting girls, although very interesting and personal, felt somewhat distant to me. The story isn't really that strong, nor complicated, that you should stretch it deedlesly over 20 or so- episodes long show, witch they didn't, thank goodness - 12 episodes is more than enough, for a story like this... no more needed! The art may turn some people away, and the drama between the leading girls may be a big turn-off some some too, but if you really like magical girls, with a surprisingly dark story, heavy yet passable themes, and the conclusion, that'll leave you both crying and cheering at the same time, give this a shot! Don't let the cover, or five first episodes to fool you - just keep going, and let youself get sink into this world, with these characters, and you'll see, why I liked this anime so much.\nStory: 10\nArt: 9\nSound: 10\nCharacters: 9\nEnjoyment: 10\nOverall: 10\n        "},

But in all seriousness, MSMM is one of those anime’s that defy typical conventions in a good way. I mean, we see cute little girls fight eerie monsters in even creepier settings. An American equivalent would be like putting Cinderella in the Children of the Corn. The juxtaposition is fascinating, and I wonder how a 13 year old girl in Japan would have received MSMM? \nStory – 7. **SEMI SPOILER ALERT. Basic premise? Kinda like Scientology. Aliens need energy. Aliens harness energy from women, due to their\n          \n        massive mood swings and emotional instability (offended yet, women?).  Harness consummated by tricking them into becoming “magical girls.” To aliens, emotions are considered mental disorders. So the “Magical girls” fight evil emotions/witches to gain energy. In return for becoming a “Magical girl”, the alien grants the woman one wish. As far as story goes, it adds just enough intrigue for me to sit through it. Sprinkle a little time travel into the mix and you’ve got MSMM. It’s no Stephen King storyline. But thankfully, it’s not Stephanie Meyer either… \nCharacters – 7. MSMM carefully avoids (to its credit) the well-trodden conventions of the Sailor-moon transforming magical powers. Gone are the insanely long and obnoxious sequences of “normal girls” transforming into strong, sexy, and scantily-clad battle babes. Instead, the sequences are more compressed, more modest, and more toned down. This intentional move allows the audience to really focus in on what really matters: the fight sequences and the ambient setting. However, other typical conventions (targeting the teenage girl market) unfortunately appear. We still see your standard cutesy girl get entangled in melodrama, cheesy dialogue, and your requisite deliberation over stupid decisions. Bah. I guess it’s a Japanese culture thing. \nNot much in the character development department. Aside from Madoka’s decision as to whether or not to become a magical girl, most of the girls simply respond to situations as they arise. This isn’t a bad thing, it’s just that we wish we’d gotten to know some of the girls a bit more. Perhaps the movies will tell us!\nAnimation – 9. The strongest point of the series is the animation. Although the art in the “real world” is standard-fare, the fight scenes are where the animation really shines. The art is exceptional. True to SHAFT form, the use of composite, mixed-media, and sketchbook-styled characterization makes an appearance. Over-the-top fight scenes with larger-than-life weaponry are utilized. AWESOME! What’s more, the fight scenes are set in refreshingly creepy environments that linger in my mind still. And the “witches” are nightmare-worthy. In summation, great art direction.\nMusic -7. Watched the OP and the ending once through. Fast-forwarded after that. Nothing to write home about. The ending sequences are particularly atrocious as the WHOLE ending is 1 static picture that slowly pans out. \nEnjoyment – 8. While MSMM isn’t going to be an intellectually stimulating emotional rollercoaster, it doesn’t have to be. Nor should it be. MSMM is a fun, lighthearted, and, at times, an artistic take on the endless simulacra of Sailor-Moon-typed anime on the market. Sometimes after a long day of school/work, MSMM is just what the doctor ordered. "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Minor spoilers ahead. Please proceed with caution.\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is an anime series famous for its dark and cruel twist on the magical girl genre. It is said to be the most intense and haunting magical girl story of all times, which is the main reason why it got me interested. I have been planning to watch it for quite a while, and when I finally decided to start, I entered its world with high hopes.\n	 It turned out the hype it gets is as misleading as the show itself.\nSTORY: 7/10\n	Now, where do I begin... \nBecause I started this anime with the prior knowledge\n          \n        of how dark it’s going to get later on, I was more or less prepared for the sudden twist, where the story stops being a story of moe anime girls trying to decide whether or not they want to become magical and changes into a dark and depressing one. Now, I can only imagine what a shock it must have been to those who started watching without expecting anything of that sort to happen. Sure, there are a few parts in the first few episodes that are a bit unsettling and could make a viewer wonder if there is going to be something else to the story than they expected, but no one would imagine such a cutely designed and magical show to turn out to be…. a not-so-cute-and-magical show. Very far from it, in fact. \n	Madoka Magica turns itself completely upside down after a few episodes, and stays that way for the remaining half. The change is drastic and sudden; even the cutesy ending theme is switched for a creepy, distorted one in the span of one episode. It’s the most misleading beginning of an anime that I have ever seen, even with me knowing that it was going to be like that. \n	I have to say that I enjoyed this twist in the storyline and what followed. I found the concept of the story cool, even if I didn’t yet fully understand what it was all about, what the girls were fighting for, and what the main antagonist’s goal was. The problem I had with the anime was that I was expecting something more grandiose in general. Unfortunately, because of the good reviews I’ve seen on this anime, I overhyped myself, and expected Madoka Magica to be something extremely thrilling. These expectations of mine were gradually blown away by the wind as more and more episodes passed in a manner I found unfitting for such a dark theme. \n	This manner of storytelling was the main thing that ruined the whole experience for me. Because I have heard about the dark theme of Madoka Magica, I thought that the storytelling would be something earth-shattering. When I watched the anime, I had to find that it wasn’t, or at least not for a long while. The problem with Madoka Magica was that, besides some very major points in the plot, it seemed to gloss over certain parts that could have been more developed, that could have had more detail put into them to make the audience feel the gravity of the situation. I think that this anime hasn’t done half as good of a job on that as it could have. The reactions of characters are a good example of this; it was in limbo between being melodramatic and suppressing characters' emotions. This is evident in the notorious Episode 3, where the characters, after seeing something terrible, only assume expressions of frightened little girls, not people who have witnessed a traumatic event. Now I may not be fair to judge, since I haven't been through anything close to what those girls have, but I still think that one would probably scream or at least burst into tears... especially if the person in question is a fragile, innocent girl like Madoka. In any case, characters in general seem to not lose their marbles over things that would generally induce losing of said marbles, or do so in an unexpected and unfitting moment.\n	I would also like to point out how rushed the story was, especially in the first half of the anime. Usually, I don’t mind a fast-paced plot, but with this one, I felt that it was rushed to the point where it was not enjoyable anymore. Madoka Magica did this weird thing of developing certain parts that were not overly important to the story, then casually moving over parts that could have made a greater impact. Also, this constant speeding caused some logical fallacies to occur that further took away from my enjoyment and contentment with this story.\n	First of all, the magical girls themselves. How did it happen that everyone who turned into a magical girl instantly knew how to fight with weapons they probably never handled or even seen before? How come a 14-year-old, puny girl could pinpoint and finish an enemy with a sword as long as herself in an instant? During her first fight ever? And I’m not talking about endurance here, since it was explained in the anime that, due to certain circumstances, magical girls could make a better use of their body without putting themselves into much danger. However, just because one’s physical abilities are boosted doesn’t mean that the person will automatically receive many years of combat experience as well. \nJustifying this with the fact that the girls are magical doesn’t prove anything, either; yes, they can use magic, but battling with manmade weapons still requires training and experience. The girls in Madoka Magica just suddenly seemed to know all about combat, and it annoyed me because that aspect of the story could have been something to improve upon, to spend more time on. Rather than just having children being able to handle weapons immediately, there could have been more detail put into how these girls learn the ways of fighting to be able to face their enemies. From my view, this was just lazy writing. \n	And this was the more trivial of flaws out of all. The one that made me flip a table only occurred later, in the last few episodes. There was actually a point up until Madoka Magica seemed very promising, but then there came the episode that lowered my opinion of this anime drastically (thank goodness that the following episodes were so touching that I decided to go easier on that flaw). Explaining this flaw without spoiling anything would be impossible, but to put it briefly: it was the desperate attempt to explain why magic and magical girls were the way they were that made me ever so frustrated. \n	It was a half-assed attempt at sort of recreating the concept of the Matrix… and throwing some obscure talk about aliens in there for good measure. The nature of those aliens was never discussed, nor was their supposedly hyper-intelligent civilization, which perhaps made it even more annoying.\n	I usually prefer a logical storyline that is explained without any major fallacies, or an abstract one that doesn’t need explaining to be enjoyable. What puts me off is when a story tries too hard to explain itself, to make sense, and then comes up with an explanation that is so ridiculous that one wishes the story was left unexplained. Madoka Magica is a good example of this, and I’m really sorry that it committed such a stupid thing, since it had so much more potential than this. \n	Thankfully, what Madoka Magica botched with its sometimes-careless writing and overexplained yet underexplained plot, it fixed with an emotional finale and an overall concept that was enchanting and horrifying. The backstory of the most misunderstood character, as well as the conclusion, was a tearjerker and finally made me feel something for someone in the show. The idea for the backstory was tragic, explaining the motives of that seemingly shady character, who actually became my favorite from the series. The one issue I had with that part was that it was saved for the very end; I do understand that this was meant to be a plot twist of some sort, but I felt it to be a little sudden. \nThe conclusion was a bit far-fetched, but there was justification for it, I guess, so I accepted it, just because it was so heartbreaking.\n\nART: 10/10\n	While the story didn’t meet some of my expectations, the art of Madoka Magica did not disappoint. It was clear, with a unique, sketchy style, and pleasant colors. The battles were masterfully animated; I almost felt like I was there while it was happening. The coolest thing was when the art changed from its normal style to moving, dancing paper cutouts that were symbolic of monster realms. The backgrounds were also professionally made, to the point where they almost seemed real. There were only minimal amounts of awkward CG. Most of it was executed very well. \nHowever, there were some flops in character designs, namely characters in the background that were hastily scribbled on there. Interestingly, I only noticed this after finishing Madoka and finding screenshots of these mishaps online.\nSOUND: 9/10\n	The Japanese voice actresses have done well at playing the main heroines of the story, but how whiny their voices were sometimes annoyed me (especially Madoka’s voice). Otherwise, great job, but nothing extraordinary to note. \n\nMUSIC: 9/10\n	When I searched up Madoka Magica’s original soundtrack after finishing the anime, I was surprised to find how many OSTs there actually were. The reason I was so surprised is because I didn’t remember hearing a really diverse soundtrack while watching the anime; I can only remember two or three, maybe four. It is true that Madoka Magica reused a few OSTs a lot; and by a lot, I mean so much that one song, Sis Puella Magica, was used at least once in every episode. That song, along with the others I can recall, all bore similar characteristics: female chanting, bells, and/or electronic beat.  From what I can recall, the music was nice and fit the anime’s mood. However, there were certain parts where the angelic music didn’t fit, such as exposition scenes or relatively mundane discussions between characters. This also contributed to the feeling that the same OSTs were being overused. If I were to summarize it, the music  was pretty, but not all that memorable; it did, however, help a lot to enhance the story’s sinister atmosphere.\n	The opening for Madoka Magica was a decent J-pop song that was strangely uplifting for such a depressing anime. The first ending theme was nothing special, but then, it wasn’t really the ending to care about. The one that came next was the real deal; the cute, comforting song was switched to eerie violin and chanting, with simple but chilling animation to emphasize the music. Ending 2 was perhaps the only thing I found really outstanding from the above.\n\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\n	The characters were all right, but still not good enough. Some of the main characters, like Madoka, felt a little bland and undeveloped, while others, like Akemi Homura and Kyouko Sakura, got more character development and had more detailed personalities. Madoka got fleshed out only at the very end of the series, which was quite sudden; perhaps more time would have been necessary to develop her change of mind and newly sprouted confidence. \nSupporting characters were also not too shabby, although they weren’t as important of a focus of the story as the magical girls, so there wasn’t much info given about them. \n	I can’t say I had gotten fond of any of the characters in Madoka Magica… perhaps only Homura, who turned out to be a great and tragic character. But even Homura, along with Kyouko, another protagonist, had their annoying quirks that I couldn’t stand. The way Homura kept flipping her hair even when all of it was already swept behind her shoulders, almost as if trying to make a point out of her every movement (although she might have done that because she wanted to conceal her feelings by acting cold and…. well, sort of bitchy), and Kyoko’s annoying and pretentious eating scenes: they just all felt forced, like the characters were given such habits in order to make them special or some nonsense like that. I think that less exaggeration would have been better. \n	The characters in Madoka Magica were certainly memorable, but not all that likeable. I was mostly indifferent about most of them, but they weren’t over-the-top annoying, which was pleasant.\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\n	Sadly, I couldn’t enjoy this anime as much as I had hoped. The reason for this was all the hype that the show gets. As I have said before in my earlier review on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, it is a sad truth that fans of certain shows tend to ruin the anime experience for others by building up the hype, and thus the expectations of viewers, so high that it will only disappoint, since every little plot hole can be turned against the show if you say it’s flawless. That is also the case with Madoka Magica. While I don’t want to judge it based on this biased view I’ve had from the start, it’s no lie that I was expecting something more impressive from this show. It did have some larger flaws in its plot that annoyed my nitpicking butt, and also most of the characters weren’t as good as I would have liked. I did enjoy watching it, since it was something the likes of which I’ve never seen before, but not as much as I expected I would.\nShort summary:\nSTORY 7/10 - Very intriguing and horrifying, yet it still has problems with pacing and tone. It also has some gaping plot holes that are annoying when you decide to spend time thinking about them. However, the overall story and the emotional ending balance out what the show lacks in consistency. \nART 10/10 - Although very moe, it is pleasant to look at, with the vibrant colors and well-applied CG. \nSOUND 9/10 - The voice actors perform their roles professionally, but their voices as tiny schoolgirls come out as too whiny sometimes. \nThe music is pretty, but you only get to enjoy about one-third of it most of the time, as the two-three most significant OSTs are constantly reused. And by reused, I mean played more than three times in the span of one episode.\nCHARACTERS 6/10 - While some characters are more developed and have moments that make you feel like they are actually real people, the others are just... bland. The main heroine of the show gets almost no character development whatsoever.\nENJOYMENT 7/10 - Doesn't live up to the hype, but it does introduce a new perspective, a story that tells us that a magical girl's life is not all sunshine and rainbows. As a deconstruction, it's well-made, but as a show in general, it has room for improvement.\n\nOVERALL: 7/10"},

I actually finished this a while ago, but I wasn't really sure what to think about it at the time, so I didn't do a review about it then. Well, I've thought about it, so let's take a look. \nStory: The story largely revolves around Madoka, a middle school student, who one day, comes into contact with Kyuubey, a weird cat-like thing, who offers her the chance to have one wish granted in exchange for becoming a magical girl and fighting witches, creatures who bring despair to the world. However, Homura, a transfer student in Madoka's class, doesn't want Madoka to accept\n          \n        Kyuubey's contract and tries to stop her. It initially plays out like it's going to be a cute show, and then it throws several very messed up curveballs largely involving what it actually means to be a magical girl that make it more like a tragedy than fluff. I did love the ending, which brought the story to a nice, bittersweet conclusion that was perfect for the show. Overall, the story did a good job with the transition between the cutesy beginning to the tragic ending that I really don't have any complaints about. \nArt: The highlight of the art was the witch labyrinths, which were very creative and wonderfully trippy at times, and I always got excited when I saw new ones. The other backgrounds were interesting, if a bit weird at times, and the characters all looked fine. Overall, the art was very good. \nSound: The soundtrack was beautiful and quite memorable, and fit the series quite well. The opening and ending themes were also good; I like to think of the cute bubbly opening as \"what you think this show will be like\", and the dark, intense ending as \"what the show is actually like\". I wasn't a huge fan of the English dub - the voices sounded too high for my liking - but the Japanese version is good, so I'd recommend the sub over the dub this time around. \nCharacters: The characters all have rather tragic stories, either in their backstories or in the series itself, that are well developed and well fleshed out. From Madoka's desire to see her friends happy and her grief at seeing them succumb to despair to Homura's determination to protect Madoka at all costs to Sayaka's descent into despair because of the consequences of her wish, all of them play out excellently and create a lot of sympathy for the characters involved. Kyuubey is a pretty interesting character too, at least in it's belief that it's doing the right thing even though it's actually ruining the lives of the girls it contracts (your mileage may vary on how justified you think Kyuubey is). To say anything about Mami or Kyoko, the other two girls introduced, would spoil, but their development plays out in an appropriately tragic way too. Overall, the characters are excellent tragic heroines that  make the series as good as it is. \nEnjoyment: Here's where my praise goes down a little bit. While overall I enjoyed the series, at times I found that it was too bleak to really be all that entertaining, and there was very little relief from the series overall bleakness past episode three. I do understand that adding too much humor or lightness would have likely cause some serious mood whiplash that probably would have cheapened the tragic nature of the story, but things seemed almost hopeless past a certain point that made things too depressing (at least until the last episode). Even with that being said though, I do recommend this series to anyone looking for a good tragedy, as the tragic elements were some of the best I've seen. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    A Magical Girl Twist: Review for Madoka Magica\nI have been watching anime for a few years so far, and I have learned to become incredibly critical about the shows that I view. Certain criteria and requirements have been put into place for me personally that truly define a perfect series that I would watch over and over again; Puella Magi Madoka Magica has completely redefined these boundaries.\nAt first glance, this show appears to be a fun, colorful cast of cute anime girls that go on adventures to defeat the bad guys and save the world (basically the plot of Sailor Moon). Once I got past\n          \n        episode three, I discovered that I was mistaken, and as I entered into episode eight, I knew that I was horribly wrong. This show has the amazing power to market itself to its audience as an innocent show when in reality the anime is more synonymous to Death Note, which took me by surprise. I feel that this is Madoka Magica’s strongest asset, and they use this skill of misleading manipulation in other areas of the show as well.\nThis anime was released in January 2011, and it’s animation style still holds strong in comparison to other popular shows that are produced today. Bright colors, incredible detail, and great character design all allow this anime to flourish. Most notably, anime fans who have seen this series know about the unique drawing style that was given to the witches in Madoka Magica, which also gives it an edge above other shows. No other enemies, bosses, or grunts of any anime series that I have ever seen has a deviation from the normal like this show displays, and it is nice to get a refreshing touch from Aniplex and Shaft.\nI cannot give an accurate review about the soundtrack of Madoka Magica, as I do not have a practiced ear for musical masterpieces, but I do know that the composer for the majority of songs used in this show were by Yuki Kajiura, a very famous musician in the otaku community. To name a few, here are some of the other series that she has been a part of:\n-Sword Art Online\n-Sword Art Online II\n-Fate/Zero\n-.hack//Roots\n-Pandora Hearts\nIf you have seen any of these anime, you understand that even without an ear for music, you know that Yuki Kajiura is extremely talented. Her music style ranges from quiet, emotional orchestral tracks when the heart-wrenching moments of the show occur to fast-paced, powerful songs at other times. She knows when to make her music certain ways, and does so splendidly, adding much to the already amazing Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\nFrom the perspective of the plot, everything from the large events to the minor details all worked together in flawless harmony. Like I mentioned before, Madoka Magica uses their power of deceptive reality and turns them like switches during certain points of the show, allowing the story to advance in ways that it could not have otherwise. For example, the first few episodes of this show introduce the characters, setting, and conflicts, like every good anime should.\nWe learn about a girl named Madoka from a city in Japan who doesn’t see anything really special about herself, and her normal everyday interactions with her friends in their middle school. Suddenly, a mysterious creature called Kyumey appears before them, promising a free wish of anything imaginable if they gain special powers and become “Magical Girls”, a force that fights against evil witches that terrorize the world.\nObviously viewers automatically assume where the plot is headed, as many are spoon-fed sappy, one-dimensional storylines without any true variation or change. I personally jumped to some serious conclusions right at the beginning, and boy did this leave me utterly shocked when Puella Magi Madoka Magica decided to flip their tone switch at episode four. Some of the dark secrets of becoming a Magical Girl were soon realized; the price of your deepest desire was actually in fact a trade, exchanging your own life for the thing that you wanted so desperately. Later on, the motivations and origins of many characters that you thought were your friends forced you to believe they were enemies, and other times you just don’t know what to think. This kind of intriguing plot is what I deem as flawless: a story that you cannot truly decipher what it is trying to convey.\nMost importantly, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has so many Biblical themes present within its complicated story that you can pull dozens of meanings from it. The courage Madoka had when she knew that she was going to be slaughtered by the witch Walpurgisnacht, the trust that Junko had in her daughter when she did not fully understand what was she was going through, and the heavy symbol of Jesus Christ through the sacrifice of Madoka all point directly towards the Bible and the message of the cross.\nThe biggest overarching theme that I felt was present in this anime was holding tightly onto a faith that you yourself are not sure of. Many Christians walk through life being challenged by non-believers who demand proof that an infinite God even exists, and they do not have the ability to answer with concrete evidence. Personal experience, science, logic, philosophy, and historic discoveries are all tools that Christians use to persuade a person to believe in Jesus Christ, yet these do not truly prove that God is even there. I feel that Madoka Magica defines the definition of faith, and teaches Christians that we know the spiritual revelations that we receive from the Bible are true because of faith.\n“Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. 2 For by it the people of old received God’s commendation. 3 By faith we understand that the worlds were set in order at God’s command, so that the visible has its origin in the invisible.” (Hebrews 11:1-3, NET)\nI don’t want to get into spoiler territory by explaining how this anime dives into this topic, but if you have any interest in finding out more, I would suggest to watch the series yourself or read an article from Beneath The Tangles. It is written by another Christian anime blogger named Kaze, and the link to his piece of writing can be accessed here:\nhttp://www.beneaththetangles.com/2016/03/09/akemi-homura-and-the-argument-of-faith/\nOverall, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has been a roller coaster ride that I am glad that I rode, and desperately want to ride again. Containing many unique elements, a powerful soundtrack, a cleverly written story, and Biblical themes, I believe that this anime has immediately become one of my favorites. I would highly recommend to buy this anime in Blueray once you have streamed it, and take a gander at the three movies that follow the series.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    I know I'm in the minority regarding Madoka, but I'll try to list my reasoning to how I came to be so disappointed with this show.\nIn short, Madoka is a boring show, in my opinion. It has a really nice plot element that, on its own, is amazing and I can understand all the praise that it gives the show, but said single element is accompanied and worked around pretty badly and in such a boring manner that it takes away all the worth the anime could have as a whole. So, for me, Madoka works with an interesting idea, but the pain to actually\n          \n        understand it and the time and effort it takes to reach that part is enormous, and a good show, for me, is not one that makes you \"push\" through bad parts to reach better ones. Is something made of good parts almost entirely.\nAlso, the art was different in some parts, and people praise that a lot, but different doesn't mean \"better\" all the time, and I was not a fan of the inovative styles used in this show—they didn't add to anything, they weren't (for me!) cleverly used elements. They were fully fledged \"different\" styles for some objects, with no objective behind the goal of them being \"different\". That also seemed too forced, for me, and I got tired of it pretty soon.\n\n* \nFirst of all, I usually try to watch every anime that has good reviews. And I don't do that while holding my hopes down, or up, or anything. I believe that, if a show receives high praise, it has to be because it has something worth praising, and I look for those because I like to watch good shows, and I try to do so with an open mind. Maybe I'll agree that they're good, maybe I won't, but, at least, I usually manage to know why something was a success with certain people, and that, too, is interesting for me.\nSo I started Madoka because I've grown up watching magical girl animes and loving them, and also because I love drama and suspense, and everyone says that Madoka is a \"must watch\" for those who like those things. And people also praise its art a lot, so I had those two things going around in my mind when I happily started watching the show.\nThe plot appeared to be interesting at first, and, while I quickly thought the art was boring and too thought through (\"forced\") to be different, I kept going. And going. And going.\nI kept watching, even though I found the main character kinda irritating, the magical pet too repetitive, and the \"bad guys\" (the villain and the 'villains') just a little too random.\nThe show is so short, so I kind of just pushed through it.\nI wasn't really anxious to find answers to the questions I felt were too forced on my face, and I didn't really like the characters.\nHowever, the show has an amazing original plot that you can only understand if you watch it all.\nStill, for me, the boring episodes and the terrible journey with terrible characters to reach one little interesting thing just doesn't add up equally. The show has an amazing plot, really amazing, and I was left speachless for a couple of minutes during one episode. But every other thing is boring, every other episode was just annoying and uninteresting, and that, for me, weights too much.\nComparing this show to Steins;Gate, that starts way too slow and then develops into something truly amazing, I have to say that the first slow episodes of Steins;Gate are entertaining in their own way, and they add more to the plot and to the development of that show as a whole a lot more than the boring episodes Madoka has until it reaches an interesting and surprising element. And the ratio of slow episodes to amazing ones in Steins;Gate is super well balanced, in Madoka 90% of it was boring (everything surrounding that one good plot element), 5% was amazing (the amazing plot element) and 5% was good while still sort of predictable (the small development raising from the amazing plot element). So, for me, that does not make up a good show. That makes up a good idea with a bad approach and execution, I believe, no matter how amazing that one idea was on its own, since it can only exist with the rest of the poor plot, and the poor plot was overwhelming and took out all enjoyment I could have gotten from watching the series.\nI was relieved when I finished this anime. Not happy, not blown out of my mind, but relieved because it was over and I was done with it. I understand now why people praise this show, it has one element that really is amazing, but I don't agree that Madoka deserves such high praise, as I tried to explain in this review.\n        "},

The voice of Madoka is terribly annoying. And there were a lot of errors in translation. Not sure if they were on purpose, but annoying nonetheless. \nThe story is unconventional. Not your typical Magical Girl anime! I started, and one episode in I wanted to quit. I gave it another episode, and I was hooked. It is intensely dark, and quick to kill off characters you care bout. \nThe characters are simple, and easily predictable. But that's to be expected with magical girl anime.\nThe art\n          \n        annoyed me. I did not like the style, but that's my personal taste. The eyes looked dead. Single color, and lines across.\nI love that this anime is SHORT AND TO THE POINT! No filler, no junk, just constant story. \nThe story did have some issues, like the very end of the last episode. You think it's over, but the very end is just a bit confusing and unnecessary. The story was fine where it ended. I would recommend skipping after credits stuff, but now that you know it exists, how could you ignore it? haha.\nOverall, I enjoyed it. If it was any longer, I don't think I would have given it an 8. I won't read the manga (or light novel, whatever this is based on... I guess that shows how much I care). \n        "},

This anime is great. I was invested in the struggles of characters all the way through, and the beautiful animation and soundtrack just made the whole thing even better.\nIt is not perfect as people may describe it, however. I found the mane lead, Kaname Madoka, to be a little too weak, even though that is a part of spoileriffic brilliance of this show.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka Magica pulls off some of the strangest narrative dissonance with how it is presented to how the actual show plays out. If you type Madoka Magica on google you will see nothing more but a explosion of moe color patterns and presentation of some \"School Days/Slice-of-Life/Typical Magical Girl\" stereotypes yet it all seems like its trying to trick you. \nThis is nothing like that. This is dark, on the board line of going into the horror genre if it wanted t. Not many shows are willing to do what Madoka Magica excels at. The writing stands out as some of the best, if not\n          \n        the best written anime shows in years sense Steins Gate. Dark and evolving with a pacing that feels so perfect when its wrapped up, you wouldn't need anything more... until the movie came out... and thats a whole other subject that will fuck with you.\nThe Art stands out because no other show looks like this, its using the moe culture as a bases to drive down a broken road of some truly messed up looking monsters that only get creepier. At a point you would imagine that you can't get into this show because it doesn't look the way it should look like for a dark and gritty deconstruction but it works.\nSound, the sound is amazing. Would not change a thing about the soundtrack, or the voice acting because it all works to feed off each other... but one thing does stand out. The opening to the show is downright strange. After you watch a few episodes your going to have a thought like \"This shouldn't be here. Why is the OP so... happy?\" It confuses you and that may be the very reason why it was made to be like that and if it was, you will get some flash backs of those classic NGE mind-fucks \nCharacters could be expanded upon more so but that would mean that you have to make the show longer and it doesn't need to be. With a show being 12 episodes, you want to come back, you want to see it again. There is no filler, everything is necessary to the story. So if the characters are limited in time, its not to say that their interactions weren't perfectly played out to fit the story and pacing.\nEnjoyment? If you like some messed up altercations then Madoka Magica has you covered. The enjoyment that comes from Madoka Magica works in the same way Evangelion does enjoyment. Your not supposed to feel like the heroes are working their way up against a evil, this is about the evil inside people. How much are you willing to sacrifice in other to provide value to your ethics or morals? What is Madoka actually? Why are things happening to these characters? These are some questions that keep you coming back to see how it plays out and it does it in a 10 out of 10 form. You need to watch Madoka Magica because it is a testament of what anime has achieved. Not many shows are filling to go as far as this one but when it does, it does it with flying colors.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Produced by studio SHAFT, ‘Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica‘ is the 12 episode love-child of writer Gen Urobuchi, composer Yuki Kaijura and director Akiyuki Shinbo. Considered a quintessential anime masterpiece and an exemplar genre deconstruction, ‘Madoka Magica‘ caused a quake in the anime landscape which lead to a distinct shift towards darker, edgier anime and accelerated the extinction of conventional and idealistic Magical Girl series. The following review will take into account the factors of story, animation, sound and characters, each component ultimately attributing to a final score. Note that this review – as with all reviews – is partially subjective (though it attempts on the whole\n          \n        to be as objective as possible), serves as a critique and welcomes  open discussion in the comments below…\n~*~\n[Story – 6/10]\nThe story of ‘Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica‘ is hard to adequately admire without promptly sliding into spoiler territory. Indeed, even the synopsis gives very little away, which is in many ways admirable as it staves off obnoxious vainglory and haughty attempts to accrue hype (I’m glaring at you ‘Rokka no Yuusha’), which – looking at it from a publishers/production companies point-of-view – is daring as it runs the risk of allowing the series to be prejudicially snubbed as ‘yet another magical girl show‘ as it indeed was until episode 3 aired and the ‘three-episode-rule Messiah’s’ scattered to the wind, preaching of the arrival of the next ‘Neon Genesis Evangelion‘. ‘Madoka Magica‘ is not the next ‘Neon Genesis Evangelion‘ – it doesn’t even come close – but as a somewhat incomplete genre deconstruction containing vaguely intelligent plot-twists, thought-provoking themes, and a referential, trope-filled feast for your average magical girl series aficionado. And that, dear reader, is in many ways ‘Madoka Magica‘s greatest failing. That said, don’t misunderstand me: a person not well versed in standard magical girl genre tropes, themes and characterisations will most likely still enjoy this series if not because of the various plot-twists then because it is (or was) ‘different‘, a trait ashamedly lacking in modern anime. The issue lies then in the fact that one who has not seen ‘Sailor Moon‘ or ‘Cardcaptor Sakura‘ (to name a couple of ‘typical‘ magical girl series) cannot fully gauge – and I say this without attempting to air on the side of narcissism – what ‘Madoka Magica‘ is attempting to do.\n ‘Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica‘ is, at first, a genre deconstruction: it presents the viewer with the genres tropes and premises laid bare (naive focal character, charming magical helper, contracts, crystals, girl fighting, girls crying, girls, girls, girls…) and propels them along a natural course, displaying a genres flaws, the palpable and uneasy ‘real‘ consequences of said tropes institution into plot and gives a pulse to an otherwise crudely constructed creature, then either destroying or rebuilding the genre it dissects. The reason I reference ‘Madoka Magica‘ as an “incomplete genre deconstruction” is because – about half-way through the series – it veers away from enabling said deconstruction to progress to its natural conclusion and instead opts to craft a ‘darker’, ‘edgier’ magical girl series. The story relies on plot-twists; they do not occur as a result of natural progression. If that were the case – and forgive my vagueness – certain developments should have led to different outcomes (this is where we begin slide towards the ever ominous spoiler-territory and thus I shall swerve quickly away). That in and of itself does not however detract from the stories overall quality.\n If I had any issues with the ‘Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica‘s story it would be that if one looks too carefully, one begins to notice various plot holes, oversights and inconsistencies (I’m glaring at one character in particular here and their eyebrow raising ability). Not only that, the series over-reliance on plot-twists leads to an ending that leaves something to be desired due to its predictability and the viewers anticipation of one final plot-twist to astound them. The pedantic viewer will not have too much fun here: yes they may display how well-read they are by citing the series Faustian themes and its allusions to thermodynamics, but ‘Madoka Magica‘ shines in its simplicity – to overstate the facts is to make an egregious mistake. ‘Madoka Magica‘ is – pure and simple – an introspective look at the magical girl genre and this it does very well. From this perspective the series is measured and competently concise; its various flaws are irksome but not wholly tarnishing and the experience is disturbingly pleasant.\n That said… ‘Madoka Magica‘ relies heavily on its shock factor; that’s why it was advertised as a typical magical anime. When one finishes ‘Madoka Magica‘ and returns to it for further satisfaction they will find none for, in essence, ‘Madoka Magica‘ is a heavily contrived, sometimes bland and irritatingly maudlin show. Some plot-points are so arbitrary that they give rise to the abrupt and inelegant question ‘why should I even care’? Gen Urobuchi is known now by the epithet ‘Urobutcher‘ for “his dark styles, nihilistic themes, and tragic plot-twists“¹ – ‘tragic plot-twists’ do not form the basis of good anime or a good story. Arbitrarily killing characters to buoy others and further the story displays a distinct lack of story-telling ability which mars a second or third experience and irks the viewer who simply desires the ‘masterpiece of story-telling’ promised then only to be slapped around the face with dark plot-twist after dark plot-twist which synthesises to create a distinct distaste during ones viewing experience.\n~*~\n[Characters – 7/10]\n‘Madoka Magica‘s characters are covertly extraordinary and overtly horrendous; they are wholly complex (at times…) and embarrassingly simply; they are the reason I dislike the magical girl genre and admire ‘Madoka Magica‘ (at times…). If there is anything to be admired about the characters in the series, it is that – because there is such a small cast – most (of the main characters) are developed extremely well (if you one considers the ‘most’ means two…) and, if they are not, it is because in attempting to de-construct the genre, each character must act in accordance with their trope. I do not like Madoka (the character, that is). She epitomises everything I dislike in a main character. In her naivety she makes ridiculous mistakes, her audacious optimism is vexing and – to put it crudely – this bitch be plainer than vanilla ice cream, yo. But – in the grand scheme of things – Madoka is one of the series strongest features: she is the embodiment of a typical (note that ‘typical’ is the key word in this post) magical girl and thus she, and all that she experiences, embodies the genre deconstruction as it progresses. In this regard she is perfect, though I shan’t refrain from rolling my eyes when she acts in ways that boggles the mind…though this is again another reason why I suggest that this show is for those who enjoy the magical girl genre and that which it begets.\n On the flip-side, some characters are just lazily written. The character Mami, for example, is a clear plot-device thrown in to enhance the illusion of genre deconstruction (two more key words in this post). Other characters simply act in ways that are curiously unrealistic in the sense that their behaviour is even inexplicable using the argument, “but it’s a genre deconstruction!” – the most common excuse used to protect the characters in this series (hell, even I used it in the paragraph prior), but in some cases it’s just not enough. Perhaps a lot of the perplexity surrounding ‘Madoka Magica‘s characters and story stem from cultural and philosophical differences which are, no doubt, subjective, but leave those who do not adhere to a particular view simply shrugging their shoulders. It’s not much of a spoiler and it will serve as the end to this paragraph, so do feel inclined to skip this point if you so desire, but the topic of souls arises about half-way through the series, one that, as a ‘monist’, I simply could not relate to (notice the use of the pronoun ‘I‘ connoting a subjective view) and was thus left feeling slightly ‘limp‘ as characters reacted to their situation in ways that – to me – were ungrounded.\n In all honesty, this was a particularly difficult section to rate, because by normal standards the characters in this show would receive nothing more than a four or a five. Their behaviour came across at times unrealistic and unsubstantiated. Some were foils, others plot-devices. But, minor gripes aside, they were well developed given the genre from which they are distilled and the goals of the anime itself. As case studies of genre deconstructed (there we go again) magical girls, they astound in most every way and for that reason alone I proffer such a high score.\n~*~\n[Animation – 7/10]\nAnimated by production studio Shaft (of ‘Monogatari‘ series fame), ‘Madoka Magica‘s animation is as expected: overtly avant-garde, delightfully psychedelic and – at times – breathtakingly beautiful. Action sequences are vibrant and fluid and the dichotomies between the bizarre lovecraftian horrors of the witches juxtapose the pure, soft coloured everyday serves to reinforce the otherworldly aspect of being a magical girl. The series true beauty lies in the picture book, Russian animation-esk qualities of the witches and their various mazes, whose darkly evocative charms produce some the most dramatic scenes in the entire anime, highlighting the series ‘darker’ and ‘edgier’ aspirations. That said, a word to the wise: watch the series Blu-ray variant; the televised rendition isn’t animated nearly half as well (in fact, I’d go as far as to say the televised versions animation is at times shocking, bordering on being an embarrassment). In an interview with Atsuhiro Iwakami (the producer in charge of ‘Madoka Magica‘ on behalf of Aniplex) it was revealed that this was most likely due to production constraints during the series weekly broadcasts, episodes being fully ‘completed’ (animated) mere hours before airing on television, and thus I cannot recommend anything less than the series polished and refined blu-ray counterpart.\n~*~\n[Sound – 9/10]\n‘Madoka Magica‘s soundtrack is, in my opinion, its best feature. Composed by Yuki Kaijura it is at once astounding in its beauty and impressive in its thematic breadth: it’s manipulated to lull the viewer into a sense of false security (e.g. using rumba or samba based tracks, bases typically used in slice-of-life anime) before hinting at darker themes (e.g. with medieval undertones and dissonant harmonies) and finally capitalizing upon them (e.g. by imploding into Ravel, Satie-esk melancholy). Simply put, the soundtrack is beautiful – and that’s all you need to know.\n~*~\n[Conclusion – 7/10]\nAs an experience, ‘Madoka Magica‘ was enjoyable. As an attempt at a masterpiece, it rang hollow. If it were not for the argument that ‘Madoka Magica‘ is a genre deconstruction (I’m honestly coming to hate the combination of those words as, for some reason, people are beginning to confuse their combination with the word ‘masterpiece’) I would give the series a lower score, but in its attempts to de-construct it somewhat succeeds and for that I cannot fault it. In all likelihood you will enjoy your first experience with ‘Madoka Magica‘ – just don’t dwell on the finer details lest (/unless) you want to spoil the experience for yourself. Its soundtrack is amazing and the animation in the series blu-ray rendition is pleasing to the eye. Adversely, the characters are mostly weak and the story is mostly malformed. To conclude: ‘Madoka Magica‘ is a wholly divisive, wholly subjective experience and I leave it to you to draw your own conclusions.\n– Chris.\n        "},

Please be understandable.\nSo I've been hearing about this show all over the Internet and people kept repeating this one phrase to describe it:\n\"It's not what it looks like\"\nWhat do they mean? Since I was curious,I wanted to check it out myself... Hell,were they right!\nTHE STORY\nThis show first appears to be your everyday magical girl anime,you know,like Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. I myself,and bunch of other people were tricked by that,not aware of what we're\n          \n        actually getting into.\nThis is a story about Madoka,a totaly normal highschool student that lives a perfect life with her family. And that is all that she is. Normal.\nUntil of course,something happens...to put it shortly,she meets this animal thing Kyubey,that is everything else than normal. However,Kyubey asks Madoka to sing a contract with her. In that concrat,Madoka must become a magical girl whose job is to fight against evil witches before they destroy the world. In return,Kyubey will grant her any wish. Kyubey also suggests the same idea to Madoka's best friend,Sayaka. She also gets them to meet another magical girl,named Mami. Mami is meant to show them and teach them what it means to be a magical girl.\nSo,now that you heared the base of the story,it still seemes very straight forward,right?Yeah. So what is it that makes Mahou Shoujo Madoka★ Magica different?In my opinion,it's the way the story is represented. In Madoka Magica,things like \"the power of friendship\" or any similar excuse whose only purpose to save a charechter from losing in a battle or dying do not exist. The show also asks a lot of questions taht other shows don't consider important,like \"Who is Kyubey?What is his goal?Is he really what he claims that he is?\"and so on.\nAs you bust trough the episodes,you'll start noticing that this show just keeps getting darker and darker.It shows the more cruel side of the magical girl genre.It shows you what those girls have to give up to be magical girls and how big the prize they have to pay really is.\nTHE CHARACTERS\nAt first,I hated the Madoka,the main charachter.To me,she was just a crybaby.But now,when I done with the show I have to say that she is everything else but a crybaby.It turns out she can bring good choises and she is willng to do whatever she must to protect the ones she cares about.\nAs for the other magical girls,well they all have their way of thinking and solving problems.Sayaka is the one that will allways try to hide her fear and saddnes so she doesn't cause others to worry about her,which ends up... not so good.Mami is the one that looks cold and heartless but showes a softer side later on,which also doesn't end up all that good.\nThen we have the magical girls I haven't mentioned before,Homura and Kyouko(my personal favourite)\nHomura is very cold and mysterious.She stayes that way all the way to the end of the show where we actually find out...everything...\nMoving on we have Kyouko,that appears later on in the show,so I won't be covering her charachter just so I don't spoil anything.\nTHE SOUND\nThe soundtrack is just epic.Nothing more to say about it.\nAs if for the English dub...ah...well it's not the worst thing ever but,if you want to enjoy the show the way it's meant to be enjoyed,go watch it in Japanse.\nTHE ANIMATION\nThe animation is...well it's nice all the way to the moments where it shines which are the scenes where the girls are fighting against witches becouse then the animation goes from light and fluffy to dark and depressing.\nOVERALL\nMadoka Magica is a show that has made it's way to the classics.It is definitly a masterpiece that is,let me put it this way-\n\"Not what it looks like\"\nIf you want to find out more aboutit,just go watch it yourself.It is only 12 episodes long,but man...one hell of a ride.\n\n"},

Bad habit, I know, but sometimes I just can't help myself. This is why it took me months after the anime release to finally give this series a try. And oh boy, I'm glad I did. I've actually rewatched the series recently and so I've decided to finally write a review.\nI'm sure that everyone has at least heard of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica by now but there's probably still a few who still can't bring themselves to watch something so 'girly'. If you're one of those poor souls, keep on reading.\nMSMM\n          \n        starts out as any other anime in mahou shoujo genre. It even looks like one: cute art style, colorful costumes,  squeally voices. The plot also seemingly fits the theme: a very ordinary girl somehow finds herself in a not so ordinary situation and receives an offer to become a 'magical girl'. A very familiar setting. However, there was simply no time to start thinking of the show as clichéd and boring, because soon enough I started getting this feeling that something was just 'off'. I felt like I kept noticing these hints, but they were so very subtle I could never be sure if it was really a hint or just part of a somewhat whacky art. It felt like having a premonition of something bad about to happen. And by the 3rd or 4th episode it was quite clear that this isn't gonna be an ordinary mahou shoujo anime.\nTo be frank, I believe this is exactly why this show has received such wide acclamation. It excels at tricking the audience into thinking they're watching some dumb 'magical girl' show but when nothing goes as expected, you can't help but feel astounded.\nI have to admit that this was my first anime from Shaft so the highly unusual art style was something I didn't expect but at the same time was impressed by it. The characters are drawn in a rather shabby way and the backgrounds of the fight scenes look like something that belongs in a scrapbook put together by some schizophrenic person. Very chaotic, very spectacular and somehow very fitting. \nOn to the characters. There is as much character development as it is possible to squeeze into 12 episodes without making it all feel unnatural. Every character has their own story. Even the super creepy cat-like creature Kyuubey. We're given the chance to see things from every girls  perspective and follow their struggles as they go through a full spectrum of emotions: hope, happiness, sadness, grief, even helplessness. They all start out as magical girls quite heroically, that is until they realize the true weight of their choices. That's were the show goes really dark really quickly. It's hard not to feel sympathetic towards them as instead of being the little girls as they are, they fight very real battles, experience loss and start raising existential questions that should not concern someone their age.\nTo sum it all up, I'd like to say that this was one of the most memorable anime series I've had the pleasure of watching. And so I would like to recommend it to everyone. Of course, I can't guarantee that everyone will like it, that would be quite revolutionary, but I firmly believe Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica falls into the 'must see' category.\n        "},

My major critique is that it took about 6 episodes to finally get really engaging (except a certain moment in ep 3 that shocked me) and by that time the show was halfway over.The first 6 episodes, to me, were actually kinda boring but still quite watchable. I also thought that the characters never really developed well at all, with the exception of Homura. The rest stayed almost exactly the same as they were when they were introduced. \nBut that last half was really good, and i watched\n          \n        the last 6 episodes in one night, which says a lot about me, since I rarely watch more than 3 episodes in a night. Overall, it is very worthwhile and I fully recommend it. \n        "},

It is definitely one of my favorite anime, and would recommended it to anyone, one of the only anime that has actually made me cry. It's actually quite hard to look back on the story without feeling depressed that it's actually over, I mean I think my only problem right with the anime is that I am having trouble finding an anime that can match up to my expectations now that I've watched this, I peaked way to early.\nThe soundtrack is amazing, in fact I think this anime has the best sound track next to elfen lied. I actually have some of the music on my ipod, I am a fan of classical music so there may be some biases there but even so it was one of the best sound tracks in general. The music fit the scenes very well, and I would often have to pause the scene to find the music that was being played.\nThe animation on the characters is unique and I love it, I like how the eyes seem to have shading on them, as if it were a drawing it made it seem much more personal to the illustrate rather than just chucking on a ton of computer generated images adding colors e.t.c it actually looks like some effort has been put into it. The environment is very atmospheric and occasionally I had to rewind the anime because I had spent too much time in awe at the environment, especially in the witch worlds, I loved the sort of steam punky out of place art style, it worked very very well. Although there were some amazingly animated scenes in the human world.\nThe characters themselves at first seemed very linear and transparent, I was very uninterested in them, and they did annoy me quite a bit at first, but as the story progresses it amazes me at how such happy go lucky characters have such dark sides to them, I mean thinking about it actually makes me feel a bit of a lump in my throat.\nI enjoyed the series very much, although it did leave me feeling a little empty inside, don't get me wrong it was a very good ending with a great twist, and I think it was a very good metaphor for the current world, but even so, I can't help but wish that there was a little more too it, it was too short and ended quite abruptly.\nOverall I'd give it a 9, it was unique, and very enjoyable but the trouble with a unique anime is just that, it's unique I try to find something similar and just come at a loss.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I just finished this anime and LOVED IT !!  The whole plot and structure of this anime surprised me.  \nGreat story telling, interesting anime styles used. A good mixture of moe and battle action. Such a joy to watch.  If you enjoy dreams (yume), wishes (negau), magical girls (Mahou Shoujo), or other world witch realms then this is an anime that you must see. \nSTORY\nThe themes and issues explored in the anime are darker than most, but not over powering. You can feel the surreal. The characters look cute, but there is a deeper meaning behind the cuteness which adds great interest.\n          \n\nThe way the girls fight to defend their friends and beliefs is awe inspiring.  Each girl has their own reason for fighting and they must ask Kyubey for the power needed to fight. The characters are memorable and will stay in your mind for a few days after watching this touching and moving story.  Homura has her explosions and bombs as her weapon of choice.  Sayaka with her cape and sword. Mami with her rifles and guns. Kyōko has her red dress and large pike and chains.  Each girl has their own method to attack the bad guys. \nKyoko has a love of junk food, pocky, and apples. Somehow this gets me excited about her character. Most anime have the heros fight and win, and if they get hurt, well in a few episodes later all is healed.  Well this anime is more mature and real.  Some of the girls do not return after getting seriously injured. The high age restriction for this anime comes from the violence and battle scenes.\nSome of the usual anime standards are missing such as the usual trip to the beach, trip to the hot springs, and also missing is the \" who is dating who \" stuff of regular teen high school anime. Well, really this anime is set in middle school, not high school. The middle school is there in this story but this story is not the normal school drama. There are also no love confessions or love triangles.\nJust make it through the first 3 episodes as it may not make enough sense what is going on after just viewing episode 1 and episode 2.  The story takes some time to build and comprehend.  \nWhen I watched Clannad I loved the depth of the story and knew I was watching something fairly unique in anime.  Like Clannad, Mahou Shoujo Madoka is one of those rare stories that makes you excited to see that someone is trying something new, exciting, unique with the plot and story line.  This anime moves us forward.\nSTYLE\nFor anime style, you know how spongebob (not an anime) uses both cartoon and actual photo images for some episodes? It is a mixed media format.  I felt that way watching this anime.  Mostly it contains standard animation, but the witch encounters bring in an other worldly, mixed media, innovative style.  And it all works so well. I found this anime to be very visually appealing and the illustration is of a very high quality.\nSOUND\nThe soundtrack is a gem, listen to the battle music of Mami or Mami's theme (the proper title is \"Credens Justitiam\"). Then listen to the song \" You should become a magical girl\".  This song is listed on the sound track as OST-01 You should become a magical girl.  It is best to hear the songs as they appear in the anime (not a later re-mix, as a different remix can change the whole song around and will give it a much different feeling).\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    For many months now, Madoka Magica has been brooding over me. It was the last big anime of 2011 that I failed to watch, and now, looking back on how I selfishly pushed it to the side time and time again, I lament how stupid I was. That's why, this weekend, I decided to sit down and marathon it, just let it all wash over me and see what feelings bubbled to the surface. What came to the surface was pure horror, unabated enthrallment, and unparalleled enjoyment. Not since Steins;Gate have I been so enraptured by one single story, so much so that I would\n          \n        gladly spend days writing about thoughts towards it. Not since Gurren Lagann has one single art style captivated and amazed me so. Not since Toradora have the characters of one anime been so real and so alive. The kicker? Madoka does all this in 12 episodes.\nI have to admit, one of the main reasons I put off this anime for so long is its genre. I'm not one for magical girls, and the flashy transformations of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura were the main things that turned me away at an early age. But Madoka Magica is different, the third episode onward really shows its dual nature. Under the surface, Madoka Magica is a cold, thrilling experience that (I won't lie) sort of scared me at first. The story twists the job of a magical girl into something to be feared, and frequently makes you question the decisions of the characters. It makes you think, \"Would I give up living for a wish?\", and pulls you into the plights of the characters and the story as a whole.\nSpeaking of characters, they're the thing that brings this whole production together. The emotion and feeling that they bring to the table is insane, and is so raw and intense that it'll make you cringe at some parts and laugh at others. One of the reasons the characters can do this is because each and everyone of them is flawed in one way or another, and some carry interesting back stories you'll learn of as you get to know them. No one character is two dimensional or flat, and each one can convey an emotion through a simple glance, a facial expression, or their eyes. That's hard to do, especially in anime, but SHAFT succeeds. We are rarely ever told what a character is feeling, and instead, we are shown it. A small twinge in their voice, or a subtle fidgeting can give away their entire mind set, and the series is better for it. Of course, the mood can also be put across by shading, or rain, which is also good.\nThe main reason the characters can do this is because of the ingenious art style put in place by SHAFT, which is sort of the one touted in Bakemonogatari only toned down, with less abstract things in the backgrounds. These abstract things are replaced by flamboyant works of art, making fences, schools, and views all spectacular. And then there are the witches. Every time a witch is fought, the backgrounds morph into different things, and the witch itself always has a different design. This is where SHAFTs unique sense comes into the picture. The witches are often abstract, as are the environments they're fought in. Weirdly enough, these sudden changes in surrounding are frightening to the viewer, and sets an immediate sense of tension that prevails throughout the fight, never failing to remind you that the characters are in great danger every time they enter these worlds. You won't forget it. (These comments apply to the BDs)\nThe sound in Madoka Magica is nothing short of terrific, and the two songs (Connect and Magia) set the tone of the anime quite nicely (soft and fun on the outside, thrilling and intense on the inside). Magia, for me, is especially captivating, and the lyrics fit the story quite nicely. The soundtrack is spectacular, and has the rare ability to set the mood of a scene as soon as it comes on, only adding to how spectacular this anime is.\nOverall, Madoka Magica just furthers my claim that 2011 was the best year for anime. Everything it sets out to do is done marvelously, through stunning animation, a beautiful story, and real, fleshed out characters. It succeeds in bringing more people to the genre in a way that's definitely not convention, but is better for it. This is a masterpiece, only the second ten I've ever given (Steins;Gate), and I think it deserves some of your time.\nDon't you?\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Puella magi madoka magica is an amazing anime, created by the mastermind we've grown to love and hate as the Urobutcher (gen urobichi, creator of psycho pass, fate\zero, etc.) It starts off as an almost odd loli with eccentric artwork for a period of time, but grows into something bursting with grandiose.\nStory-The story is amazing to the point where it's almost ungodly, putting to shame almost all animes around it. There are EXTREME plot twists and sudden surprises and an extremely unique concept at its time of the \"magical girl anime\". The story is a little slow initially and can make you wonder if it\n          \n        was all just decent filler, but it serves a greater purpose in the end. The whole story will open your mind greatly, mostly towards the last 3 episodes. 1O\1O\nArt-The artwork is largely kind of adorable and looks almost sketched out a bit, however, when the witches create their labryinths, the artwork gets VERY odd and eccentric. Its like a huge acid trip or alice in wonderland. The artworks creates a bizarre yet intense atmosphere and is actually important in this case (in animes, they usually aren't). 1O of 1O my freind.\nsound-The sound is kind of a nice little bit if anything, adding a little more to the mystical mood of the anime, with a beautiful intro and sick dark outro. Nothing game changing, but still cool. 7\1O\nCharacter-The characters here are heartwarming as alls hell (except the ferret asshole who fucks up the girls. you'll see who i'm talking about). Madoka herself goes from being sweet yet weak and undependable to being a savior of all of the universe, and being able to stand on her own and withstanding anything, along with homura (who is a little bitter but knows about sacrifice well.) 1O\1O.\nenjoyment-the enjoyment is still a 9 instead of 1O simply because this-you need patience. Most of the intense heated action and tearjerkers do not even happen until like episode 8 or\n9, but they are well worth the wait.\nOverall-definetly a 1O, a great introduction to gen urobitchi's works, and an anime that earns him the title urobutcher very well. You like deep thought or intense emotion than you will love this.\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    Short review: Probably the best short anime I've ever seen. The story is very satisfying at only 12 episodes. Unique art style, smooth action animation, brilliant character and psychological horror writing from Gen Urobuchi, an unforgettably epic soundtrack, but not AS MUCH of a genre deconstruction as others may say it is. \nLoooooooong review: \nStory: \nAs you've all probably heard before, Madoka Magica is a deconstruction/post modernism anime. It starts off with a rather simple premise, only to become darker, more complex, and deviating far from people's preconceptions of the show. Think of it like adopting an adorable kitty from an animal shelter, taking it\n          \n        home, it gradually turns into a terrifying tiger, and then it demands you to sit down and respect it. The story is very original, although the plot twist(s) didn't shock me because I was spoiled by Wikipedia (really my own curiosity) and tumblr. The writing shines the best when there's character interaction, which is where most of the show's psychological aspect is. The words really resonated with me, and just go to show how dark, thought-provoking, and mature this anime is. Quite often I found myself connecting the themes of this anime to the infamous \"Law of Equivalent Exchange\" from Fullmetal Alchemist. The plot itself didn't feel like a solid linear PLOT, really, but this can be due to the fact that Madoka Magica is only 12 episodes long. I would like to say a show as \"well written\" as this has perfect pacing, but at times, I did feel like the show needed to \"get on with it.\" This is probably because I can kind of separate the anime into \"arcs\" and this setup felt a bit abrupt for an anime this short. And I felt that with a plot that's not necessarily linear, a few events (no spoilers) felt just a bit dragged out, with better events and plot points getting less screen time than I would have liked. I can't really talk about the \"mystery\" aspect of this pacing, because I already knew the ending from the get-go. Lastly, for an anime as dark as this, I was somewhat surprised that the ending felt melancholy and bittersweet. It was (almost) a perfect ending, with everything resolved, and you feel like you've accomplished something after watching this. oh, and one more thing: there is a very minimal Yuri undertone to this anime. I'd say this anime implied Yuri like Free implies Yaoi. Just to be clear.\n Characters: \nThe characters in Madoka Magica all start off as variations of character archetypes (like most anime do nowadays). Madoka, the (ridiculously) sweet and kind-hearted girl, Homura, the mysterious transfer student (seriously, there are way too many of these in anime), Mami, the big sister/mentor figure, Sayaka, the tomboy best friend, and Kyoko, the redhead rebel who takes no flack from anyone. But as the show progresses, the line between good and bad is blurred for almost all the characters, with Madoka being the emotional and psychological anchor for the characters and story. She's sweet, kind, and caring to the core, almost to the point that it got annoying a few times. All the other characters do get some backstory, which did make them more complex, dynamic, 3-D characters. This is probably why I considered Homura, Sayaka, and Kyoko to be anti-heroes. Every character in Madoka Magica, no matter how minor, helps move the plot forward in some way or another. There are no \"useless' characters, and I felt all the characters were used to their full potential. Now, by all definitions, the characters in Madoka Magica are good. The only problem is, I found many of them to be annoying or I just plain hated them. They're not very relate-able, for starters. Even after finishing the anime, when every character showed redeeming qualities or did something to change the audience's perspective of that character, the only one I liked in the end was Kyoko, and even when she was first introduced, I didn't really like her. Most of the conflict and what made most of the characters annoying at some point or another could just be solved with someone (or me) saying/doing something profound, stating the obvious, or just needed to be said/done. Just one sentence could've done the trick at times! But then again, that's the shojo way to resolve character conflict, and Madoka Magica is a Seinen, so yeah.\n Art: \nThe human character designs are all very moe and their faces look like they were taken straight off a sketchpad. I say human because, well...the witches are something else. The use of actual photographs, stop-motion, a layered-paper effect, and innocent yet subtly creepy imagery in the witch's labyrinths and the designs for the witches starkly and VERY EFFECTIVELY contrast the moe character designs. I mean, you wouldn't think desserts, art supplies, and an orchestra would be creepy. But Madoka Magica makes it so. The best way I can describe this art style is comparing it to an American cartoon called Chowder. Anyone who's seen it knows there are parts that are fully animated, but the show sometimes uses stop-motion type photographs, patterned textures, and even live action puppetry. But as unique (I say this instead of good) as the art is, it does suffer a consistency problem. I watched the fully touched-up version of the anime on Netflix, and a few days later, I saw screenshots of the Japanese TV broadcast version. Some scenes weren't completely drawn, and others had the characters look fuzzy and even have misshapen faces. I wish Shaft would be more timely with the production of Madoka Magica, but I understand they apologize with the DVD release version. In the fully finished version, everything looks very nice, consistent, and very clean, especially with distance shots. One last thought I would like to add: Every single building in this anime is ridiculously nice. Like, how much money do these people have?!?!? \n Animation: \nThe animation during the action scenes is very smooth and consistent throughout the entire series. Almost exceptionally so. Mixing the smooth movements of the magical girls with the erratic, (creepy) stop-motion animation in the witches labyrinths was very jarring, but worked to the show's advantage VERY much so. The action scenes, combined with the amazing OST (more on that later) made all of the action scenes very exhilarating and often would make my jaw drop. It doesn't do an Attack on Titan, where the camera spins around a lot, which was much appreciated. The animation also doesn't feel like shonen action, which I guess should be expected from an anime of this quality level. Even in non-action scenes, Shaft didn't skimp too much, which is also a good indication of quality. \n Voice:  \nNow here's the one area of the anime that I had low expectations. I know moe is very hard to dub in English well. But the thing is, Madoka Magica didn't need cutesy moe voices for the dub. This is a dark show, after all. The dub didn't distract me, and the dub script was not rewritten much from the original script. I switched between sub and dub very frequently throughout the series, and I honestly couldn't hear the difference between Madoka's voice in sub and dub. Because if you can act out a(n annoying) character so well that you feel the urge to yell at/slap that character, that deserves major praise. Shout out to you, Christine Marie Cabanos. You easily gave the best performance in this entire anime. Kyubey's voice took a little getting used to. I don't think Cassandra Lee quite nailed it whenever Kyubey has to explain/reveal things to the magical girls. Everyone else (Cristina Vee, Sarah Williams, Carrie Keranen, Lauren Landa, Shelby Lindley, Marianne Miller) gave rather average performances (compared to better dubs), but I actually didn't mind. Every dub VA in this anime has a wide (enough) emotional range, and this dub shows it with all the characters. Sure, the quality of this dub isn't earth-shattering, but I would actually recommend watching this in English, even though to others this may just seem like a passable dub  (and it actually kind of is). Also, since this is an action anime, that's another reason to watch this dubbed.\n Music: \nAs usual, let me start with the opening. Now, I saw a YouTube comment on a video of the opening that said something along the lines of \"I love how this opening lies so much to the audience.\" To which I would disagree, because I think it isn't a happy-go-lucky song like the kinds used to open other moe or magical girl anime. Sure, it's not something I would want on my MP3 player, but it actually suits the anime quite well, both music and animation. The soundtrack to Madoka Magica was composed by Yuki Kajura. As such, a lot of the music is dark, chilling, and ominous. The OST music in this anime DEMANDS attention with many memorable tracks with many different \"feelings\" to them. A sign of a good OST is when there are many tracks that would be great as just music, to which Madoka Magica delivers with flying colors. Even when characters are just having a conversation, the music makes it ten times darker or intense. The same goes for the show's ending themes 2 and 3. One of the best tracks in the OST is the second ending theme \"Magia.\" It matches the anime in both melody, mood, and lyrics (yes I looked them up). Seriously, I got chills whenever I heard that used as a battle theme in the anime. \n Execution: \nAs a deconstruction, Madoka Magica does fine. However, it's not AS BRUTAL of a deconstruction as many people say it is or like we've seen from other anime. (If you want more info on this, read my magical girl rant) In 12 episodes you get a solid and complete story, well-written characters with proper character motivations, and a soundtrack that will blow your mind. However, despite the overall quality of this anime, I consider Madoka Magica to be a WW (weekend watch) anime, albeit a very good one. It's one of those short shows that you can finish in a weekend if you have nothing to do. And while I don't think I could have written a better ending, it does leave a bit to be desired (something that people say Rebellion fails to fix.)\n My Enjoyment: \nIt should be pretty obvious that this anime is not necessarily meant to be \"enjoyed\", but to be \"awed at\" or to promote deep thinking. The pacing was a bit strange, and I never really found my self in awe until towards the end of the story (probably because I spoiled the entire plot before watching this) and after I gave the anime a little thinking over. I never felt a moment of AMAZINGNESS while watching this anime, probably because many parts felt slow compared to what my expectations of the show were. And honestly, I didn't have that \"OH MY GOSH THIS IS AWESOME\" buzz that I've gotten after finishing other anime. I even waited a few days, and it didn't come. I'm sorry if that makes me an immature anime fan. However, all the headcanons, fanart, and other Madoka Magica stuff on tumblr did leave me with a little bit better of an impression of this anime. Seriously, I actually really like (Non-Yuri) Madoka Magica fanart. So, learn my lesson, and go into this anime with NO SPOILERS. \nIf you liked this review, go to my page, and there's a link to my anime review blog. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    There has been a lot hf hype surrounding Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. It is easily\none of the most popular anime of 2011, and the most notable title to come out of the \"Magical Girl\" genre in a long time. With names such as the prolific music composer Yuki Kaijura and visual innovator Akiyuki Shinbo attached to it, it's no surprise Madoka has received the attention it has. So does it live up to expectations? On many levels, yes. It is a visually stunning, dark take on a genre plagued with inherit cuteness; something that is greatly appreciated. However, it also has its fair share of\n          \n        shortcomings that make it less than the hype would imply.\nMadoka Kaname is a normal junior-high student, with a strong desire to help others. She is her class' health representative and is quite friendly, however, she has never felt as if she is anything special. things begin to change when a new transfer student, Homura Akemi, takes a strange interest in Madoka. Akemi questions Madoka if she values her life, friends, and family, then tells Madoka to not attempt to become something she is not. Later, while hanging out with her friend Sayaka, Madoka hears a voice calling for help. The voice belongs to a strange creature being hunted by none other than Akemi. With the help of another mysterious girl named Mami Tomoe, Madoka and Sayaka prevent Akemi from doing any harm to the creature. As it turns out the creature, called Kyuubey, can grant any wish, but in exchange the wisher must fight against strange beings called witches. This might seem like an opportunity for Madoka to make something more of herself, however, she is unaware of the nightmare she is about to enter.\nWhat makes Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica stand out from the magical girl genre is that it is an exceedingly dark and morbid series. Where other shows in the genre might present their themes in a more sugar-coated manner, Madoka does the opposite, expressing its themes in some very harsh ways. Madoka takes the conventions of the genre and twists them into something sinister. At the beginning of the series, Madoka and Sayaka seem to think that being a Puella Magi is an ideal way to do some good in the world, but that is far from the truth.  The lives of those who accept Kyuubey's offer are truly cursed, they forfeit a normal life for one of constant danger in exchange for there wish, living under circumstances they do not fully comprehend. Even greater suffering comes to those who know the dark secrets behind their existence. This is very different from the usual magical girl fair, or at least it is different in tone. Being that Madoka is playing around with the conventions of a genre, a lot of its themes and concepts are borrowed from other series, losing points on originality. This would be a bigger problem if the show was not so successful at putting a dark twist on things. Even though themes such as the depth of friendship and overcoming hopeless odds, that dominate the magical girl genre are present here, Madoka still feels unlike any other anime of its type.\nMadoka has a solid, but not outstanding, cast of characters. Viewers will likely find themselves emotionally invested in the characters; hoping they find some way out of their dreadful situation and somehow find their unattainable happy ending. However, like Elfen Lied and other such shows, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica achieves such pathos through the extremity of the situation, rather than strong characterization. The characters come off as common archetypes: Madoka being kind but lacking in confidence, Akemi being cold and distant, Sayaka being the loud best friend, etc. There are times when they break from these molds, especially in Sayaka's case, but they often feel one-note (especially true for Akemi). What really makes you feel for these characters is the suffering they go through. Whatever ideals they have are shattered, and their lives quickly unravel. The standout character in the series is Kyuubey; a character that subverts the cute mascot image he belongs to. Side-characters are neigh unmemorable and mainly used for plot convenience. Madoka certainly does not have a bad cast of characters, but they ultimately stop it from ascending to true greatness.\n The dark tone of the story is supported by some fantastic technical merits. If there is anything people have come to expect from Akiyuki Shinbo it is a certain visual flare, and he delivers here. Madoka features some of the craziest, most unique visuals ever seen in an anime. Whenever a witch shows up, the show gets transformed into a deranged multicolored nightmare. The landscapes are a combination of candy-land and surrealistic imagery looks like it came straight out of Salvador Dalí's head. The result is a marvel to look at. Even when the visuals are not tripping out, though, they are still impressive. The character designs are reminiscent to other magical girl anime, but not overwhelmingly cutesy; the color scheme is vivid but at the same ominously dark. Then of course there are the bizarre angles Shinbo is known for, overall this is a visually impressive show. Suporting them is the just as impressive soundtrack from Yuki Kaijura. The music is well composed, haunting, and just plain beautiful. It is a prime example of  why Kaijura is such a respected composer.\nFollowing the hype, one might be led believe Mahou Soujo Madoka Magica is the best magical girl anime ever. The limited character development of its cast, and the fact that the show is recycled material simply presented differently make it fall short of that expectation. Still, it is quite an impressive endeavor. For those who are looking to see the magical girl genre at its best, the enchanting Princess Tutu should be the top priority. However, for anyone looking to escape the cutesy image that dominates the genre, Madoka is a very welcomed alternative. \n        "},

A perfectly, beautifully crafted story that transcends genre. How can one even begin to review such a faultless series?\nThe intrinsic concept of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is the duality of the universe. The unmerciful equality of it. If you look hard enough through your daily life, you can see it underpinning everything. Every concept has it's twin. Light has dark; love has hate; hope has despair. For every good thing that is done in this world, an equally bad thing happens. Every pleasurable activity carries pain hand in hand. Think about\n          \n        love. When you fall in love, that person becomes your everything. You hold them deep inside you and they resonate joy through every nerve ending and fiber of your being. However, when that relationship ends, that part of them in you ends with it. It leaves a void exactly proportionate to the space the person occupied. \nThink about good deeds. When you impart good upon this world, somewhere else in the world, evil also occurs. So the two concepts balance each other out, and the fundamental equality of the universe is preserved.\n\"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.\" This law is true in more ways that just in physics.\nSo does that mean that we should never do good? That we should never care? That all is pointless and every happy feeling and hope and dream is just an embryo for sadness, despair, and nightmare?\nOf course not. And this is where the beauty of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica truly shines. There is one action that cannot cause an equal and negative reaction, because it contains both positive and negative within itself. That is the power of sacrifice.\nThis is one of those anime that makes you sad, because you wonder if you will ever experience something so good again.\nWatch it and, in the words of Samuel L Jackson, hold on to your butts.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="                          \n    A friend of mine is obsessed with this show, so of course I just HAD to see what all the fuss was about, and what a terribly amazing decision it was. I am no anime buff, so my review won't be too in depth, this is just my casual viewing perspective.\nStory: 10\nThe story was so twisted and depressing that I could not get it out of my head. You go into this thinking the story sounds cute. You have probably read the description here on MAL, and seen some Kyubey memes, probably saying something along the lines of \"Make a contract with me and become\n          \n        a magical girl!\". Sure, that sounds real cute, an adorable cat creature with the ability to turn you into a magical girl. NO! Stop. Forget about it. If you start watching this anime with the mindset that it is a cutesy magical girl story, you will end up like I did, dying inside and on the verge of tears whenever I see anything related to this show. That said, this is a very dark anime, despite the art style, and the story was so flawlessly put together that it will take your breath away.\nArt: 9\nIt was different than anything I had seen before. The witches labyrinths were incredibly well done and out-there, and the way the girls were drawn was so interesting (I myself was especially intrigued  by their eyes for some reason). Again there were a couple of rough spots, earning the art a 9 in my book.\nSound: 8\nThe sound did not stand out to me much, but this could possibly be because I was so captivated by the other aspects of this anime that it was just too much for me to take in at once. From what I can remember though, is that the background music in some of the scenes gave me the chills from how beautiful, yet somewhat creepy it was. \nCharacter: 9\nAll I am going to say is that the character development was insane! There were some character flaws though, but that is expected by every anime in my opinion. I am not going to say any more because I am positive that I would start spewing spoilers.\nEnjoyment: 7\nBroken down, the different pieces of this anime were amazing. This section however, is about my own personal feelings toward Madoka Magica. I was constantly screaming at the screen because of the questionable decisions made by the characters that could have been easily avoided. This anime emotionally fucked me up. I did not enjoy watching it, but I just had to. I  full on cried at least 5 times, and was on the verge of tears at least once an episode. I do not like to cry. I hate pondering my own existence, wondering if I should even be on this earth. That exactly what this anime did to me. (sorry that sounded morbid)\nOverall: 8\nThis anime was so well done, I applaud every single person who put any time into this. Overall however, this was simply not my style. I would give it a 9, but considering my own feelings for this show, I can't do that.\n"},

Did you think it was girly? 2 things: This is NOT childish, and I know guys who love this anime.\nThere are countless reasons why I like this anime. It's realistic, it can actually happen, and the diversity of the characters are great. This anime is beautiful.\nStory-10: How should I say this... The plot is awesome! With unexpected plot twists, a story you've probably never heard of, emotional moments, you have a great story. Though I was a little confused in the beginning, I kept watching it. I love how everything fits together at the\n          \n        end. Its almost mystery. Tell me, how exactly do you fit in little girls with cute cosplay dresses with darkness and evil? Well, watch this anime and you'll find out. \nArt-10: The art really suited this anime. Its not too cutesy, its not too \"boyish\", its just perfect. I believe I might've seen better artwork, but I think the art work is a masterpiece because the story makes it shine. The characters' designs look great too. I love their expressions and reactions to changes. The evil creatures were just priceless. They were very sketchy and rough, and it suited them.  I liked the sci-fi'ish setting as well. Although the settings didn't really seem to.. blend in, I still loved it. \nSound-10: JUST LOVED THE SOUNDTRACKS! They were beautiful. period.\nCharacter-10: I swear, I'm going to put 10's for everything. The characters' personalities were very diverse and realistic. We have the good and cautious girl, we have the best friend, we have the tsunadere girl, we have an easy-going girl, just wonderful! I also liked how the characters were not exactly swayed by words. In a lot of animes and manga, a person's feelings are crushed and they begin to distance from everyone, and then the protagonist comes and says some nice and sweet things and make the gloomy person think again. Well, in this anime, it's a little more real. I like how the girls don't stupid things. But when they do, its, again, more realistic that way.\nEnjoyment-10: This anime became one of my favorites after watching. If you are the type of person who likes a good anime with dark and bitter twists, this is the anime for you."},

Whether it is a certain possession, a close friend, a family member, or a lover, we all have it, and we would do anything to protect it. However, when that object or person is in trouble, and you feel bad that you couldn’t do a thing about it, you start to fall into despair. Just when you feel like giving up, what would do if you were given the opportunity to fix all that, with just a single wish? What would that wish be? Would you risk everything that you have to grant\n          \n        it?  Would it lead to happiness or sorrow? Well, the 2011 anime, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or Puella Magi Madoka Magica) is centered on questions like these. This anime has gained a massive amount of popularity, receiving never-ending praise for deconstructing the magical-girl genre. There are a few important questions, though: Did this anime meet up to my expectations, and does it deserve the hype that it gets?\n~~~~~\nStory: (10/10)\nThe story of Madoka Magica centers around a girl named Madoka Kaname. She’s pretty much your typical teenage girl who doesn’t have any special talents, but is rather cheerful and treasures her life, family, and friends dearly. But when transfer student Homura Akemi questions her about actually treasuring her loved ones, she also warns Madoka to not do anything crazy to change that. This warning becomes more prominent when Madoka stumbles upon a creature by the name of Kyuubey, and she enters the dark world of magical girls and witches.\nFrom the get-go, the story of Madoka Magica seems like the typical magical-girl stuff that you’ve probably seen in an anime like Sailor Moon. However, anyone who is familiar with the works of Hans Christian Andersen knows that this anime is more than meets-the-eye. If you asked anyone who has watched the show about the premise, they would say that it deconstructs the tropes that are common in magical-girl anime, taking everything you know about that genre and beating it to a bloody pulp, throw it off a cliff, and bring it back up, only to just repeat the process. This anime shows that being a magical-girl does come at a price. The writing of Madoka Magica is absolutely fantastic, putting in so much detail about every little thing, and doing it in only 12 episodes. I think that’s quite the accomplishment.  As a fan of psychological-thrillers, I was instantly hooked while watching a couple of minutes of the first episode. While this story can be confusing, and does require using your head a little to fully understand the situations going on, it didn’t bother me one bit.\n~~~~~\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\nIs there really anything I need to say about the animation that hasn’t been said before? It’s absolutely amazing. From the real world to the witches’ labyrinths, there is just so much detail and quality put into these visuals. The action scenes’ animation is consistent and fluid, and some of the scenery is just breathtaking. I also love how the labyrinths look very unique, especially the one that looks like a concert hall during an orchestra concert. The city also compliments Madoka Magica’s changing tones: bright and colorful at first, but slowly turns ominous and bleak as the show progresses. And let’s not forget the “sideways glance” that’s pretty much a staple in EVERY Shaft anime. Long story short, the art of this anime is some of the best I’ve seen in a LONG time.\n~~~~~\nCharacters: (10/10)\nHaving a great story and an amazing art style, does Madoka Magica have a great cast of characters? My answer to that is: Yes, yes it does have great characters, despite the number being rather small. This gives each of the five main characters the right amount of time to develop all throughout the 12 episodes of the show, and you can see why they act the way that they do. I could understand why Madoka is hesitant to grant her wish at first; I could understand why Homura acted cold at the beginning of the show, and I could also understand why Kyouko told Sayaka the things that she did tell her. \nEach character (except for one) had that certain attachment that grew onto me. Though I could disagree with some of their motives, some of their stories are some of the most tragic that I’ve ever seen in modern media. I REALLY wish that I could say more, but I can’t because I’d be revealing major spoilers for the show. Let me just say that every main is fantastic and unique in some way, shape, or form.\n~~~~~\nMusic/Sound: (10/10)\nBeing a huge fan of Yuki Kajira (who also did the soundtracks for Pandora Hearts, Fate/Zero, the Kara no Kyoukai movies, and Sword Art Online), I absolutely LOVED the soundtrack of this anime. The opening song, “Connect”, is not only a great song, but it also does an amazing job of hiding the darker tone of the show. The background music is just as amazing, fitting every scene perfectly, whether it’s to add tension or lightheartedness to it. Some notable songs include “Sis Puella Magica” and “Decretum”; they are by far my favorite songs of the entire soundtrack. Needless to say, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Seriously, go listen to it as soon as you can.\n~~~~~\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica was an absolute blast to watch. From beginning to end, I was always on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen. There wasn’t a single time while watching this show where I was ever bored. It was an absolute thrill to watch.\n~~~~~\nOverall Score: 10 out of 10\nMadoka Magica is one of the best anime I have ever seen. From the amazing story, the relatable characters, the beautiful animation, to the spectacular soundtrack, this anime has EVERYTHING to love in a good anime. If you haven’t watched it yet, please do yourselves a favor and go watch it. I promise that you won’t regret it!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica... One...if not the most...trolliest animes in existence.  Without further ado, let us begin.\nStory: The story of Madoka Magica is a typical magical girl anime with lots of cute costumes and an animal guidance as the girl saves the world, right?  RIGHT?!  Though it may seem that way for about...3 episodes, it all goes to shit.  And from there, well, take it away, Another. \"Plays death scenes.\"  Seriously though.  The story is incredibly dark and not one for the faint of heart.  It will definitely tug heartstrings at this one anime.\nCharacters: Probably one of my\n          \n        favorite parts of this anime.  For starters, we have color-coding.  Every girl has a color-coded outfit to match their hair, which, incidentally, actually works.  Without spoiling much, the 5 girls that this anime revolve around each have their own backstory or reason to have the mentality that they have.  Though only 12 episodes, Madoka Magica wastes no time in formulating proper characters that befit its story, an effort that paid off well in the end.  However, the sixth character is one that everyone hates, and that, is Kyubey.  As the \"antagonist\" of the story, he merely does his job and has no concern for how things turn out, to the point that he is truly neutral.   \nArt and sound: With art, we have a moe style chibi that looks like it came out of a sketchbook for the most part.  While cute and adorable, remember, this anime is trolly.  The art style looks great, and the magical aspect in this series are definitely well made.  On another note, this anime has a different art style to the \"labyrinths\" that the witches in the series make.  Each one is special in their own way and feel as though they came out of an art museum for how they were made.  Sound is also a huge plus for this anime.  With mystical tracks and a very trolly sounding opening, this anime has a great feel to it.  The battle music is outstandingly mystical and beautiful and could not ask for anything better.  \nPersonal enjoyment: While my enjoyment is lower then the other categories, I still enjoyed it very much.  With wonderfully rounded characters and awesome sounding music, added in the fact that there is a story that wastes no time in telling what is going on, this anime is well, outstanding.  It's to the point that I cannot express in words how much this anime really means to me and my personal morals.  So, Pyra, you may ask, with all this in mind, why do you enjoy it less then what you say you should've?  Well, random reader, I'll tell you.  While yes, I do like the idea of Madoka Magica, the aspect of these girls dying in some horrible disastrous way is disturbing to me.  I didn't want to part away from them and I really wanted them to continue living on.  While other animes have random characters that die left and right, (elfen lied), this one kills off the characters, and let it simmer, stirring the emotions of the viewer, and stretching the heartstrings.  Damn you KYUBEY!!!  In short, I love this anime, I just wish I could have the heart to love it more.  So, with that in mind, if you really want to take this on, I suggest getting a box of tissues and a tab with \"Shinryaku! Ika Musume\" in case you need to take a break from this heartbreak anime.  The ending... ;(\n        "},

The artwork involving the Witches leaves much to be desired, but the overall artwork is your average anime artwork. I suggest not watching dubbed, because the voices are terrible. By the end of the anime you won't notice so much, but they really grate to hear in the beginning. For being only twelve episodes, the character\n          \n        development is great.

As a newbie to the Ani-verse, you're probably thinking - \"How can so many people call this a masterpiece, when all it seems to be is some rather silly magic girl nonsense?\". And then you watch it. And then you hide, crying, under a bed for several hours. MSMM shows a particular talent, in my opinion, of abusing our generic stereotypes. In an essence, the creators have shattered the Magic Girl genre and rebuilt from the ground up for a much more mature audience. Seriously, much more mature.\nThere is no doubt that 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica' has been\n          \n        delicately crafted by either geniuses, psychopaths, or both. Whilst often when we read a genre, we may assume that the anime will use it in a similar method as any other within the genre. MSMM abuses our preordained expectations of a genre and thus almost seems to be amused having totally fooled the audience. This dark, yet magical giggle echoes throughout the entire course of the anime, truly leaving a haunting yet brilliant experience.\nNow you're probably thinking - \"Well, that doesn't tell me much\". I don't believe I want to say anymore about this piece of work, out of pure respect for the anime. Personally, I think that while a review may point someone in a direction, there is much more to gain from anime watched with a sense of 'self-discovery'.\nNow please, \"make a contract with me and become a magic girl!\"\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This rating is actually not really what I would've given it. This is a reason to always be skeptical.\nMahou shoujo Madoka magica isn't the typical mahou shoujo anime. Yeah I already knew that shit was supposed to take off after the third episode and I was still pleasantly surprised.\nStory - (7) The plot is actually really basic. Girl tries to protect another girl from a bad guy. Nothing too special here to be honest. How it's revealed, is where things get clever. The show first starts of by placing Akemi as the antagonist and kyubey as a protagonist. Eventually their roles change. This also occurs\n          \n        with Sayaka and Kyoko. \nWhat stems from this is one of my favourite themes; ignorance. \nNot everything is as it seems and everything may be bit too rushed for the viewer to realize and take a grasp of the situation, but that all depends on someone's thoughts on pacing. I'm usually fast to pick up on things so I don't tend to find anything hard to follow. You probably shouldn't watch this if you find fast pace things hard to follow because this series tries to slip in a long story in 12 episodes.\nAnyways, the true beauty of the plot development was very clear to me as I watched the entire series a second time out of boredom seeing as I had it installed and Cuba had no internet. It's almost like watching an entirely different show. Understanding what is going on completely changes the perspective and really tries to change the viewer's opinion. Even watching it for the first time, naivety is present in most of the characters.\nAnother theme is probably the obvious \"be careful what you wish for\" but what impressed me was that it didn't go for the \"faults in humanity\" (except for that one time on the subway). Instead, it focused mostly on \"the things that make us human\" and it really brought the ethics of morals into question especially with an antagonist such as kyubey who doesn't exhibit any emotion. Another book that does the exact same thing is Gullivers Travels - Part Four where of course morality is compared with logic.\nAside from themes, which there are definitely many, another thing to appreciate is the subtle things that occur throughout the franchise which the audience most likely won't pick up on. Such as that moment in the third movie, during the cake song where Mami says she is the cheese.\nThe plot twists do their job by shocking the audience and any mention of them will completely ruin the experience for people that are completely new to the show (I'd say that's the sign of a good plot twist).\nArt - (5) The part that really stands out is the atmosphere, I felt the mood indefinitely.\nHowever...\nThe character designs are horrendous. I just can't get over them and never will. The outside world is too abstract for my liking and the world of the witches is also too abstract. The only reason I was able to bear with most of the art was because I got used to it.\nMusic - (10) If there is anything this anime has above all else, it's the music. Even though I mostly listen to classical, the music was a treat.\nYuka Kaijura is a very talented composer and I enjoyed the orchestral OSTs, especially the ones with a choir. Many of the words are sang in German and it just sounds so right.\nCharacters - (4) What I liked about the characters was that each one had a different upbringing giving us a chance to see the difference between the privileged and the unprivileged.\nUnfortunately, the majority of them are just there and don't really develop. The only one that really does is Akemi and she doesn't really make an appearance too often. It's great that she ends up basically having the entire plot revolve around her but that only really happens towards the end. This worked out perfectly for me because all I really wanted was to know more about her the entire time.\nEnjoyment - (10) Loved it. For me, it was well worth watching. Gen Urobuchi generally makes fun stuff but this is really quite good. Love seeing people suffer. Definitely a unique concept not that I really care about originality. Ridiculous amounts of wasted potential. Pleasant to listen to the soundtracks. Not too interested in deconstructions or parody but I enjoyed this one.\nReached for the moon and landed on a cloud.\nOverall 10/10"},

So please, just let me have a happy dream?”\n--Kyoko Sakura\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of my favorite anime of all-time, and with good reason. In 12 short episodes, Madoka Magica produces a fleshed-out world, easily relatable characters, a terrifying antagonist, more twists than a churro, and an ending that feels complete but still leaves the viewer pining for more. It’s a thrill ride that punches you in the gut over and over but keeps you coming back for the next episode. From a technical standpoint, Madoka leaves the viewer wanting for nothing, with gorgeous visuals and\n          \n        sound complementing the frenetic editing and direction. It is a joy to watch, even as its story leaves you bereft of hope.\nMadoka Kaname is our main protagonist, and it’s perhaps best to start with her as she is probably the most normal of the characters, the one most relatable to the audience at large. She is almost immediately thrust into a perilous situation and encounters Kyubey, the obligatory quirky animal mascot. Kyubey tells her that to prevent this disaster, she has to become a magical girl and defend the Earth from eldritch abominations called witches. In exchange for her vow of service (which is eternal, by the way), Kyubey will grant her one wish. It is this framework of “wishes in exchange for power” that is Madoka’s main dilemma.\nLater on Madoka encounters Homura Akemi and Mami Tomoe. Mami has been at the magical girl gig for awhile now and agrees to show Madoka the ropes, as it were, before she makes her choice whether or not to join this sisterhood of witch-slayers. Homura, on the other hand, is set up almost like a villain, and goes to grave and drastic measures to prevent Madoka from having anything to do with the whole enterprise. There’s also Sayaka Miki, Madoka’s genki girl best friend, and Kyoko Sakura, an enigmatic and violent magical girl who makes her presence known in the second half of the show’s run.\nIn case you haven’t heard already, Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the once-ubiquitous magical girl genre. It takes the conventions of the genre and skillfully, gleefully turns them on their head, resulting in a story more dark and horrific than anyone expected when the show first aired. The fact that Gen Urobuchi (Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass) is the lead writer should dispel any illusions you have of this being a light and fluffy story about girls uniting to fight evil. This is a story about girls deceiving each other and themselves in pursuit of undefined, sometimes ephemeral dreams, and the fallout of those pursuits. Friendships are made and broken. Dreams are destroyed. Suffering is almost ubiquitous, so much so that it’s sometimes difficult to watch.\nIn lesser hands, this show would break anyone’s willingness to continue watching as the horror unfolds, but Studio SHAFT are at the reins, and they bring to the table their quirky, no-holds-barred approach to the direction and art, resulting in a show that you can watch purely for the stunning, psychedelic, demented visuals if nothing else. The soundtrack is handled by legendary composer Yuki Kajiura who brings climactic, dark rhythms and haunting lyrics to the OP, ED, and score. The pacing is consistent and frenetic. With only 12 episodes of runtime, director Akiyuki Shinbou made every last one count in a big way, resulting in a climactic resolution that was bittersweet, fitting, and definite. Then the movies came out... but that’s a story for another time.\nI would be remiss if I did not mention that the English dub of this show is absolutely worth your time. The roster is stacked with high-caliber vocal talent from the West, and they put forth some of the best work I’ve heard in my native tongue. Each of them brings their own something to the table, but Cristina Valenzuela’s Homura and Sarah Williams’ Sayaka stand as two of the most heartrending, memorable, and faithful performances.\nI can’t really talk about what makes this show so great and so worth watching without either spoiling some of the horrific events or just describing the effect it had on me, so I’ll choose the latter. I cried. I cried a lot during my time with this. I am a father of a school-age daughter, and I felt compelled to hold her tight and have “the talk” about strange animals offering wishes despite the fact that these things don’t exist in our world (Thank the gods). And I thought about everything that occurred during it for weeks afterward trying to suss out if things could have gone better, if there was any way the girls could have “won” this no-win situation they’re placed in, or if the show could have been better for having done so. I came up empty. The show is so tightly written, so expertly constructed, that there was nowhere for my unwashed hands to make it better. The game of wishes and witches was rigged from the start.\nThis show advanced the medium of anime, and while it is not the first deconstruction, it is by far the best I’ve seen. It’s a favorite, a classic, and a landmark, and if you don’t believe me you can scour the lists on this very website for the scores of magical girl anime that were made in its wake hoping to catch just a glimmer of its brilliance only to fall on their faces. Even five years later, people are still attempting to replicate the Madoka formula of deconstruction with varying degrees of success. That is a testament to its longevity, its quality, and its mark in the hearts of its millions of fans.\nUntil next time, remember that there’s someone out there fighting for you, and you are not alone.\n        "},

Despite its benign genre of mahou shoujo, it manages to break many typical tropes and stand out on its own as a masterful reimagining of a classical anime genre. It is full of despair, dread, misconceptions, misunderstanding, deception, dread, angst, and above it all, hope. There has never been an anime of this genre quite like it, and that is precisely what makes it so distinguished and enjoyable. Although I can't deny that the ending is utterly ridiculous, it manages to adhere to the story and characters that have developed throughout this show. \n"},

The best thing about this anime is that is really delves into a more realistic, nitty gritty magical girl genre.  It really makes you think about the consequences of magic and the cost a magical girl pays to get her power.\n-Art-\nI find the artstyle of the characters kind of an eyesore, really.  Waaaay to cutsey-cutsey.  Madoka and her mother have the exact same face shape.  I suppose you can argue that it's a stylistic choice to offset the\n          \n        dark plot?  But it took me about 7 episodes to take this show seriously due to the art style.\nThe animation, itself, is very good though!  The fight scenes look amazing.  \nI find the stuttering animation of the Witch's Labyrinth so unsettling and it's awesome!  That was a very good stylistic choice!  \n-Sound-\nVoice acting is very good.  Soundtrack is very good.  The subtle, creepy giggles and wonky tones utilized in the witch's labyrinth are very appropriate.\n-Character-\nCharacter-wise, this anime doesn't offer anything really different than your typical magical girl series.  You've got: the bubbly main character, the cool senpai, the sporty girl, the rude girl, and the quiet girl.  Again, you could probably argue that that was a deliberate stylistic choice.\nMy favorite character, oddly enough, is Kyoko Sakura.  I like how she's tough and I think her weapon is cool.  \n        "},

There was more than one time where I would fight the strongest urges to watch it at school just to find out what happened next. Once you hit a certain point in the series, get ready for a long binge night - because you won't be able to stop yourself until you finish it!\nThe art style, while simplistic compared to other\n          \n        anime that came out the same year, was artistically simple as it made the viewer feel like they were watching an ordinary anime - rather than the nail-biting series that it is. I pleasantly enjoyed the use of the chairs in the series.\nI personally found the opening theme quite dull, and skipped it every episode after I had watched it once. Standing from the perspective of a reviewer, I see why the opening was made in the way it was. As previously stated, without knowing the story one would think of this as an ordinary Maho Shojo, and the opening reflects it. The ending theme and battle song, however, I became addicted to! As I write this, I am listening to it. I feel that Magia by Kalafina is the best music that could have been put in the anime, it makes the battle sequences hair-raising and more intense.\nAs far as character is concerned, I absolutely adored Homura Akemi. I found all the characters charming in their own ways, and I felt that the anime would have been lost if even one was missing. I felt that Sayaka Miki's personality was lacking compared to others, and wished that it had been deepened. (that being said, I have not read the manga and am only speaking from the opinion of an anime viewer.) Madoka Kaname's ditsy and sweet nature, while can be very overused and a waste of a character in a lot of anime, is the perfect counterweight to the depth of the anime. If not for her compassionate personality, I feel the anime would have been too dark for the plot.\nI first discovered this anime while I was surfing channels after dinner. I'm from Australia, and there isn't a lot of anime on TV. If there is, it's a bit overrated and boring. I came across it, and watched the scene of Mami Tomoe's first fight out of boredom. I didn't realise how much the visuals and music would draw me in, and quickly changed channels to save myself from spoilers. About 6 months later I decided to chase it up, and finished the series in less than a week (at the time I was a full-time student.) I wouldn't say that Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is one of my favourite anime, but with a few more of my personal criteria it definitely could be one of them.\nI would recommend this anime to someone who; likes Maho Shojo, doesn't have the time or the drive to follow a long series, enjoys unique character design, isn't afraid to have their heart broken, thrives for a good plot twist and loves watching friends fight for one another.\nI rate this anime 9 sakura flowers out of 10.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    Many reviews about Madoka can be summarized in one sentence - \"intense, plot twisting, dark show breaking the foundation of genre\". I find these features attractive as I enjoyed Mirai Nikki, Shisekai Yori, Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero. And when I learned that Urobuchi Gen wrote the scenario for Madoka, I started watching it despite the genre. This was my mistake. Most reviews are praising and comparing Madoka with other magic girls anime. But I started watching it without deep knowledge about mahou shoujo and this greatly affected my enjoyment from the show. So if you are fan of the genre I recommend you to read other\n          \n        reviews instead of mine.  This review is dedicated to provide an opinion on Madoka without consideration of its genre.\nStory: It's something quite expected from Urobuchi Gen - dark atmosphere, realistic violence, plot twists and references to science and culture. Story is intense, filled with events, mature themes and psychological questions. Plot development is good and quite fascinating. But author as always justifies his title \"Urobutcher\" - not all acts of violence are properly justified and I sometimes doubted characters will to survive (\"fight or run\" seems to be replaced by \"fight and die for greater good\").\nArt: I watched some titles with abstract or simplified art, but Madoka beat the record. Abstract dark art used at battle zones to visualize witches evil nature and menace they present. Simplified art is used in usual life and it seems coherent with hight-tech architecture. But characters design are too much schematic and their facial expressions are difficult to read. \nSound: Standard Yuki Kajiura anime score. Seriously. And i don't have particular opinion about opening or ending. Voice actors are done good job but I wouldn't call it outstanding.\nCharacters: I think what main weakness of this anime is characters, they are too simple. It is no good then you can fully describe character personality with a few sentences. No deep background, no explanation for their feelings towards each other, no character development. They are just set of principles like \"protect people\", \"save important for you person\", \"serve justice\". They pretend to question their motives but they cannot defy the \"programming\". Still, some complexity in characters are born from conflict of their desires and reality.\nEnjoyment: It was hard to enjoy dark and violent story, then I don't feel anything towards characters. Still Urobuchi Gen and Yuki Kajiura make it quite enjoyable (familiar duet from Fate/Zero,huh?). \nOverall: Not up to dark-Urobucther-anime expectation, but still good. \n        "},

Why might I bring this up: 2 hour difference sitting in a theater full of weebos compared to 12 episode series.\nA friend of mine told me, that \"the trailers sounded and looked happy.\" well...he was wrong, and misled like everyone was. \nAnother one of my friends told me he was going to the barrios of the Philippines for a month, he thought it was pretty cheery for the first two episodes.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    The series starts off sprinting with sharp, eye catching imagery:  Optically illusory hallways leading to a destroyed city, a scene enticing enough to wet the one’s appetite until at least the end of the third episode. (Which of course is the one that abruptly reveals the series’ true nature and gets the metaphorical ‘ball’ rolling.) Expect every facet you love and adore about this typically fluffy genre to be turned upside down as our heroines fight for their lives against the terrifying Witches. Mixing an art style of cutouts and CG, the visual impact of these monstrosities is heavily striking, doubly so when tied\n          \n        with the eerie and operatic soundtrack.\nWhat begins as just a well animated magical girl series with a serious feel develops more and more into a dark and twisted look into the realistic perils of being asked by strange little creatures to make contracts and fight the forces of evil. Kyubei, our series’ not-quite-adorable animal mascot, asks our heroines incessantly to make a contract with him, gaining the powers of magic in exchange for an obligation to destroy witches. As the series develops, the girls truly learn what this entails; Potential injury, sacrifice, and even death lurk around every corner.  Inevitably, though, they must make this difficult decision, as in exchange for becoming a magical girl, one wish is granted. As each of them have desires to fulfill, fighting temptation becomes an emotional struggle seemingly few can resist.\nDealing with dark themes such as death, betrayal, injustice and futility, Madoka Magica manages to balance itself with at least one truly likable character, Homura. Discovering her powers, emotions and back story is a delicious high point of the show, with a complementary set of incredible fight scenes featuring her centre stage. The series often shows how it can quite the enjoyable thrill ride by just letting the twists come and being encaptured by the ever changing plot. Especially in the last few episodes of the series, the audience is given excellent plot points that tie the series together and make for a fantastic ending.\nWith that said, the series does falter often, mainly due to lead characters that are mostly one-dimensional and uninteresting. The lack of this strong character presence hurts the show, giving it a feeling of showing off a concept rather than a fully fledged story. Plus, even with a coherent and often exciting plotline, the series doesn’t always maintain its level of excitement, with some parts of the story feeling subpar. Sayaka, Madoka’s best friend, for example, features an overly melodramatic storyline, highlighted by her over the top breakdowns at every given opportunity.\nThankfully, the overall impression is one of a well polished and interesting take on a normally bubbly and formulaic genre. No one can finish Mahou Shojou Madoka Magica without at least admitting that it presents a fresh look and feel, mixed well with addictive battle scenes and twist-filled plot.\nFurther Viewing:\nBokurano – For those who enjoyed the terrible inevitability of the characters’ fate in Madoka, why not give this tragic take on the mecha genre a try? With each episode more crushing and depressing than the last, Bokurano has the same distinct atmosphere as the sinister magical girl series.\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni – If you thought Madoka took a dark stance, prepare yourself for the maddeningly sick and horrific Higurashi series. Four girls and the new guy in town get caught up in an ever repeating sequence of gruesome deaths, and breaking the cycle seems near impossible.\nRevolutionary Girl Utena – Thought the magical girl genre couldn’t get more insane? Madoka’s bending of the genre barely compares to Utena’s breaking it and blowing up the pieces. Half surreal, half symbolic, and three quarters insane, don’t miss this great rendition of the magical girl tale.\n        "},

When I started watching Madoka I had a feeling I wasn't going to fall head over heels for it like so many people have. Turns out I was wrong.\nStory: Absolutely great. This is by far the best aspect of the series in my opinion. There were no major plotholes of any sort as far as I can tell. The plot keeps moving and doesn't focus so much on battles as it does on storytelling. However, the ending didn't turn out quite as good as I\n          \n        hoped it would be, but it wasn't that horrible either.\nArt: Excellent. I loved the character desings to bits (although I sometimes felt as if I was watching hey arnold). Battles against witches are extremely trippy. I honestly haven't seen anything like it in anime. I felt like I was tripping on acid on numerous occasions. It was very fun to look at.\nSound: The OST is utterly amazing. It ranges from epic chant to orchestra. This is also one of the best things about the show in my opinion.\nCharacter development: Character development was good, but not perfect. I honestly wish Mami could have gotten more screen time. I also feel that they spent too much time focusing on Madoka and not other characters. Be that as it may, the development was still very good.\nEnjoyment: I absolutely had a blast watching this. From the trippy scenes to the unbelievable soundtrack to the emotional moments, Madoka Magica is a success from start to finish. I would not be so quick as to call it the best anime of 2011, as I have not yet seen steins gate.

I mean, one wish for magical powers? Sounds like a great deal to me, but Puella Magi Madoka Magica was so much more then just that. It was much darker and not as happy as one may think.\nStory 9\n The story was wonderful. Like I mentioned, it was more then just girls running around in costumes, it was so much more in depth and the plot was well thought out. They learned the truth behind being a\n          \n        magical girl, all these depressing secrets and learning and depressingness, if that's even a word. Bottom line, it wasn't a simple, boring story.\nArt 9\n The art of the characters was good, not the best but above average. I'm actually glad it wasn't any different because it made the anime seem much more innocent and childish. What impressed me though were the labyrinths. They weren't typical anime styled art, but they were like collages and they were really well done, like, if the labyrinths were anime styled, it wouldn't have made this anime as unique. Also, I gave the art a 9 because of the labyrinths, otherwise it would have given it an 8 or 7.\nSound 10\n The sound was actually soooo great. Like I said in my SAO review, Yuki Kajura does it again:)  It wasn't a music I would have normally listened to, it was different, but it wen't great with the anime and it was really outstanding.(I'm listening to one of the songs now D:)\nCharacter 8\n There was some character development, not much though, but there WERE only like 12 episodes. I wish they could of gone more in depth into their back stories, but they kind of did, enough for me to feel sorry for or like the characters. It was pretty good. The characters them selves weren't danzels in distress, so I enjoyed them.\nEnjoyment 10\n I finished the series in a day. It was like, I HAD to watch the next episode. There was so much drama and lessons and tragedy and with the music and the balance of action and drama, a little bit a romance, it was really enjoyable.\nOverall 10\n This anime was so beautiful, I think you should all go watch it right now!

You don’t need amazing visuals to tell a good story, so it’s about the original material (if any) and the screenwriter’s adaptation of it here. Good cliffhangers that keep you on the edge of your seat week after week suggest the series is doing something right, whereas filler-esque showings don’t.\nWhen it comes to a gripping story, three series immediately came to mind — Anohana, Madoka Magica, and Steins;Gate. After skimming some episodes of each, I had to go with Madoka Magica for\n          \n        its deconstruction of the magical girl genre and heavily character-driven progression where the heroines plummeted more and more into despair. It happened late in the series, but the story shares similarities with Steins;Gate’s hellish time traveling too — all in a mere 12 episodes. I loved how Urobuchi Gen’s dark tale cast a constant shadow of doubt on where things were headed and then completely twisted my understanding of everything that’s happened so far. It didn’t shy away from character deaths either. For those reasons, it edges ahead of Steins;Gate. Okada Mari’s touching story isn’t too far behind.\nPlot Twist\nI’m looking for a sudden unexpected turn of events in the story that caught me off guard and delivered sheer shock value. It’s that “WTF” moment that has people talking about it for the next few days, regardless of whether or not anyone found it agreeable. Below are the plot twists I have in mind.\nThis plot twist is largely the reason why Madoka Magica’s story was so good. After everyone was left wondering if Madoka would ever become a magical girl, we finally got our answer in the most unexpected way — she’s already been one numerous times and met her tragic end every time. What’s worse, Homura’s been reliving the same hell over and over again to try and save her best friend from such an ill-gotten fate. That revelation reshaped my very understanding of their “first” encounter and everything that’s happened since. It was so series-defining that I had to take a step back and looking at the bigger picture just to take in all the implications. Once it sunk in, I was dying to know if Madoka would make a wish and if it would pave a way to a brighter future.\n        "},

Such an incredible amount of originality was put into this anime, ranging from the art style right down to the story itself.\nStory: 10\nConstantly keeping the viewer wanting more, this anime delivers with each episode - wasting not a single episode with meaningless\n          \n        filler. Each episode only serves to inform and satisfy while yet leaving an eagerness for more.\nArt: 10\nI saw some wonderful blends of different styles and I was absolutely in love with it. Even during scenes where violence seemed 'edited' for youth, it still emphasized the intent of the grimness. To express an emotion to the viewer without needing to over-exaggerate the grimness, in the art, was just incredible.\nSound: 10\nThough it seemed only half a dozen different tracks were used, they were used so well. Music wasn't played needlessly and each time a track - no matter how often it may have been played in the past - always managed to express just the right kind of gravity to the current situation.\nCharacter: 10\nThe premises of this anime forces each character to have a story - And that's what I love about it. There weren't any background characters that didn't in, some way, bring their own content into the series. Feeling despair when a character felt despair, feeling happy when a character felt joy - That's how strongly this anime was able to portray each character.\nEnjoyment: 10\n12 episodes of wonderful art, music and story. I couldn't have asked for more, in an anime.\nOverall: 10\nEach girl had her own reason for fighting and each had a sense of defiance against overwhelming odds that just made their plights all the more tragic. For an anime that seems to advertise happy-go lucky and good-time feelings, this anime delivers on a completely opposite level.

I mean when you first see the premise and the art and visuals you think this is going to be a cute adventure with magical powers and cupcakes. YEP NOT AT ALL! Seriously after episode 3 i don't think there is a happy tone in this show. Now normally that would lead to a depressing mood but this show finds a way to keep on the line of engaging and avoid being depressing. Don't get me wrong this show is heart breaking at some\n          \n        moments and the ending will leave you in tears but it never gets depressing.\nCharacters again are bloody amazing. Every single one has their own quirks and have their own weaknesses. You start to see some strange things near the end to (Im not going to spoil it but a lot of stuff come around) I do think that Kyoko and Sayaka are very similar so that can get annoying to some people. They pretty much have the same wish and fight for the same reasons but they change a bit after something happens. One goes one way the other goes the other way. Honestly i can't say more without spoiling it.\nMusic, Visuals are all A++. The visuals in the normal worlds are great but my god the visuals in the witches world are creepy yet colourful. They leave a creepy vibe to them plus they are just random. The music is superb. The ending themes they use perfectly pick up the tone of the episode. The music in the show never seems to be the wrong tone and the OP well is god damn bloody freaking amazing.\nEnjoyment well if you read what i just put do you really need to ask what my enjoyment score is?\nOverall this show isn't a masterpiece. It is perfection. To do this much this well in only 12 episodes is amazing to me. Honestly the best part about this show is how nothing in the show is what it seems. \n        "},

If you think this anime is a light-hearted, happy magical girl anime... it's the opposite.\nMost magical girl animes show the lighter side of being a magical girl - the frilly costumes, power, working together with friends, ect. Madoka Magica, though? It shows the other side of it COMPLETELY - the truth behind the frilly costumes, the power, and all of that stuff. It also shows the consequences behind making a wish... ending in despair.\nThe soundtrack is outstanding - Yuki Kajiura did a really amazing job. The OP and\n          \n        ED are also amazing - this anime was how I got into Kalafina and ClariS.\nThe artwork is beautiful - especially the labyrinth and character designs.\nThe character development and plot are really good.\nI'm really glad I watched this anime - you won't regret watching it!\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Everyone has a wish. Perhaps it is to be noticed by someone you admire or love. Maybe it's to be rich and famous. It could even be as simple as not losing someone you were close to, or to protect someone. We all have our wishes. One thing above all else we hope will come true. The question is... What are you willing to sacrifice to have that wish granted?\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica follows the story of Kaname Madoka who is suddenly thrust into the world of magical girls. This is not a happy go lucky story though. You quickly see that there is more\n          \n        to this show than meets the eye.\nMadoka Magica is what's known by many as a deconstruction. It takes something well known, in this case magical girls, and asks all the questions other magical girl shows don't or wont. Why is there an animal here trying to help us? Why does he want us to be magical girls? Where did he come from? Just what are witches? What do they want? Where do they come from?\nSo, in typical magical girl fashion, squirrel-cat thing Kyubey appears to Madoka and makes her an offer to become a magical girl. In return, he will grant her any one wish. Usually when things sound too good to be true, it's because they are. These girls learn that lesson the hard way.\nOn the character side of things we have our \"protagonist\" Kaname Madoka. Originally seeming like your typical girl but her traits shine more later on as her past is explored better. Then we have her best friend Miki Sayaka. She is headstrong and diligent. Always wanting to do what's right and just even if she has a hard time doing that herself. Then we have Sakura Kyouko the smart mouthed almost tsundere girl from another town. There's Tomoe Mami the caring and loving one. She wants to protect everyone even at the cost of her own well being. Then finally we have Akemi Homura... Homura is an interesting character because almost nothing is revealed about her until later in the series. Up to that point she seems like little more than a Rei Ayanami clone.\nWhat makes these characters so great is how fleshed out they are in such a short amount of time. Each one has clear-cut motivations and flaws. Their back story and contribution to the plot is astounding. Even the side characters. You'll find yourself rooting for these poor girls. Hoping and praying that they will win even if it seems less and less likely with each passing episode.\nThe music gets a special note here. The soundtrack was composed by Kajiura Yuki and is fantastic. Each track is able to immediately set the tone of the scene and emphasize the emotions. The themes for every girl is spot on. These are tracks that remain in your mind long after the anime is over.\nThe animation side of things suffers a bit. Studio Shaft is well known for having questionable quality shows air, then fixing them later for box set releases. While you can easily say owning the box set fixes this, they are so unreasonably priced most people will watch this streamed. Unless they pirate.\nOverall Madoka Magica is a fantastic anime and a well done deconstruction. I can not recommend this anime enough to people. The plot is very mature and changes protagonists on a whim and that can be jarring to some. However, if you can see past that you are in for an amazing tale.\nMadoka Magica is often considered a masterpiece and I often find myself having troubling debating that.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="                          \n    I went into Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica with high expectations. This is the show that has supposedly redefined the magical girl genre. I expected darkness, grittiness, and, most of all, uniqueness. And, well, Madoka sort of delivered. \nOnce you make it past the first three episodes, the plot is actually quite engaging. The show does delve into the bleaker aspects of power and responsibility. The focus on the strain of romantic and familial relationships was refreshing, and I also enjoyed how the characters’ opinions of themselves changed as the secrets of their true natures were revealed. I particularly enjoyed the Faustian concept of “paying a\n          \n        price for a miracle.” I can attest that the plot was well thought out, and even quite moving at times. The musical score was very nice. The opening theme was especially catchy, and Kalafina did not fail to deliver. The band’s ethereal vocals augmented the show’s somber themes.\nThe art was 50/50 for me. Other reviewers have remarked on the surreal quality of the witches and their lairs. I agree that this was a daring move, and it did pay off. The witches are completely unearthly and far more threatening because of it. The labyrinths dazzle the eye, and since the viewer never knows what will appear next within them, the tension and suspense levels are high.\nBut I hated the character designs. The enormous, doe-eyes and fluorescent hairdos did not match the vibe the show was trying to set. Most of all, I abhorred the characters’ wide, goofy looking faces. No matter how great the hardships, it’s difficult to take someone seriously when they have a football for a head. So when one character’s noggin got bitten off, I felt like some poetic justice had been served. The girls’ costumes were okay, but I for one would not want to fight evil in big flouncy petticoats.\nLike the art, I was also torn on characters.  I wanted this show to take all those magical girl clichés and turn them upside down. Kyuubey was exactly what I was looking for; at first glance, he’s the typical, cuddly animal pal. Then his apathy and questionable morality emerge and delve into grim territory.\nBut the actual heroines…  I’ll start with the good aspects. I enjoyed the rivalry between Sayaka and Kyouko.  I appreciated that they did not immediately establish a friendship with each other.  Both of their backstories were interesting and their inner struggles were engaging. Each one had a strong personality, and I would’ve liked to see more character development between them. \nI did not like Mami at all. Her motives were never explained and her actions were not believable. For a reason that is never revealed, she immediately warms up to Madoka and Sayaka, but has this completely unexplained grudge (a grudge that endangers all of the girls, by the way) against Homura. I got whiplash from watching her lurch from saccharine to vindictive. Apparently, becoming a Puella Magi has made her bipolar.  \nThis brings me to Madoka, the primary reason why this series flopped for me. For a show that was supposed to refresh the genre, Madoka possesses every cliché magical girl trait. She even has pigtails. She wears pink. She squeals and blushed at everything.  She’s a little clumsy, but her enormous, generous, sickeningly, mushy heart makes up for it. Cue the collective “Aww.” \nWell, all of this is a major no for me. It’s all been done before. There is nothing interesting or surprising about her personality, and for the majority of the series, she walked around with a kicked puppy expression painted on her football head. As the eponymous character, Madoka did not bring anything fresh to a show that really had a lot of potential. \nWhile I didn’t care if Madoka lived or died (honestly, I was kind of hoping for the latter), I did genuinely like Homura. She had some serious backbone, and when she entered the fray, you know she meant business. Unlike Mami, she did not get caught up in a catfight in the territory of a bloodthirsty enemy. Homura’s unflappable, jaded outlook also contrasted nicely with the newer Puella Magis’ short-lived idealism and wild despair. Homura’s characterization wasn’t entirely innovative, but she did have a surprising storyline, and I enjoyed the innovative use of her powers. Her motive was convincing and pretty sad. If she had been the titular character instead of Madoka, I think this show would have been much more powerful.   \nMadoka wasn’t a bad series. I’d probably even watch it again, and I wouldn’t mind seeing the movie about Homura’s exploits. The alternate timelines that are revealed in the final episodes peaked my interest, and the concept of the show is very intriguing. A great deal was done very well, but overall, the show just did not live up to my expectations. "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Overall : 9/10\nHonestly this was the second anime I saw and it blew me away. I was just on Netflix looking for something to watch and I saw this masterpiece just sat there. I'm so glad I took to watching it because this is one of the best things I've seen to this day.\nStory : 10/10\nIf you're looking for an anime with tragedies, a bit of romance, a bit of excitement, a bit of a mind-f**k and with a multitude of twists and turns then this is the anime for you! I thought it was one of those animes that continues on with happiness and\n          \n        hope and all of that but the third episode hit me like a wrecking ball. I realised the turn it took.\nThe knot of the plot is slowly unravelled before your eyes and it looks amazing. The character development, the bonds, the premise, the story line, the direction, everything about it is just perfect.\nThe contrast between the colourful animation and the dark world of Madoka Magica is incredible, how they work in the science behind the magic you thought was there even more so- Sure, there were a lot of questions they could've asked like 'What happens if you don't collect enough grief seeds for your soul gem' but honestly, they had me fooled.\nHow the story twists and turns is beautiful and I just can't describe my love for it without spoiling it.\nArt : 9/10\nThe art. The absolute /art/! I couldn't tear my eyes away. It was impossible. The image of them all being loli and cute compared to the dark world around them was brilliant, the abstract appearance of their city, how the direction of shots were worked into it all made it one of my favourites just visually, not to mention the sound and characters and story. The animation seems so simple but you begin to notice how almost fragile it appears, almost as to say 'They're fragile young girls born into this dark and horrific world' all on its own.\nSound : 10/10\nAll the characters sound alive and expressive through both the Subbed and Dubbed versions, though I find Hitomei's voice a bit contrived but she's not really much of a character in this series, maybe in the Concept movie.\nMy ears are singing. They grew lips just to sing to the soundtrack. All the music in this anime seems to weave a tale of hope and despair. Sayaka's theme just makes my heart throb for her, the opening theme expresses Homura's promises to Madoka, the mystery behind Homura's theme, it's all wonderful and as though it was just written for these characters. Whenever I'm drawing I just have to plug in my headphones and listen to CONNECT and the ending themes.\nAlso I love the twist of the original happy themes to the dark Magia one that seems to tell the tale of time and how deceiving the concept of magic is.\nCharacter : 9/10\nHomura is my favourite character in anime... Ever. How she turns herself into what she considers to be a monster in order to save Madoka, how she goes back in time again and again and even shoots Madoka at her command. The way she falls into such an emotionless state actually makes sense, something rare in anime these days with characters like Kirito just becoming depressed after being trapped. Her loyalty to Madoka is endearing through and through.\nKyoko is a breath of fresh air for me, it's not rare for her type to pop up but I do like how she is written and animated. She's not really that soft like most characters acting like her are, but she is considerate and is just afraid of being alone. The confusing bond between her and Sayaka is cute and although it is confusing how they are suddenly friends, it could be that they remember each other faintly as Madoka did with Homura after Homura turning back in time slightly. \nMami is ok, I understand her motives and everything but she's not my favourite. She's a noble character and I have friends who adore her as their favourite, and I can accept that as she's not really a bad character, but someone who dies so early into the anime just isn't someone I can get attached to that much at all.\nI don't get Sayaka. To me she's over-emotional and I don't think many people actually do like her at all really. She's more of an exposition character in my opinion as she opens the window into how things really are in the Madoka Magica universe, but she's nothing special. She's a bit whiny and annoying to be honest, and her voice actor plays her well in that respect, but I just don't really like her hotheaded personality much at all, especially with how quickly she descends into madness with just finding out her soul was taken out.\nEnjoyment : 10/10\nOverall I did enjoy it a lot and even managed to shed a few tears for Homura and Madoka."},

Honestly its just so sad,emotional and depressing and yeah here's the warning if you don't like this stuff , don't watch it.\nCharacters are OK-ish, few of them are really good like Homura and Kyoko while others lack development like Sayaka and Mami even our main character Madoka isn't really a\n          \n        bad MC either,she is good enough . Oh yeah Many characters die too sooo yup.......\nOP is catchy but its nothing against its ED which OMG SOOOO GOOD!!!!\nMadoka Magica is not really inviting but once you're in, there is no way out(well as long as your'e not an idiot). Action is really good too,Art used is beautiful.\nPROS:\n#Good animation and art\n#Awesome soundtrack\n#Emotional depth\n#Good ending\n#Homura\n#not spoiling but there is kinda time traveling  which I LOVED\nCONS:\n#some characters lack development\n#A little slow and uninviting start\nOverall Madoka Magica is Superb,it is dark,emotional and a gripping story.I will give it a 9 which means it is Best of the Best.\n        "},

You will rarely find me writting reviews for unenjoyable anime because i find ranting pointless so me taking the time to write this and share it with you is already a big giant plus for this anime. \n~Story~\nWoah! Giving off all those cutesy vides than smashing action, violence, gore, psychological themes and freaking amazing plot twists on your face! Hell yess! Where can i find more of these misleading animes because i'm all about that rollercoaster of expectations?\n          \n        So basically this anime is about this little animal who gives magical powers to little girls so they can fight evil witches. In exchange each girl gets one wish granted. Sounds cute, until you find out the anime actually deals with the origins of this suspicious animal;  the struggle, regret and consequences that come with the wish and explores some dark character backstories. I found this show hella similar to Future Diary and Steins; Gate for reasons i won't mention in order to keep this show spoiler free, but hey those two are great animes and so is Madoka Magica. I won't say this anime is 100% unexpected though, because as the plot developed the anime itself didn't intend to be completely unexpected and kept throwing hints at you. I also like how it ceased to keep me bored because shit started happening really soon in the story which is not the case for mos 12 episode animes, since they can only fit one small arc the majority of the plot is in the last two or three episodes and the rest are just fillers or character backstories, but in Madoka Magica questions kept getting answered episode after episode and just when you thought you know enough it hits you again with something greater. \n~Art~\nThe art was a bit experimental which is not my favorite type to be honest. Sorry about the mediocrity but i enjoy the average anime artstyle. But from an objective perspective i's say it was a great fit. The character design was all cutesy i suppose in order to be a little misleading, but also to add to the 'magical girl' theme. Some scenes are filled with weird artsy pattern thingies which made me a bit dizzy at first but then i got used to it and it's actually pretty original and in an atristic way kinda deep. I would have enjoyed the show just as much without those artsy pattern thingies, but i'll give the show another big plus for originality. \n~Characters~\nThis is one of those shows where you don't get as attached to the main character as you do to side characters, because let's face it, Madoka was boring. I mean, ok she's a nice caring person and all but she's boring. Even the show itself indirectly reveals that she's boring. Won't go into much detail about this, i think i made my point. But this isn't one of those shows where it's all about the main characters even though it may appear that way after you've watched, because they took the time to make some good backstories for side characters and there's a lot character development involved (most of which is included in the backstories tho). I enjoyed it because it explored some dark themes and even went into a psychological level. Those girls may look cute, but i can tell you they went through some tough shit. \n\n~Enjoyment~\nI don't need to repeat myself. \n~Overall~\nI mean the one thing the show didn't have was comedy, but i would say it made up for that with the cutesy character design. My point is that this show is actually for everybody(except little kids), despite your favorite genre. So go watch it. The worst that could happen is that you find it mediocre, but i can guarantee you that it's not a waste of time. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This is an abridged review for the sake of space.  For the full review with analysis, see my blog.\nTo say that Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica is a foray into the magical girl genre is to leave a great deal unsaid.  Madoka★Magica is far more complex than can simply be summarized in 130 characters or less.\nTo briefly summarize, Madoka★Magica follows the titular character Kaname Madoka and her close friend Sayaka Miki through their encounters with the mysterious supernatural being Kyubey and other magical girls.  Through these encounters, they are confronted by the growing realization that there is a terrible price to be paid for\n          \n        the power they acquire.  Their wishes have drastic repercussions, ultimately leading to each character's own internal struggle between hope and despair.  Their power becomes less of a blessing and more of a burden as the characters struggle to balance the desire to make the world a better place despite the horrific toll it takes upon their naive, adolescent minds.\nThis summary barely scratches the surface of the thematic impact of the series.  The magical girl concept is merely the backdrop, the vehicle for telling the story, giving it an immediately familiar and understandable framework upon which to build a greater narrative.  What Madoka★Magica eschews is the typical structure of the magical girl show, focusing instead on the drama and dilemma inherent to the condition of being a magical girl.\nMadoka★Magica instead confronts loss of innocence much more directly and symbolically examines the negative consequences of puberty and adolescence--broken hearts, tension with parents, mortality, sexual anxiety and fear of objectification.  The loss of innocence is part-and-parcel with the mounting sense of despair that grows throughout the series.  The characters have thrust upon them the burden of responsibility and eventually obtain more and more knowledge and experience that makes their tragic destinies all the more apparent.  Magic carries a steep price, as the characters commit to a Faustian bargain with a supernatural entity.  Each episode peels away more mystery and as each layer is exposed, more knowledge is obtained and the more innocence is lost.\nAll of this and more are conveyed within a brief 12-episode run with  incredibly tight pacing and narrative flow.  Every scene is crafted with a tight attention to detail and a deliberateness that conveys volumes of meaning.  The conceptualization and realization of the world in which Madoka★Magica takes place is heavily stylized, with exuberantly avant-garde architecture juxtaposed against dense urban skylines, oil refinery towers silhouetted against red skies at sunset, and interior designs at times elegant and at other times almost fantastically futuristic.  It calls to mind the surrealist movement of late Soviet animation and early-20th century German Expressionism.\nMadoka★Magica has the makings of a classic.  It will undoubtedly stand up against the test of time and take its place alongside other seminal works in the medium of Japanese animation.  If, ten years after its release, it is still considered complex and influential, is still widely analyzed and discussed, this reviewer's grade of 9 will likely be upgraded to a 10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    This series... It is  of the few times where I say \"FORGET TO SAY THAT IS PRETENCIOUS, THAT TRIES TO BE A MASTER PIECE, THAT'S A BAD ANIMU\", because this arguments is far to the reality: Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a very good anime from this decade.\nMaybe this series isn't a revolution as many says, but have ressurected a genre full of loliconism and fanservice (this yet exist). Madoka Magica play very good with the plot and play very well with this \"cards\". Not reveals information as other series and the plot twists aren't removed from the sleeve. This series isn't for all,\n          \n        because many believes that PMMM want to be \"deep\", but I repeat: that is far to the reality. \nThe visual, the songs and the plot is a clasic seal from Shaft, which is famous for incorporate a visual narrative and few others symbolism in the series. In that case, the symbolism It works from two forms: theoryze or tell witch's stories. \nEven the characters, isn't lazy and boring. Is interesting watch that Madoka plays a very good role in the series. Is very good say that MADOKA ISN'T LAZY AND ISN'T USELESS THAT AS MANY REVIEWERS SAYS. The series isn't hard to analyze and say \"oh, now I understand because the name of the series\". The rest of characters are very good: the villain is fantastic, Tomoe is an awesome character, Homura is great, Sayaka, Kyoko, etc... are very good characters that fullfills the roles in the series.\nThis series is my favorite for cause fear and shock in your world, because I feel dark and intimidate unlike a other maho shojo series. I reccomend check the first three chapters, and stop means \"this animu is pretencious and appears to be deep\". Watch such as It, and LEAVE IN PEACE THIS HOLLOWS ARGUMENTS.\n        "},

I would say that the so good ED by Kalafina is the only place where we really feel the ambience of the anime, a darkness unexpected and unpredictable. It's a true innovation, Gen Urobuchi completely reinvented the Magical Girl by giving him an psychological side, very mature and frightful. To avoid spoilers, I'll stop right there. \nThe Art is not perfect, even if some may not have, I liked the Witch's dimension, which is psychelic and I\n          \n        really love that. The plot is amazing. I don't think there's 12 episode plot that are as good as this one, it's the most dense anime that I saw and it's truly a masterpiece, everything is perfect. The character development is sudden, logic but surprising. The sound is perfect, Yuki Kajiura is for me, as good as Hiroyuki Sawano and the enjoyment may not be 10 all the time, but for me it was and there's more than just that. That psychological side, that Gen Urobuchi does so well, make us think, and it's intelligent thought. \nThe end, we can't just describe it by \"sad\" or \"beautiful', it's beyond that. Some people might dislike it because it doesn't bring any conclusion but that's what so good with this end. It's full of meaning, tragic, very true and reinforces the pasts events in an way that I never felt before, and that makes it even better.\"The individual is powerless to change History and that by screaming his existence to the world, we just look stupid.\" That could describe what we feel in the end of the anime. It's realistic, and cynical.\nI give 10/10 to everything except Art, where I give 8/10, but it doesn't matter much for me. The rest is from FAR, enough to give Overall : 10/10. Don't believe that it's just the typical Magical Girl show, it's so much more.\n        "},

With nothing else to do, I decided that I had nothing to lose by watching it, and that I might as well try it out. Man, was I surprised. By the end of the last episode, I was thoroughly impressed at the anime I had previously thought was going to be a boring, part adventure, part slice of life, feel good\n          \n        anime. It had presented a well written story that felt fresh to me, stellar music and unique artwork, and all within a short span of only 12 episodes making it one heck of a ride.\nSound (10/10):\nThe opening and ending songs are both fairly solid, and the OST done by Yuki Kajiura is probably one of the best, if not the best OSTs I have heard in my somewhat limited experience with anime. It’s even better in the context of the anime, making events feel more significant, more dramatic when appropriate. The Japanese voice actors do a great job at portraying the emotions of the characters as well. There’s really nothing to complain about here.\nArt (9/10):\nThis is arguably the weakest part of Madoka Magica from my perspective, but for really small reasons, which didn’t generally detract from my overall enjoyment, and there is a lot more going on that’s good rather than bad when it comes to the art in the show. Most of the time, the animation is gorgeous. That is to say, major things like the witches’ labyrinths and character designs are done really well. The main issue I and others have is that at times there are details that the studio might not have paid attention to because they are just not well done - these tend to be in the background, but it’s still somewhat noticeable, and gives a sort of sketchy quality (which I actually didn’t dislike a whole lot, but it is noticeable).\nStory (10/10):\nOne thing that I really enjoyed about the story is that it took something that I thought was going to be predictable and bland and turned it over its head. Within the course of a couple episodes, the series went from an adventure/slice of life anime to a dark psychological drama and thriller; it felt fresh and unpredictable, and I liked it. There were many moments when I felt genuinely shocked, while the tragedy throughout made me get “feels,” and even included symbolism and allusions to other literature without seemingly dumbing things down, but also never feeling “2deep4me.” The story is intelligent and unique, but not too far out there so that it hampers the experience of the viewer, and is also dark and mature, which I like.\n**Spoilers**\nCharacter (9/10): I felt that the characters were really well done, especially considering that the series is a measly 12 episodes long. However, with 12 episodes, even with such a small group of main characters, a few characters, namely Mami and Kyoko, felt underdeveloped. While I was able to sympathize with Mami, and her death felt tragic, I just feel like more character development would give more weight to her death. After all, we only saw her for 2 and a bit episodes. Additionally, I think that Kyoko’s progression was a bit rushed, and it almost feels unrealistic how she warms up to Sayaka so quickly. I can believe it, but it could have been better done. The rest of the characters are pretty good. Sayaka gets a tremendous time in character development, being introduced in the first episode and only dying in the ninth, and her downfall seems natural and believable; her transformation into a witch was one of the more saddening scenes for me. The writers must have really liked her to give her so much character development. Additionally, Homura was a character that I think was well written - (evident from my profile pic at the time of writing this review) the well known episode 10 did a great job at illustrating the pointlessness of her attempts to change Madoka’s fate, and really helped me empathize with her, and ultimately made her my favorite character in the series.\n**Spoilers are done**\nEnjoyment (10/10): This series gave me a lot of enjoyment - there were surprises, feels, and overall great music and art to complement it. Having only 12 episodes with a lot of content, the pacing is fast, and there are no “useless” episodes. I will likely come back to this series again sometime.\nOverall, I’d recommend this anime to anyone who likes serious or dark animes, such as Fate/Zero (which is by the same writer), but I really think anyone could get a good amount of enjoyment out of it, as well as some mature themes or ideas. Ultimately, I would give the show a 10/10. Yes, I think Madoka Magica is certainly a masterpiece.\n\nIt’s probably also worth noting that this is my first review I’ve ever written, so it might come off as rambling, but hopefully not!\nEdit: I plan on rewriting this review some time in the future.\n        "},

I've always been more of a fan of action tv shows so I love Shonen anime. I also love dark and creepy concepts for a story too, so I was surprised when my best friend knows my preferences and then....I see this show.\nIt feels very innocent and cute at first but...as the phrase goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover\" this anime has themes that\n          \n        are very uncommon for the Magical Girl genera and I LOVE IT for that.  I love how well crafted this show is, from having vastly different artstyles clashing with the anime artstyle yet it works with the show, to how everything in this show has a reason for happening, even making the main character Madoka seem to not do much in the show, is all for a reason.

Madoka Magica does an excellent job at throwing your initial expectations out the window with this strangely awesome dark and gritty magical girl vibe that the series possesses. \nStory: I thought the story was fantastic! it was nothing like any other magical girls genre, in fact it was completely opposite. The story is quite tragic and dark, and it really flows well with the tone the show has going for it. There aren't really any filler episodes either; the story stays focused on it's goal and moves along rather nicely with the initial archs. \nArt: This area\n          \n        wasn't slacking at all. The show is filled with rich and beautiful colors that stand out at every instant. The environment looks incredible switching between bright and shining, to dark and disturbed backgrounds. The character color schemes were phenomenal, and match right along with the characters personality. \nSound: I'll just say I loved the soundtrack! It goes along fluently with both the action and emotional scenes. The sounds from the characters transforming let you know that these are real magical girls. The one thing I did enjoy most was the composer being Yuki Kajiura made some wonderful pieces that fit right in with the show. \nCharacters: All aboard the Mami hype train! In all seriousness this show had some great characters. It didn't really just focus on Madoka through the entire story, it built upon all the characters as the arch progressed, and it showed back story into their lives giving you an understanding of why they chose to be Magical Girls, and now are regretting it completely. \nEnjoyment: I had a blast through this show! Every second of it was enjoyable to me, it was a breath of fresh air and it just felt great watching it. The story pulls you along very quickly and doesn't slow down through the rest of the series. \nOverall: I can't say it enough this is one of legends boys and girls, so go do yourselves a favor and go watch it as soon as you have the opportunity! \n        "},

Madoka Magica is no child's show, and certainly, no teens show as well.\nNow, what SHAFT had done was take your basic magical girl anime genre. However, they had pulled that element apart, only to pull it right back together, with a much more realistic twist to it, unlike \"Sailor Moon.\" Which was to my shock.\nWhen I first stumbled across this anime, I thought it would be another one of \"those\" genres. However, five seconds into the episode I thought otherwise. Now, how could SHAFT manage to maintain such a dark element to a magical girl show? That's\n          \n        a question that indeed, myself cannot answer.\nI cannot express any dislikings to this show without spoilers, so i'll leave it as a positive review as of now.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Ah Madoka, a very popular work praised for being a genre defying work.\nIt was a decent anime, especially if you are just starting out noted for its dark themes and cute cast. Nice production with some very predictable parts to the plot regarding wishing and how broken of a fantasy concept that is.\nHowever as a nitroplus and urobuchi work it is terrible\nStory-3 \nA very flawed story full of contrivinces and missed opportunities at every chance to make it tragic for the sake of it, I predicted the end before even halfway into the show.\nCharacters-2\nWorst of all is the characters that fail at every possibility and\n          \n        set everything in motion, one in particular could have stopped the whole plot by being more proactive. Urobuchi never really wrote female main characters like this and it shows.\nPresentation-8\nBest part by far, weird visuals by shaft ( it looks very similar to hidamri sketch in design and coloring) and even though the music isnt from nitro+'s ZIZZ its still strikingly great having some standout vocal tracks.\nEnjoyment-0 \nUrobuchi lost all his integrity when he stopped doing eroge, he now makes shallow trash with non of his amazing writing to punctuate action and world building. His anime are so bad on average that they may as well be by some nobody rather than himself as he made nitroplus into what they are which is the best eroge company to date. His anime is watered down and his usual tone of pitch black became a very light gray as he started to lose his heart for dark stories and focus more on making bank by slapping his name on everything. His eroge are all masterpieces in various ways one way is by how he will clearly define the true intent of the work to you in the first 30 minutes, in madoka it takes 3 episodes and comes to quickly to really care about the character rather than the fact that it just happened. It's hollow edginess with no impact, the urobuchi I know was far better at making me care and making the stakes matter more than this. Vampirdzhija Vjedogonia ( also by urobuchi) came out nearly a decade before madoka and its easy to see where nitroplus's priorites shifted too, making completley casualized to get as many people to love it while trying to deliver a good story, in 	Vampirdzhija Vjedogonia's case it was an eroge that lacked all sense of caring about what YOU prefer and instead giving you a story that was horrifying and badass to the very core but supported by suprisingly great writing, so it wasnt hard to fall in love with the unique honesty the eroge had. Madoka has 0% of the integrity of that vn and fails to get you invested unlike Phantom of the inferno, Kikokugai, or Saya no uta ( also all by urobuchi). Fir these reasons my enjoyment of this title is a flat out 0 even if one is as low as MAL will let me go.\nOverall-3 / 10\nUrobuchi died in 2011, dont let anyone tell you otherwise, he left nitroplus's eroge writing entirely in the hands of shimokura for years now with no sign of returning. Madoka is a very flawed work, but the fact that Urobuchi wrote this and not something better in text form is an unforgivable blow \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    A pinnacle of Japanese animation, this SHAFT anime production manages to tell a compelling story with deep characters, gripping music, and experimental animation in 12 episodes.\nMadoka is a Seinen and certainly not for kids or those looking for a light-hearted magic girl. People familiar with genre will “get more” out of the show, as it directly counters and subverts magic girl tropes. Like myself, however, you don’t need to be a magic girl fan to be a Madoka fan.\nPlot: 8/10\nFor once I’m putting plot first instead of character, because I feel like you can’t judge the characters without considering the plot. \nFirst a warning: the\n          \n        first episodes may bore viewers who aren’t fans of magic girl anime, and fans of magic girl anime may only enjoy those first episodes. They are, however, imperative to the show’s goal.\nMadoka plays out like a maze, leading people down false turns with the intention to frustrate the audience and upset characters. This show wants to irritate and surprise you. Consider it like one of those chocolate eggs you get on Easter. It looks pretty and shiny, like something sweet and fun, but, as you peel off the wrapper, you realize the chocolate tastes bitter, and the inside is dark and hollow and not at all what you expected. Don’t let the show’s trailer, intro, or promotional pictures deceive you into thinking this a cute, happy show. Madoka is set up to mess with the viewers at the characters’ expense.\nThe plot is fairly typical and could be described in a single sentence; but, again, this show is not about the plot so much as the journey the viewers take as the characters discover truths. Interestingly, much forward progress occurs with such revelations rather than actual events. The uncovering of new information jerks characters and viewers alike into a more desperate direction. \nBeing only 12 episodes, the plot is blessedly uncomplicated. It is easy to follow with no name or character puking. The cast is small and well put together. The story is both sweet and sad, reaching a grand scale without a hitch. \nCharacters: 9/10\nThe first time I watched this show I was too distracted with the plot (and the frustration it brings) to really notice how well developed these characters are. This is partly due to the nature of the show, which often withholds information from the audience (one character in particular suffers from this). However, after those secrets are revealed, it forces the viewer to reevaluate everything about said character up until that point, giving Madoka high re-watch quality. \nThe second time I watched the show I realized how attached I had become to most of the cast, two girls in particular. The show does a good job of keeping emotional drama from turning into melodrama, which helps you attach to and grieve with the cast. \nDespite the brevity of the show, each of the main girls feels like a real person, with a history and desires. Each girl has a different personality, all of which are well explained, likable, and believable. Especially interesting is seeing how each character reacts to the world and plot twists. \nMost of the girls undergo fundamental changes (I can’t say growth, since it’s a regression in some cases). The cast also interacts with each other well, and their own relationships with each other grow and change throughout the show. Often, the girls foster positive changes in each other. I find one relationship in particular a touching and beautiful example of how love can make you stronger. \nThis show does a good job or showing portraying realistic personalities in an impossible situation. You see how normal girls face having to save others at a high cost to themselves. Watching girls struggle with the reality of becoming a magic girl and the price paid creates an interesting, if heart breaking, dynamic.\nAesthetics: 10/10\n(animation)\nWell, it’s a SHAFT production. You can expect fantastic and stylistic animation, which Madoka delivers. It’s often breathtaking and unique and couples a more typical and clean animation style with what looks like the doodles of a disturbed child. But, hey, it works really well and adds to the story.\nNo corners are cut here and most scenes will have a beautiful and detailed background. The characters are expressive and the fights clean, easy to follow, and fast. The show often uses highly stylized animation to curb some of the more violent moments, but that only increases the show’s overall tone.\n(angles)\nCleverly placed, the show uses angles to influence the viewers’ emotions and understanding of the scene. Angles also help show what a character is feeling but not necessarily saying. \n(intro/outro)\nDon’t trust the intro. Just don’t. The song—“Watanabe Shou” by ClariS— is lovey and the animation is fine, but it doesn’t make sense until the show is almost over. Then go ahead and pay attention to it.\nThe outro, when the show finally gets one (it takes a few episodes), is amazing. Stylized and dramatic, it has striking animation, tells a story, and gave me chills more than once. Of course, the song is “Magia” by Kalafina, so that’s not too surprising.\n(music)\nThe OST adds to the show’s drama and blends well with the characters, scenes, and overall tone. It fits both the show’s normal, happy magic-girl feel and the desperate, chaotic underbelly. \nFemale Representation: 10/10\nThis is a tough one, as most magic girls are. On one hand, the show follows a group of powerful girls who have to save the world. On the other, it’s moe and has one or two scenes that may make some viewers uncomfortable. But the moe is palatable and shouldn’t deter anyone from watching the show.\nI’d have to say it represents females well and the little girls you follow aren’t overly sexualized. The girls are fully fleshed out characters allowed to grow and make mistakes. They can actually fight too, usually in battles the viewer will view as a life and death situation. On top of that, the girls have significant relationships with each other and a variety of personalities. Aside from the moe (which I know really bothers some people, me included), I don’t have any reason to complain.\nThe two main female leads also present absolutely fantastic examples of strong, female leads. One girl’s kindness ends up being her strength. I can’t express how exciting it is to see female leads who are strong because of their femininity. Another girl’s fighting power is completely self-earned. She makes herself stronger instead of relying utterly on her magic girl power because she wants to protect a loved one. On top of this, we see a mother working as the family’s bread winner. She also has a working relationship with her daughter, which is surprisingly touching and well developed for 12 episodes. \nIf anything, I’d say this show lacks decent male representation. Males are, in fact, largely absent from the show. Males aren’t torn down and called weak, but only one male exists and he serves as a plot device, not a character. \nOne character may (or may not) be male, so I can’t really consider it for either side.\nI wouldn’t recommend it for kids, but that’s hardly due to the moe aspect of the show.\nOverall: 9/10\nIf you decide to watch Madoka, prepare for irritation, shattered expectations, and, most of all, tears. I know people who hate this show and those who swear by it. I, personally, adore it and recommend everyone gives it a shot (though, you kind of have to reach the end to really appreciate it). Then you have to watch it again—with a tissue box beside you. \nIf you have any concerns I didn’t address, let me know! I’d be happy to help. "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, henceforth shortened to ‘Magica’ in the interest of concision, is a show that came out in 2011 and was met with stunning praise and, as with most popular shows, harsh rejection. I decided to watch the show on a whim and assess for myself what I thought of the show and if I would recommend it to someone else.\nIn short, my answer is ‘yes, it is’. I should clarify my perspective. I approach Magica at the angle of someone who has never really watched the mahou shoujo genre, though I have watched some deconstructions of the genre and am not unfamiliar to\n          \n        its tropes. I also come at it from several years after it was originally produced, so I think it would be safe to say that hype, good or bad, is not going to enter into this review. With that, let us begin.\nStory -\nLife for Kaname Madoka, is happy but unexciting. Madoka has a happy family, good friends and overall a normal life. This is all turned up on its head, however, when, she and her close friend, Sayaka Miki, rescue a mysterious cat-like creature called Kyuubei. Kyuubei, as thanks, offers the girls a deal. In return for having whatever wish they want granted, he will turn them into magical girls, whose job it is to fight off the evil witches who threaten the town.\nFairly typical set-up, right? Mysterious, cutesy creature finds young girls and turns them into magical girls to fight off the forces of evil. Cue the moe, right? Well, if you don’t know, I won’t spoil it in this review, but it is obvious from the first episode that Magica refuses to simply be put in the box of ‘another mahou shoujo anime’.\nI personally was already partially spoiled as to the nature of the deeper plot, which did slightly dampen my experience. However, by no means is the story terrible and indeed it is actually quite good. While I think the story alone is decent, I think the main aspect that draws people in is the contrast between the preconceptions about what should happen and what does happen, a theme I will go back to later.\nCharacters -\nThe characters, much like the plot, seem at first to be very box-standard. You have Madoka Kaname, the cute, shy type who only wants to help everyone and protect her friends and family. The rest of the main characters follow suit. Sayaka Miki is the spirited, tom-boyish type who want to be a hero. Homura Akemi is the mysterious and cold transfer student. Kyuubei is the cute, alien-animal sidekick. And so and so forth. Much like the plot, though, from these predictable base archetypes, you start to see fully-grown 3D characters with their own motivations, personality flaws and feelings. Indeed, motivation is an important theme in the show, although explaining more would spoil the most interesting character conflict that I have seen in a long time. So, I’ll stop there.\nAnimation and Sound –\nThe animation, I would say should be split into three parts; early-series, late-series and battle.\nEarly-series, the colour palette is light, with lots of bright blues, yellows, greens and other bright colours that present the aesthetic of a happy atmosphere that suits the overall atmosphere and nature of the start of the show. \nLate-series the colours grow darker, but also richer and starker, taking on various tones of grayscale, whites, deep reds and dark blues. These help represent the change in tone the show undertakes, with the bright, innocent colours that featured so heavily before, now only appearing infrequently and now seeming much more fake and fantastical than before.\nMy favourite animation is definitely present in the battle scenes, both in and outside of the ‘witch worlds’. Inside the witch worlds, the art-style moves from cute to abstract and creepy, taking on a picture-book style. These scenes have some of the best artistic choices, including a whole battle carried out in silhouette form. The animation is overall fluid and fast-paced, with mercifully short ‘transformation’ sequences for the magical girls, though still maintaining the feel of a traditional transformation.\nThe OP and ED are easily my favourite part of the show. ‘Connect’ by ClariS is a bright, fast-paced pop/rock song the brings the viewer into the mind-set of adventure and magic that would be expected in a regular mahou shoujo anime. It’s filled with bright, innocent scenes of the main characters having fun. The opening does, however, hint at the way the show will develop, certain images gaining new meaning as the show progresses as well as the lyrics.\n‘Magia’ by Kalafina, leans more into the rock side of the genre, the tone of the song tempered by the inclusion of bells and a much deeper and richer sound than the opening. This represents the latter half of the show and features; images of the girls being sucked into an encroaching dark force. The lyrics here to, present a much darker picture than the OPs did. The rest of the music is incredibly good too as well, though these songs are what stick out in my mind.\nOverall –\nSo, on balance, adding in my own personal enjoyment of the show, the show weighs in at 8.4. The show is definitely good and I would definitely recommend it to a friend for them to try. Like most people that rate Magica highly, most of this comes from the main theme that connects all aspects of the show that I have mentioned here. Duality. There are many examples of this; the mahou shoujo genre vs. psychological genre, fantasy vs. reality, light vs. dark. The show embodies the concept of combining two seemingly incompatible elements. The studio obviously knew what they were doing when they thought of how to present this show and that is why I highly recommend you watch this show, if not for its excellent plot and characters, then for its intriguing thematic elements."},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    Preface: In spite of the name, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is NOT a magical girl show, or at the very least not your average magical girl show. The first time I heard of this anime was on recommendation from a friend, which I brushed aside. Though after a few nights of boredom I broke down and actually watched the first episode, and I could not have been more surprised and pleased with what I saw. The first episode opened with a dark and bleak atmosphere, with a girl fighting what looked like the third form of the last boss of a Final Fantasy game, and\n          \n        I was hooked from there. \nThe entire story of Madoka Magica is totally unlike any other magical girl show that I've ever seen. While most magical girl shows have the principle dilemma of the heroine as \"how can I balance my life as a normal girl while living up to my responsibilities as a magical girl\", the question the girls in Madoka ask themselves is \"how can I not die while doing this?\" For the most part, mortality is an issue that is not even touched on in other series, but Madoka has it as an ever-present force. Not only that, but other heavy subjects such as morality and the essence of human nature are standard fare for this series. \nThe art style is stunning, though it may not sit well with everybody. The most notable aspect of Madoka's art resides with the witches. The enemies of the series reside in pockets of space-time that are adjacent to but separate from our own, and have a visual style of a surrealist nightmare, or perhaps a bad acid trip would be more apt. This juxtaposition of girls in cute outfits in a more traditional anime style fighting in this twisted netherworld add not only a unique touch to a rather common genre, but also help foreshadow later themes in the series. \nThe soundtrack of the series is stellar. This extends not only to the catchy opening, the dark rock closing, but also to individual character music and battle themes. In fact, Mami's theme is an interesting coupling with a battle scene, due to it's uplifting chorus and accompanying orchestral score, but it works surprisingly well. \nThe characters are well done, as each character has a personality that is easy to identify (the shy one, the athletic one, etc.), but what's more is that each character has a unique back story internal conflicts that are laid bare to make give them depth and round them out as a whole. Each of the magical girl has a unique outfit, weapon and fighting style that provide some relief from the standard magical girl wand. One of the more interesting powers is that one magical girl has the ability to summon a seemingly infinite number of magical flint-lock rifles. The most mold-breaking character that is presented in this series is Kyubey, the \"mascot character\". Without wishing to spoil anything, he has an agenda and his smiling face may haunt you. \nIf I had to criticize the series at all, it would have to be that there are no significant male characters (the only two are Madoka's father and little brother), and that the main cast seem more introspective and emotionally mature than their age would suggest, but even these quibbles are minuscule in the broad scope of the series. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a deep series that feels like a mix of Shakespeare and Faust, and should not be dismissed as \"just another magical girl show\". Madoka is a prime example of how good anime can be, and is a great addition to anyone's list. \n        "},

I am obviously not talking about the broadcast version, but the dvd. The main characters are very well done. The soundtrack is perfection. The action scenes were great. The story is one of the best I've seen in an anime in quiet a while. The best part, however, is the pacing. The show is 12 episodes long, and is paced perfectly. After using the first several episodes to set you up, each episode is full of content, and builds on what the previous one did. I used to think that 12-episode series\n          \n        almost always left you lacking, but then Masoka Magica proved me dead wrong.\n                Overall, I would heavily, heavily recommend anyone who watches anime give this a try. It is not something you have seen before, and is worth the watch. Personally, in sheer quality, I would probably put this up there with BeBop, though for different reasons. So, please, go watch it, or Kyubey will find you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Despite its serious themes, Mahou Shoujo anime are usually cheerful and upbeat in their portrayal of the young girls and the discovery of their magical powers, emotions, and responsibilities. The primary model for this sub-genre remains of course, Sailor Moon. \nDirector Akiyuki Shinbo introduces all these elements into Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica as well, but takes the tone of the sub-genre down a surprisingly different road, in turn making it quite an effective narrative built on the foundational premise of magical girls.\nUnlike the upbeat, romantic atmosphere of Sailor Moon, Madoka Magica is filled with tragic consequences and disastrous circumstances. Essentially, the series is a deconstruction\n          \n        of the Mahou Shoujo genre it belongs to. Most Mahou Shoujo anime dwell on the duality that exists between its young female protagonists as they attempt to balance their ordinary lives alongside their secret magical personas. But Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a series that prefers to explore the dark recesses of becoming a magical girl, a choice that is given considerable weight, as the anime ultimately suggests. \nI wrote a full review on the anime, take a look at the link below and tell me what you guys think :)\nwww.japanfinds.com/mahou-shoujo-madoka-magica-anime-review"},

But I did like it.\nSo lets get right too it.\nThis Show is super generic, it breaks no mold in character or story and the twists are nothing new(but with some creative style). It is different from other magic girl anime's maybe but I even doubt that on the story side. Other then it having a darker setting.\n\nWith that out of the way. This show is really fun, it is a fun action/horror show. Is it psychological honestly not that much there is some but it not anything\n          \n        special once again nothing new. The other just fun and horrifying also mystery stuff just make it a really fun show that brings you an enjoyable ride.\nIn conclusion as this is just a short none detailed review. This show is worth watching as it is a well made fun show.\n        "},

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is the latest anime masterpiece. Really an amazing anime to watch. You will cry, laugh, feel the characters and get inside each one's little world. It's not just getting magic wands and pretty dresses, trust me.\nStory: 10/10\nThe story is outstanding. It begins with the title character, Madoka Kaname, an average 14 year old middle schooler. One day her life changes, when she and a close friend, Sayaka Miki, run into Kyubey, a mysterious being. He is\n          \n        being chased by Homura Akemi, a girl who transferred to their school that day. They try to run from her, and enter a weird and bizarre place. Guess that'll be all, so I won't spoil it for you. All I can say is that the story will leave you literally shocked, both in the good and bad way. It is so amazingly twisted, you won't even know what to think about it anymore.\nArtwork: 7/10\nThe artwork is good. The characters could be a bit better, they're all drawn cutely, but their outfits are pretty simple, both ordinary and magical girl clothing. The backgrounds are amazing, they give you an Alice in Wonderland kind of vibe. The colors are rich and mostly dark. Also, the city/school/places have very high technology, which is a nice touch, making the story more close to the real world.\nSound: 8/10\nSound is pretty good. Every piece of music is dark and fitting. It fits what the character's feeling and describes the mood. OP and ED are great, too.\nCharacter: 9/10\nCharacters are inside out amazing. They develop in so little time and are fast paced. Every character has their own personality, filled with the liveliness of a teenager and other twisted stuff that go on in the series. They are extremely well-written, and by the end of the series, each one has matured and decided what's best for everybody. Yet, they have the liveliness within them, that doesn't let them destroy who they are, which shows how strong they are. All are goodly explored too.\nOverall, Madoka Magica is a series that should not be missed. It will give anything you'd ever want from a series. It will make you experience lots of emotions. It's pretty good. I'm giving it a 9, because, even a masterpiece ain't  perfect. It's flaws, even though extremely minor, are still  here. Or maybe I'm doing it just to annoy y'all hardcore fans. :D Anyways, this series is totally worth it.\n        "},

Ideally, i prefer comedies (which is something this anime does not offer), and i definitely DO NOT like magical girl series, but this anime entirely BLEW MY MIND. To start off, the artwork is what originally drew me into this anime. All the artwork is unique, soft and nice for a futuristic-like setting, but then..... something amazing happened.... A REALM OF ABSTRACT CREEPY-NESS ENTERS THE STAGE!!! Holy crap, there are just no\n          \n        words to describe the twist Madoka Magica takes when these cutesy little school girls fire up guns and swords and fight amongst themselves, as well as vintagey-abstract-victorian-style witches! And after that the WHOLE STORY spirals into this twisted new and exciting story that I DID NOT SEE COMING. This sets magical girl series to a totally different level... in other words......... * YOU MUUUUUUST TRY THIS ANIME!!!!*\nAlright! Well now that you understand how FANTASTIC this anime is there are a few minor critiques. As I said before this anime really isn't a comedy, in fact it's pretty much void of all humor, its purdy darn serious. It's only appropriate though, there isn't really room for slap-stick humor in the midst of a mind-provoking plot. Another minor point, it really doesn't have any attractive characters :/. Yet again, the story really doesn't leave any need for that kind of thing, but for any fantastic anime there is typically at least one EXTREMELY COOL/ATRACTIVE character that you tend to root for you know? In fact for some animes thats the MAIN REASON YOU WATCH IT (Ikuto fangirls?remember him?) ! This anime pretty much equally distributes your pity/admiration for all the characters, i can't say i liked any one person more than the other.\nbut alas, sorry for my long critique. You totally MUST put this anime on the top of your anime list ^^\n        "},

It absorbed me right in, and made me HAVE to finish watching the show. Though, it seems it gets fairly confusing by episode\n          \n        10.\nSound: I found the sounds at some points very disturbing, and that just adds to the suspension and well-made art/story. The voices matched all the characters very well, the SFX are great, and the minions/monsters are perfect.\nCharacter: I found that all the characters had their place, and played the roll they looked like they'd have. I knew right away the Homura would be some sort of depressed girl saving Madoka.\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime A LOT. I've already re-watched it 3 times, and every time I still enjoy it. (I find lots of new things every time too!)\nOverall, I really enjoyed every aspect of the show, and really hope there's some sort of OVA or season 2. I really enjoyed it, and for sure will fit this into my top 5 for the time being. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    To me, there's three things an anime needs to do right to make me a fan of it. Story – You got to keep me intrigued. Emotion – People have to demonstrate real anger and sadness. Action – I should get a little bit of an adrenaline rush and keep me wanting more. Puella Magi Madoka Magica delivers very well as far as story and emotion go, but action is not its strong suit.\nThis anime definitely has sub-par graphics, but that is not the problem when it comes to the fight scenes. The problem lies in the lack of imagination when it came to making\n          \n        them. The battles come to little more than the character using her attacks, which don't change very much, to the enemy getting a few hits off with the crap it keeps throwing, and then to the conclusion. You'd think that since the fights take place in a magical world, there would be a bit more variation to it, but there's not. I wish that the battles were a bit more enduring, so we could actually see the characters struggle through them. There's only 12 episodes in this series, and I think it really could have been expanded and enhanced had the fight scenes been dragged out a bit more. I realize that most people would rather get to the meat and potatoes of a fight, but I think this anime really could have benefited from more action in them. Perhaps one of the problems, that was keeping this from happening, is that the witches and their creations feel no pain and never react to anything; hard to make a back-and-forth fight out of that. There was only one fight scene between two people, and that actually was alright, despite that one person never really did any damage.\nSo all-in-all, I would give this anime an 8 out of 10. This would be suitable for most people, but I only want the best. Therefore, it falls beneath my standards (barely).\n        "},

I'd like you to have the least amount of prejudgments possible before going into it. Just know that it is not at all as it seems, and is as close to a masterpiece as i have seen in a long time, anime or otherwise.\nArt: 7\nAbstract. I had a hard time getting into it at first but it fits the anime well.\nSound: 8\nSoundtrack fits quite magnificently with what is happening on screen. Loved the classical bits.\nCharacters: 9\nThe greatest thing about the characters in this series are the flaws that they have. The\n          \n        story greatly benefits from these flaws and is one of the reasons it is so great.\nStory: 9\nOne of the things that really impressed me about this story was the \"wise old man\" that just emanated from the dialogue from time to time. Some great quotes to be found here. The story was tailored very well to the characters that are in it. The story has kind of a  \"every action has a positive and negative consequence\" ideology behind it.  I was very impressed with how the ending was written, as it easily could have strayed off from that idea, but it manages stick with it well. However, because of its somewhat negative ideology can get quite grim at times, but that's part of what makes it great to me.  \nEnjoyment: 8.5\nCan be a bit grueling to watch from time to time, but that is part of what makes it so great. It can be extremely unforgiving at times, which makes me want to watch it even more. The sense of mystery and ominousness that surrounds you though out the entire series unravels its-self quite satisfyingly and never treats you like a child, however childish this show may come off as. (To a westerner anyways) \nOverall: 8.75\nAs i said above it is as close to a masterpiece as i have seen in a long time, and would highly recommend that anyone who enjoys anime to watch this series.\n"},

I was still reeling in shock from the utter greatness of Danganronpa, and was not prepared to think that any other anime could be as good, so you could say I was a little prejudiced when I first started watching this.\nWhat can I say? It was great. There were numerous features I liked:\n- Plotline: I love how not only this is a complete different take on the magical girl genre, but it starts of sweet and ends up dark. Do not let the cute characters, and definitely not Kyubey, fool you. And that brings me to,\n-\n          \n        Art: It wasn't state of the ART (get it?), but it was quite good. I particularly liked how the characters were very easy to draw. Their kawaii-ness also helped with the sweet, sugary first impression of the anime. \n- Music: OMG, the music in this is like 20 over 10. It's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. I am constantly humming it and it has sent me on a rampage to learn the pieces on my violin. \n- Character development: Since this anime doesn't have too many characters, character development was very good. Whilst Madoka was a little stereotypical, it wasn't too bad. I particularly liked Homura's character. However, I feel as though Mami didn't get enough development. \nOverall, this is a great anime which I really enjoyed. It becomes dark quite soon and will hit close to heart. This is the first anime which made me cry, and let me tell you - I never cry. It's so heartfelt and amazing and.... Just watch it, okay? You won't regret it. Trust me. :)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="                          \n    Madoka Magica truly is one of the most outstanding animated shows that I have had the pleasure of watching. The story is unique and interesting, the characters are colourful, (dis)likeable and multidimensional, the art is gorgeous, the environments are enthralling, and the sound is captivating. Shaft has created a true marvel.\nThe Art \nMadoka Magica's artstyle is busting at the seems with personality and colour. Most of the time Madoka uses a more traditional artstyle reminiscent of other shows of the Magical Girl variety such as Sailor Moon. Although traditional Madoka's artstyle helps in visually expressing the emotions of the cast with an expansive colour palette ranging from\n          \n        vibrant reds and calm blues to desolate grays. At other times the show swaps out the more traditional MG style for abstract art. Environments that once were alleyways become living Van Gogh paintings with the strangeness bumped up tenfold. In these environments is where the show's artstyle truly shines with the characters battling through inconsistent enemies and constantly shifting worlds. The eccentricity of these environments commands a sense of urgency and danger that helps us better empathise with the cast. The juxtaposition of the more traditional art of the characters with the abstract environments makes for some of the most beautifully animated scenes I have witnessed. \nSound\nThe soundtrack behind Madoka's art is what truly sells the atmospheric package. Each song is unique and helps to convey the emotion that fits the current situation. The OST ranges from beautiful yet melancholic piano pieces to heartpounding orchestral pieces.The ambient effects and SFX are crisp and deliver their intended effects. The SFX makes each hit and blast feel impactful. The ambient effects help add a sense of life to even the most dreary of situations.\nCharacters \nEach character has a unique style to them that helps them stick out among the cast. This is mostly due to the rather conventional single colour palette (Red hair, red dress, red eyes, etc) that you would expect from a show of the similar nature. The psychology of each character is thoroughly delved into through visual cues, flashbacks, conversations, and monologues. Shaft was smart with its character development as the overall tone of the show revolves around how the characters are feeling. When the characters are hopeful the environments reflect that hopefulness. When the characters are hopeless the environment reflects that hopelessness. Every character is multidimensional and display a variety of emotions. Panic, fear, depression, hopelessness, hopefulness, giddiness, nervousness, and guilt are all emotions displayed by the characters all at appropriate times. Every emotion a character goes through feels organic and never feels forced. No character feels like a cardboard cutout or a specific type of character. Although they may fit archetypes no character feels like the bland \"Tough Apathetic Guy with a Soft Side\" or the \"Wimp with the Iron Heart\". Of course a character can be interpreted as one of those but as the story progresses each character is slowly fleshed out as different sides of them come to light and are expressed and thus their similary to the more traditional two-dimensional character archetypes more or less disappears. For me every character simply felt like their character. Sayaka felt like Sayaka and Madoka felt like Madoka. The voice actors did a superb job at molding their characters. The actors feel very natural in their roles and help sell their characters as human beings. Even when I recognised the voice of a different character that an actor has previously portrayed I never made a connection where that character was anything but that character.\nStory \nMadoka is an interesting take on the magical girl genre. The MG genre is mostly known for its light-heartedness whereas Madoka goes for a mature, bleak, and serious story. The story explores the human psyche, philosophy, and morality as major themes throughout. The ambiguous nature of the plot helps us empathise better with the cast. There are quite a number of twists in the story and you feel almost as helpless and ignorant as the characters do. There are many things to be unsure about and encourages the viewer to stay on their toes just as much as the cast themselves. Although there are plenty of twists Madoka never feels like it's needlessly complicated or contrived. Each twist adds a new perspective on the characters' situations and helps educate both the viewer and cast on how the universe works. It also adds a sense of camaraderie as the cast faces a number of unrelenting and mysterious foes.\nThe pacing of the story is very well done. Everything you need to know about the setting, characters and character relationships is explained in the first and second episode. The exposition is handled very well and feels organic whereas some shows would simply go for out-of-place elongated narration and conversations about the past that make little situational sense. Instead the personality of the characters and their relationships are explained through interactions and dialogue. \nMind you I do have one issue with the story and that would be the conclusion. The ending isn't nonsensical and it does make contextual sense but I don't get why Shaft decided to go in the direction they did. To me it felt the conclusion was far too massive in-terms of scaled and I feel that would have benefited from being scaled-down. \nOverall (9/10)\nEven with the issue I have with Madoka's conclusion I still consider it to be an outstanding show. It's a must watch.  "},

However, Madoka manages to provide a dark, sinister twist on the genre, while still preserving the values it tries to represent; love, hope, compassion, and friendship. \nThe first thing about Madoka that caught my eye was the unusual visual style, it is essentially a collage of childish character designs and dynamic backgrounds that incorporates both 2 and 3-D elements that reflects the ambiance and moods of the characters. It combines the juvenile and creepy, and does it well. \nThis story is definitely a little disturbing, especially if you\n          \n        are expecting something aimed towards younger audiences.

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Madoka is my favorite anime. Anime title managed to equal the intensity of the emotional experience I had when I first watched Madoka. I will try to explain why I felt this way using my relatively poorly writing skills.\nOverall, I could say Madoka is an example of an anime that succeeds on all levels: it's writing is excellent (10/10 in character development), it's direction is excellent (also 10/10 in art), has a very memorable spooky soundtrack (10/10 in sound), it is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch (10/10 in enjoyment). It also contains many artistic elements, such as the fact it is a deconstruction of\n          \n        the magical girl genre and a lot of visual experimentation is done with the witch labyrinths.\nAfter well over a year after I first watched this and after seven re-watches, and a bit of more knowledge of the work of each of the artists involved in it I think I have a well informed perspective to explain why it is my favorite piece of audiovisual media. Madoka is essentially the work of a combination of two artists: the director Shinbo and the writer Urobuchi. To understand Madoka one has to understand the artistic elements of the works of these two artists.\nShinbo is currently one of the most significant anime directors. Working with his distinctive style which emerged in the mid 2000's and is crystallized in works such as Hidamari Sketch (2007) and Bakemonogatari (2009).\nIt is characterized by extremely fast shoots on average of 2-3 seconds each, his cuts are called irrational cuts because they violate the standard in hollywood directing (which is also followed by most anime) where each shoot follows a logical order, instead, for example, he violently cuts from the head to the feet to abstract figures and plays around with all sorts of symbolism (as very apparent in Hidamari Sketch), where the fever of Yuno, the main character is represented in the water counter of her apartment and compared to the normal temperatures of her neighboring houses). Before that his directing was more conventional but still quite distinctive, such as his work no Nanoha (2004), the first strictly adult work in the genre of magical girl.\nLike Hidamari Sketch, Madoka is extremely aggressive on a visual level. I like the level of aggression achieved in animation that one cannot achieve (easily at least) in live action film. Featuring extremely high level of visual contrast  \nMadoka borrows heavily from earlier Shinbo works such as Hidamari Sketch and Nanoha. Urobuchi said that his main inspiration for writing Madoka were these two titles and Le portrait de petite cossette, a horror direct to video animation. So essentially, Madoka is the exciting mix of several radically different genres that managed to work really well on all levels.\nUrobuchi is a writer of tragedy, horror, action and psychological thrillers anime series. His nickname among western fans is \"Urobutcher\" and some jockingly call him \"agonize them all Urobutcher\", because he likes to write plots where he makes the main characters suffer in agony for the pleasure of the viewers. Madoka is among his most sadistic works, indeed, I was greatly impressed by how evil and twisted it was and it made it so much cool and exciting. It's like Saw in being a form of torture pornography but it does not suffer from the dumbness factor of that movie.\nI wouldn't consider his minimalistic writing anything like a sophisticated form of writing comparable to authors such as Tolstoy (as some people compared it to the great works of classical European literature). His writing is very simple and focused, very concise and does not waste lines in transmitting information about the plot, characterization and thematic points. I have watched 6 of his works already and they are all very concisely written and I notice that he appears to be a very smart guy as well (he shows that he has a good knowledge of many things, such as here in PMMM the knowledge of the science fiction concept of heat death of the universe). Though he doesn't know how to write good less violent stuff, he tried to write a lighter series for a younger audience of teenagers who just turned into adults, Gargantia, where nobody dies or suffers in agony for extended periods of time but he failed to do anything really good with the concept and it became just another plain mediocre work of fiction like many others (and the ending was as bad as the ending of the dumbest Hollywood movies like Avatar). Madoka is by far his best work, because differently from his other works it has a certain sense of aesthetic elegance and balance: after finishing watching it I was in awe of how well written and executed it was. How exceptionally entertaining and at the same time an extremely powerful and affecting work of art.\nMadoka is very aggressive both on a visual level and on the level of writing. Perhaps one could say it's the equivalent of heavy metal in terms of animation (I wouldn't say that applies for almost anything else in Japanese animation). It's more visually daring than almost any live action film as well and overall an extremely impressive work of postmodern popular art. \nWhile it is similar to EVA in some ways it is not exactly comparable: It's sensibilities are very different from Evangelion: while Madoka reflects adult sensibilities, EVA reflects adolescent sensibilities. So while similar to EVA in many levels it is a more mature work which allows this mature anime fan greater level of identification.\nInitial draft first published here: http://www.movieforums.com/community/showthread.php?anchor=1&p=1155671#post1155671\n        "},

Probably every anime fan has heard it once before: Madoka is one of those shows you start off expecting one thing and leave with your heart ripped from your chest and thrown across the room in one quick swing of Satan's scythe--but when you actually sit down to watch it, it's still more intense than what you've been warned. While I expected something along the lines of \"cute but morbid,\" something resembling Gakkou Gurashi (a show which I consider one of my favorites), what I received\n          \n        was so much more complex, so much more of a postulation regarding the concept of our existence and the validity of our emotions. The only regret I have is that I waited so long, passing this show off as another hyped up mainstream series that simply defied the stereotypical.\nStory: 10/10\nWithout spoiling anything, this series deals with themes of personal responsibility, the will to survive, the meaning of life, the importance of friendship, the sacrifice of heroism, fate and the validity (or invalidity) of time travel, the inevitability of evil, and the obscurity of human values. And it nails every one of these concepts.\nArt: 8/10\nDespite the extremely beautiful styles of art throughout the show, one thing, ONE VERY SPECIFIC THING, irritated me enough to consider the art the worse aspect of this show: THE CHIN LINES. Tell me why the close-ups have such thick chin lines, with a weird darker skin shading between? Maybe it was just an artistic choice, or it was a way to make the character designs appear more sketchy (as this sketchiness is often used to indicate the severity of an emotion or situation), but....it just BOTHERS ME. \nSound: 8/10\nWhile the OST wasn't a huge part of the experience for me, the opening was catchy as hell, and music was used to intensify or express the emotions of a situation (much like the art style) in a natural way. Not much more to say--it isn't outstanding but it does its job without flaw.\nCharacter: 10/10\nVirtually the entire plot revolves around the development and fundamental importance of each character. I'll refrain from continuing, as anything regarding the constantly evolving plot of this series could be spoiler territory, but I can assure you that the character development is done right, many times over.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nNeed I say more? Go watch Madoka Magica for yourself--nothing I say can express what it does perfectly in expressing itself. That's the most important thing to remember going into this show: unless someone were to tell you the plot, you would never expect what it has to offer.\n        "},

Madoka as a person, is so amazing and incredible; kind, loving and caring. I can't believe the way the story went. I know it was supposed to be \"dark\" from the get-go, but my gosh did I love it. It's not dark, it's a beautiful story of hope, masterfully created/written and animated for us to view.\nMadoka and Homura are forever the best of friends and we witness it happen, seriously jaw dropping; this entire anime, just jaw dropping, from good moments to all the sad and bad moments, there were so many times I yelled out \"No freaking\n          \n        way, are you kidding me\" - and variations of it, so good.\nI love the OP's and ED's used, the beautiful voice and melodies to accompany the opening and the metal based music for the ED, love love love it. The entire BGM is pretty spectacular and is one of few anime where you can \"hear\" the art style. This meld is so different and is truly a listening experience. \nThe biggest difference and probably the first and most telling case that this anime is different, is the way the eyes are drawn for characters. It's not big and bright eyed with moe written all over it, it's very somber and the lines used across the top half sort of hint that this isn't going to be happy lovey wovey dovey stuff. I love the city Mitakihara, it's architecture is very real, but the subtle futuristic-like details are incredibly neat, it's amazing.\nFrom all the art, it's the fight with Witches that's truly out there. It's not traditional anime type of opponents and by God is it weird; but in such a good way, the difference between Magical Girls, the world they live in and Witches and their \"worlds\", is totally different and the clash of art-styles melds really well. All the battles are great and just simply fantastic.\nThe cast is really well done, Madoka Kaname, Miki Sayaka, Homura Akemi, Kyouko Sakura and Tomoe Mami, all very cute girls with cute costumes, but more importantly than just being cute magic girls, they feel very real with a purpose behind everything they do.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Another hugely popular anime knocked off my to-do list. I don’t really have much exposure to the Magical Girl genre of anime, and like most guys the little I saw of the standards made it seem like something that’d hold little appeal to me. Magical Girl Madoka Magica came out in 2011 and was an instant success, and I had friends with similar tastes to me highly recommending it. I remember just seeing posters of it and couldn’t believe it, but on hearing the real premise of the show it became easy to believe how a niche genre managed to reach such a wider audience\n          \n        by balancing the things that normally put people off such as the fluffy light action and comedy often aimed at kids with a level of stark drama and darkness that appeals to the mainstream. I finally gave the series a shot, knowing nothing about it other than the fact it was a subversive Magical Girl story.\nFor the most part I enjoyed myself. I found Madoka Magica to be a fairly easy watch, and its experiments with digital animation and the natural curiosity about the depths with which its macabre story would go kept my attention pretty easily. Basically, Madoka is a young girl who comes across other middle schoolers who can transform into Magical Girls and fight Witches, monstrous entities that cause disasters for humans. At first Madoka is excited at the possibility of using this power to help others, but the price she must pay for becoming a Magical Girl is an extremely heavy one. They seem to take the hero’s obligation to a logical extreme here, where the girls who become Magical Girls are forced to sacrifice their real lives out of a duty to fight Witches and an urgency because they have to do it to live. Many “normal person to hero” works thrust responsibility on the hero, but it can be portrayed as anything from a small price to pay for the power or something that can still be reasonably juggled with real life, as is a common plot conflict with many comic book heroes. In Madoka Magica, the need for the girls to purify their Soul Gems means they have no choice but to throw their life away.\nThe Witches are also portrayed as an actual threat that can do true harm to the girls early on, and naturally many of these Magical Girl or hero shows are aimed at children and feature incompetent villains or minor punishments for failures on the part of the heroes. This subversion isn’t a new one, but it’s not as common to see such things happening to children which can make it more uncomfortable. An early problem I had with Madoka Magica though was how desperately it tried to sell its tragedies. After a while, the whole thing becomes beholden to Murphy’s Law. Characters have these ridiculous backstories where everyone ever dies, people make sacrifices that amount to literally nothing, and the show’s devoid of victory or optimism. Having consequences and dramatic gravitas is very important and what defines this show when paired with the childishly feminine aesthetic, but when you go overboard as much as they could do here, the despair starts to not feel like despair to the viewer because it’s predicted as the only likely outcome. You need to have your hopes up for the tragedy to mean anything, and after a while the show is just punishments piling up without the emotional impact.\nPart of that missing emotional impact amidst all the misfortune was that I didn’t particularly connect to any of the characters. Isolating the characters from the context of the series’ unique premise and subversions of their basic image I don’t think any of them are very interesting. Madoka is intentionally a very typical young girl heroine, but a young girl heroine nonetheless. She wants to help everyone, she’s shy and hard on herself, she cries a lot about how everything’s wrong and everyone needs to stop fighting to futility. She’s drawn entirely into this because of her friend’s reckless decision to become a Magical Girl. Sayaka is obsessed with a crippled violin player she just knows from somewhere and is simply in love with, but you get the bare minimum of expression as to the fact she likes him without getting to feel much in the way of why. They don’t have good chemistry when he’s an emotionless husk lying in a hospital bed, and beyond that you get a background scene of her sitting in the audience watching him at a concert. So Sayaka has a motivation you understand but don’t really get to feel, which hinders the heaviness of her sacrifice as well as part of its believability. Akemi is the mysterious outcast type who foreshadows the dangers of becoming a Magical Girl, but mostly hops in and out to bail the other girls out of situations while speaking in cryptic messages that don’t mean anything until the second-to-last episode of the series. Until this point she’s just a stoic girl who has no meaning behind anything she does even though we can obviously infer immediately she knows more than what she’s letting on and is on the right side.\nA lot of the emotional tragedy of the show seems to be sold to the viewer due to the fact that these are brutally violent and dark fates meeting innocent cute colorful young girls. Madoka Magica feels like kind of a forced concept in that way, take the Magical Girl genre and pair it with something antithetical to shock by contrast. But I’ve seen so many macabre shows that have so much more significant drama and tragedy because they set up more interesting or complex characters or balance a dynamic tone of yearning and disappointment whereas Madoka Magica is kind of a straight line of the same kind of attempts at gut punching the viewer without setting up enough meaning for it. It’s easy to recognize why all of these things happening are bad, but making the audience feel the suffering is a much taller order. Madoka Magica jumps into its dark side very early on, and the subversion itself is weakened as such because the typical Magical Girl show and light tone is barely set up for it to deviate from and the characters haven’t yet been developed enough to really care about.\nAnd that’s kind of what the whole show is. There’s not really much to call a plot besides what’s revealed in the last few episodes, and so the progression is mostly a train wreck of contrived bad things happening to bland characters and their subsequent existential crisis of reactions to them so the show doesn’t really feel like it evolves until the very end. Part of even the basic empathizing with these girls’ misfortune due to them being only children is offset by the fact that, for some reason, they all speak as eloquently as adults in some hammy soap opera. It’s hard to believe in their naiveté and innocence when it’s offset by dramatic philosophizing and on-the-spot existential monologues from 12 year-olds. The melodrama of the show is often a bit too much to handle and the emotional reactions of the characters can be absolutely ridiculous as to what instigated them. I can forgive a lot of this because it’s made a point of how they’re hormonal adolescents that aren’t totally rational, which is fair to an extent, but I draw the line on that level of reason at things like (SPOILERS contained in following image because there's no spoiler tags yet) http://i.imgur.com/eAXnpNP.png\nThe art direction and animation of Madoka Magica ended up being my favorite thing about it. Instantly the show sets up an eye-grabbing design. The colors are bright and varied which is expectedly pleasant, but there’s nice cross-hatch pencil sketch effect on the characters’ eyes that give their expressions a bit more of an emotional glare as opposed to a more sterile digital look of flat colors, because your eyes are immediately directed to the characters’ when they stand out so much from the rest of their appearance. The architecture of the world also quickly got my attention, since Madoka Magica is placed in the “real world” but the general city looks different from a real life city in many subtle ways. There’s a distinct sense of decorating style that fits a lot of geometric shapes together in close quarters seemingly arbitrarily. Madoka’s school has classrooms located on a single square floor but all of the classrooms are separated only by see-through glass so the room is blatantly divisible into separate shapes at a glance. One of the rooms in Madoka’s house where she brushes her teeth has an extremely high ceiling and the wall is plastered with various squares of differing sizes with nothing on them to give them an actual application. Madoka’s own room has a ton of vastly different looking chairs covering the floor asymmetrically. There’s even a bar late in the series that has Michelangelo’s painting, “The Creation of Adam”, hung above the bar (which I would consider for symbolism if not for the fact no focus was drawn to it). The city often has hologram projections just out in the street, and touch screen technology is common around the actual houses. At a first glance, it’s just kind of a surreal flavoring, but I thought the choice to even bother doing this was very interesting. Technology or the idea of future mankind development doesn’t play into the plot or backgrounds of any characters even remotely. The series already takes place in the real world, and designing the city to look like any contemporary one would’ve been the obvious choice and far easier because the concept art practically draws itself because you can use pre-existing templates of actual buildings. Instead, Madoka Magica used changing decorating trends and acceptably widespread current technology to imply that the story is taking place in the future, but not something too far off or unimaginable which required the restraint of a light touch. This background art design may just be a unique texture, but it’s admirable to experiment with nonetheless and I was charmed how little attention was drawn to this endeavor by the writing itself.\nSeeming to further play with the idea of sharp shapes is what I saw as a general tendency to use many different perspective shots. There’s a lot of refraction played with here, with reflections and shadows being particularly common ways to express emotion. Reflections show multiple angles of a character’s face of course, and there are dozens upon dozens of shots where everyone’s face is obscured and you can only gauge their body language from seeing what dramatic pose their giant shadow is striking. This diagonal rhythm and large, projected body language keeps the reactions and responses of the characters very lively, and although I have issues with the writing selling the story’s drama, I have little to no qualms about the direction’s attempt to do so.\nTo finally speak of the animation quality, I was nothing short of extremely impressed. To start with the only negative thing I can think of, sometimes when the camera perspective was too far back character models had a tendency to look very lanky and nondescript in the face with blotchy features – an unfortunately common digital problem. That aside, the frame-by-frame is extremely fluid which makes the unbelievably elaborate and well-choreographed fight sequences nothing short of a marvel. This is a good point to mention the design of the Witches and their secluded worlds. The animation group Gekidan Inu Curry use stop-motion to create mechanical monstrosities of multiple moving parts that look like shuffling paper craft when combined with the fairy tale storybook appearance. Gekidan Inu Curry take influence from dark fantasy works as well as Czech and Russian animation to give the Witches their distinct mix of modern gothic and Lewis Carroll-based absurd fantasy. The textured paint job on the Witches and their backgrounds makes the solid colors of the characters really pop, and the contrast between these scenes and the rest of the world (or even anime in general) make them a joy to watch, packed to the brim with small details and objects that fly by in a second. It can very nearly be sensory overload when trying to follow the fast action as characters summon dozens of flashing weapons to combat the hordes of paper grotesqueries. But the choreography keeps the constant movement to follow, and knows well enough to frequently place the camera back enough with so many things on screen so that the action doesn’t become too cluttered. The scenes with the most amount of objects feature a lot of flying movement so knowing a character’s exact position in all the chaos isn’t important and you can get into the spectacle. The distorted, inverted art design of Witches and their worlds (as well as how they visually symbolize the characters they manifest around) would be enough on its own for me to not regret watching 12 episodes of a series. Madoka Magica is generally an incredibly well-animated show that goes that rare extra mile in also doing unique things to make sure that talent and effort truly pays off. It makes ideal use of digital techniques, not to cut corners but define its aesthetic in a way that only the pristine synthetic nature of digital could allow.\nThe music and sound design didn’t particularly impress me. Most of the background score doesn’t stand out too much, but I do quite like some of the vocal battle themes as well as the second ending song. The dark electronic trance music reminds me of some of the work made by composer Shoji Meguro, which I only bring up because the design of the Witches’ worlds also makes me wonder if the anime’s art design was inspired somewhat by Persona 3. Anyway, the sound effects that play during transformations and battles are what you’d expect, and sound is rarely used to set mood. It’s almost always the backing score’s duty, but the soft string pieces sounded generic to me if suitable enough.\nThat probably does it for now. Madoka Magica was a show I found to be pretty fun but not at all very emotionally impactful despite serious attempts in the show’s tone and direction to stress it. The melodramatic story and characters fell flat to me because I never ended up getting enough to care about either, but the premise kept me going without much restlessness. I’d give it an easy recommendation if someone hasn’t seen it before because it’s such an easy watch story-wise with its length and dark concept, and even if you’re like me and that wouldn’t make it on its own, there’s still the idiosyncratic art direction and animation techniques.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    The most critical impression of this anime was how strong the “friendship“ crest. At first glance, the character was too simple due the years of production. But that’s not the point of my review, we will review bit by bit so we know a lot positive and minus of this anime.\n\nIn Mitakihara (fiction town), Madoka and her friend Sayaka meet small and cute being who can grant any wish contrary with the big consequence.  Later, Homura appears to prevent Madoka accepting Kyuubei contract. The task was to be a magical girl and defeat enemy before the final witch awaken. Anything born from fate, and\n          \n        they must learn the biggest challenge of doing the task. Madoka and Sayaka meet Tomoe, their upperclassman at the same school. Tomoe offer them to learn the responsibility being a magical girl and joint her witch hunt.\n[somewhat SPOILER] Soon Madoka learns the worst consequence, she is a witness of Sayaka's death due the tainted soul gems [true form of magical girl, source of magic] but still Kyuubei tries to tempt Madoka to be a magical girl. Finally she realizes the reason of Kyuubei's existence is to harvest their emotion to bring despair and Homura comes from different time to save her. Homura tries to save Madoka from time to time countlessly [that’s how true friendship does]. Finally, Madoka decides to be a magical girl to stop this madness, as the result new world was created and rewrite the previous fate.\n    Well, most people hard to find the true value of this anime. I’m not a fan of this anime, but in this review I try my best to be neutral. The development of the plot was kind of exciting waku waku, but if you are an anime critic you will find most flaw of this anime is “ the expected story “. First, I try to tell you about the main character of this anime so you can imagine the plot easier. Madoka is kind and gently, live with loving family kind of timid and see herself with low talents, after seeing Tomoe's fight in the witch hunt she aspires to be a magical girl. The second chara is Homura, well in my mind Homura is the most critical chara of the story plot. She is unnaturally good at everything eventhough the cold and demeaning attitude toward others. At first glance, you will stamped Homura as antagonist chara but soon you will find the kind nature of Homura. She sacrifices herself over and over to prevent Madoka's worst fate [ my tears was drop to see the most valuable act of friendship crest ]. The third chara is Mami, third grade and veteran magical girl whom offers Madoka and Saya joint in her witch hunt. She is kind of cheerful and confident person.\n    All I can say about the OST song was good, try to find the translation in your language. You will find harmony enchantment from the phrase. The OP song was “ Connect “ from ClariS and the ED song was “ Magia “ from kalafina. When you hear the OP song, you can feel some beat as good as the other ClariS song but if you are a music devoter you will say that Connect was an oldschool song. The ED song phrase meaning was good, but all I can say when I hear “ Magia “ you will feel kind thrilling …\n\nPlus : Well, the best point of Madoka Magica series is its “ friendship crest, “ good character development, nice theme songs\nMinus : The artwork was to simple [ maybe due to the production years ], sad ending, and you can say that Madoka Magica series is not for children because of the turnover.\n"},

The deep and extremely dark themes of this anime are NOT for children and should not be shown to anyone who is not interested in BOTH drama and tragedy, as well as extremely cute art.\nThe art is extremely well done but is not for everyone.  First off, the character design is so intensely cute\n          \n        that not all peole will even be able to watch the beginning parts for the fact of how ...I hate using this word, but moe the characters are.  I will openly admit that the first two episodes move rather slowly, the real draw happens in thee third episode when it flips your ideas of the show on its head.  This show does little to nothing to hide that fact that it is meant to be an intense and slightly insane show that will leave you baffled at points.  And when it comes to the art in battles, the moe effect is lost in a world of eclectic art and a very unique pattern all in all making the show a very beautiful one.\nSo, if you can move past the art or just love it from the get go, let's move along to the story.\nMadoka is your regular -underaverage- (teenage?) girl, who lives a normal life with her perfect family and her extremely tight group of friends.  She is clumsy and can't do much right.  She's not good in school and not much else happens.  The series opens with her in a wasteland of destruction forced to stand by and watch a familiar girl she doesn't know being attacked and torn apart.  And then she wakes up to her every day life.  Another day...or so she thinks, when a new transfer student arrives in her class.  It is the same girl from her dream.  Unsure how to take this, she goes about her normal routine until she hears a voice in her head calling out for help.  And so she meets and saves Kubey.  A strange cat/bunny/vulpix like creature with the ability to grant any wish in exchange for the girl becoming a magical girl, and having to fight against beings known as witches.\nThe story begins in a very established fashion.  Until it finally breaks apart every detail of what you think you know about this series and utterly destroys it in a way you would never guess.  In my personal oppinion the ending was somewhat dissapointing.  I feel like they tried too hard to make a point and failed in a way.  Not to say it was a BAD ending.  just not exactly my cup of tea if you know what I mean.  I would say more but I don't want to give anything away.\nThe characters...I will admit I found most of them to be very bland and cliche.  The series did not leave very much room for most of them to develop as to be expected from a 12 episode series, but the characters that WERE developed made amazing impacts on me later in the story.  All in all the story has about 6 main characters only 3 or which get much focus.  4 if you include Kyoko.\nThe music is a huge bonus to the series.  Every moment is full of such emotion due much to the great musical score written for this series.  It was truly fantstic.  The opening and ending of the series being extremely bipolar I found them both quite enjoyable, but the ending conveys the feelings of the entire series in and of itself.  Even so much as to be used as a battle theme from time to time.\nAll in all I loved this series form beginning to end.  I would suggest it to anyone who is not too picky and likes series such as Serial Experiments Lain or Neon Genesis Evangelion or Mai Hime, etc.  As well as any other magical girl shows you might enjoy it can relate to a lot of them.  I hope you all enjoy the show and are as captivated as I was by this fantastic series\n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    I have debated within myself as to whether or not I should write a review for this show. You see, normally I write reviews for anime/manga that had a really strong impact on me or I really really liked. I produce more solid reviews that way. But I have given Madoka an exception as I am dying to put my two cents in.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is really quite amazing. The first 5min of the first episode gets you pumped and excited for the show. It's dark and captivating and a great way to start the show. Then you're suddenly thrown into a world of\n          \n        normal and get to enjoy a more slice of life element while adding in a few mysteries at the end.\nI was really excited for this show. I heard news of it (I hadn't heard of it until the tenth episode came out) and MAL'd, googled and wiki'd it. A mahou shoujo comebined with thriller and psychological mind screwing seemed mind blowing to me. I could only stop myself watching the series for two days until I gave in and marathoned the ten episodes.\nThe first three episodes were great. It was fast paced and terrifying. It was horrific or anything, just the things the girls went through was just terrible. I can't stand looking at Charlotte, one of the witches, either because her personality scares me. This is where Madoka sort of lost it for me...\nI was expecting more terrifying encounters with witches and maybe even a few gruesome scenes. It was what I was expecting. Maybe I was expecting too much because I soon found myself a bit bored. I think my expectation were definitely too high. Yes Madoka was something new and different but it was not something like a masterpeice.\nDon't get me wrong, Madoka is great. It goes through the mind of the mahou shoujo, why they became one and what was becoming of them. It was truly intriguing to see what the girls though, to see them hesitate to gain something that is usually seen as a blessing in most other mahou shoujo. The twists were somewhat predictable but it was still exciting to see what the characters themselves would do in the end. Some fates were changed, others weren't.\nThe psychological breakdown seemed to overpower the thriller side of Madoka though. It was so caught up in the characters' struggles that the action or the thrill had paid the toll. Like I said, I began watching this anime because I wanted something to give me chills up my spine while screwing with the minds of the innocent magical characters. That wasn't achieved. It seemed that the creators wanted the audience to question whether the characters should choose what certain path. I love psychological anime, especially when there's a thrill with it. Madoka didn't live up to that genre which is what disappointed me the most.\nThe art, as mentioned by many, is similar to Hidamari Sketch's. It is cute, colourful and is just pure eye candy. The colours of the costumes, the designs, the background, it was all hard to keep my eyes off of it. I rewatched the OP repeatedly because it was the only piece of animation where I felt I didn't have to read subtitles and just enjoyed the animation. It's a nice contrast to the darker themes of Madoka which I really appreciated. The genre that I wanted had shined in the art and not the story.\nSound was just wonderful. The OP song is catchy and easy to enjoy. It's a J-Pop song, which adds onto the carefree mask that Madoka puts on. The ED was it's polar opposite really. It was dark, sung by Kalafina which I thought was a perfect choice. Kalafina produces a wonderful deep and dark sound while they have the dark lyrics to accompany it. The music overall is directed by the same person who directed the music for Tsubasa Chronicles. Anyone else notice? It was the first thing that stood out to me. I actually don't remember any happy BGM, all I remember is dark mysterious music so I'll skip BGM for now. Seiyuu were great as well, just putting it out there.\nNormally, characters are what I love the most out of anime/manga. I love creating a bond with the characters (yes I don't have a life :P (jokes)). I like to see what reactions the directors can make me feel. Unfortunately, I never really had any real attachments to the characters. Yes they were cool and all but nothing really stood out. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable. However!! The breakdown on them was done quite well. I liked seeing them go insane. It was incredibly amusing. The ending also got me teary eyed because of the cruel circumstances.\nI think one of the best parts of this series was the trolling. the director really did have some sense of humour, or thought, whichever you'd like to call it. It was fun watching the fandom go insane, even if I was part of that fandom slightly, kinda like Kuroshitsuji II except that doesn't even compare to Madoka, only the trolling. Other than that, I got bored at some bits. Not enough action/thriller for me. Some episodes were great and really got me pumped. Others I probably could have skipped if it wasn't for the importance of the knowledge you gained from them. Madoka was a good anime. Quiet psychological but not enough thriller. It is somewhat overrated. It wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. None the less, it was good and I enjoyed it.\n        "},

I thought it would just turn out to be another, normal magical girl anime with cheerfull, cute characters and all this glittering magic stuff (It`s not that I think these things are bad ;) ). But it turned out that I was completely wrong. I`ve never seen a show like this before. And I think I`ve already seen a lot of animes. The whole story is outstanding and extraordinary. It arrested my attention from the very beginning and although it has just 12 episodes it`s not too short. The size fits\n          \n        the story perfectly and even the ending is good. There are a lot of animes, which you beginn to watch and you know the ending from the beginning on. By this one, it`s nearly impossible to know what will come next. I recommend this anime to everyone. (To the ones who usually don`t like magical girl stuff, too) If you want to see something new, you`ll beginn to watch this one anyway ;).\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n         Deconstruction is the dismantling of certain text to show the apparent contradiction and fallacies upon which the work is founded. One of the most common forms of this is to take a piece of work and show the logical, or most extreme, consequences it would have in a realistic stetting. If there was ever a genre ripe for deconstruction it would be mahou shoujo. Cute little middle school girls fighting a secret war against an invisible enemy with magical powers, bestowed upon them from everything from aliens, to magical artifacts, and even gods. All entirely constructed to appeal to a\n          \n        demographic of 7 to 14 year old girls, with all the sparkles, adorable characters, outfits, and sidekicks you might expect. Fighting for peace, love and happiness against the forces of evil. How young and innocent and boring! But what if we were to say that this war had actual consequences... for example if one of your partners were to trip up and something might happen to her. Who could you tell? Your secret little war would prevent you from sharing, wouldn’t it... And what if your allies weren't even your friends and the war might be more complicated than you first thought. Well that’s a bit depressing isn’t it... yet that is exactly what Shaft is proposing with its newest work Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. \n      Do not be mislead by the apparently cherry and optimistic tone of the art design or even the tone of the first few episodes. This show is about as dark as they come. Yet part of the enjoyment comes from seeing just how dark it gets. The contrast between the first episodes and those that proceed it is the difference between the light and dark side of the moon. This might be jarring for some, yet be fascinating to others. The story, as previously stated, is a deconstruction of the the magical girl genre. It involves viciously tearing apart the genre and replacing the bright optimism and hopefulness with dark angst and cold tragedy. It is told in a way that it starts out with strict adherence to the same plot elements and characters that make up many of the genre. But as the story progresses darker and darker elements are added until you have a product wildly different than its subject matter, and winds up completely destroying some tropes you might take for granted. Despite it being a deconstruction much of the plot revolves heavily on your suspension of disbelief. With key plot points that are expect to be swallowed with little more explanation other than that is how it is. That and MAGIC, of course. This would not be so distracting if it weren't for the fact that the story frequently provides explanations to question that would be left blank in other magic girl shows. \nBe wary of spoilers for this one; as plot twists and revelations are as frequent as they are jarring. Yet despite its apparent darkness there is a heart present amidst the constant death and betrayal. Even with its commitment to deconstruction the shows has depth and meaning behind the darkness. The script is sharply written and tells the story admirably and is largely unblemished; making its occasional resort to clunky exposition and stilted dialog all the more distracting. Yet the emotions are conveyed and the story is told well even with these flaws. \nThe characters themselves are easily the weakest part of the story. With only one, maybe two, developed beyond the simple caricatures they are originally presented as. Here lies the main fault of the story. Despite the fact it viciously tears apart most of the tropes and cliches associated with the genre, it leave the characters largely alone. Where the opportunity could have been used to present more realistic and complex characters in the proceedings and see how they would react to the powers and responsibilities of a magic girl. The show instead chooses to take the same characters of others in the genre with the only major change being the level of tragedy that they are exposed to. Shaft appears to have wanted to explore the psychological effects the story would have on these characters, but this also falls flat. Since the characters are underdeveloped to being with they lack the complexity to show any stages of depression beyond simple grief. Despite the harrowing events that take place the grief rarely compounds on the characters. With previous tragedies seeming to be tossed aside as soon as something else equally heartbreaking occurs. With that said I may be over exemplifying the faults of what is a solid and fascinating tragedy to behold. \nThe Art of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is easily its strongest point. The ‘real world’ is in a more traditional anime style, with cute characters why hyperexaggerated cheekbones, eyes, and hair. With the locals being spacious artistic feats that look to be ripped strait from architectural digest. The animation is crisp and fluid and remains consistent thoughout its run. But where it really shines is in their other worldly designs for the witches’ mazes. Each possessing a radically different art style. These range the gambit from children's drawing, a mix of 2-D and 3-D visuals. Obvious effort has went into the creation of these locals with many details presented that add depth and back story to the locals and the characters behind them. This is a treat that should not be missed, with the beauty on display. \nThe sound design, while not quite as strong as the visuals are superb. The effects work are fantastic and fit the other worldly visuals perfectly. The soundtrack is also excellent. Simultaneously haunting invigorating it fits the show perfectly, with a mix a chorus work and synthesisers and fully orchestrated works. The opening theme however is a generic j-pop tune with odd art that is used mostly as contrast for the proceedings. The rest of remarkable soundtrack far greater than what might be expected.\n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a rare treat to be treasured. Its rare for deconstruction of this magnitude to come along, that not only alters its genre, it transcends it. While the weak characters and spotty script might hold it back from legendary status it wishes to achieve, this is none the less an excellent show for those of the genre and anime in general.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Magical girl anime has always been about ordinary girls with extraordinary responsibilities - and cute transformation sequences with pretty clothes. At the beginning, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica seems like just that. Even with the dark of the scenes before the opening, the joyous looking opening makes the audience think they are about to watch yet another bubbly show with an quirky cast of characters.\nBut that is where the strength in this series lies. This is not like those other \"magical girl\" anime. This show is dark and deep, twisting and turning. The individual characters create such intense emotions that draw the audience in. They develop\n          \n        throughout the course of the 12 episode series and we, the audience, want to watch them. \nThe story is another strong point of this anime. Although I think the story was strongest at the beginning and grew significantly weaker towards the end, the story receives a ten. Not only does it deter from your typical \"magical girl\" shows, but it has the complexities of a labyrinth not revealing all it's secrets at once.  The deceiving looks of the cute cast of characters and their cute magical creature adds yet another layer to the already amazing story of this anime. \nMahou Shoujo Magica Madoka is certainly a worthwhile anime to check out just for it's stories alone. Don't judge an anime by its initial looks. You will be surprised what can be discovered by watching it. \n        "},

There is no real case of 'she is the chosen one' - all girls pretty much bought the situation upon themselves.\nMadoka - the leading female, is a nice girl who is new to the chaotic life a magic girl has to endure.\nThough if you take this concept and think that Madoka (the lead) then goes on to continuously save the day - you're wrong. :P\nCharacter...\nWe often see the intro 'normal highschool student' in order to\n          \n        describe the 'n00b' placed into an odd situation.\nWithin this series, effort has been put in place in order to show use that Madoka is not only 'normal', but 'ideal' - she's a nice girl who has no reason to be unhappy, she has; two loving parents who are actually interested in her life, a cute little brother, a beautiful home, good friends and she attends a pleasant school, there isn's a hint of malice within her.\nMadoka may be the lead, yet she doesn't dominate the plot - we are introduced to a number of girls, all possessing a differing personalites, motives and backstory put forward as the story progresses - there's bound to ba a character for everyone.\nArt...\nThe are has me a tad mixed - the art isn't bad and bad art alone doesn't put me off, however, the characters are the typical 'moe' design (I'm not a massive fan of) we see quite often in anime these days, but not only are the cast purposley 'cute', but they look like cardboard cut-outs.\nAs cheap as the chracter design appears, production seem to have blown the budget on the scenery artwork, which provides us with numerous different trends of stunning artwork that almost doesn't fit, yet is entirely appropriot down to the situation.\nOverall...\nI would say that I personally enjoyed this story and would reccomend this to anyone.\nThough I don't generally seek out magic girl anime's, even I can tell that this is something different, not conforming to what's 'tried, tested and apporved'.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Story: 8\nOne of my favorite things in a fantasy show is a fully-thought-out or self-explanatory universe, one in which simple and uniform laws dictate the \"magical\" aspect of the show, keeping it both clearly fantasy and yet still believable. Madoka Magica does this perfectly, with even the wildest of twists easily explained by Kyuubey. My only complaint is that, because it is such a short series, I wish that Madoka Magica's dark side had come out just a bit sooner so that I would have had more time to enjoy it. \nArt: 9\nI typically like my animation to be the tiniest bit smoother (think Kyoukai\n          \n        no Kanata), but Madoka Magica's supremely unique design makes up for this. I love that the animators were not afraid to do something different and, in the end, the outstanding creativity and beautiful colors makes this one of my favorite art styles. \nSound: 9\nUnfortunately, OSTs rarely stand out to me while I'm so focused on the dialogue of the show. Madoka Magica is definitely an exception though, and I refused to skip both the opening and the ending tracks while also enjoying the mid-episode music. The heavy guitar definitely helps bring a darker tone to the show even while it is still in its much happier first few episodes and I loved every minute of it. \nCharacter: 8\nNearly every character is given a fully fleshed-out background and fittingly-complex personality, all with an aspect to which anyone can relate. There are (relatively) unpredictable transformations and heart-breaking relationships and wonderfully powerful acts of true love, all while even minor characters are not forgotten (ex: Junko, Hitomi). If absolutely nothing else, I wish that Junko had been involved in the storyline a little more considering how mush screen-time we spend getting to know her. \nEnjoyment: 9\nI love nothing more than a show that is not afraid to kill off its characters, and Madoka Magica does not disappoint. With a few small exceptions, there are no \"just kidding, she's still alive\" moments, while each death still feels significant and purposeful, as opposed to done in the name of gore. On top of it all, I am definitely one for a good ol' girl power story.\nOverall: 9\nMadoka Magica completely reinvents the magical girl genre, keeping it fresh and new with its unique art style, complex characters, short and sweet plot, edgy OST and famously mind-blowing twist. It's rich with emotion without feeling over-the-top and comes to a close with a deeply-satisfying ending. A must-watch for anyone.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Puella Magi Madoka☆Magica is not your ordinary magical girl anime; far from it.! This anime throws a out a theme that is usually so easily forgotten in fantasy... magic always comes with a price. Are you willing to pay it?\nThe story starts off with a young Madoka, an average student whose biggest wish is to be noticed by a boy and be successful in life. After having a strange dream, she soon finds that it is slowly turning into reality. After saving a cat-like creature named Kyubey, Madoka and her friend are given the chance to not only have a wish granted, but also to\n          \n        become magical girls and fight witches!\nAs the story progresses, it certainly goes from a friendly, joyful series to a much more serious and tragic one. The characters suffer through a lot, and after watching it, it can leave a sour taste after all the tragedy they go through. It's refreshing to see a show challenge the usual happy and free life of a magic girl. In all honesty, I really enjoyed the show and it's a must-see for anyone who enjoys magical girl themes.\nThe plot is quick enough to keep the action racing and kickstarts straight into the show. At times it's too fast. Some moments and revelations could be paced more, but I digress. Good plot, and I certainly was left waiting to see what would happen next. I was satisfied with the ending and was glad I watched it as a whole. \nThe animation is certainly different. I personally don't love it. However, it's effective in showing the character's emotion and giving off a certain innocence to the characters. The witch fights are even more worth it in my opinion. Each one looks and feels different. Some are more unnerving than others once you realize where the witches come from. \nThe music is okay. The openings and endings are good in giving the general feelings about the show. You believe you're entering a much more friendly and joyful show and it slowly morphs into tragedy and grief. The sound effects are good and fitting. However, in my opinion some of the songs inside the show were repetitive, but it fits well enough. \nI really enjoyed the show and the ending was excellent.\n"},

I also dislike the mahou shoujo genre with a fire. \nI've been hearing about this series for months now but never paid it a second glance whenever someone mentions it. I honestly don't know what caused me to watch it but whatever it was, I am very thankful because this anime is simply one of the most impressive anime I have ever watched. Apart from the art and the genre, it's got all the elements I didn't know I love in\n          \n        my anime. With it's deceptive front, MSMM is one dark and serious anime with an intelligent plot and more complex twists.\nThe characters are very distinguishable. At any other moment, I would've hated Madoka's character but she fits so well with the series that you can't help but to love and sympathize with her. I also love that this gives as much spotlight to the supporting characters as to the main protagonist. The fact that this has only 12 episodes makes it even more impressive. The author did a tremendously good job in shaping the elements of the plot, putting bits and pieces in the right places and fitting them in 12 episodes. This anime will basically flay you slowly while you watch and then rip your heart out. It will also destroy your tear ducts apart in a neverending river of tears. \nThe most tragic thing about this anime though is that there will never be another anime like this one. I feel like going back in time with my memories erased just so I could watch this again and be surprised again like the first time.\n        "},

Hell, It was hard to me to watch some of my favourite anime just for its draw style... But this show tricked me completely.\n I came to give it a chance after a recomendation of some one with great tastes (even knowing he whatches a lot of moe and other crappy romance stuff). At the\n          \n        beggining, it was a shock to see that kind of dark spaces in this kind of anime (after watching some of the promotional posters and trailers).\n But, after episode 3, the show proved to be something completely different from those magical girl and school slice of life animes. And as the show keep getting more darker and darker, I realized that this was a truly masterpiece and I was sad how the producers tricked everyone with those trailers and other promotional stuff.\nDeep characters, deep history, amazing soundtrack, awesome scenarios. Don't let you be tricked by the art style, it's truly worth your time and money.\n"},

It is probably one of my favorite magic animes even if it doesn't look like it from a glance.\nThe story is entertaining and I still don't know any other anime like it. Even though it's only 12 episodes or so, it feels full length and just gets you to keep watching. I think I finished this in a day because it just wraps you up in the story. People judge this anime by its cover way too much(although I don't think this anime is 17+ as\n          \n        it says on the anime page). It makes you think about the world as if there were magical girls that existed and it doesn't exaggerate.\nThe art was kind of bland and only really stood out in the battles. My friends would even say the art was too bad to watch as an excuse to stay away but I don't really judge things based on graphics especially since this anime still got the crazy moods down with other parts of the anime.\nThe sound was great because it really stood out but this time in a good way. It emphasized the moments and the opening/ending songs are just too catchy. The moods went from nice to dark and so on, completely matching with the background music. The only problem is the English dub which you should probably stay away from. Its music creates most of the atmosphere.\nThe characters were pretty interesting too and helped progress through the story. They all had different things to say and I didn't dislike any of them(although I did like some more than others). They did get back stories but I feel like they didn't all get a lot of depth. Maybe if the anime was longer it could've achieved that.\nI enjoyed this a lot except for the ending which kind of threw me off for awhile. Besides that, everything just came together and I enjoyed all of it. With the battles, music, story...it kept me hooked.\nOverall this anime is great and I'm not sure whether it is underrated or overrated but it's still just great in my opinion. I recommend this to anyone who likes dark fantasies and lots of action/drama.\n        "},

Although this kind of mahou shoujo seems to be different and more enticing than the other series like this. The work seems to be really original, other mahou shoujo series are really fancy if you will compare it it but this one really is different and I was really expecting this one! The character designer was Ume Aoki which is also the Character designer from the anime Hidamari Sketch, no doubt their quite similar and original. The anime looks really clean and neat unlike bakemonogatari and\n          \n        sayonara zetsubo sensei which are also SHAFT’s anime that is produced. Although if you really look at the art of the anime you will notice that SHAFT’s art remnants are still there. This is why SHAFT was really great because of their art originality and their splendid difference even though the genre totally fits the category.\nThe Opening song is sang by ClariS which is “Connect”. Every line of the lyrics totally slots with the story. She can make difference even though she will encounter many obstacle, she knows that she can make the future better. This is something that I could understand in the song but there’s more into it I just didn’t really criticized it that much although our singer made another impression to her fans and some people that liked her song in this series."},

I was so so so SO wrong.\nPMMM has incredible art, a heart-wrentching story and beautiful music.  It is an absolute work of art.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into great detail.  However, I will\n          \n        say that this show brought me close to tears.  It is so sad but oh so lovely.

Kyubey one of the most interesting characters offers the contract to Madoka, who\n          \n        is meant to be able to bestow a great amount of power to the 'magical girl' species (if you would call it that). What i love about the story is that it's twisted and quite sinister; it shows that anything must come with a price and really touches down on human ethics in the modern world, that we cannot receive anything for free, without sacrificing/unwillingly giving something in return.\nAlso a review on the characters:  i have to say that either Kyoko Sakura or Miki Sayaka, have to be my favorite characters- firstly their wishes to become magical girls were to help and benefit their loved ones although they never received that love back in return (Sayaka's story line). However i think these characters are all archetypes and display how humans live and the way others react to events, which can break down a human: for example Akemi Homura decided to negate all ideas and became numb to the world and cut off all her emotions due to one person (Madoka) and a complete opposite to her character Mami Tomoe, who perhaps due to her wish being rather self-centered and selfish shows a naive sort of kindness to the other magical girls, however she does become quite defensive in her own right (especially over Bebe in Rebellion). \nOverall i do believe that this is an amazing adaptation to the magical girl themed anime and i would recommend it for people to watch due to the character development and the entire story line. I feel as though this anime shows an embodiment of the human race and how due to our emotions we can become completely destroyed by those we love or due to events that occur to us. \n(If you haven't watched this anime you should.

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an original 12-episode original anime series (How often do you get to say that?!) released back in 2011. The story follows 14-year old Madoka Kaname who is your typical pink haired school girl. One day a creature called an ‘incubator’ or Kyubey encounters Madoka and her friend Sayaka Miki. Kyubey offers the two a chance to become magical girls by creating a contract with the little creature. The contract also includes the girl that becomes a magical girl will have one wish granted to them. The girls bide their time thinking about what to wish for and later that day\n          \n        in school Madoka and her class are introduced to a new transfer student Homura Akemi, Madoka is shocked as she saw her appear in her dreams the previous night. Homura advises Madoka not to make a contract which sparks a dilemma for our young protagonist.\n\nI hate magical girl anime. I always have hated magical girl anime. I’ll be honest that I never watched a series as the whole ‘girls with wands’ fascination irritates me. I probably never would have watched one until I came across ‘ultra maniac’ one day (Just F.Y.I very misleading title) which just made me realize how dreadful a magical girl anime series is.\n\nIt wasn't long after its release that I occasionally heard the mentioning of Madoka Magica so in early 2013 I came across a review of Madoka Magica by one of my favourite reviewers. Before watching the review I looked up this on the internet and found that it was a magical girl anime. Much to my dismay I left this anime in the wilderness until the summer where I came across it in my list and thought “fuck it!! Let’s see what all the talk is about”\n\nWell needless to say I was shocked and surprised by the end of the series. This emphasises the point of “you can’t judge a book by its cover” or in this case “you can’t judge an anime by its magical girl cover”\n\nThe characters in Madoka Magica are the only real flaw in the series. I’m not saying that they’re awful, but some are more mentionable than others. I’ll start off with the main character Madoka. She is the most useless and pitiful character in the show. She hesitates when things get out of control and cries when friends are hurt. I hope I'm not the only one who was thinking “Why does she just stand there and not do a fucking thing?” A few times I did shout at my screen saying “Make a fucking wish already”\n\nMadoka doesn’t really have much character development until the end and for the majority of the show is just an annoyance to everyone who is a magical girl with the exception of Homura.\n\nSo next I’ll get to the best developed character. Homura Akemi, also known as Homura-Dawg!! (Sorry, reference to an abridged series I watched) She first appears in Madoka’s dreams as Madoka watches her fight a watch. She is later transferred into Madoka’s school where she begins her… adventure? Homura has the appearance of a social outcast, as she is reluctant to talk to people and has a very emotionless and serious attitude. At first this can make her unlikeable, I was wondering why she has such a bad attitude and why she is incredibly serious. Later in the series it is revealed to us why she is so serious and reluctant for Madoka and others to become magical girls.\n\nNext up is Sayaka Miki who is Madoka’s tom-boyish best friend. Sayaka has had a crush on her childhood friend Kyōsuke Kamijō since they were at a young age. Unfortunately Kyōsuke had an accident which prolonged an injury to his arm, meaning he cannot play the violin any more. Prompting Sayaka to make a decision and wish for him to be healed. Sayaka seems like a nice girl who stands for the right things. Though as the series progresses she is pushed to breaking point and she later turns on her friend Madoka, feeling alone as Madoka stands around failing to help her Sayaka slowly falls into depression. \n\nFinally we have Kyoko Sakura who is a fiery magical girl; she is very arrogant and often intimidating to others like Madoka and Sayaka. She is also often seen eating excessive amounts of food. Along with Homura she is one of the more developed characters, as we get a back story and insight into her behavioural pattern. Kyoko is a good example of portraying the consequences of what you wish for; personally she is my favourite character in the series.\n\nOther characters in the series are not worth mentioning for.\n\nWhen talking about sound the first thing I need to mention is the opening. The opening sequence for Madoka Magica is probably the most misleading that you will ever see in anime. Next is the crazy animation that occurs when witches appear. It looks very freakishly creepy you’ll get a good idea when you get to episode the second and third episode. The character designs aren't that bad, though given Madoka’s design certainly didn't persuade me to watch the series either.\n\nSo, for a guy who hates magical girl anime I have to say… I like Madoka Magica. It is a very good deconstruction of the stereotypical archetype that is the magical girl genre. This anime isn’t revolutionary by all means but it does deserve its reputable profile. This anime can't ever be one of the greats, but it will forever be the anime that exceeded far beyond my expectations of a magical anime. I give Puella Magi Madoka Magica A high 8/10 and a definite recommendation to all those looking for something different and very well executed. \n"},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a poorly developed \"deep\" Magical Girls anime. Madoka Magica is also pretentious, overrated, and boring. This review is going to be unstructured and i'm just going to say whatever is off my mind.\nMadoka Magica is revolves around Madoka and magical girls. These magical girls are granted a single wish in exchange to be sent fighting against witches and stuff. \nMadoka herself is a horrible and disinteresting protagonist. She's an indecisive eighth grade schoolgirl which I apparently heard it took her 12 episodes for her to figure out if she actually wants to be a magical girl or whatever. Eh, I\n          \n        dropped this bullshit at episode 10 anyways. There are tons of themes and messages that are just thrown in there and not developed at all, such as the one in episode 8 in which you can go see for yourself. There's also this one girl that is attached to some disabled boy and we have no reason whatsoever on why she is so attached to him, it's as if the creator of this godawful show just said \"ey, throw in some emotional scene with that disabled kid and his violin and make sure that one chick likes him or something.\"\nKyubey is the meaning of \"oh this thing is cute OH FUCK WHAT THE HELL THIS IS DARK AND SCARY!\"\nThat is basically why this anime is rated so high, because of the fact that it successfully made something that is childish and targeted for pre-teen girls into an anime that is accessible to older people with the fact that they are trying to make this dark and full of meaning. However it's not even near close to well thought it compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion. To this day there are still many theories as to why so many things happened to Neon Genesis Evangelion, and other such things. NGE gets the viewers thinking, the ending of the original anime and the EoE movie has clearly distribituted to the viewer a masterpiece of philosophical and deep content, something that Madoka Magica fails to do. \nThe only ratings I can give to this anime is to Art and Sound, however, this score will not be an average and Madoka well merits a 1/10.\n\n"},

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="                          \n    No spoilers, but it's not a glowing review by any exaggeration of the imagination (if you are looking for affirmation about how great this anime is, this is probably not the lackluster thing you'd want to read.):\nI was talking about this anime with some guy friends and we came to a satisfying conclusion that this anime really felt like a show aimed at guys using the cliched (and successful) girly genre of magical girls.  After that, a lot of things made a lot more sense.\nLet me start this off by saying that it definitely attempted to turn this genre on its head...  But\n          \n        let's be frank: I was not attached to any of the characters and while I liked a lot of the concepts, even the character concepts, the inability for me to relate to or feel a connection with the characters made this drama not that enjoyable.  I had to force myself to sit through some of it (and I was not prepared for that concerning such a short and acclaimed series) and while the last few episodes were much more engaging, it's balance was tipped too much in the direction of the cerebral and not enough in the direction of the emotional (at least, not for me).  Looking back, I can't say I ever lost myself in the story.  I'm not saying the characters were not likable or that the story was bad, nor even that you -- dear reader -- will not lose yourself in it.  But, for me, I just could not cross the intellectual line from: \"huh, that makes sense...\" to: \"wow, that hit right to the heart!\" (which was what I was hoping for and expecting from all the rave reviews).  I just could not relate to any of the crucial main characters (or even the secondary characters), no matter how much sense it made to relate to them, their situation or the idea of them.\nI didn't feel pain at any tragedies (great or small).  Not even a pang. (Call me heartless in this case if you want, but let me just say that this is extremely rare for me.)\nMy inability to empathize in this anime greatly decreased my ability to enjoy this story.  What bewilders me is the fact that the ideas behind them should have made it easy for me to relate to and empathize with said characters.  But the way this was done pretty much made me have very little sympathy for anyone and it wasn't even that I hated particular character(s), I just did not/could not care.  To that I can only say that for me this is most likely caused by the execution.  The pace that was chosen just didn't jive with or work for me.\nSince it's so popular, I'm guessing you'll just have to make your own decision on this.  The art was interesting but failed to help me connect and I never really thought \"Wow!  That really fit this anime!\".  As a drama, for me, where it really failed was it failed to make me care -- and that pretty much is the reason I watch dramas.  This is why I have concluded that it's just \"Fine/Fair\".  And frankly, after discussing this with some friends, I've come to realized I'm probably not the target audience which might explain why it's just not my cup of joe.\n        "},

Having not really been a avid Mahou Shoujo series fanatic, I was still very interested to see what it would be like.\nFor those of you who plan to watch(if not already) this series can be categorized as an anime that is full of twists and a well developed plot. The flow of the series is very smooth and at a certain point, will have you finding it hard to stop yourself from watching the next episode. Being completely opposite from an episodic series, this anime builds upon each\n          \n        episode with more and more of the secrets of this magical world being revealed, and as a results keeps you in suspense, itching with antisipation for more and ultimately the next episode. \nOverall this anime could easily rival the popularity of many other great hits such as Code Geass, but i guess the overall enjoyment of this anime could easily be influenced by the expectations everyone has for this anime(including myself).\nThis series is best watched with your mind clear of any expectations and left to be discovered by yourself 1 episode at a time.\nAs for how I feel about this series, I felt it was very well done and that Shaft's take on a mahou shoujo is very exciting and full of surprises that would keep you watching back-to-back especially when the episodes are now readily available from start to finish. Although I was reluctant at first, every single minute spent on this series was very well worth the time and is very deserving of your attention.\n\n"},

That being said, I always try to write my reviews as un-biased as possible, even If I hated the anime or genera. This is not my opinion, this is a review of what the anime is truly worth.     \n     When I first herd of, \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica\", I thought I looked like a mediocre, fan boy generic anime, that would be excruciating, and humiliating to watch. And in fact, for the first 4 episodes it is.\n\n            With that being said, this is the one time I actually listened to my friend when he said, \"it gets better\". Normal when my friends say this about anime, they're normally wrong, which is mostly due to the fact that I don't have the patiences  to sit through 50 episodes of filler, then a fight that lasts for about 20 more episodes. But this anime is a rare exception. Trust me when I say this, it really does get better. \n     For the first four episodes, the characters talked to each like they were reading a cliché Teleprompter slightly off screen. But after the first four episodes it's as almost like the writer was fired, and a new one was brought in actually making two people talking to each other sound like two average people having a conversation. I normally hate most dialogue unless it's really good, which is why I give some anime' a 6 or 7, but with Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica, this is not the case.  In fact, some of the dialogue was so well written it felt as though I was in the story, and could jump in at any time and say my input on the situation, which is saying something. \n     The plot Itself could use some touch ups, but overall it's great, just not well executed. I found myself at times trying to figure out why this line of dialogue is relevent to the story, and why I should care. And belive me when I tell you that at one point, one charater actually asked another character what kind of shampoo she uses. But that was in the shitty first four episodes, not in the later ones when it felt like they got a new writter, or the current one stopped smoking so much dope and could string a sustenance together. In the later episodes the plot becomes so interesting, I could hardly pry my life away form the computer screen, and lost a weekend over it. (sort of a spoiler but not really alert)  The ending was not predictable, and I can honestest say I was surprised by the way things played out. But, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's good. In fact, seeing someone beet a small child in the middle of the street is surprising to see, but that doesn't mean you should applaud them of doing so. After you get explained about why everything is happening, the plot is quite linear from there on. \n     Overall, this anime has one thing going for it that most don't, it's enjoyable to watch. I recommend this anime to anyone who wants to see a truly fun to watch, enjoyable and at times, intense anime.  \n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n                          \n    WOW!! What a ride I have been. This anime has redefined anime for what supposed to be a proving ground to creators to make an impact in today's world and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica does it all. No wonder every people being hyped with the series from the start. I mean seriously, this anime make me feel that every single despair and sorrow that every people in this world experienced cannot dissapear but we must believe in ourselves that we can change these despairs into hope for the better. That is what we learned from this anime and this anime proves to inch out every\n          \n        single detail about the message for not only youths but for the entire world to believe in yourself and fight no matter how wretched incidents happened.\nSTORY: 10/10\nLet's start by saying that the storyline is WAY more than meets the eye. The story starts with the usual, a girl (Madoka) finds a cute, fluffy creature (Kyuubey), hurt by an apparent mysterious villian (Homura) and then Kyuubey wants her to accept a contract in becoming a Magical Girl. Pretty simple for a magical girl anime. However, by episode 3, the dark ambience of the storyline really kicks in and the outcome, an emotional and mind blowing developments. This is more like I'm watching a movie directed by a world class director that I think even exceeds Christopher Nolan's standards. The gruesome and life-threating situation every single Mahou Shoujo have encountered just making the story so unique and full of plot boosting that I was not expected from an anime. The ending also really captivated me on how the remaining main characters have potrayed in what I considered as the \"Change the World\" phase. Overall, the story really exceeds my expectations and coexist with the dark deep plot that they executed. Well done, SHAFT!! Well done!!\nANIMATION: 9/10\nThe art for this series really amazed me on how they draw the entire atmosphere into one hell of a bizarre universe that some people said that this is not their cup of coffee. The facial expression of each of the character is really wierd and different than normal animes. However, the fight scenes is done with the perfection. I can see every angle of the action as if this is like the real thing. The two last episodes also have mindblowing art that I think shines and makes it even more exhillarating to watch the finale. The art styles, however, does seem a bit too scary and maybe haunt me to nightmares but this is a slight minor scare that I can see.\nSOUND: 9/10 \nThe soundtrack in this anime is my another great praise to this series because Kaijura Yuki does every single theme matched the conversation or certain events that accompany, just like bread and butter. Most of the soundtracks have certain emotions inside the story, like despair, hope, jealousy, worries and more that I really enjoyed. Plus, the opening theme (Connect by ClariS) in my opinion, match what Madoka expressions are in her road in becoming a Magical Girl. The ending (Magia by Kalafina) also redefines the characeters of Homura with sadness and wiltedness of her feeling in true meaning.\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nNot only the storyline is awesome, but the characters are well developed to its fullest. We have Madoka, who at first glance, she's just a crybaby desperate in holding on to her life in the midst of their friends' death. However, she growned up every single episode and thus, becoming a girl with hope and meaning to make every single people in the world end their suffering and start on a new chapter in this world. There is also Homura, will-hearted, brave in facing challenges, and never gives up on fighting to protect the ones that she loved the most, Madoka. Then, there's Mami, who is shy, polite and caring, Sayaka, naive and in desperation trying to impress her love ones who he is a violin meister, and of course, not to mention, the devil in teddy bear's shirt (my description), Kyuubey, cute but evil,enough said. Every single character have their own perspective in elaborating their own stories that are perfectly done. This series also implicates what every character's emotions deepens from start to finish thanks to a great interaction. Even I'm also impressed about the Kyuubey's World Balance theory and explained information really precise about the life of an incubator.\nOVERALL: 9/10\nAll in all, I got to say, this had been a wild and treacherous ride from start to finish. Madoka Magica have defined Magical Girls anime in a whole new level and way exceeds the quality of the Magical Girl animes from the 60's. This anime also redefined the way how an anime could elaborate on a real world situation that is rare for anime nowadays. Excellent storyine, great art design, weird and dark atmosphere, great soundtrack, superb characterisation and amazing plot development made this series a true classic. I mean, what animes could match this masterpiece that came from nowhere and we have never saw a true classic during the 2000's era. This absolutely blows ALL the fanservice, moe animes that have become a trend. It's a piece of magical powers, sci-fi, social issues and dark plot that made this a must watch for all otakus. By far, in my standards, this had to be THE BEST ANIME OF 2011, better yet THE BEST ANIME OF THE 2000's or maybe become AN ALL TIME CLASSIC. Seriously, even Deadman Wonderland or Hyouge Mono or other anime could NOT match this superior masterpiece. Thank you, Urobuchi Gen! Thank you, Kaijura Yuki! Thank you, Magica Quartet! And most of all, THANK YOU SHAFT!! You're all AWESOME!!\n"},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=4,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    I'm sure everyone has seen Madoka Magica by now, but if you haven't, why haven't you seen Madoka Magica?\nI can't not write about it because the one thing I might possibly love more than magical girl shows are deconstructions of the genre. Bonus points if that deconstruction is dark and thought provoking. Madoka is.\nIt picks up on the darker moments of any good magical girl show and is probably most heavily influenced by Sailor Moon. In Sailor Moon, we see the girls die. We see Usagi break down and ask why she has to fight. There are times she wants to give up. Her final\n          \n        wish at the end of Season 1 is for her and her friends to return to being normal girls, and, in Season 2 when she gets her memories back of being a Sailor Senshi, her one request is that her friends don't have to remember and carry that burden again too.\nHowever, the darkness in Sailor Moon is quickly drowned out in pink and love and friendship. Madoka Magica lives in the dark and even picks up on elements the creators of Sailor Moon never immagined even WERE dark. Notably, the housing of the girls' souls. The Sailor Senshi are Senshi because their souls are Star Seeds. They are something separate from their bodies (though inside them) and allow them to be reborn over and over when they die.\nMadoka Magica recasts these as Soul Gems, things outside the body, but they essentially do the same thing, keep the girls from easily dying. The horror is explored here though, if your soul isn't natural any more, if your body is just a prop, what does that make you? A zombie? A monster?\nI was skeptical about the art at first (I really, really don't dig moe), but it suits the story in the worst way possible, which makes it the best choice, and as the story gets darker and darker the style makes everything more effecting. Plus, we never get to forget just how young these girls are. \nI'm not going to go into how amazing the story telling is or how beautiful the animation is, and all you need to know about the music is that Yuki Kaijira composed it and she is genius. \nI'm going to talk about how Mahou Puella Madoka Magica is IMPORTANT. I accidentally stumbled across it, and marathoned all twelve episodes. Then I made my best friend watch it. It's an update on a classic story. What compels me to feel as strongly about it as I do?\nObviously, my love for it stems from my bottomless love for Sailor Moon (something I've loved since I was 6), but I embraced Madoka just as whole heartedly. What is it about magical girls that stick with us?\nIt clicked, today, and I think I’m stating the obvious here, when I say I didn’t get a whole hell of a lot of Female Coming of Age narratives in school, in the media, or otherwise. The word bildungsroman is practically synonymous with “story about a young boy who grows up”. It’s not that I can’t relate to those narratives - I can - it’s just that they’re not about me. \nThe Magical Girl genre is essentially a genre which explores the female Heroine’s arc, the female coming of age story, and the womanhood narrative with varying degrees of success or failure — but it gets explored.\nNow look at Puella Magi. At only twelve episodes it packs a hard punch, and it’s so easy to claim that Kyubey represents the devil, with a contract waiting to be made to essentially use your soul to fight witches. This claim that the narrative is Faustian isn’t wholly wrong, but I’d argue it’s not all there is either. \nKyubey isn’t the devil. Kyubey is the society we live in, which takes up and preys on young girls at vulnerable times in their lives, and asks them to be perfect. Society asks girls to fight against evil, the icky, awful, and impure, and it keeps asking until we say yes. Yes to being beautiful, and perfect, and good, and pure, and sweet, yes to being a nice young lady, yes to fighting everything that is bad and evil and dangerous - to fighting the things that threaten us and our friends. \nExcept there’s a catch. We’re fighting ourselves. What they don’t tell you, society, or Kyubey in this metaphor, is that there is no way to prevent yourself from becoming what you started out fighting. You lose, in this scenario, every time. At some point, a young, “emotionally volatile” girl grows up and becomes a woman. One day, you hit puberty, or maybe you haven’t yet, and someone leers at you, or looks at you wrong, or calls after you and you are suddenly made aware of the fact that being a woman is dangerous. Growing up means something incredibly different for girls than it does boys. \nAnd this is something Kyubey himself says, and the implications of it are astounding. Girls become women. Magical girls become witches. There’s no stopping it, the process happens whether you want it to or not. You grow up, sure, but there’s a reason for it. Sayaka Miki fights relentlessly against the evils she sees in the world, but she becomes obsessed with her imperfections and failures, she berates herself for falling short of her own standards, and for standards thrust upon her, and she literally can not win. The standards are always changing, they can’t be met, they’re meant to keep you fighting, but only in a certain way, only the way society wants you to. Sayaka loses her cool, she overhears some men say awful, horribly misogynistic and sexist things about their ‘girlfriends’ on a train, and she loses it. Sayaka reacts to the endless stream of hatred and misogyny set up in a patriarchal society that has been asking her to fight against women who failed to met society’s expectations and while we don’t see the results of her losing her cool on the train directly, we can all imagine that she could have beaten these men up, or she could have killed them. In the end, the result doesn’t matter. The losing her temper does.\nYou become a witch or a bitch the day you fight back. And even if you don’t fight back, you’re going to become a witch or a bitch eventually. That’s the unfortunate truth of growing up female — sooner or later, society will betray you. And while you might not become Walpurgisnacht, it can be as simple as a hiss in your ear, or a seething message in your inbox. You’re an emotionally out of control girl, you’re evil, you’re bad, you’re a slut, a whore, or a bitch, or hysterical, or over reacting. You become a woman in a society that hates women. And if and when you react, you get tossed straight into the bin of evil terrible things. \nPuella Magi is a story about young teenager girls who, while exploring who they are as people, their sexualities, their lives, their desires, hopes, wants, wishes, and dreams — find out that society is going to see them as shitty monstrous plagues upon the world sooner or later. And you can try to stop it, or take it back, or hold out hope, or you can lose your unholy shit and hit back. You can say the idea of witches is complete and utter bullshit, and women and girls don’t deserve that fate. You can fight against it, you can be Madoka Kaname, or Usagi Tsukino and you can fight against people who prey on other girls and women for having anything special or bright about them and try to make it something terrible or wrong. \nMagical Girl stories are stories about growing up and becoming a woman, and protecting other women, saving other women, following desires and dreams and wishes and then kicking the bad guys in the face with your high heeled boots. The weapon is womanhood and girlhood and your sexuality because that’s the weapon society gave you and told you you were going to hurt yourself with it. Except the thing is, you don’t have to hurt yourself. You can protect yourself, and your friends, and your ideas, and feelings, and some days, yes, you fall down on your knees and sob messily because you can’t defeat every bad guy on your own, or ever, or alone - but goddamnit you have the ability to take power in your agency and who you are. Society doesn’t OFTEN tell girls that. We don’t often get the message that who we are is okay, acceptable, powerful, or amazing, much less that it’s also okay if we don’t succeed every single time. We know the fight is a part of our lives, but survival is the minimum. Getting stories about winning beyond that is amazing. \nThis is why I cringe when people complain loudly that there aren’t “Magical Boy” series for them to watch. To start with, there are already several series that involve young boys transforming with magical powers and skirts/wands/sparkles/etc. There’s also an abundance of already available fantasy male heroes who start off on Hero’s journeys that describe the process of growing up and becoming a “man” in society. Magical Girls are a genre that rely on a female narrative, on becoming a woman, on relative experiences of love and sex and dreams and wishes that are influenced by the treatment of women in society. \nThat doesn’t mean men can enjoy these stories, or relate to them, or that people who don’t fall in the binary gender spectrum can’t relate to them (on the contrary, there’s a lot of reliability in not “fitting” gender roles or expectations in the series I’ve just mentioned), it just means that this genre is built on something very specific to a narrative that is not male dominated, that isn’t a male narrative. I'm not claiming there is no Male Gaze, or that men have no place in a magical girl story, just that it's not THEIR story. There’s a reason  PMMM features one male love interest who ends up with someone else. \nMagical Girls are important to real girls because they tell us stories about ourselves and our powers, and we need them, because girls need to see themselves as heroes and saviors too.\nThat's why Madoka can't end the cycle of magical girls. There will always be battles to fight, but Madoka--the every girl--ended having to become a witch.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    How do you write a review for a masterpiece and pretend like you haven't just got off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride? Let me attempt this, good sirs and madams!\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica (Say that 5 times really fast) is a masterpiece produced by SHAFT (Those crazy people behind the Monogatari series) and Aniplex (Persona 4: The Animation, Rurouni Kenshin, and Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood) that revolves around a girl named Madoka whom, after a dream, is given the opportunity to become a magical girl through a mysterious being known as \"Kyubey\". There is a catch, however; they must make a wish, and whatever that wish is, it\n          \n        will inevitably cause despair. The girls must battle beings called \"Witches\" and gain powers and the means to do so. However, there is more to this than what the mysterious \"Kyubey\" lets on...\nThe art and animation are amazing. The labyrinths where the Witches reside are a combination of acid trip-inducing \"wtf\" and abstract art combined in an art & animation department's Hell. The fights are beautifully-presented and even the out-of-battle regular stuff is pretty incredible. The girls have their own designs, nothing feels under-designed and really, the show looks great. The only weakness are the thick lines that appear in some scenes (most prominent around the lower half of the girls' heads) that make it look like a manga being animated. Honestly, I thought it added to the charm of the series. \nThe music is pretty enjoyable and blends well with whatever scene is going on. The opening (\"Connect\" by ClariS) is energetic and fills the viewer with hype for the episode, even if the entire series is depressing as a whole. Tracks such as \"Decretum\" (by Yuki Kajiura) and \"Surgem Identidem\" are beautiful scores that keep delivering where the scenes seem to fall short (I mean, a story this well-crafted can't have any real flaws to it, so the music puts it over the 100% maximum). Honestly, the anime and the movie Rebellion have some pretty incredible music on them. \nNow, for the characters. What can I say? Each character is well-written and there aren't any real parts that stuck out to me. Kyubey is secretive and while not deceptive, doesn't tell the whole truth. Madoka is innocent, joyful, and perhaps the most kind-hearted while Mami is strong-willed and tries to encourage the other girls to make their wishes wisely. Homura comes off as a bit of a bitch at first, but you warm up to her when the tragedy of her character is revealed, if not earlier when she becomes a bit more agreeable. Sayaka is kind-hearted like Madoka, but also a bit selfish and tragic in her own way, though not without reason. Finally, Kyouko is probably the least-developed and even then, her brash, almost fiendish behavior hides its own tragedy. The cruel persona she puts forward only makes her more sympathetic. \nHonestly, it's a great series that CAN be depressing, but makes up for it with having a story and characters that are endearing, while the music, animation, and art style are absolutely amazing. For such a short series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica finds a way to say \"Hey, a story can be short AND incredible\". If ever you're bored and haven't seen it, I highly recommend giving it a watch. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    If you were like me in 2011-13 and were in the right place and knew the right people, you probably already know a lot about this anime with certain parts being already spoiled for you. You've probably even been exposed to it in some way without realizing even if you weren't around for it's initial popularity. The reason I have this really weird opening is sort of a warning before reading the rest. I'm writing this as someone who has seen some major parts before actually watching it. I am not going to pretend that I watched it not knowing anything more then a brief\n          \n        summary. I hope this review can help anyone thinking about it who have never been involved but I really hope it can help people who were in the same boat as me who are thinking of watching it. Sorry for the weird opening, on to the actual review.\nAs mentioned before, I knew a lot about this show before even pressing play. Most of it was scenes of major events with little context outside of the fact that they came form this show and the major theme of \"sad lesbians\" that those who introduced me to it talked about. Knowing the majority of what happens and knowing it was going to be sad, I thought I wouldn't enjoy the story. Turns out I did really like it. It had the stuff I knew, and it pulled out some twists at the end that I actually didn't expect (that's why the last three episodes are my favorite). There isn't a single filler episode, and I can see where they tried to trick the viewers into thinking it was another magical girl show. There were likable characters, and there were non-likable ones. They are all usual tropes of females in anime but all end up changing to something different then their tropes, which I really liked. It actually resulted in a character whose trope I usually like being one of my least favorite characters, and in a show with only about 7 to 8 characters that really matter that is saying something. \nI found the art to be really interesting, because while the \"anime\" parts weren't the best (if you pause randomly through the first episode you get a lot of funny screen shots), the witches were amazing. Their designs were different, their looks unique, each being different from the last. They were so detailed down to the movements, it was obvious how much care was put into them and it made them all really special to me. There wasn't to much variety in the music, but what was really great for me was the opening and ending songs. The opening song was upbeat and interesting, and never changed even after you realize the show is more then meets the eye. The ending song was my favorite though, because not only was it intense when played at different points of the anime, the ending animations for it were creepy to me that now the sound of it outside of the anime is enough to unnerve me.\nOverall I think it was a good anime. It had it's good parts and it's bad, and where certain parts lacked others were strong. If you were like me, I'd say watch at least the first couple of episode to see if you are interested in seeing the rest (for me the biggest spoilers came within the first 4 episodes). Like I said, overall it was good, not really something I'd watch over and over again, but I'd say watch it at least once to see what everyone was into.\n        "},

It starts off like any other magical girl show, but I noticed something off from the start. It only had 12 episodes, and after the first two, the main girl hadn't even become a magical girl yet. Then things got dark and emotional, and everything TOTALLY changed. We got to see a realistic outlook on the whole thing, and how getting a wish granted has its consequences. This was a really deep, emotional story, and I truly enjoyed it.\nArt: 10. THE WITCHES BARRIERS. enough said.  You have these characters that look all moe and\n          \n        kawaii like any other magical girl show, and then you contrast them with the surrealistic witches barriers, it provides a nice contrast. My mind was blown when I saw them. The colors all flow off each other nicely and it really adds to the atmosphere of it all.\nSound: 10. Who needs drugs when you have Connect, the opening theme, to release a bunch of dopamine? I can't help but get fully absorbed whenever I hear it, and it's a contender for my number one anime opening. The main ending theme, Magia, is also amazing, but not as much as Connect. The background / side songs were also good, and this is one of the few anime where I regularly listen to music from it that isn't the OP / ED.\nCharacter: 9. Mastering characters is something really hard to do, especially in anime. But Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica does this pretty well. The characters are all different, and good in their own ways. While Madoka wasn't my favorite main, it was probably because she was outclassed by all the others amazingness. Sayaka was my personal favorite, she showed us the struggle of being a magical girl more than anyone else did. If anything, I'd say this is her story more than it is Madoka's.  She was the character you felt for the most. Kyouko is another good character. She starts off antagonistic, but you learn her tragic story and see her perspective soon.... (not to mention i kinda have an anime crush on Kyouko....) But who cares because Kyouko x Sayaka is best ship!! I'm always a sucker for red hair x blue hair.....I'M GETTING OFF TOPIC!!! Homura was interesting, you could empathize with her too, but not as much as Sayaka. Kyubey..KYUBEY. I liked Kyubey. He isn't evil, he just doesn't know the value of emotions. I feel sorry for him. The only character I didn't like was Kyousuke, the violin guy. HISSSSSS....\nEnjoyment: 10. Good scores for everything else means a high enjoyment score. My attention was always caught, and I never felt bored. In fact, I was constantly interested. I laughed with them, I cried with them. I JAMMED OUT TO THE OPENING EVERY TIME!!! And I fangirled for KyoSaya a lot. I was left confused quite a bit though, so I watched the whole thing again a few weeks later. It's best to watch it twice. I'd reccommend this to anyone, but it's better if you have experience with other magical girl series like Tokyo Mew Mew. If you don't, it's okay. It won't ruin much. GO WATCH THIS ALREADY!!\nOverall: 10. Favorite anime. Outclasses others in many ways. Some people say that this gets too much credit and is overrated, and they might be right. But I'll always be here, overrating it anyways.\n        "},

It is not your happy go along series where the girls go around doing some magic stuff and all that. This series is dark and grim. Quite dark in fact, that  saying more would ban my review on account of spoilers. This is one series where they have mislead the audience from the cover poster.

The plot is sound and the characters are well made, but not worth the attention. If you want to explore into the realm of magical anime while also wanting to explore something  different, this may be for you. Otherwise, don't watch it. Watch it when you are prepared for something dark. I belonged to the latter category and while I can bear to watch dark anime, this wasn't up to my expectations.\nIf you are watching the series, watch it with a neutral mind.  Don't expect much.

Even with every mystical element involved (from witches to time-travel) you could, in a sense, interpret this show as a way for adolescent girls to experience the difficult choices, stress - and eventually the insanity - forced onto younger men as they go through the military.  What eventually happens to the Puella Magi if they aren't killed by the witches they fight is a grim destiny that mirrors the reality that real soldiers go\n          \n        through: their grief sets in after they see what happens in and after fighting, and their souls gradually reach the point of despair.\nEvery main Puella Magi in this show represents a common trait that can be found in any young soldier.  Madoka is innocence, Homura is naiveté, Sayaka is impudence, Kyouko is scorn, and Mami is overconfidence.\nMami starts out as the show's veteran, thinking she knows what lies ahead and takes Madoka and Sayaka under her wing.  When she formed a contract with Kyuubey, she wasn't fully aware her inevitable destiny.  Of course, no Puella Magi does.  Nevertheless, overconfidence is most evident in her as she was clearly unprepared for the truth behind the contract.  What she ends up doing is also proof of the insanity that any human being is vulnerable to.\nKyouko is the one with the dark past.  She's left with disdain towards everyone, all because of the wish that she asked for when making the contract.  She used her wish to help someone (rather than use it for her own benefit) and it left her with tragic and ironic results.  As such, everytime Kyouko sees a new Puella Magi who wanted to help someone they love, it leaves her with bitter memories.\nThis leads us towards Sayaka, who also used her wish on someone she loved.  Because of their similar desires to help others, both Sayaka and Kyouko form a rivalry - one that was instigated by Kyouko to prove once and for all that you shouldn't be so selfless when given the opportunity to help yourself.  Sayaka refuses to listen, and with her headstrong attitude, she ignores all potential dangers and continues to fight witches - but not without showing us how monstrous we can become if we lose ourselves in battle.\nHomura is a bit more difficult to explain without giving away any spoilers.  We first see her as a lonely, melancholic girl who tries to warn Madoka of becoming a magical girl.  But the truth goes further than that; it's actually because of her that Madoka is destined to become the most powerful Puella Magi, and eventually something far worse.  Homura cares for Madoka so deeply and does not want her to come to harm.  But it's those feelings that eventually lead her to an endless cycle - literally.  Homura gradually realizes that her feelings alone cannot save Madoka, so she becomes more of the \"ice-in-her-veins\" character we see in the beginning.  Like every young and naive character, things don't always go the way Homura wants them to - even if she has manipulating powers.\nFinally, there's Madoka.  Although innocence is usually depicted as weak, frail, and dependent on others, it has its own rewards.  Madoka watches as the four girls around her are or become Puella Magi, while she alone refrains from making the contract with Kyuubey.  She manages to discover the truth from him, and it's not until then that she understands what she must do when the Walpurgis Night arrives.  It's a big step of maturity for her as we also see her stand up to her mother when there's still a bit of parent-to-child mistrust between them.\nKyuubey is - more or less - the devil.  Every girl he meets ends up selling her soul to him, and becomes his own pawn.  But whether she lives or dies by the series' end, every Puella Magi winds up with her own destiny, in noncompliance with Kyuubey's contract.\nI really enjoyed this anime, and while it's out of the ordinary for the mahou shoujo genre, it will hopefully lay groundwork for a whole new genre.\n        "},

So watching the first ten seconds of Madoka Magica, brought me in to a realm that I had not been prepared for. Wow is an understatement. This story is so undeniably original and it pulls you into it's craziness immediately. I'll admit that I went into this assuming that it was going to be a very cutesy girl show, and wow was I wrong. Do not be fooled by the extremely vague description and misleading covert art for the show. This is a dark story. But unlike a lot\n          \n        of shows that I have been watching lately, it truly had an ending. You could not possibly have a better ending to this show, especially in such a short amount of time being that it's only 12 episodes. The only reason I didn't give this show a 10 was because there was still a little something missing for me. But I am hard to please, so the fact that it's getting a 9 is pretty incredible. In short, I absolutely recommend this story. For anyone too. No matter what you are in the mood to watch, no matter what type of story you typically enjoy, you must watch this. \n        "},

I don't usually watch magical girl series, because, quite frankly, they seem a bit too young for me.  However, this is one that I can honestly say is one of my favorite anime ever, despite how childish it looks at first glance.\nStory: 10/10\nMadoka does a great job in keeping its viewers guessing, without driving them away by being too confused.  It has its flaws, as any does, and some people may not like how it is kind\n          \n        of a mystery until the very end.  However, the story itself is brilliant, and truly unique despite its wide genre.\nArt: 10/10\nAgain, Madoka stands out from the crowd when it comes to art.  The characters are well designed, and look like the 14-15 year-old girls that they are rather than looking a few years too young or too old like most shows tend to do in today's world.  The backgrounds and other art aspects help to bring a more mature factor to Madoka - the witches themselves are truly something straight out of a nightmare.\nSound: 10/10\nI really liked the music they used in this show.  There wasn't much background music in the episodes themselves, but the soundtracks they did use fit the situation well, and added to the suspense or emotion of the episode(s).\nCharacter: 10/10\nIn terms of character development, Madoka's character crew could be easily compared to the cast of Higurashi.  The characters are not cookie-cutter adolescent girls, though they seem to be at first glance.  They don't just walk around, waving their wands and fight evil without ever thinking twice.  Each of them actually has a unique personality, and even flaws that cause them to fall deeper into despair.  It is refreshing to see characters that can actually be related to, especially in a magical girl genre, as well as those very same characters being able to show emotion and shed tears without making them seem too weak to stand alone as a main character.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nTo be honest, I wasn't sure how I felt about the show at first.  I was kind of thinking to myself, \"Oh, great.  Another Sailor Moon-esque show that I'm not going to want to ever watch again..\"  \nBut I was totally, and completely wrong.  \nUnlike Sailor Moon, Tokyo Mew Mew and other shows like it, Madoka wastes no time in irrelevant transformation cut scenes.  In fact, in all 12 episodes, I believe there was perhaps a max of 5 throughout the series.  \nThe time they didn't use on useless cut scenes like that was used in a great way to develop the plot and characters.  By the end of the series, I was in tears.  This anime is beautiful, and deeply moving.  There is a lot of symbolism within it that you may not catch until later in series or even until a second watch through it, but it is worth your time to watch.  \nOverall: 10/10\n        "},

This is my first review, so sorry if I reiterate something or if I talk in circles.\nThe whole show has such great atmosphere. My only negatives with the entire show were the character designs for the girls, which were pretty good other than the faces. I just think they were a little too square-ish. I loved the music. The music is one of the things that actually makes the series so great for me. I actually listen to the soundtrack independently from the show all the time. \n\nPast that, without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending is very satisfying and\n          \n        my only other major downside is that they didn't really show much about Sayaka, just her boy's (forgot his name).

This by no means is some stereotypical Mahou Shoujo anime if anything it is almost the opposite.  \nStory-10\nIt's been\n          \n        a long time since I've watched something that has left me a strong impression and it reminds me of why I watched anime in the first place. Mahou SHoujo Madoka Magica is INSANELY good and basically feeds off of the audiences misunderstanding of what the anime was supposed to be. There are a few minor plot holes but nothing really major. That's all I can really say now without giving any spoilers.. I really don't even want to give the Synopsis because even that is misleading.\nStory Comparison: Steins Gate\nArt-10\nThe art is beautiful and the character designs are decently original. The art style is unique compared to other anime. Also as usual in anime the background and scenery are beautiful and match the situations almost to well....But what will impress you the most is the art style they went with to represent witches it's almost like a hallucination but even that has a bigger meaning to it then it seems. \nArt style comparison: Soul Eater \nSound-10\nThe soundtrack is very VERY well done. Although in this anime they don't really use the music that much to add drama to dramatic scenes or reinforce the \"feels\" of the sadness. However in my opinion it is because they didn't need to. There was only One opening and 5 different endings. The opening is connect by ClariS. I can't really think of another kind of song that would have suited the anime any better. \nSound comparison: Guilty Crown \nCharacter-10\nI have no clue where to being with this.... all i can say is 3d. 3d characters everywhere. This i feel is where the anime shined the most is not only in character dynamic but character development. It is almost INSANE how well they did it. People may say OMG SO UNREALISTIC THERE IS NO WAY THEY WOULD ACT LIKE THAT IF I WERE THEM I'D ALREADY SUCKED IT UP AND MOVED ON AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY WOULD REACT LIKE THAT THIS IS SO UNREALISTIC. To that.. I really try not to face palm. The character and plot is more realistic than it seems. Yes I am saying that in reality most people would react like the way the characters did to situations. Not only that but the characters almost serve the purpose of being \"stereotypical\" anime personalities just so they can show the audience what happens if they were put under a traumatic situation. \nCharacter Comparison: hmmm...this is a hard one the closest so far would be Guilty Crown and probably a few others that are better examples. \nEnjoyment-10\nI would be lying if I didn't say my heart was racing while watching the anime. But my god. I did go into the anime with the misunderstanding that it was your \"stereotypical\" Mahou Shoujo anime. However I did enjoy it. I haven't enjoyed an anime this much since watching my first Studio Ghibli movie. \nOverall-10\nI would not recommend this to a friend/person who is just starting to watch anime or can breakdown easily. This will either for the person who is new to anime is what will get them to stop watching anime because of how intense it is or it will be total confusion for them because throughout the whole entire series they would be confused as to why the girls hair colour is pink, blue, red and why the heck is there a talking animal. However if your one of the people who is \"sick\" of moe anime please watch this. It will destroy your distaste to anime in the 20th century."},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Let me tell you a story of how I first became an anime reviewer. It was one dark and dismal day when I met a mysterious little critter on my way home. As he stared at me with curiosity gleaming in those scarlet pupils of his, the first words to come out of his mouth were “Would you like to make a contract with me.” Reluctantly I accepted his contract and wow, just wow. I had no clue as to what I was getting into. The act of being a reviewer is difficult. Everyday I have to struggle to build up my reputation, respect the\n          \n        opinions of others even if they’re shit talking your favorite show to death and make sure my reviews are precise, informative and unbiased. It almost became a complete nightmare for me! No in fact it is a nightmare. I’ve been conned. I feel like I’ve just sold my soul… I gotta find him! Before he-\nOk I was just messing with you. That story is 100% fictional (yeah I know it was pretty bad). However that is basically Madoka Magica’s storyline in a nutshell (except with a magical girl instead of reviewer). \nStory (9)\nTo keep details simple, Puella Magi Madoka Magica starts off with your rather cute, average and ordinary female protagonist meeting up with a strange little creature called Kyuubey who offers to grant her a wish in exchange for signing his contract to become a magical girl and protect this world from witches who stalk the sinister and uncanny labyrinths, preying on the depression of bypassers. So far my first impressions of this show were that it was this happy-go-lucky Sailor Moon esque anime where magical girls fight to protect the planet from evil. Well that part is right however the anime goes much deeper into that. So deep in fact that you’re going to feel like you’ve watched the magical girl version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. A show for your 5 year old daughter this is definitely not. \nTo bluntly put it, the story gets much darker after episode 3 and I mean very dark. So dark in fact that you’ll be pondering at night about it. If you want a happy-go-lucky Sailor Moon esque show then be warned. \nWell that’s all you need to know about the show, that it’s a magical girl anime that soon takes a turn for a much darker and depressing plot. Revealing anything else is pretty much a guaranteed spoiler and we all know how much we hate those. What I can tell you however, is whether the story is actually any good. \nThe story is magnificently put together. Every fight scene and dialogue in this show serves a purpose to moving the plot forwards and there is very little filler shown throughout.  The show introduces such themes like the deconstruction of the idealism present in many shows of its genre and even the consequences of making a wish and accomplishes this task in the most captivating way possible. The only issue I had with the story that prevents me from giving it a perfect 10 is that it is too short and introduces a plot device later on that suddenly complicates the whole thing. However this can be forgiven for the ending perfectly wraps up the majority of the essential loose ends together and can be very satisfying even to a diehard fan of magical girl anime. \nCharacter (8)\nInstead of trying to cram a plethora of characters into a short 1 cour anime, Gen Urobuchi took the safe route this time by focusing on five magical girls along with the ‘team pet’. Sure there are also side characters such as Madoka’s mother, Madoka and Sayaka’s teacher, Hitomi etc but they merely serve as a reminder of the fact that Madoka and her friend Sayaka are ordinary individuals just like you and me (unless you happen to be another contract-making being who passes himself off as a ridiculously adorable critter). \nAs for the magical girls themselves, I felt they were already fleshed out enough. There was nothing very supernatural and mysterious about their past as they were pretty much normal girls whom have encountered some sort of accident or catastrophe or even a flaw in their character before this Kyuubey creature came along. Characterization for the most part is pretty spot on and no one in the show generally acts out of character for no apparent reason. \nAnimation/art (9)\nOne thing to mention is that this anime is animated by Studio Shaft who were notable for producing animes with a deranged and almost bizarre look to them. So you would expect the animation for this show to be like Bakemonogatari, Nisekoi or Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei with live action imagery being spliced in, Japanese texts being projected on to a colored background or weird faces that resemble some other animes out there. Madoka however is not really like that. Instead the animation comes in two sections, traditional moe designs to fit the main characters and the human world and a somewhat gothic and uncanny look to the witches and the labyrinths while drawing upon inspiration from many western animated works like some of the scarier and trippy sequences of the Western cartoon known as Courage the Cowardly Dog with a little bit of Tim Burton being poured into the mixture. As a result it tends to have a unique aesthetic design especially when some of the labyrinth sequences blend in with the 2D animation of the magical girls themselves. \nSo yes you’ll be seeing Madoka and friends battling witches through rooms spliced with photo-shopped imagery of deserts, stationary you name it.  Some of you may find it weird and almost distracting at first but you’ll get used to it after seeing a few episodes. I certainly did. \nThe only major issue I have with the animation itself is that some of the character’s faces look almost off model at times from a distance. It is almost hard to notice during certain scenes but it’s definitely there. However this is an incredibly minor gripe for the fight scenes in this show are fluid and very well animated. The soul gems in particular were satisfying visual works of hand drawn art. \nTo those Blu Ray lovers out there, several shots and scenes have been improved. Mami’s home for example is not as empty anymore as in the DVD version and actually has some furniture and brightly colored wallpapers added as opposed to the bland, shadowy locale that was present in the TV and DVD editions. That is all fine and dandy, if you can afford the Blu Ray of course (its way too expensive).\nSound (10)\nAh Yuki Kajuira. You impressed me greatly with your compositions of the soundtrack for the likes of Mai Hime and Fate Zero but I did not expect you to pull the same level of greatness with yet another installment. The music for this anime oozes with orchestral beats along with a European flair added to it for some more foreign flavor. The classic Kajuira style violin can be heard during some of the more emotional themes, the most prominent one being Decretum which just has this overall melancholic feel to it, showing us what it is truly like to be a magical girl. In fact the whole soundtrack is beyond excellent.\nThe openings and endings to the anime are sung by Claris and Kalafina respectively. The strangest aspect of these two that you’ll immediately notice is that they are both different in tone and style from each other. The opening song Connect by Claris is very lighthearted, heartwarming and filled with joy thus deluding you to believing that you’re watching another cutesy magical girl show. The ending song Magia by Kalafina however is dark, brooding, filled with the exasperated strums of an electric guitar rather than a piano and basking in a sinister symphony that will have you screaming at the top of your lungs “Yuki Kajuira must have worked on this!” The ending is one of my favorites as it fits the tone of the series perfectly and doesn’t make its appearance until the end of the third episode, a perfect opportunity for it to signify the shift from the shows optimistic and serene introductory episodes to more darker and ominous ones. \nVoice acting is definitely superior with the Japanese version. While I have only seen bits of the English dub what I can tell so far is that it is not as perfected as the original. When Madoka was crying in the Japanese original I could definitely feel her pain. The seiyuus really conveyed the emotions of their character to you.\nOverall (9)\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the more popular and hyped up anime titles alongside the likes of Sword Art Online, Shingeki no Kyojin and Kill la Kill. However Madoka actually deserves most of the popularity it had received. Whether or not people tell you that it is not even close to being a deconstruction of the magical girl genre, you have to admit that Gen Urobuchi has crafted a dark, engaging and twisted tale that sets itself apart from many other traditional mahou shoujo titles out there.  Because after watching this anime you’ll never look at Sailor Moon or her trusty animalistic companion in the same way again. "},

Watch them only if I'm tottally bored...\n2) Most of the famouse shows I watched ened up being crap in my opinion. I won't specify which ones, if you are interested then youn you can check my list.\nSo yeh, taking those 2 facts into considerations I was being put off from this show a lot. However, I just kept hearing praises\n          \n        for it and there seemed to be no stop for positive reviews. I also heard that series are different from normal magical girl series and actually have a dark side to it. Being a huge lover of mysteries, suspence and drama I have finally given in and... don't regret at all!\nThis show 100% deserves all the praises it got! The characters are unique and enjoyable and have a quiet strange villian whom you can't call totally evil despite all the deaths he/she brought upon others. You hate this character yet you still tend to agree with his/her logic and you start to doubt your original opinion.\nTalking about characters, we have a stereotypical, cold natured heroine called Homura. If you are tired of those stereotypes, you will get annoyed with her at first. However, as series progress her back story happens to have a \"perfect\" explanation to why she acts the way she does. It is not something cliche and sloppy like \"I was bullied as a child so I will go all hardcore on everyone now\", no... there is much more than that and the reason is totally accaptable.\nWe also have a \"bitchy\" type of character who is mean to everyone but eventually comes over to the good side... No, she was not brainwashed and talked out of it like it usually happens in Naruto for example, once again there is more than that.\nThe music is a major plus! Kajiura Yuki did her best as always.\nStory is also entertaining, at first it seems to be a standard but once it goes further more things start to get revealed and with that more questions start to arise as well. If watch a show in one go (like I did), you get seriously suprised by some revelvations. However, if you take your time and start analyze things over, you might get to some solutions yourself. I myself prefered to watch it in one go.\nAnimation... well it could have been better but it is still watchable though cutely faces might be a bit annoying especially if you don't like such art style. The fights with witches are illustrated in a very unique way which at first will look weird and dumb but once you give it a bit of time to synch in, you'll love it. I actually have not seen any other animes doing fights this way.\nAnother minus... well despite characters being entertaining and having some good back stories I still think that they were not completly developed, actually the right way to say would be that they got developed way too fast that sometimes you might wonder \"Why this sudden change all of a sudden?\" but considering that it is 12 episode long story, it could not be avoided.\nThe ending... well you have to see it yourself in order to decide. For me it was not a total satisfaction but it did use the idea I had at the begining of the series so I can't complain.\nSo taking it all in account I give this show 9 and do recommend for everyone to take a look even if you don't like Magical Girl type of series like me, you will get suprised by how addicting this show might get.\nP.S. It reminded me a lot Mai HiME series which were done several years ago. Both series have similar theme going on and most importantly Kajiura Yuki did the music for this series too =D\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    *WARNING: This is my first review, so I couldn't really find a way to actually review without putting a few spoilers here and there.\nI really had doubts when my friends recommended this series to me...I mean, magical girls? Really? But after watching the first three or four episodes, my preconceptions were shattered. From the OP and the ED from the first 3 episodes, the show tries [and succeeds] to portray itself as a lighthearted anime about a group of girls and their journey of becoming magical girls, but gradually transitions into something a lot darker. Now onto the specifics.\nStory-  Many have called Madoka Magica\n          \n        a \"deconstruction of the magical girl genre\", and while this isn't entirely incorrect, I feel like the show just chose the magical girl setting to emphasize its compelling story. I was fairly impressed, since even though it was bound to the genre it managed to spread itself out into somewhat of a thriller/drama. A lot of emphasis is put on Madoka's internal struggle, and rightly so. The whole concept of magica madoka's magical girl and [mild spoilers] how manifesting your soul into a gem is a prerequisite (basically throwing away your humanity) really fits the dark theme of the show.\nArt- Shaft does a great job with this series. Having watched their other works, such as Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, and Denpa Onna, they retain their very unique animating style here (Random cuts, weird looking yet detailed rooms and backgrounds, creative character visuals). The reason I gave the art a 8 is because I didn't like the close up's of the characters' faces; they looked too sketched.\nSound- I gave this an 8 because while the OST isn't super amazing, it does its job well and sets the mood. The operaish voices prominent in some of the soundtrack were pretty cool. I enjoyed the OP and ED for the most part. Sound effects are done well. I also noticed that the school bell is identical to the one in Bakemonogatari :3\nCharacters- Each and every major character in this show has a considerable amount of depth and backstory which get revealed throughout the show. I gave this an 8, however, because Sakura Kyoko specifically just does not make any sense to me...[SPOILER ALERT] She goes from deathmatch with Sayaka to totally BFF wannabe...I just can't bring myself to accept this total switch from arrogant always-running-solo to undyingly-loyal-friend. Kyubey, the creature that everyone loves to hate, is interesting in that he's not quite evil per se, but he lacks empathy. In general, he comes off as slightly sociopathic, which really helps bring out the visceral mood of the show.\nEnjoyment- I enjoyed this show for the most part. All of the above elements really fit together and played off each other like a well oiled machine. Unlike many other 12-14 episode shows i have watched i actually came to care about the characters and their struggles (in my experience, shows of this length have trouble fully developing their main cast, such as Angel Beats). I feel inclined to gripe about the ending, but it really is fitting for the show.\nOverall- Sadly, I can't give 8.5's on the overall rating, but I do believe that it deserves a 9, as much as I enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this series to fans of Shaft's previous works, those disillusioned by the pretense of the Magical Girl genre, and those just seeking a good thriller/drama with a good bit of action.\nFeedback is very greatly appreciated, please tell me why you gave me Helpful/Not helpful ^^\n        "},

But definitely worth watching. Honestly the anime felt a bit slow in first half with some good twists here and there, but the 2nd half was what made it..... Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica. I, unlike most people, have a \"really\" strong prescience and figured out most of the \"mind-blowing\" events early on so the OMG factor was not as nearly\n          \n        as shocking as for me like other people. That's why I personally would've gave it an 8. HOWEVER, as prophetic as I am, there was 2 episodes that completely thew me off and what made me really enjoy this anime. Those 2 episode alone I would give them both 10's. So if your'e like me and have a really strong \"predicting skills\" the anime won't be as shocking to what most people say, however if you're a normal anime viewer this absolutely will absolutely blow your mind and perfectly deserves a 9+.\nStory-9\nA typical Mahou Shoujo that was given crazy plot twists\nArt-8\nThose rectangular heads...\nSound-8\nSet the atmosphere nicely\nCharacter-7\nUgh, crybaby Madoka\nEnjoyment-8\nWasn't as mind blowing, except those 2 episodes.\nOverall-9 (personally 8)"},

I'll review it as it deserves and NOT from a hardcore fans viewpoint.\n-  The story is a fantastic ride all throughout, taking dark turns every step of the way.  It takes it's start as a fairly normal, cute magical girl anime with creepy looking monsters (witches and familiars) to fight.  It's okay though, because the heroic magical\n          \n        girls are here to fight them off and protect everyone!!.... or so we thought.  Episode 3 hits and the change comes with it.  From this point on, the series turns darker, and if you're anything like me, your emotional investment in these characters will hit a record high in anime.  \n- as for the art goes, I'll admit, it has it's lazy moments.  Scenes of the characters from a distance look rather hilarious sometimes, especially during the scene in the first episode when Madoka, Sayaka, and Hitmoi are walking to school.  You'll know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  These little bits happen quite a few times in the series, but they're entirely forgiven when you see the beautiful designs that are present in every witch battle and labyrinth.  Each one looks creepy, odd, and has rather Avant-Garde-like visuals.  The witch battle with Sayaka vs Elsa Maria is absolutely gorgeous and is one of my all time favorite anime scenes in terms of visuals, music, and color (or, lack of).\n- The soundtrack for this series is stunning.  absolutely phenomenal.  Each track from the beautifully composed \"Sis Puella Magica!\" to the depressingly heart-wrenching \"Incertus\", to my favorite song, \"Decretum\", every song in this series is composed beautifully, as well as the main OP, \"Connect\", and the ending song \"Magia\" (which isn't ALWAYS used, but is used a few times during episodes).  \n-  Each character in this series has something to offer, and odds are, you will get emotionally attached to at least one of these characters, considering they all go through some pretty heavy stuff.  The things these girls go through are quite traumatizing, and they all portray their emotions excellently.  For dub fans, the english cast does an incredible job capturing the emotion and portrayal of these characters, and no more is that clear than with Kyoko Sakura.  Her english voice is phenomenal, and she cusses more too, which, I personally feel adds more to her characters personality, in a positive way.  The japanese dub isn't without its great cast however.  I personally feel Mami's Japanese voice actress did a much better portrayal of the character, even if she didn't have anywhere near as much screen time as everyone else.\nAlso, we can't forget about Kyubey, who is one of the most infamous characters to come out of anime in a while, with his gleaming red stare and his emotionless ulterior motives... he's just fantastic.\n- well, considering how many times I've seen this series, I think it's safe to say I've enjoyed it quite a lot, however, some may have mixed feelings.  When i watched this series with one of my best friends, he said the series had way too many sad moments, too consistently, with not enough happy moments to balance it out.  personally, i feel this makes the series that much stronger.\n-Overall, this series is certainly worth a watch.  It's a quick series to marathon, and doing it in one sitting isn't too hard, considering the plot doesn't jump around TOO much, and many episodes flow right into the next.  The characters, plot, soundtrack, and everything else this series has to offer makes it entirely worth the 4 hours it takes to sit through this.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Ever see something that looks sweet and innocent until you realize it isn't at all? That's what this anime is like. Ladies and gentlemen i give you a review of one of the most insane, dark, confusing, and extremely disturbing and yes  awesome anime's i have seen: Puella Magi Madoka Magica  (or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica)\nPlot: 10\nMadoka Magica is a deconstruction anime. What does that mean to those unfamiliar to the term? it means an anime that takes a cliche, typical genre(in this case the magical girl genre) and turns in it on it's head.  What starts off in episode\n          \n        one seems like the typical recipe for a magical girl anime for children: a young, hyper girl who comes in contact with a cute fuzzy creature named Kyubey and offers her and her friend Sayaka the chance to become magical girls and fight these bizarre creatures called witches who cause chaos usually resulting in death's.  The two follow veteran magical girl Mami Tomoe and kyubey on missions for the first two episodes until episode three which which is where things take a turn for the worse. What's to expect afterwards in the plot: Basically after episode three the happy magical girl facade has been ripped to shreds chewed up and spit back out again. This show turns into a epic witch fighting anime that doesn't stop until the final episode. Honestly i'm happy with the way things went  with the plot even though the ending did confuse me a bit. The plot and twists to it are probably the golden part of the show. The plot moves so swiftly you feel like your watching a movie series rather then a tv show. It's amazing they were able to tell a well executed story in 12 episodes. \nCharacters: 9\nThe characters in this series are generally very interesting. It's a relatively small cast that has the five main girls (Madoka, Sayaka, Homura, Kyoko and Mami) including the contractor Kyubey. The characters had very little time to develop and feel fleshed  out especially since this anime is more plot than character driven but they get the job done. From bubbly Madoka, tomboyish Sayaka, insane/violent Kyoko,  cold and cruel Homura and motherly, Mami the girls each have a story and reason for risking there lives fighting witches. Kyoubey the creature that tricks....i mean \"convinces\" the girls to become magical girls and let's just say while he may seem cute and cuddly at first by the series end you'll be wanting to get his cold stare and  unemotional face out of your mind making him one of the most interesting  and unexpected antagonists in anime. I just wish we got more character episodes but this series did what it did in 12 episodes and did manage to make us care about these five girls. \nMusic: 10 \nThe music in this anime was composed and written by Yuki Kajiura, a.k.a. one of the best anime composers of our time. \"Magia\" the ending theme never fails to send shivers up my spine and haunts me every time i hear it. The music that plays during the witch fights are epic and during emotional scenes the music is gorgeous. \nArt:10 \n Madoka also succeeds animation wise. The art style they were going for was obviously simplistic almost girly but there's something a little dark about each character design .  The witches labyrinths are always scary and have an almost real life quality about them ( they remind me of the other mother's world in  Coraline if anyone has seen it) \nSub vs. Dub: Subbed but can be watched dubbed\nI admit it i'm a huge English dub watcher but i of course love watching anime in it's original form regardless of having to pause to read subtitles.  Madoka is one of the anime's that isn't terrible dubbed but it's just......average? Chrsitine Marie Cabanos sounds overly emotional as Madoka even though i did enjoy her performance in the later episodes when Madoka's character takes a shift. Christina Vee does a decent job as Homura with the emotionless, cold voice and taking her to a  sobbing mess. Sarah Williams as Sayaka was funny and in my opinion fit the bill (she got really good during Sayaka's character arc). Cassandra Lee as Kyubey was really sweet while sounding creepy at the same time. To me Laura Landa as Kyoko was the highlight of the dub giving her sarcastic almost sadistic nature true flare and gave her a soul later on. Of course there's the Japanese dub which was really good and sounded more professional the the dub and has no flaws really. So while i enjoyed the dub i would recommend  the sub for perfectionists. \nViewing  age/ parental Warning:\n Do not show this anime to children there are many dark themes in it that are not sugar coated: Decapitation, extreme violence, and Kyoko has one of the most disturbing story's i've seen in anime  and of course language but there was really only one episode that it was a huge issue. 13/14 is a good age to watch this but not before that. It's honestly not nearly as disturbing as Elfen Lied but it has it's rating for a reason. \nOverall:\n Madoka Magica was certainly a wild ride i'd love to take again sometime. It had flaws here and there and an ending that confused me just a little but but was overall great and worth while. A 10/10 for me. \nRecommendations: There are plenty of other anime recommendations on this page you may enjoy if you enjoyed this so i'll give you non anime "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    This anime is basically better form of a magical girl genre. By the way, I am basically having some expectations with this anime. I really want the cast to really learn how to work together and go through struggles in life rather than whine and cry a lot when things go wrong like Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon. \nThe music really complements the story given and I like the opening theme.\nThe story tells in a very dark and serious tone which means that this anime really wants the viewers to really take this anime seriously. This anime is about Madoka & Miki who encountered the\n          \n        strange creature Kyubey who offers a contract in which a girl can be granted any wish in return having magical powers. The story also talks about trust and betrayal between friends.\nHowever, the magical powers are not something which is easy to handle. If there is one mistake, and you will be gone. Having magical powers do not guarantee happiness because sometimes these magical powers have bad effects and can turn a person into a witch which means every girl has a soul gem and if it is not polished by defeating witches, they instead will become one of them. \nBasically, the characters really learn how to trust and care one another in dire situations. I really wanted to see team cooperation when it comes to action scenes. I do believe that it is not easy to become a great character as I have mentioned, I want to see how a character treat others just as how people want to treat them. In fact, they really showed me how great they stand in spite of the difficulties and struggles as magical girls. \nMy favorite character is Homura Akemi. She is without a doubt the most developed character and she is smart, calm and collected.\nI also did like some of the characters bonding moments including Miki and Madoka.\nMy only big problem is I didn't find this anime quite fascinating and I feel that few of the supporting characters didn't get enough character development.\nAkiyuki Shinbo was responsible for the animation and it really gave a different feel and vibe when putting together the drawings. However, I appreciated his effort in coming up with the animation.\nThis is really a good lesson to learn that life does not come easy because in life we all learn how to deal with problems. Life is education and it is a journey we embark in.\nThis anime follows the qoute \"With great power comes great responsibility\" from Spiderman. This is really a good quote.\nSo this anime is definitely worth watching. 8/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Something I heard as an uninitiated viewer of this anime was that it was a ZOMG! DARK SUBVERSION of magical girl anime. It definitely is that, BUT that wasn't why I enjoyed Madoka Magica so much. I enjoyed it because it was a great story, conducive to rewatches and with a plot as tight as a drum.\nThe characters were extremely well-written, some of them with some downright complex problems. You may not always like some of them (I didn't), but I think a character's value is measured by how much you believe in everything they do, good or bad, and I believed in these characters.\nIf\n          \n        I have one complaint about this series, it would probably lie with the first two movies in the trilogy Studio Shaft decided to release. The animation for the series wasn't the best I've seen on a TV budget, but it was decent enough. Apparently Shaft shared my opinion on the first half of that sentence, because they more or less re-released the entire series in two movies with better animation. The cash cow goes, \"MOOOOOOOOO!\"\nBut overall, this is probably one of my favorites. I think I'll never forget it and may even urge this on my future kids (when they get old enough).\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    I wanted to enjoy this anime more than I did. It was a lot darker and would appeal to a lot more people than most animes in this genre would. I liked the artwork and how it vaired between the real world and the worlds the Witches lived in. The characters also were well done and the music was good too. But somehow, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I should.\nIt is a very good anime though. The story focuses on Madoka, but what annoyed me a little was the opening theme not only was way too upbeat considering the dark nature of\n          \n        this anime, but throughout it didn't really actually show anything really of what the story was. That may be just me but the ending theme was a much better representation of what this anime was actually about and how dark it was. The story doesn't hold back any punches after all, and it doesn't merely revert to a happy ending either, which I kind of liked, though some twists did get a little extreme.\nStill, the characters were great, though you might change your mind about some of them as the series goes on. I changed my mind about several characters, and sometimes it wasn't in a good way, but that is kind of what made this anime so clever as well. Some characters though felt a little less developed and didn't really get enough time during the anime.\nI can understand that the art won't be to everyone's tastes. While the real world's art follows most animes of this kind, the Witch's world and flashbacks use a much different style. I actually really liked this, as it adds to the dark tone and generally creepy feel that these moments are meant to create. The Witches are well designed too and each of their worlds are fantasy at its most surreal and best, with each one having its own different setting. It shows just how much time and effort went into the art.\nThis is a great anime and it does deserve to be watched. The dark tone it carries and the idea that 'everything is not as it seems' is probably a lot stronger here than you might expect. If you don't like the art though, it will probably be a lot harder to watch for you, and the story does go to some very dark places. I did really enjoy Madoka...I just wish I'd enjoyed it more.\n        "},

Don't let the sugar sweet character designs fool you, this anime is a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. There is only so much I can say about the anime without spoiling because it's a very fast paced one, at only 12 episodes. All I can say is you have to watch a bit past episode one until it gets really good. And after the first one, whether it's the cut and paste eldritch abominations, or the awesome soundtrack that reels you in it's a promising start.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=3,    ["text"]="                          \n    For some, this show does for magical girls what Evangelion did for mecha. The comparison is fair, as this show does act as something like a deconstruction for the magical girl genre. At least, that’s the narrative that’s been built around it. Madoka is built more or less on the futility of hope. Some characters line up to in order to defend it, some to tear it down, one lives through it over and over again; the characters exist in order to bring about these ideas. That said, the experience of actually watching Madoka is anathema to these thematic readings (although they can certainly be\n          \n        made), because much of its power relies on the viewer making an emotional investment on its characters. By upping the stakes of its battles, the show gives weight to the actions of its characters – and the resulting devastation and trauma that results from those actions becomes even more dramatic because of this. Although in my mind I still have trouble reconciling the very forward-thinking and ambition nature of this show with the marketplace-motivated motivation/calculations that went into its creation (how even though these characters are incredibly well-realized, the reason why they are allowed to exist is because they are likely to be commodified and  objectified by the audience the show is aimed at), the show is nonetheless very strong.\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com\n        "},

I take note of whether I have watched or read a series that is extremely similar to this, does it have original characters, and do I like to listen to the soundtrack outside of the show. The answer to all of those questions in this case was yes.\nThe bad. It did seem like they were trying to make some of the scenes go on forever, though in some cases it helped with the mood of the anime, so I won't take down the art much for that. There was a\n          \n        lack of development for a certain character in the series as well.\nThe good. This series had an original story, which isn't something most Magical Girl series have, where as Sailor Moon started the whole cliche of villain of the day in magical girl series, this one didn't follow at all the same formula. Madoka Magica had a dark and near horror like story that had to do with magical girls turning into witches, these be evil monster like beings, that would kill innocent people. They had a very prominent theme of innocence and sacrifice when it came to the two main characters Madoka and Homura. These two as well as Sakura and Sayaka are very well developed as characters. The art style is also very original, mixing a cute style of drawing for the main characters and a Silent Hill like appearance for the witches. Not to mention that amazing soundtrack.\nFinal Verdict:\nI would really suggest this series, even if you don't like cute style characters or magical girl anime. This isn't your average magical girl anime.\n        "},

At first, I judged the cover before knowing what it was about,because it looked like a normal magica girl anime, but I was wondering why it was on the top list, so I tried on this one and Oh man, this wasn't a disappointement at all. \nThe story is about normal school girls who gets to meet new girls who appear to be magical ones, one of them is a cold one who seems very mysterious at first\n          \n        sight, the other isn't at all, she shows magoka and her friend about the magical world of become a magical girl and Fighting Vile Witchs. I swear at first look this anime looks really normal and at time cliche even if the artistic style is unique, But after 2 episodes in, you're in for a Mind Fuckery anime that will Blow your mind of Originality and Redefined the Magical Girl Genre. The Evolution of the characters are so incredibly believable and well put, one that I really liked was Homura, the cold one at the beginning who seems mysterious, I Didn't didn't like her in the beginning, I just found her really unreadable and cold, but it's really supposed to be that way, because after the show is done, it could possibly be your favorite character in the show and that is only because the character developpement of her is done so well, Oh and her magic is so awesome! More than the other In my opinion. What I really liked about this show is how all the characters are different, they are all fighting for something different and you can really understand why they are the way they are because of that, sometimes Madoka Magica Have moment : '' NO WAY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JUST HAPPENED?!?!?\" And that is REALLY awesome, because they aren't many animes these days capable of doing moment like this. The Music is very beautiful too.\n I think the only problem I have with this anime is the animation quality, I know I KNOW this is supposed to be that way to make the magical world different from the normal one, but Sometime some villains are like too paperish, It doesn't look 3D, it didn't bother me that much, I just wanted some really dark villain that would feat the theme of the anime. And talking about the theme, The anime is so dark, it's impressive how well the anime goes on that theme with that visual style, it looks girly in the beginning but in the end it's not girly anymore, it's really serious, you don't even think about how the anime looks in the end because the series is so great. The last 3 or 4 episodes are totally Mind Blowing, you just can't simply stop.\n I will put it simple : Puella Magi Madoka Magica is INCREDIBLE, A rare Gem of anime quality that made me remember once again Why I like anime so mucch with an incredible plot and endind. I Gladly give this anime a 9.5, it crearly deserves it. Madoka Magica simply Redefined genre, it really is the perfect magical Girl anime and all the Magical Girl anime should follow the same path.\n        "},

Though, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is much more complex than that. If I were to label it in a genre, it would definitely be a psychological thriller, the kind that makes you question everything. Which is why I want to start with a quote...\n\"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid\n          \n        island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of the infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.”\n-H. P. Lovecraft\nWith that being said, the first thing that viewers must know about Mahou Shoujo is the fact that it touches on some very complex subjects that require utmost attention in viewing so as to be able to grasp them at least to a minimal extent. Expressing what the anime is about in overly simplified terms is basically this: how man's wishes (or a woman's wishes in this case) can affect the simple balance of life and their future/destiny.\nIt starts out simple enough: grasping the viewer in a beautifully drawn world, with the cutest characters you could possibly imagine. In the aspect of artwork, you will not be disappointed. The mostly female cast is well animated to the extent that we can grasp their emotions without fully understanding what's going on. There is extensive use of color that helps attribute personality to each of the characters. For example, Madoka, which is our main protagonist, has pink hair and red-pink-ish eyes. In her everyday attire you may see more hues of red present, depending on the episode. This free use of coloring aids in pinpointing specific characteristics on each of the characters, which helps make them more memorable. Memorability is the main topic of Mahou Shoujo's protagonists. They all contribute with their own personalities, emotions, and above all, their circumstances. Their individual experiences are strong enough to make anyone feel sympathetic with them. These aren't your everyday schoolgirls with schoolgirl problems.\nAt first, our cast, composed of mostly girls, seems light-hearted and carefree. We may even feel that there is no seriousness to the story. This changes early on when we witness the type of situations and dangers (which appear to be nonexistent to the protagonist's childish eyes) the characters are getting into, and how their decisions and behavior affect their own safety. We soon learn that these light-hearted girls are much more serious and harbor deeper, more complex feelings towards their surroundings than thought possible. Again, memorability...\nAs far as animation goes, we witness various exhilarating fight scenes filled to the brim with detail that keep you on the edge of your seat. Not just that, but each character has their own body-language that we learn to interpret throughout. These aspects, and a few more which I know I'm leaving out, add to the memorability.\nAnd then story-wise, it grasps on to you like a parasite and doesn't allow you to be free until you are left scratching your head in utter bewilderment. There is much mystery surrounding our main characters, and what is really going on around them. Mahou Shoujo's case (story-wise) is a complex one and an emotional ride that delves deeply into friendship, love, psychology and psychoanalysis, time-travel, and cause-and-effect, all while leaving you with a sense of despair and confusion. Nearing the end, you start to question whether or not the main problem can truly be resolved.\n...And this is where things go downhill for me. I found the wrap up to the seemingly impossible-to-resolve conflict completely perplexing and upsetting. It seems as though it was too well thought out to the point where they should write a science book about it, because the viewer is left in a limbo of juggling a myriad of whats, hows, and whys. I dare not criticize originality because it is original to a certain extent (the ending), but it is so mystifying that you aren't really paying attention to its originality. Sure, the conversations between the characters (in the wrap-up) show some important insight into what's happening and why it happened, but it all seems so labyrinthine and impossible that it doesn't make up for how much despair the viewer is put through during the rising action.\nThe reason I gave enjoyment a \"7\", is precisely because of the ending. I'd rewatch it only to skip the last 2 episodes to avoid getting myself entangled in more unanswerable questions.\nAll in all, I recommend Mahou Shoujo to anyone that isn't like me that despises sad or bitter endings. At least, that was what I felt in the sense of the protagonist. I always cling on the main protagonist and feel that the ending must justify his/her actions, but still provide a bit of relief, that \"everything will be ok in the end\". If you don't care much for the main protagonist's story conclusion, then give Madoka Magica a nice long watch. You're a fool if you don't try it, at the least.\nAnd with that, I wrap up my first review ever.\nCheers.\n        "},

The anime didn't strongly click with me, and I wasn't sure how to rate it (8 or 7), but it is a high quality series that are worth watching.\nDetailed review below:\nStory: 7/10:\nThe story subverts traditional magical girl anime rules, and progressively gets more and more sad. Overall it is very well done, and even in the most clumsily done moments it is completely belivable. The world is quite interesting by itself, and story turns are not exactly predictable. \nNow, to be honest, if you watched TON of anime, movies and cartoons,\n          \n        then you'll recognize some of the story turns, or at the very least they won't surprise you. Despite that the continuous turn of events is quite interesting and would probably touch hearts of most people.\nArt: 7/10: \nThis is Shaft before they developed Bakemonogatari style. Character visuals are somewhat simplistic/cutesy, but backgrounds are highly detailed, and art shifts are handled in pretty much magnificient way. The anime is visually rich, meaning even with simply drawn characters, the quality of animation is very high, and so is amount of details in scenes. \nTo be honest there aren't many animes at the same level visually, with those kind of abstract sequences.\nSound: 7/10:\nThe sound is very good, and I really liked the battle theme that alwso plays during anime ending. \nCharacter: 7/10:\nWell developed characters overall, even side characters in anime. Everybody develops over course of series and slowly changes, till anime freaches the conclusion. This is one of the rare series without any \"gag sequence\" where character go chibi and start displaying emotions via \"flaoting indicators\" (like water drip indicating... if you watched an anime before, you'll know what I'm talking about). Kyuubey does great job providing unerving presence through the series.\nEnjoyement: 6/10:\nIt is a high quality work, but it didn't fully click with me. Hence 6/10.\nOVerall: 8/10:\nHigh quality material that is definitely worth watching. Close to the level fo \"classic\" movies, and most likely a \"must-watch\" anime.\nP.Sl I realize that this kind of review is a bit short, but... the show overall is a bit hard to describe without spoiling it too much. It is an unique work of high quality that is worth checking out. Can't add much more to that.\n        "},

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="                          \n    I'm going to start off by saying something most people won't agree with -- at least, according to the other MAL Reviews I read. I don't think Madoka is a masterpiece. Let me explain why. \nStory(8 out of 10): \nThe story of Puella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the highlights of the show. Since I don't like to use the term \"deconstruction\", let's just call it an original magical girl show. Although many would call it a different take on the magical girl genre, the themes presented in the latter half of the show are similar to that of other shows. Rather, Madoka is\n          \n        the darkest take on the genre. There is also an obvious lack of world building. You never really get to know much about magical girls. \nArt(9 out of 10):\nThis show is Shaft with a large budget. Due to the success of Bakemonogatari(and its 10,000 sequels), Madoka was able to obtain a rather large budget. If I could describe the animation in one word, it would be trippy. When the characters are fighting the witches, the art is absolutely gorgeous. \nSound(7 out of 10):\nThe opening is fantastic. It contains a rather catchy tune, a fair amount of symbolism, and visuals that serve to deceive the viewer. \nCharacter(3 out of 10):\nThis is where the show starts to fall apart. Though each character goes through separate character arcs, they remain one-dimensional. In this show, the characters take a back seat to the plot.\nEnjoyment(8 out of 10):\nThough Madoka has its flaws, it is rather entertaining. I myself watched the entire series in one day, episode after episode. So it at least gets that. \nOverall (7 out of 10):\nIn summary, though it is not a masterpiece, Madoka is a pretty okay show and definitely deserves a watch. The same thing can't be said for the movies, however. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Madoka is heavily promoted by its creators and a large fanbase and while I rarely pay attention to marketing campaigns in the anime industry (although I probably should as I am studying to be a marketer), it seems like Madoka's marketing campaign was hard to ignore or resist. When it comes to hype, I can't help but feel rather skeptical. But, much to my surprise, I liked this anime.\nStory: 8/10.\nI may be mistaken as I am not exactly an expert when it comes to magical girls as a genre, but something's telling me it was Madoka Magica that set new tendencies with the help of\n          \n        its dark and heavily philosophical themes. Magical girls are not unique and it's hard to come  up with new ideas that could help new shows stand out. But this anime does because it exploits the idea that being a magical girl is not all rainbows and roses, it's not as cool or romantic as it seems to be. In fact, it is a huge burden to carry and there are plenty of drawbacks and threats. It's not an easy show to watch as its themes are heavy and dark. And I have to admit, I like some good angst every now and then.\nArt: 6/10.\nI personally do not like the art style of this show, but it's quite subjective as I believe that art and pretty image are not as important as the plot itself. But don't let these cute faces deceive you, this show is going to be one hell of a ride.\nSound: 10/10.\nKajiura Yuki is a genius and a woman of exceptional talent. In fact, although I can name several talented composers and musicians, I highly doubt anyone else would do such a great job at creating music that would fit this anime's dark and complex atmosphere. Good voice acting plus amazing soundtrack, I loved everything about these two parts of the same aspect.\nCharacter: 8/10.\nThis show's only flaw is its main character as Madoka Kaname can be pretty annoying at times as her naivety and optimism may drive one crazy. Do I dislike her? Actually, no, I do not. She's okay, although she is not the type of protagonist I personally prefer.\nThe most forgettable character is Sayaka. Now, don't get me wrong, she has a decent story, interesting reasons and overall, she is a pretty decent character. I just do not seem to care for her as much as I do for some other characters.\nTomoe Mami is a poor victim of her own good intentions and idealism. As you learn more about the world of Madoka Magica, you realize how mistaken she was. Unfortunately, her lack of knowledge was what destroyed her. However, I can't help but wonder if she should've known about the other side of this coin.\nAkemi Homura may seem somewhat annoying at first. When you know little to nothing about all aspects of the story, you can't help but judge her by her actions and intentions. But in the end, she is the one who knows everything, as well as how it all must end.\nSakura Kyoko is probably one of the brightest characters of this show as her bold and brash personality make her a rather interesting character. Her harsh attitude is the result of her tragic life. I admire characters that manage to hold their heads up high no matter what, even though it is a bit of a cliche.\nLong story short, all cast members are memorable regardless of what you think of them, and I personally find it remarkable.\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\nI liked it. I liked it a lot and I do not regret watching this anime despite not being a huge fan of incredibly heavy themes.\nIs this anime overrated? Let's be honest, yes, it is. And there are shows that are just as good as Magoka Magica, if not better. But what I know (and what I need to know) for sure is that it is a very interesting and enjoyable anime, whether it's popular or not. I believe ratings are subjective as we all just share our opinions on anime and manga, but this particular anime is worth checking out.\n        "},

However much magic and cute dresses plays a part in Madoka Magica, it is not where the story focuses. Remember when watching the twelve episodes of Madoka, to never let your guard down, because just as soon as you think you're safe, someone comes up behind you and stabs you in the throat.

For fans of magical fight scenes, there is plenty of jaw dropping moments.  There are guns, grenades, rocket launchers, mines, swords, spears, etc. etc.  And as for the epicness/scope of the anime it is one of few anime that comes close to the epicness/scope of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\nFor fans\n          \n        of psychological thrillers, it will have your head spinning by the final episode.  \"Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.\"  A quote from fullmetal alchemist describes what is at stake for the characters of this story.  \nAs for why I gave a 9 instead of a 10 I can only say its because I'm a guy.  Wait that sounded a little sexist...to be honest I prefer realistic anime, and while Madoka Magica seemed like a roller coaster ride and sent a powerful message of hope, I feel it was too dramatic at times...I wished that the producers made a few episodes where they induced emotions other than despair, suspense, and hope.  The show would have felt more balanced overall and the finale would have had greater impact.\nStill, I advise you to get on the ride. \nArt(10): There was excellent, consistent animation throughout the entire show.  Some of you may be turned off by the cute character designs (I know I wasn't haha), but I feel it helped drive the theme of the show; the battle between despair and hope.  \nThat said, the battle scenes were over the top.  Animation was fluid, colorful, and unique.  The art style really amazed me.\nSound(10): Opening was light, upbeat, and quite catchy.  Ending was intense in contrast to the opening.  I didn't particularly distracted by any sound effects in the anime...which is a good thing...because it meant they fit.\nCharacter(9): So, the characters start off fairly stereotypical.  You have the bubbly shy girl (Madoka), the tomboy (Sayaka), tsundere (Kyouko), nice girl (Mami), serious girl (Homura).  The beginning episodes are used for introductions.  However, the later episodes really draw out the depths of each character. We learn about their philosophies, desires, and despair.  \nEnjoyment(10): I just finished it, so I may be biased.  But I really enjoyed this series.  It drew me in and that's when you know you're watching something good.\nSo...what are you waiting for, go watch it.  If your more into seinen stuff keep watching at least for 3-4 episodes."},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    * CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS *\nFirst let me start by reconstructing my thought process while I was watching this anime:\nThe Beginning\n“Why am I watching this boring magical girl anime, and why the hell did my friend recommend this to me?”\nThe Middle\n“This theme (Magia) doesn’t fit the magical girl genre at all, what is this?”\nThe End\n“Oh. Wow.”\nThe story begins with a young 8th grade girl named Madoka, who has a happy life with a good healthy family. She is given the opportunity to have any wish in the world, by a (cute) little creature named Kyubey. However, this wish comes with a hefty price of becoming a\n          \n        magical girl and hunting witches for their “grief seeds” to maintain a “soul gem”. As it later turns out, all magical girls eventually turn into witches when their soul gems become too corrupt and turn into grief seeds. A mysterious girl named Homura continues to prevent Madoka from accepting this “contract”, while her motivations remain unknown.\nNow after watching 3 or 4 episodes you will understand that this show does not target little girls as an audience with its mature and complex themes. The true intentions of the writers become known throughout the story as it follows the adventures and hardships of Madoka and her friends, Sayaka and Mami. Only after the magical girl “role model”, Mami, is brutally killed by a witch, does Madoka, Sayaka, and the viewer realize how dark and twisted the repercussions of being a magical girl are. This event seems to convey, one of the many themes in the show, that “with great power, comes great responsibility”.\nThe writing in this show is truly phenomenal as the writers successfully tackle very complex concepts such as: time travel, wishes, human ethics and morals, karmic forces, and interdimensional beings. Not to say that this goes without plot holes, however, I found myself overlooking them because of the sheer quality of the writing.\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica deconstructs the traditional magical girl anime and provides a more realistic interpretation of these kind, brave, and innocent heroines dressed in flashy cute costumes. It suggests that these traditional magical girls would not survive in reality, as their kindness would turn into naivety, their courage into recklessness, and their innocence into corruption. Also, it points out that good intentions alone, do not equate to good deeds. In fact, a majority of the problems and conflicts that the magical girls face, stems from good intentions that go horribly wrong (ie: Sayaka’s wish for Kyousuke’s body to heal ultimately leads to her demise, Homura’s dedication of her entire existence to protecting Madoka just makes matters worse).\n\"With kindness comes naïveté. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can’t accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.\"\nThe characters in the show are beyond interesting, as our expectations of them to be shallow and stereotypical are abruptly abandoned. They are actually quite complex as they all struggle through battling their own inner demons.\nAnd that’s another thing, the convention, that all characters are either inherently good or evil, is heavily challenged by the writers. I mean, look at Sayaka’s tragic plight through jealousy and hatred towards Hitomi. Sayaka is supposed to be one of the “good guys” but that doesn’t stop her from having these corrupted thoughts and feelings that, eventually, consume her.\nEven Kyubey is revealed to be the mastermind behind this “evil” plan to absorb energy from the magical girls turning into witches. You’d think that this would make him the “bad guy” of the show; however, he does make a very good point. He explains to Madoka that his species sees human lives as commodities, just as humans see livestock (cows, chickens, etc) as commodities. The writers play with this concept of “Good Versus Evil” throughout the show, to further contend that the traditional magical girl genre simplifies characters too much, while developing their own even more.\nFinally, the art style and music fit perfectly with the deceptive and dark undertones of the show. All of the witch battles displayed a psychedelic art style that was both beautiful to look at, and creepy. The opening theme followed a typical J-Pop bouncy style that would match other magical girl animes, while the ending theme followed a dark and ominous style that was more appropriate to the actual show.\nOverall, this show took a simple story about magical girls fighting witches, and added complex elements and themes to provide an exciting and mind blowing experience. And it was able to do this in just 12 episodes because the writing was very focused and meaningful. Everything had a purpose and there was no fan service, side plots, fillers, or love triangles. All of the characters’ actions fit their motivations, which is a testament to good character consistency. In other words, all of the characters’ actions made sense. The ending, which I dare not spoil, was the cherry on top of one of my favorite animes of all time.\n        "},

Something that makes it more distressing for me however, is that these anime's are usually from genres I generally dislike.\nTwo anime I've watched have done this to great effect, and it seems that I have once again found a new anime to take this pedestal. Joining the ranks of Evangelion and Kanon 2006. Ladies, Gentlemen and\n          \n        Troglodites, I give you... Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\n-------------------\nAh, the magical girl genre, how I have come to despise you. Yes there certainly are anime in your genre that are not terrible, and even a few I would consider good... Nothing I've ever watched before now ever... had that spark, that edge above everything else I'd seen. Then you give me this little gem of an anime.\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica. Madoka Magica for the sake of keeping this short, follows a group of teenage girls as they go through the trials and tribulations of becoming magical girls. Evil witches are coming to hurt the human race, and magical girls are the only ones who can stop them. Only, all is not as it seems. \nLike Evangelion, Madoka Magica askes the rather interesting question of \"If this could happen, how would it happen? And what, would be the consequences.\"\nIt is this question, I believe, that makes this anime so intriguing to watch. It deals with magical girls in a way pretty close to how they would be in reality. They wouldn't be regular school girls who dressed up and fought monsters. They'd be soldiers, child soldiers. And just like soldiers in similar situations, they are liable to break.\nWithout going into spoiler territory, this anime is not your usual run of the mill happy go lucky journey. And its almost wonderful for that.\n---------------------\nThe animation for this series is... well, I'd put it up there with some of the better animation out there, although it admitedly holds no candle to Gainax, its pretty much on par with what Kyoto Ani where producing at the same time as this anime.\nMy main problem with the animation in this series is the short cuts made in it. At times, its static for large amounts of time, where they aren't even moving their mouths when they talk.\nBut then, there are momments when this anime takes the complete opposite with animation, going full on Gainax in terms of quality when the battles come into it. I wouldn't mind the normal stuff if it didn't happen so much.\nWhat really makes the drops in animation irritating is that, for a majority of the time, the times when the animation drops are some of the much more interesting ones. The scenes you're going to want to remember, while the fights are just kind of throw away for a good majority of them. I would have prefared it to have been switched, or at the least balanced for both.\n------------------\nAs some of you may know, I am almost constantly watching dubs rather than subs. Truth is I tend to get more invested when I can understand what the characters are saying. \nAnd for all you dub haters, I'm sorry to say, but this one is pretty much spot on. With this sort of anime, its easy for the characters to almost sound the same, making it hard to destinguish them between eachother, especially in dubs. But, I'm happy to say that the dubbing team here did an excellent job, especially Cristina Valenzuela as Homura.\n----------------\nFinally we have characters, and my god, do we have some knock-outs in this.\nFirst, we have the protagonist of the series. Madoka. A sweet girl who only wants to help others, Madoka is our viewpoint for most of the series and the one whom we experience most of the trails with throughout the series. She has difficulty throughout the series in deciding whether to take the Magic Girl mantle. However, she also blames herself above all when things turn bad, very similar to the protagonist of Evangelion, Shinji Ikari.\nNext up, we have Homura Akemi, the secondary protagonist and the aloof transfer student character. Cold and Calculating, she is often at odds with the rest of the cast due to her seemingly uncaring nature. Still, she has some of the most interesting back stories in the series.\nSayaka Miki is Madoka's friend and the one whom she discusses the idea of being a magical girl with the most throughout the series. While seemingly a generic 'cool best friend' character, she soon becomes a much more interesting character when we begin to peel away at her life.\nMami Tamoe, the first magical girl we meet in the series and the one who shows Madoka and Sayaka the basics of the whole magical girl business. A lonely character, she acts like a mother hen to Madoka and Sayaka, guiding them on their descision of weather they should become magical girls.\nAnd finally, we have Kyōko Sakura, the resident veteran and general 'I don't care as long as I win' character. She critizes Madoka and Sayaka on their descisions to become magical girls and makes it perfectly clear that she wants to be top dog. If you're getting Asuka L Shoyru vibes, you aren't the only one.\nAll of these main 5 are linked to one character in particular. Kyuubey is a small, cat... bunny... thing, whom takes the role as the giver of the magical girls powers. Cold and Emotionless, he offers each magical girl a wish to persuade them into taking on the role. While not evil, his motives, are not known.\n----------\nSo, in conclusion, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is not your typical magical girl anime, and has a rather interesting take on the whole genre. While the animation is lacking at times, its characters and story make up for it instead. Its soundtrack, while not amazing, certainly fits the anime well and does its job accordingly.\nAnd with this all in mind it is my great honour to give Puella Magi Madoka Magica a very impressive 9.23/10. If you're an anime fan, you'll be kicking yourself if you leave this anime alone for long. \nSo, with that I am done, and with one final message I say to you all that if you ever see a white rabbit thing come up to you and ask to give you magical powers, give it a good punting from me. Ja ne.\n        "},

Why do I mention this? Well because no other magical-girl anime has ever been on par with Sailor Moon- for me it defines a magical-girl anime completely and nothing could compete with it... this was until I watched Madoka Magica.\nA lot of people see the cute characters and transformations, the beautiful bright visuals and think 'This is gonna be a typical sugary, cute- magical girl anime with cute transformations and a very\n          \n        linear story'- and for those who think that- please- WATCH this anime. \nI cannot stress how much I love this anime because everything is done for a reason. The chibi faces, the cute colors, the jokes, the sheer scope of scenery. I have never come any anime that has made me watch it through a second time and understand every single moment of the first 3 episodes- and I gotta be honest after watching the ending and then rewatching it- you'd appreciate what happens at the start about a thousands time more. \nWhile Sailor Moon showed me the innocence of being a magical girl, Madoka Magica handed me Pandora's box with a smile and then unleashed hell. \nThere is nothing to hate about this show. The art style although questionable at the beginning works really well and does something that Sailor Moon fails to address. Madoka is 14 and I can believe that, Usagi is 14 and I don't believe that. The harshness that comes with actually seeing that these characters are so young is really put into that light and the emotions that a young girl faces in her day to day life is really touched upon. But every entire character is a different depiction- we got the girl that want's her friends to be happy, we got a girl that wants to protect her family, we got another that falls in love. This makes the entire cast different as opposed to just being focused on the typical romance subplot that many Magical Girl genres bludgeon you with.\nBack to the art style- it is fantastic! I cannot stress this enough, sure we got those cute moments with bright colors- but then there's a splash of dark orange across the sky and suddenly the world looks frightening.\nThe dark tones contrasting against the lighter tones really highlights the key-tones of the scenes and further pulls out the meaning of said object. There's this particular moment with chairs, and the coloring and shadowing really puts across the unspoken meaning behind it. \nNow while I can talk about the art for ages- I'm gonna move onto the animation. Madoka Magica- is a masterpiece It doesn't just use traditional animation, it also meshes silhouettes and what I assume is mock-cut out animation. And I cannot praise it enough- the moment you see the mock-cut out you feel you've fallen into another world and the only sanity you can pick out is the animation of the characters really standing out against it. And I'm not going to talk about the animation of the silhouette battle which just knocks me off my feet every-time I see it. \nNow my final point before the overall would be the sound. And this is where it loses a small point. The dub for me was terrible- everyone was voiced badly and it does try to destroy the experience- but that's just my taste if you find yourself liking the voices then go ahead and watch it in dubbed. Personality for me- I felt the characters either sounded to old or to childish while the Japanese voices were perfect. The entire Japanese voice cast put a lot of effort into it and constantly left me in tears with their performances. The soundtrack is probably the best I've heard it uses the combination of all sorts of styles of music and I could listen to it for hours. \nI cannot recommend this anime highly enough. It goes for and then against the entire magical-girl genre. I will warn you though, this anime is very dark and doesn't try to be fluffy and give magical ways out (aha)\nSo I now have one question for you\n／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼Contract?\n\n"},

But when I began watching it,  I couldn't help but become attached right away. The story starts out with a young girl named Madoka who isn't to significant. If anything, she is someone like you and me, an average human being. However, fate seems to change for her when she encounters the mysterious Kyubey. When she saves Kyubey, it promises to grant her ANY wish\n          \n        and to turn her into a Magical Girl, so long as she promises to help defeat witches. Little does she know, there's more to being a Magical Girl than she thinks.\n10/10\nART: The artwork in the anime is definitely very unique and different. With the vibrant and soft colors with the Magical Girls, to the dark and intense colors when it comes to the witches. I especially loved the different themes each Witch had whenever the Magical Girls faced them. It definitely made everything better. \n10/10\nSOUND: The BGM and OST to this anime are amazing. I found myself listening to the OST over and over. Of course, what would you expect from Yuki Kajiura but to deliver when it comes to an OST. Each scene had its own BGM that fit the mood perfectly. It's as if the OST had an emotion in itself. \n10/10\nCHARACTER: I never met an anime that did side characters as good as this one did. Every single character within the anime is extremely important to the story. I found myself becoming emotionally attached to each Magical Girl. The thing that makes the characters great is learning why they made the wish that they did and what the outcome was of that wish and whether or not they regret it. Then you have Madoka, who is the most easiest to relate too. You can't help but worry for her. I constantly found myself praising her when no one else would. As if this bitch could hear me lol. But shes the perfect balance to help even out all the depression that will go on in the anime.\n10/10\nENJOYMENT: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, And found myself rewatching it time and time again. It has its lighthearted  moments, as well as its tear-jerking moments. But thats what makes this anime amazing, you never really know what will happen.\n10/10\nOVERALL: Overall this is an amazing anime, and if you haven't watched it then I suggest that you do. \n10/10\n        "},

That's what magical girls have to do. Spent their whole lives fighting witches in exchange for that one wish. To Madoka, this seems like the perfect chance, fight for justice while looking cool in the process! However, as she journeys deeper into this world of magical girls, she learns that being a magical girl isn't all that it seems. \nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is a very fresh and interesting look on magical girls. At the first episodes, I thought it was the sailor moon type\n          \n        anime, but boy, was I WRONG. \nAfter the third episode, I literally had to sit down and think about what THE HELL just happened. The third episode was amazing, and it just keeps getting better, When I think everything is happy again, this show just goes ahead and wrecks it. And my feels start pouring again. But, that's what I really like about this show. Plot twists fly around, blowing my mind EVERY.TIME. \nRarely do I find an anime with so many plot twists, but still manages to tie them all back together to make sense. That's what Madoka Magica manages to do. Everything makes sense, and left me with almost no questions. \nThe character are well-rounded and HUMAN. I have seen anime characters with just one personality that refuses to change. Happy-go-lucky characters stay happy-go-lucky, cool mysterious characters stay that way. Madoka Magica, however, change things. The main character Madoka, seems like the weak, annoying main character. But after the last episode, I realized just how mature she really was, and how there was more to her than I thought. Also, tops to my favorite character, Homura, who has an amazing story. In the beginning, I hated her. I thought she was the party pooper. But as her story was slowly revealed she become so much more real and got me to fall in love her in later episodes. \nHats off to the music as well, the song when Mami is fighting is AMAZING, and the OPs and EDs are awesome too. This anime was one of the few that I didn't skip the OPs and EDs like I usually do. \nOverall, I loved this story. The ending was amazing, and I loved it. Never again will I look at magical girls the same way again. Please try it out. Your mind will be blown.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Madoka Magica took me by surprise when I first started watching it I must admit. I though that this was going to be one of those generic magical girl series where good always triumps over evil, every one was friends and pure of heart. Glad I was proven wrong! Madoka Magica can definitely be classed as a darker magical girl series as the girls have to fight against witches despite their own potential dark demises. Madoka despite seeing what happens along the story line still chooses to fight and maintains her innocence through the purity of her wish. The music score also complemented the series\n          \n        perfectly. Especially enjoyed the ending theme of Magica by Kalafina. All in all, a solid 8/10. A definite must watch :)\n        "},

Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica uses the veneer of mahou shoujo to weave a dark tale about the power and peril of having your deepest wishes granted. Add in the emotional manipulation of teenage girls, the mind-aching causality problems of time-travel and the transcendent quality of true friendship and you end up with a story that is much deeper than it appears on the surface.\nThe highest praise I can give an anime is to say that I want to watch it again after I finish the series. Although the reasons vary from show\n          \n        to show, for Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica the rewatch value is definitely the story.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    Mahou Shoujo has always been a genre I always hated. It always seemed to me like a type of anime with cute girls, pink rods and candy colorful transformations sequences, very boring, predictable, \nand uncreative story. \nIt seemed to me that way, until I saw Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Produced by Shaft, studio famous for creating artistically amazing stuff. I had only seen one of their anime - Ef , and  their unique style and creativity has really made it amazing to watch. That's why I even decided to gave Madoka Magica a chance in the first place.\n[Very Minor Spoilers]\nThe beginning already told me\n          \n        I won't be watching a typical magical girls anime. It shown me something significantly darker and creepier that I would expect, and by the time I finished episode 3 I knew I was watching something that is exceptionally different and very much darker then most mahou shoujo which was a definite plus. \nBut lets start by explaining the storyline:\nMadoka is your typical school girl with no ordinary capabilities or talents, just living her normal, uneventful life, till one day she has a dream about her being in some dark place, where a girl is falling and she is standing near with some white little creature and says she wants to become magical girl. After that, she wakes up, realizes it was just a dream and goes on with her life, until she finds that the girl from the dream joins her school. Soon she meets the white creature, which the girl is trying to kill. Madoka saves it and meets the other magical girl who tells her who those girls are and what are they doing. \nThe creature named Kyubey is capable of forming a contract with a girl, the girl who forms a contract with him has to become a magical girl and battle witches, in exchange he will grant them one wish, no matter what it is. \nThe creature becomes very interested in Madoka's and constantly tries for her to establish a contract with him. Throughout the story we see Madoka wondering whether she should become magical girl while  learning that the truth about them is not as she was told, struggling to keep it together while the world around her grows darker and darker.\nThe storyline is very good, it has a much, much darker tone than any magical girl series I've ever heard of and is the main reason I stuck with this series to the very end. The feeling of depression grows larger with every episode, when we learn more and more terrible things about what witches and magical girls really are. The only problem I had is that it felt a little rushed and too complicated to me at the end. Maybe if they've done it as 25 episode series and shown a little more of those really climatic fights with witches it could've been better it could've been something more. The other thing i disliked was character development. I know it's quite hard to tell complicated background stories about characters in 12 episode series but i felt like I haven't really gotten to know any of the them and that was quite disappointing for me. But other than that there's really not much to be complaining about.\nVery interesting thing in this series was the series connection to the Goethe's play Faust, which is the story about a devil Mephistopheles and a scholar named Faust, which makes a bet with the God that he will stray away God's favorite human Faust away from righteousness. He then makes a pact with Faust promising him to give him everything he wants on earth, in exchange Faust will serve him in hell. That means giving his soul to him. Does that resemble something? Whether Kyubey is really him and Madoka is Faust is a subject of debate but the one thing for sure is that the creators were basing their work on this drama, as quotes from it can be seen along multiple episodes and rune writings in german that are the name of the titles are also present in the anime. It was an interesting thing to see, really.\nThe artwork and character designs are pretty much the only thing in the series i couldn't completely get used to. I didn't found the characters to be drawn that well and the animation quality is inconsistent in some places but it's nothing to major and it doesn't affect the storyline in any way, it just happened. But the characters designs i found are the only thing i didn't like in this anime, they were just to simple. I liked the backgrounds thought, those were quite detailed and added to the feel of the show.\nAs for the overall animation, it's quite good, i really liked the fight scenes and transformation sequences, though i found them a little too short, and too simple.\nCompositions made for this anime are one of the best I've heard in an anime. Epic, orchestral tracks that fit the mood of the series perfectly and fit the scenes in  exactly how they should be. There are also \nquiet piano tracks that play mostly in the beginning, when we don't know what the series will really be like, and at the end when the depressing mood reaches it's climax. I had a pleasure listening to them even after i had watched the anime, multiple times. \nI found OP to be the weakest part in the whole series, not really fitting and overall while the song is pretty average, the animation sequences in opening doesn't fit the tone of the series at all and makes it look like someone really wanted to make us believe we were watching an entirely different series, it's not really that bad but if that's so then why wasn't it changed after episode 3?, it's clearly an attempt to fool the viewers but it's just getting annoying at the end. ED however is very much different and I have to say Ii really liked it, I found music to be really haunting and very, very fitting, it's also great that it was played the first time after episode 3 when it really makes quite an impression. The seiyuu are also very good, I didn't notice anything off about how the characters sounded like. Overall Yuki Kajiura did an amazing job on music.\n[Now it's time to wrap this very chaotic review up. I'm sorry for the composition of this review i wrote this for a week while being really tired, and really wanted to get this over with. Also I'm not very good at writing in English, anyway]:\nOverall this is a very good show, not as good as some claim it to be though. It didn't felt quite as dark to me as it did to a lot of people, but i guess that's why I really like darker stuff. Although the story didn't feel like very predictable, Ii felt like some things could be explained better and some characters stories could've evolved more, cause I didn't feel like I was emotionally connected to most of them, and that's a major fault for me. But the most important thing about this anime is that for me it revolutionizes the genre I've been so harsh on since i started to watch anime. I was really pleasantly surprised with this series.\nIt just goes to show that if you have really creative and smart people on the series, no matter the genre, you can make something exceptionally good. I'm rating it 9, because despite it had a lot of minor flaws, they weren't really enough to ruin the feelings I've been having for this series since episode three. It's a great anime.\n"},

The series did pick up for me and I began to gain interest again by episode 12 but as you can see, if an anime takes that long to draw it's user in, it's not something to boast about.\nOriginally, I was going to give this anime a 5 or 6 on the rating scale, however, later in the episodes a huge twist comes which really improved the score on the anime. \nI would recommend this to other users who are into the 'Magical Girl' mixed with dark themes kind of genre but not to users who are looking for a good series. 7/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="                          \n    Anyone expecting a typical mahou shoujo title out of Puella Magi Madoka Magica is gonna be in for a huge shock. This series takes the genre and dips it into some very dark and horrific territory where it makes the lives of those given the power a living hell instead of a blessing. The first two episodes hint to a darker picture of things to come while meshing in the typical elements of slice-of-life with Madoka's everyday developments and the seemingly happy-go-lucky developments of the mahou shoujo genre. But once the end of episode 3 swings around, then things will start hitting the fan hard.\n          \n        The series delivers plot twists galore with the true natures concerning the seemingly blessed abilities that the girls are blessed with and the witches that they fight, doing enough to keep you hooked on the show's various developments.\nMadoka Magica appeared to be focused on exploring themes related to human nature in the fact that the mahou shoujo in the series gained their abilities through tragic dilemmas or personal desires and Kyubey fulfilling his goals with the girls while lacking comprehension about human morality and emotions. In particular, middle school girls are the focus of this exploration where they are oblivious to many of the harsh realities of life while coming of age. With the mahou shoujo, they come to handle their issues in different ways as they become aware of the realities of their situations. Due to the lack of maturity they have in responding to situations such as rejection and death, they become negatively effected from the nature of their wish as they were oblivious to the possibilities that would occur with their wishes. This gives some of the mahou shoujo in this series a good amount of character depth as the series explores the inner struggles they face in responding to the reality of being a mahou shoujo and their mentalities affected by the past tragedies that occurred thanks to their wish. This helps make the characters seem more than the typical character archetypes you would get out of conventional mahou shoujo titles as characters come across as flawed in their mentalities and there is no true villain within the series. The only major issue I would have to fuss about with the show's plot is that certain major characters such as Mami and Madoka are rather underdeveloped compared to what we learn of Sayaka, Homura and Kyoko.\nAnother element that works well in the show's favor for the most part is its visual presentation. The scenery for the normal world has subdued color tones with a good amount of visual detail to go with its everyday, plain feel. However in the various witch worlds seen, a surreal landscape is presented with bright colors with macabre-looking renderings of environments and the various witches to give them a horrifying feel when they are confronted by the mahou shoujo. The show does have its moments of fluid animation shown through the mahou shoujo fighting the witches or one another making use of their various abilities. The only low point I would have to give for the show's visual presentation would be the plain looking character designs.\nOverall, Puella Magi Madoka Magica makes for a worthwhile subversion of the mahou shoujo genre by dipping into dark territory with its exploration on human nature and making it so being a mahou shoujo isn't so morally black and white and happy-go-lucky compared to more conventional titles. \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I don't want to say this show is a masterpiece, but... it kind of is. But it's not a masterpiece simply because it deconstructs mahou shoujo, like many people will say. It's more than that. \nMadoka Magica is really engaging. The good pacing makes every episode worth watching. You can't skip a single one of the 12 episodes, and you wouldn't want to, anyway. Even though it's not really suspenseful, I wanted to know what would happen next the entire time.\nWhat I really liked about it, and this was probably to be expected from a deconstruction but good nevertheless, is that the show doesn't focus\n          \n        much on fighting against a common enemy, rather it focuses on the conflict between the magical girls themselves. There is a common enemy, though: Kyubey. It was obvious. What wasn't obvious was Kyubey's motive. And even though I didn't quite understand its whole plan, it was explained, and that's what matters to me. \nI also feel the need to mention the \"be-careful-what-you-wish-for\" theme. This isn't an uncommon theme, but what I like is that it really CONTRIBUTES to the story. It's not just a futile attempt at a moral. \nAs for the characters, well, they're not exactly the anime's strong point. They're all pretty stereotypical. The only  interesting character was Mami, and they killed her off three episodes in. I liked Kyoko's backstory, though. It's an unusual take on the usual family-being-killed thing. Character development was fantastic.\nThe unique art was kind of weird at first, but once you get used to it it's actually really nice. The soundtrack is amazing, too. Overall, I'd say Madoka Magica is a bit overrated, but isn't all good anime overrated? If you haven't seen it, please go watch it now because it's great.\n        "},

So you will see a lot of, what I can say, unique style of animation in this anime, especially during the witch fights. The character also look cute.\nAnd that just the foreshadowing for a dark tale called Mahou shoujo madoka (Madoka). The stories of this series is quite dark. It cover some of heroes dilemma. The magical girls in this series sacrificed their life to protect people only to get bitter end to save many lives. They were being manipulated by higher being (disguised as cute rabbit....kinda) and cannot\n          \n        do nothing although they know about it. \nBut stories like this always revolve around hope. Hope that 'all wells end wells to', and that what Madoka did. \nSo enjoy this anime, a the tale about struggling for own morality, unrequited sacrifice, unlimited love for a friend and helplessness. A good watch for those who like psychological stories.\nFavorite character:\nAkemi Homura: The (magical) girl who leap through time\nTomoe Mami: Look good with her head. Has nice rack too.\nKyoko Sakura: Give her some food and she will be nice with you. Here kitty kitty.....\nMiki Sayaka: Yandere + Berserker=Awesomeness\nKaname Madoka: Bear with her helplessness along the series. She is a good girl I assure you *pedobearsealofapproval.PNG*\nKyuubey: Your favorite choice as christmass present. Highly durable. Burn him, chop him, cook him, he will just come back and troll you with \"keiyakusha ???\"\nEnd note: Being magical girl is suffering...........\nThanks for reading my review (rant)\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n                          \n    I have an automatic distaste for a lot of anime genres. Mecha does relatively little for me. Harem animes don't appeal. Magical girl stuff always seems way too cutesy and childish. So when my wife recommended very strongly that I try Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, I'm not gonna lie: there was a lot of pushback.\nI promised her I'd watch five episodes (my rule of thumb) before giving up. At the end of five episodes, I wasn't hooked, exactly, but I was intrigued. Within the first few episodes it became pretty clear that this is not a light-hearted show despite moments of childlike fun. Even the\n          \n        nicer moments of Madoka's life--chilling with her friends, bonding with her mother--are tinged by a shadow that doesn't materialize yet.\nSignificant plot points happen in most of the episodes, but the reason this went from a good anime to a *great* one are in the last three episodes, so if you watch this, you absolutely need to see it through to the end. A lot of anime I wawtch tends to devolve into madness or weirdness or randomness near the end. On the contrary, Madoka Magica has a tight, coherent resolution and payoff that left me *completely satisfied*, a rarity among anime series.\nThe music is done by Yuki Kajiura. I don't think I need to say anything more about how amazing it is, and how perfectly it fits in with the fight scenes and such.\nAlong those lines, the fight scenes are pretty well done. I didn't care for the weird magazine-collage aesthetic, but other aspects of the show far outweighed that.\nDue to the way the story is structured and certain things are withheld, the pacing feels a bit slow, but I think it's--you know what? scratch that thought. The story is best experienced without even the slightest hints.\nI went into this expecting cute little girls, gratuitous transformation sequences, and monster fights interspersed with comedic relief. What I got was a surprisingly deep, dark, and mature show that only uses \"magical girl\" as a vehicle--perhaps an ironic one, given the gravity--for a solid, coherent story.\n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=1,    ["text"]="\n\n\n                          \n    Whenever I sat down to watch the first episode of this anime, I recall thinking that it came across as another boring, school-centered anime with a high-pitched nuisance of a main character. I had seen such positive things about it on social networks that I wanted to keep watching it, so I did, and I'm glad I did.\nThe story was absolutely outstanding. To make a contract, to devote your entire life to one thing, to battling witches, and all for the sake of one, simple wish. It's a lot to think about, and this anime does not portray it as an easy decision. Many girls\n          \n        do it, some for better reasons than others. But they all make this choice at a young age, Madoka as young as an eighth grader. However young the characters are, the story is not meant for small children. It is a very dark, somewhat depressing, but inspiring anime. \nThere are not many characters, and even with the small casts, there are still deaths of important characters. But no matter how short lived these people are, they are very well developed. Each character has their own distinct personality, and we learn of their background as we watch on. The important characters are female, and they are strong, positive, independent roles that anyone can look up to. Something I really enjoy in any show I watch, especially the ending scene, which included girls from (literally) all over the world. I came to appreciate each one, and Sayaka Miki is definitely my favorite.\nI normally don't comment too much on the art and sound of anime, but this one was exquisite. I have to say that I was not expecting the style in which the witches and their scenes were drawn. It was a collage of pure amazingness. The amount of detail that had to be taken to create those scenes, the sounds that accompanied them was truly amazing. There's no other word to describe it besides purely unique. I had never, and I've seen a lot of anime that I haven't logged, seen anything like it. \nThis anime was downright glorious. I have nothing but praises for it. I came in expecting something immature, but left feeling so satisfied, and watching more after each episode. I devoured this series, and I plan on rewatching it. I've recommended it to friends, and I would gladly do so again, to anyone. An outstanding anime for sure. \n"},

But where witch hunters the right choice for this anime?\n In a not so normal world full of not so normal people, and the occasional normal person Witches attempt to destroy us all; one quick question though? Will our magical girls be able too handle the responsibility of taking down these sinners, or will they turn out to be not so magical after all?\nI've got to say just after watching one short episode of this anime i feel in love with the style of art straight away. With our magical girls wearing super cute\n          \n        outfits that make the younger generation of watchers fall in love with them straight away; colour full looking fancy soul gems and witches that don't completely scare us to death after one viewing. \nThe series is mainly about you young girl called Madoka and is a seriously cute lead character who encounters a number of future \"friends\". Madoka does eventually become a magical girl, as do a few other characters.\nMadoka Magica; A young girl who has a caring, loving family that would do absolutely anything for her in any circumstance. She attends school with normal humans and some of the magical girls. In the first episode we see one of Madokas dreams completely in black and white; within the dream she encounters a young girl who is a magical girl in real life who eventually turns up at the school as a transfer student in Madokas class. \nI do think it's an amazingly good series of anime; a bit wacky at times but a brilinat wacky not too serious anime about cute looking witch hunting fun loving girls who are completely insane in every way possible!!!\nIt's an amazing watch from start to finish; it has it's own complete individual art style which stands out straight away, cute loveable characters and a short story line that actually makes sense! No confusing pasts that everyone can keep up with, it's just amazeballs! This only may be a small review but it really is worth the watch if you wnat a break from all of the mainstream stuff."},

The first few episodes are important to the story but, it goes painfully slow for those.The art is very cute but, the anatomy seems to be more off than usual in some places (as anime proportions are often not realistic.

After that she is going to find more partner to kill stronger evil monster and so on. Usually there are no dark and deep story, no violent battle, no killing, etc\nBut Madoka case is different\nMadoka story is surprisingly deep and dark. More Seinen-ish than Shoujo. More suitable for man teenager than little girl (which is mahou shoujo usually for little girl)\nDon`t be fooled by cute opening!!\n          \n        i warn ya\nBattle scene is more brutal and violent. Finishing move is rarely seen in madoka. \nThere isn`t any magic stick! They use various weapon from blade until bazooka (i don`t even expect that mahou shoujo will use military explosive to kill their enemies)\n\nCharacter art is kinda sucks, face proportion is kinda weird  for me (sorry, i have to blunt here)\nSoundtrack is awesome, especially when fighting their last boss. Opening is good (which is fooled me), Ending.. i don`t know, i never listen ending song \nI recommend you to watch this,\nmaybe you won`t instantly like this series, but at least bear until eps 6\nFrom eps 6, you won`t stop watching it ^^\n        "},
