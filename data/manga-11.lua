The 4th Hokage from the leaf village sealed the demon inside the newly born Naruto, causing him to unknowingly grow up detested by his fellow villagers. Despite his lack of talent in many areas of ninjutsu, Naruto strives for only one goal: to gain the title of Hokage, the strongest ninja in his village. Desiring the respect he never received, Naruto works toward his dream with fellow friends Sasuke and Sakura and mentor Kakashi as they go through many trials and battles that come with being a ninja.

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=481,  ["text"]="          \n    This review contains spoilers up to chapter 435 of the Naruto manga. Read at your own risk.\n\nNaruto is currently one of the leading titans of the anime industry, and probably the biggest thing to hit it off stateside since Dragonball Z. At first glance, you would think it is completely deserved, and rightly so. After all, this series has all the components of a major success. Nice art? Check. Interesting-looking characters? Check. Unique and clever fighting styles? Why yes. And don't forget the ninjas. After all, what's cooler than ninjas?\nUnfortunately, none of that means jack squat if it isn't executed correctly. This is where Naruto\n          \n        falls flat on its face.\nThe story is typical shonen fare, a young boy hated by his peers sets off to prove himself useful. I won't go into detail as to why, since MAL's Naruto page covers that quite nicely. The problem here is that said boy is set up as almost instantly unlikeable. He's a juvenile delinquent with low motivations, low intelligence, low skill and pie-in-the-sky dreams. Soon after the start of the series, he gets teamed up with Sasuke Uchiha, a mildly interesting lad with murderous feelings toward his own brother, Sakura Haruno, whose personality can best be described as 'only there to be a gushing Sasuke fangirl,' and Kakashi Hatake, their adult leader who is cool, lazy and just about the only interesting thing about this group.\nI will admit that the first few arcs are actually kind of neat. Pretty darn enjoyable, actually. Masashi Kishimoto had talent back in those days, and it shows. the Zabuza arc, for example, is going to grab you and take you along for the ride all the way through. Most of the others after that are also kind of fun, up until after the Chuunin exams.\nOne of the best parts about this series early on is its wide, diverse and interesting cast of minor supporting characters. They all have their own hopes and dreams, and every single one of them has an interesting fighting style. For example, there's Rock Lee, a martial artist and the only ninja in the village who has no need for fireballs and shuriken, Neji Hyuuga, a child prodigy who aims for the weak spots, Kiba Inuzuka, who teams up with his pet dog in battle, Gaara, who controls and manipulates sand in battle, and Tenten, who....\nOh, damn. What does she do? Something to do with weapons.\nOh, well. She's basically a throwaway character. Kishimoto invented her to keep the 'two guys and a girl' status quo he had going. She barely gets any screentime and says all of three or so lines in the entire series, which is a damn shame. She has a very neat character design.\nAnyway, most of the side characters are fantastic, and they all get some screentime to show off their unique abilities.\nUntil after the Chuunin exams.\nNow to be a little more fair, there is an arc right after the Chuunin exams that gets them all an excuse to play around with their powers and provides a decent amount of entertainment. Unfortunately, I have to call that the beginning of the rot anyway, because that is the point where the series takes a gigantic nosedive. And that nosedive's name is Sasuke.\nYes, Sasuke. The mildly interesting young fellow goes from being kind of cool to being an overpowered wristcutter with all the personality of a chunk of cardboard. In his quest for power, which he plans to use to murder his own sibling, he enters the tutelage of a fifty-something Michael Jackson impersonator with a bizarre snake affinity, betrays his friends, and generally acts like an utter moron. Worse yet, the story shifts its focus from a balance of all the fantastic side characters to this emo Mary Sue punk. At certain points, you might as well just call the series Sasuke. At one point, he manages to actually kill his brother, only to find out that Itachi threw the match. What's more, Itachi was dying anyway and only ever had the best intentions at heart, giving his life to protect his home. Sasuke then immediately decides to destroy said village, which makes no sense no matter how you look at it.\nCompounding on that dilemma is the story's pacing, which more or less comes to a grinding halt. Fights suddenly begin to drag on chapter after chapter, villains become dull and unmotivated, and characters become dumber and dumber as the plot demands.\nThe most recent arc involves Naruto's final showdown with Pein, an elite warlord superninja with six individually sentient bodies and a knack for showy, destructive rampages. Though there were quite a few clever developments, such as Naruto's most recent powerups and development from whiny brat to competent, clever tactician, this arc suffers greatly from many side character-related flaws. Kishimoto has begun to kill off Naruto's mentors left and right for no apparent reason and in completely embarrassing ways. For example, Kakashi, the coolest thing this series had going for it since the Zabuza Arc, recently died of exaustion after failing to do any significant damage to one of Pein's bodies. Meanwhile, halfway across town, a young, weak Naruto wannabe named Konohamaru knocks out another of Pein's bodies in one blow. What's more, people began to acknowledge Naruto as their only chance for salvation long before he arrived at the village, despite the fact that he had previously done absolutely nothing to deserve that kind of respect. As of the current chapter, the minor characters who were once so clever, imaginative and fun to watch are basically sitting around muttering about how they'll only get in the way of this person that's fighting the ultimate enemy of their entire village, despite the fact that said person was until very recently regarded as the village idiot.\nThese ratings are generous due to the beginning of the series. Back then Charactes would have gotten a perfect ten. Now they barely deserve a two thanks to all the derailment. The story, once at least an eight, has now puttered down to no more than a one. The enjoyment rating is only as high as it is because this series is almost fun to read if only to laugh at Kishimoto's desperate attempts to motivate a character that's already got more than enough motivation, thanks, and to observe how very, very tired of this series he obviously is. The only reason I can fathom for him to continue is because his editor wants to milk this franchise for all it's worth, rather than risk starting over with a newer, more interesting franchise. I only continue it in the shallow hope that it may one day become half as great as it once was.\nIn conclusion, Naruto starts out great, but crashes like Michael Scott from The Office on sugar. It hasn't regained its boundless energy yet, and it's likely to keep sleeping for a while. There is much, much better out there, people. Please try to broaden your horizons.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=277,  ["text"]="          \n    I can't believe this... I really can't believe this...\nNaruto is a manga that has been running for 15 years, I still remember catching up with the first seasons of the anime back when I was 12, I remember skipping the dreadful filler second half from the original series and going straight to Shippuuden, I remember ALL of it and it is suddenly over. Wow... feels like an entire era ending.\nAnyway, Naruto was one of the first anime series I have ever watched (Dragon Ball being my first), and even though I had lost my interest and enjoyment in it for a very long time (I\n          \n        dropped it REALLY early when I had just started Shippuuden, it just wasn't doing it for me anymore), I still made an attempt at catching up with the manga because people told me it was ending and I wanted to see my late childhood fall apart just like that.\nAs for the actual review, Naruto started out as a fairly decent shounen manga, it told the story of a ninja called Naruto that was treated like shit by everyone else in the Hidden Leaf Village because he had the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed inside him. At first, he's completely useless and kinda annoying, all he really did at first was yelling \"I'M GONNA BECOME THE HOKAGE\" like if there was no tomorrow. And for those wondering, the Hokage is the ruler of the village.\nHe later teams up with two other classmates alongside a more experienced ninja and form a team that does the jobs assigned to them, while at the same time, each character has its own goals and intentions. The most notable, other than Naruto, is Sasuke, an old childhood rival that had lost his family when he was younger, eventually leading to him carefully planning to take revenge on the person behind it. At first, they do some stuff as a team and it is a fairly enjoyable story that does its job in a decent manner. Nothing too special, but also something that I could watch and still get a kick out of. Yes, Naruto was a bit annoying as a character, but that didn't keep him from being likeable, and the same goes for all the other characters.... at least for a while...\nEventually, Sasuke runs away and the story goes on a timeskip, which wasn't really a good idea as the story kinda jumped the shark at that point. Filled with asspulls such as the 99 different forms of the Rasengan and the treatment given to side characters, the story past the time skip had a MAJOR drop in quality, which caused me to eventually lose my interest in the series. Not to mention the treatment they gave to Sasuke, which initially was a character full of potential, only for it to be turned into the most despicable one of the cast that SOMEHOW still does a 180 on his mood. One second he is planning to destroy the village, the other he simply agrees to help Naruto defeat the big bad because.... crap, I don't even know anymore, I really think not even Kishimoto enjoyed what he was doing anymore at that point, just dragging the story more than it needed for the hell of it.\nAnd Naruto himself did not get any better too, he was turned into one hell of a Mary Sue that just pulled random powers out of his arse because he had to defeat the evil villain at the end of the day. For crying out loud, even the worst Fairy Tail asspull is not as big as a lot of stuff I've seen here. I don't even think this was about bloody ninjas anymore because, as far as I'm aware, ninjas wouldn't just summon meteorites in a Final Fantasy manner. Eventually, even Naruto's iconic \"I'M GONNA BECOME THE HOKAGE\" was toned down and that's when I realized that these characters were no longer what they used to be. What about the rest of them? Pffffft, they were thrown to the side after the so notorious timeskip, it's like they weren't even there.\nAnother thing I have to point out is that the story simply couldn't keep one consistent bad guy. The timeskip arrives and we are left with Sasuke running away to eventually become a bad guy, a psychotic ninja that wants to achieve immortality and a secret society dedicated to capturing the Tailed Beasts such as Naruto's Nine-Tailed Fox. Wanna guess which one was the real big baddie? NONE OF THEM! Sasuke? He becomes a good guy after a while. Orochimaru? Same thing. Pain, the leader of Akatsuki? Turns out he was a puppet after all. Tobi, the guy behind him? Same thing, a puppet as well. Madara? Not this one either. Black Zetsu, the guy that never had any spotlight? Nope, also a puppet! As it turns out (And here comes a big spoiler), the real big bad just so happened to be the entity that created the energy force they use in their battles? How, because she was somehow resurrected...\nOverall, Naruto is a manga that does a fair job on the first part, but completely blows it near the end. If you wanna know if it's worth reading? Not really, unless you are planning to stop just before the timeskip begins\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=234,  ["text"]="           \n    Note: The 9/10 score is for Vol. 1-27 only. In my opinion, the series drops in quality by a huge amount in the last half and we'd be talking 6-7/10 if I rated Vol. 28 onwards. Naruto is difficult to rate when I love the first half so much...\n----------------\nNaruto is a name that brings lots of memories to the front of my mind. Many years ago, when I was 14-15 and hadn't watched anime for very long, I was told about this hugely popular title. Being new to anime at the time, discovering I had 60-80 episodes to watch before I'd catch up wasn't a\n          \n        worry; discovering Naruto's a lengthy story actually made me even more eager to catch up. I caught up within a week, finding myself addicted to it, the weekly episodes working as a sort of drug that kept me going until the next episode aired.\n...But, sadly, nothing in life lasts forever. The Naruto anime eventually ended up becoming a joke after the first 135 episodes due to the anime evil known as 'filler'; original stories the animation studio come up with when they run out of manga material to animate. Older Naruto anime fans had to endure nearly two years of soul destroying stories, involving cooking ninja, postmen ninja and a Tony the Tiger lookalike. And when the anime finally started to follow the real plot again, a combination of budget cuts and laziness meant it just wasn't enjoyable to watch any more.\nAfter enduring so much, I decided that reading black and white pages to finish the story would be far more enjoyable than continuing to watch the anime adaptation. From that point onwards I've followed the manga instead of the anime weekly, starting from the point where the proper anime story restarted after the two year filler hell. I didn't read the first 250 or so chapters that came before because I already knew the story and reading all those pages would've taken a long, long time.\nThe volumes themselves are great. For a weekly manga, the art is top class and, unlike in certain other series, it's very easy to follow the action. There are even some pages in-between the chapters used for Kishimoto's (the manga author) personal thoughts, including some interesting information such as who his favourite character is, what manga attempts he made before Naruto, how he let a plant die by doing something silly, etc. His comments are great for Naruto fans who want to know more about the man who created what they love\nNaruto's a relatively simple story that steals from other famous shounen (young boy) series, namely Dragon Ball. In Naruto we, the readers, follow a young ninja called Naruto who has a big dream: he wants to become the Hokage; the champion/leader of his ninja village. This dream is not a very likely one when Naruto happens to have the lowest grade his class and be better known for being a trouble maker than being a skilled ninja.\nBut, unknown even to Naruto, he has something special hidden inside him that sets him apart: Kyuubi (9-tails); the most deadly creature in existence that was sealed inside his newly born body as a last resort by the previous Hokage (at the cost of his life) when the Kyuubi attacked his ninja village (Konoha). Although a law was made preventing any of the adults revealing this afterwards, the adults hated Naruto because they saw him as the Kyuubi in a human form, and their hatred of him spread to their children even without them revealing the reasoning behind their feelings. This resulted in Naruto wanting to be respected, fuelling his dream to become the Hokage.\nUsing that plot as its base, the story goes on from there, quickly developing by putting Naruto in a team with two other rookie ninja: Uchiha Sasuke (Naruto's skilled rival) and Sakura (the brightest girl ninja, who just so happens to have a crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto). All three are distinctive characters that keep the series interesting with their differences, the dialogue between the three never being dull.\nOne last plot related matter worth mentioning is the manga/anime differences...or rather, the lack of. Some filler additions and less blood/gore aside, the story you see in Vol. 1-27 (excluding Kakashi Gaiden) and EP1-135 is practically identical. There wouldn't be much point seeing both if you wanted to see changes.\nFinally: My overall thoughts about Naruto...\nAside from Naruto having some of the best fights ever, what makes it stand out from the crowd is the diverse cast of likeable characters and absorbing world. All too often with stories you find yourself disconnected, not caring about the supporting cast or surrounding world very much, but Kishimoto somehow managed to create a huge amount of characters and make most enjoyable to pass time watching. The length of the story obviously helped, with Kishimoto having a lot of time to develop the cast, but it was more to do with his ability to create charming characters than anything else.\nOne of the accusations many throw at Naruto due to its worldwide popularity is that it's too simple. Sure, its story is simplistic and aimed at young/teenage boys, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the time of adults when the characters receive excellent development and there are adult themes used constantly (Naruto is, after all, set in a world where ninja kill other ninjas). Lots of grown men in their 20s admit to loving Naruto, and that's because it's the sort of story everyone can enjoy. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what's aimed at young boys in Japan is what's aimed at young boys elsewhere in the world - the Japanese aren't as overly protective as people in most other countries.\n...Well, I think that's about it. I hope this wall of text helps at least someone!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=224,  ["text"]="            \n    Masashi Kishimoto is in my opinion one of the more refreshing writers on the manga scene. Though may I say at first, that yes while this is my favourite manga, and I along with many others find the story rather captivating and original in many ways (despite drawing from many common, and rather cliché themes), this manga is not necessarily for you, the reader, who is sitting comfortably at their computer screen wondering 'what good manga should I read next?' and has decided to let peoples' reviews sway them towards or away many possibly magnificent reads.\nThat is not the purpose of this review. As a\n          \n        fan, I'm standing here saying that this is not a manga to pass the time, this, like a good book will take time, and when you catch up to it, you'll be sitting at your desk waiting as impatiently as any fan to read the next chapter; like a hungry beast impatiently awaiting it's next meal. This is  not a quick paced manga, nor is it all too slow. Kishimoto has found a rather acceptable pace, at which his story moves, but, if you are the kind of person with the attention-span of a teaspoon, this manga is not for you. Though, despite my last comment, if you are still reading this, you clearly are not; and so this manga is something you might enjoy.\nThe story is a classic one, of two friends, who, over time become further apart, and one betrays the other. Any more, and this would ruin the twists and turns that makes it so unique. A lot of the time you are patiently wondering, 'what will happen next?' even though you have a perfectly good idea. And this, makes the story one I would put up at the same level as any good book I have read in the past, thus the previous analogies. However, I am in no way comparing Kishimoto to Orwell, this is no Nineteen-Eighty-Four. This is not a world changing story, this is more of a Harry Potter, a famous franchise with many fans, and a fantasy world that people love to escape into. 9/10\nThe art work is good, but nothing original. If like me, you are reading and love Seishi Kishimoto's 666 Satan, the stylistic themes of this manga will be so similar that you will be pained at times to continue reading. Though despite this, Naruto's art work is still appealing to the eyes, and has some rather cool characters, and the fights are drawn out in such a way, that there is no challenge in following them. 7/10\nThe characters of this manga are what makes it so enjoyable however. Each has their own little quirks, and amusing traits. While you won't love them all, even the bit parts are more than the 2-dimensional characters you'll see in a lower caliber manga. From small characters like Teuchi, the owner of Ichiraku Ramen bar, to supporting roles like Gaara and Shikamaru Nara, each character will make you desperate to see more of them. And of course, the greatest achievement of this manga is that, despite how much people hate, or love Naruto, the manga's protagonist, you will always see yourself cheering him on, and his unachievable goals and dreams, as they slowly appear more and more realistic. 10/10\nOverall - 9/10\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=216,  ["text"]="          \n    The world of Naruto is probably the most interesting aspect of the show. Despite being a show about ninja, the soldiers in this manga are really ninja in name only. They're actually much more reminiscent of modern soldiers with flashy ninja magic than mysterious, stealthy ninja.\nThere characters are a rather nice aspect of the show. Many of them are archetypes, but I find them entertaining regardless. I also feel like the characters that are around Naruto's age (teenagers) have realistic personalities. They're teenagers, and they act like teenagers. That's one of the reasons I like them. Many would disagree with me, so it's really a\n          \n        matter of taste and perspective.\nThe action scenes are rather exciting, but there certainly is better out there. The characters have a variety of different ways in which they do battle, and some styles are very entertaining. Others seems utterly ridiculous and completely out of place in a manga that's trying to be serious.\nNow, while the series certainly has it's good aspects, the overall series is something worse than the sum of its parts. In fact, while Kishimoto clearly knows what he's doing from an artistic standpoint, his lack of story-telling skills shows through. He spends far too much time putting focus on minor characters. There ends up being so little focus on Naruto himself that it's almost impossible to feel any attachment toward him. I also find him to be rather annoying, which makes it even more difficult to feel for him.\nFurthermore, he only focuses on one character at a time. He seems incapable of putting the focus on a group of characters, as he should. Even when the characters are together, they only seem to speak to one another when necessary, never saying much more than what's needed. So while the characters themselves are decent, the character interactions are not very well done.\nThe story also seems to get side-tracked quite often. Some story arcs have very little to do with the main story at all. Now, that wouldn't be such a problem, but a few of these story arcs each span over a few volumes. A lot of the time, it feels like a waste of time.\nThe art is quite good, but Kishimoto actually has a tendancy to show too much detail. He shows far more than what's necessary, taking up panels, taking up pages, and slowing down the progress of the manga.\nThe slow progress is the final nail in the coffin. The longer the series goes, the more it's flaws stand out. The series is good, but not good enough to justify the long, tedious progression of events.\nPersonally, I love this series. However, I have to admit that, looking at it from a critical standpoint, most aspects of this manga are so utterly mediocre that the series ends up looking even worse than it is.\nOn a final note, I'd like to say that when I read the manga in graphic novel format, as opposed to the one chapter per week format it's released in Japan and on the internet, I found the series to be much more enjoyable. This makes the series far less tedious, since many events are experienced in one sitting, since an entire chapter can--and often does--revolve around one minute event. Even the English release in the American Shonen Jump, which is released monthly, four chapters are released all at once, making it a much more satisfying read.\nSo, I would suggest either buying the graphic novels or Shonen Jump, or just waiting for the chapters online to build up, and read them about once a month instead of reading the latest one every week. This will make for a much more enjoyable reading experience.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=215,  ["text"]="           \n    The story is well-written. It's not just the usual shounen manga that's filled with action nonetheless since there are tidbits of angst and drama. Though the target audience of Naruto is usually the male populace, it is not a wonder that it can also captivate the hearts of the females.\n Angst, drama and a little bit of romance mixed with action packed adventure is indeed wonderful. No wonder Naruto is sitting at the top spot for years now. \nIndeed the story is magnificent since it is unique and captivating. Plus the fact that there are a lot of mysteries waiting to be unveiled makes fans\n          \n        go gaga over it. It's not a wonder how and why this manga has been sitting at the top spot for years now. \nThe anime is a must-watch while the manga is a must-read. Naruto is, indeed, amazing.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=214,  ["text"]="           \n    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\nIt's hard writing this review straight after finishing the manga but I wanted to do it when It's all fresh in my mind. Naruto is a story manga and anime fans over the world know, hate or love, It is easily the most detested manga of all time but yet one of the most popular. The story is about a young boy called Naruto Uzumaki, with his entire village despising and fearing him he is practically alone in the village and because of that he as a character values friendship more than the comman man and that leads to him going above\n          \n        and beyond to bring his best friend Sasuke back. With many arcs and a monumental timeskip Naruto is a long story and not for people who don't have any patience, the land of waves arc, the chunin exams arc, the invasion of konoha arc, the search for tsunade arc and the sasuke retrieval arc comprised was part 1 and the flow of the arcs was great, it had practically no slow points and the emotion is high.\nWith the land of the waves being the arc that fans usually remember as the arc that hooked them to Naruto with the crazy techiques and really showed of what a ninja is. The chunin exams is a favorite to many and is my favorite arc with crazy battles and learning about many tragic past to characters it is easily the arc that develops more characters than any. The Invasion of konoha arc is something that could of waited till a certain part in the story was concluded but as it was it was an amazing part in the manga and it did bring tears and epic fighting, still could of been handled differently. The search for Tsunade arc is simply the calm before the storm arc, Naruto gets training from Jiraiya and learns the infamous Rasengan while looking for the next Hokage, the dynamics between Naruto, Jiraiya and Tsunade is very well done and the ending of the arc is a pinnacle point in the series. The final arc of part 1 is outstanding to say the least, the battles in this arc are probably the biggest in part 1 and in the series and the final fight is full of emotion which Kishi is well at, overall the arc changed the story but opened up the story for different possibilities.\nEach arc focuses on something new and trhat's what I liked about part 1 and how it was starting to build upon the ninja world. Then in part 2 the focus of the story shifted a bit from being a boy who wants to become Hokage to a boy who wants to bring his friend back before he becomes Hokage. Now the idea of that seems great but it did bring allot of complications to the story. In part 2 the arcs were structured not as well but the character dynamic was excellent but did seem more slow at times. The kazekage rescue arc was a good opening as I expected te be fair but then it went downhill with the sai and sasuke arc which is easily the worst arc in the series, the only good thing about it really was Naruto Vs Orochimaru. Moving on the Kakuzu and Hidan arc was an arc which used different characters like ino, shikamaru and Choji, the depth and the meaning of that arc was very well written. The Itachi pursuit arc is possibly the arc with the most emotion, Kishimoto sensei may of changed the story to more character focused than story building focus but that didn't change him still being able to deliver and with 3 huge deaths, 2 massive ones this arc stands out very much so. The nest arc is the Invasion of pain arc which to me is one of the best. I would prefer for certain things to of changed but as Kishimoto sensei did it, I couldn't call it bad writing. The atmosphere in this arc is very dark, it's the most suspenseful in the story so far and the fear of death looms over every character and I like it and the ending was a real changing point in the series and very much developed Naruto's character. \nMoving to the more recent arcs the Five Kage summit was something that was needed, we needed for the kages to interact and to show that the shinobi world wasn't perfect and the dynamic between them all proved that the world still needed to  change. Events happened in the arc which led to a big change, something that would start a beggining of a new era, overall a great arc. The confining the jinchuriki arc was an interesting one which focused on characters we don't get to see much and going more in depth with them as well as learning more about the past. The 4th shinobi world war arc was slow and the fighting wasn't that good but the ending proved it not to be the worst in the story. The ten tails revival arc was much better as we learn a truth about a certain person and the stakes really are higher, this is one of the best arcs and especially when read in a sitting instead of once a week for 3 years like some. Next is the final arc which could be seen as the best arc in the series as it focused on a select number of characters and it had very shocking moments and overall it concluded the story well and I didn't know if Kishimoto sensei could do it but he did, he concluded it perfectly. \nI'll say some points about the art, characters, my enjoyment and why I gave the manga a 9/10 overall. Well the art I rate an 8/10, for a weekly manga it is rare to find one with superb art every chapter and the Naruto series has allot of great art but then it can be very shabby as well. Characters I would rate them as 9/10, in part 1 it would be 10/10 but because of shippuden and less characters got development I think a 9 is suitable becuase still characters like Naruto, Gaara, Sasuke, Itachi and Shikamaru etc have great development. My enjoyment wise a 10/10, no less, I love Naruto the series, It's my favorite manga and i can look pass the not so good bits because it has everything I look for in a shounen manga. Overall I give it a 9/10, in reality it's something between an 8.5-9/10 but I think I will just give it a 9 instead of an 8. The story is really an amazing jouney and I always wanted my first review to be Naruto when it finished and here it is ... the story of a boy and his dream!\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=193,  ["text"]="            \n    First thing's first, if you're not willing to read a manga that's very very long and drawn out then Naruto most likely isn't for you. \nWhen people say that it's long and drawn out, they mean it. 400+ episodes, 570+ chapters, 50+ volumes later and it's not exactly close to being finished.\nHowever, all those chapters, episodes and volumes give the creator an opportunity to further explain the plot and characters more thoroughly, which is a plus. \nThe story:\nWithout spoiling it too much, the story is definitely full of plot twists, some welcomed others absolutely detested, but that makes it all the more interesting. The characters\n          \n        do start to get a little repetitive, i.e. one character in the middle of the manga is a lot like one in the beginning. But it doesn't take much to get over that if you're into the story. Naruto, the main character, in my eyes is pretty static. He pretty much remains the same throughout the whole manga, other than aging 3 years; it might get a little old after a while, but there are many many other characters that are dynamic. \nThe art:\nOne word sums up the art for me. Amazing. The manga especially and some of the newer episodes. There's so much detail compared to a lot of other manga, which is awesome. :) Every once in a while, there are a few minor mistakes but those aren't noticeable unless you reread the chapter or have a magnifying glass nearby. \nThe Characters:\nI already touched a little on the characters. There are a TON of characters, especially with the fillers in the anime. All the characters might be a little overwhelming, but you'll either forget the unimportant ones or get used to it. The plot twists occurs the most with the pasts of the main characters especially, sometimes even with supporting ones. Other than the art, the characters are probably the main attraction. They have their own personalities and traits, even if some of them are annoying. ._.\nOverall:\nNaruto is definitely one of my favorite Manga/Anime. I've been watching/reading it for around 7 years, so it would be hard to just drop it. \nOnce you get into the story, you'll understand. I will always recommend this manga/anime to anyone who is willing to try it out. \n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=180,  ["text"]="          \n    Here's Naruto Manga summed up short and quick, unlike what the manga is capable of.\nIt can't finish what it's started.\nStory:\nNaruto began as an intriguing tale based off of everyone's favourite sub-culture group, ninjas. Except these ninjas had personality, and a backstory! Everything was going well, really well, I loved reading it cause every jutsu they pulled was thought out carefully, where they'd adapt what they had to suit their purposes. Battles were strategic, plot was meaningful, and most importantly, EVENTS LEAD SOMEWHERE.\nNow, I'm still reading this manga, so maybe there's something to it, but I've dropped it once before, and I'm getting awfully close to\n          \n        dropping it again. I'm just in so deep now that it's tough to quit.\nAs I just said, Naruto started out good, but in the chapters regarding the split of naruto and naruto shippuden, well... it went downhill.\nAkatsuki was a good addition, but after all the grief, all the fighting, all the backstories, you ended up not even caring. SPOILER ALERT. I mean, honestly, they end up killing off an entire village, and all the important characters, making you think the story was concluding, and then nope, actually, Naruto manages to inexplicably woo another creepy old dude to stray from his determined path, and REVIVE the WHOLE FREAKING VILLAGE. That is not appropriate plot development people! You don't start finishing the series and then just say \"jk! Lulz!\" That's exactly where InuYasha had it wrong. SPOILER DONE.\nAs the series dragged on, everything I loved about Naruto was slowly whittled away, appearances by Rock Lee and Shikamaru were lessened, each battle grew to be less about strategy and more about who had the more powerful, previously unmentioned jutsu. I kid you not, the last 4 chapters I read, all that's happened is a fight where they either summon a giant monster thing to do their fighting for them, or use a genjutsu, within a genjutsu, within a genjutsu. There's no imagination left here people. Honestly it's turned into a DBZ clone, except without the yelling, and without the aftermath actually leading somewhere.\nBut I suppose everyone wants a review according to all the factors.\nArt:\nSometimes it's a bit over-inked and it makes it difficult to tell exactly what's going on, especially during a fight. The art style works nicely overall, but it's nothing that's about to wow you if you've read manga before.\nCharacter:\nif they had focused on the good characters, like Gai, Lee, Kakashi, Shikamaru, Gaara etc... I could give this a higher score, but Naruto took the \"Goku\" approach, and suddenly everything has to be done by one guy, except unlike goku, the guy doesn't even require an explanation as to why anyone more skilled than him couldn't do it. Everyone just seems to accept it.\nEnjoyment:\nIt's hard to say, first couple hundred chapters were magnificent, 10/10. But last 100 have been shite, and it's really dragging on. I can't give it overall anything more than a 6, but understand that the last chapters have been really poor.\nOverall:\nA resounding MEH. I've read 477 chapters now and it's just been getting worse and worse as time goes by. If you want to get stuck in a manga where the start works it's way up to a brilliant climax, and leaves you wanting to read more, only to find out the more that you get to read is worse than the 100 episodes of filler they threw into the anime of this series, then go for it. Naruto WAS good, Naruto was great. But it's hard to stay motivated about a series as stagnant as this one. It's lost it's charm, it's only got the \"I'm in this far\" factor going for it now.\n        "},

It is not very usual that the person who draws the manga is also the one to come up with the plot for it, as it is rather rare to see somebody manage to combine both drawing talent and original ideas in one. Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto manga creator, is such a shining example that something magnificent can be born when you are both gifted with drawing skills to be envyed for by many and the ability to come up with a plot and characters that have some sort of real depth and make the person who reads the story\n          \n        actually stop and think about a lot of things.\n Naruto is not just about fights and action and kick-ass skills (which is however a major element of the story composition and adds that exciting flavour of dynamic to the story), but also about friendship and bonds and how connections can be formed, ruined and rebuild. As if the main purpose is not to entertain, but to rather show how cruel the world can sometimes be and how you must deal with all the pain and sorrow that you face throughout your lifespan. The main character, Naruto, is always the positive factor, the symbol of hope that signals light and kindess with his arrival, the one who never loses his path. He is also gifted with a stuborness that never ceases to amaze and a burning will to never give up. \n The way I see it, Naruto is the kind of person that we all should try to become - bright, positive and never doubting in ourselves and our believes.\n And what of the other characters? They are simply unique, each and every one of them in their own way. The range of varying personalities is stunning and the way the story keeps almost noone neglected really makes me admire the writor's skill. \n And as for the art - I have followed through the story for quite a few years now and have seen it change and somewhat mature. It has of late become more realistic and more accurate for a ninja/shonen manga. Masashi Kishimoto has undoubtetly build a style of his own that is uncomparable to anything before it and anything that is yet to come. \n Overall, as I now look up to what I've written, there were only good and positive things to say about this wonderful manga which I can without any regret call a masterpiece. It cant be helped. When something is good, it is good and that's the end of it. \n Let's hope we shall be enjoying this manga for many years to come. It absolutely deserves to be placed as first  in all sorts of rating systems!\n        "},

Other reasons is bacause i was afraid of going away from my other interestes in favor for Naruto. Oh man, i was wrong xD.\nOne day, i was sick and pretty bored, so i decided to watch an Episode of Naruto. I was pretty neutral there.\n          \n        Afterwards i read af few chapters of the Manga, and it got more interesting. Then i saw the battle between Naruto VS Kyubi, and that's the true beggining of my Naruto-hype xD.\nNow for the Review itself.\nStory - 9/10\nThe story builted up on a slow pace just as many other manga, but the part 2 aka Shippuden is clearly my favorite part of Naruto. All the battles, the wars and especially when the Akatsuki appears where they are after the Tailed Beasts so they could reach their goal is definitely one of my favorite part of Naruto. My top favorite part is where Madara and Hashirama meets Again, especially when Madara shouts \"HASHIRAMA\" like an little fangirl. I felt of my couch laughting like an insane XD.\nOverall, the manga ended pretty good in my opinion, there is few things to come after that.\nArt - 10/10\nI think the art is amazing. I didn't really looked deeper to the quality of the artwork since i'm more into the story. But still, i like the artwork.\nCharacters - 10/10\nThere are really, really many characters introduced in Naruto, but there are some that are my top favorites.\nMadara - His backstory is what is the most interesting thing about him, but i do also like his personality. He i also always first for battle xD. Madara is especially epic where he eradicates the Shinobi Allies wíth meteors and takes them out like bugs, while keeping his Poker Face xD.\nMinato - His personality and his kindness to people is where he gets my thumps up. I do also like his way of fighting. Also the fact that he created the Rasengan is the reason he is one of my favorite characters from Naruto.\nTobirama - Like Madara, his backstory is what i like about him, and also because he is the man behind Rebirth Nun Jutsu. He's also a big racist against the Uchihas for many reasons, because of the first war for example.\nEnjoyment - 9/10\nI did enjoy Naruto from start to finish. It was a great journey xD.\nOverall - 10/10\nI can say i will read Naruto again some time in the future. I can definitly recommend it to anyone interested in a long manga."},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=156,  ["text"]="          \n    It's done! The end of Naruto marks the end of an 15-year period, about half of which I spent waiting for weekly updates for the manga that was my very first. \nWas it worth it? Maybe. I have a gut feeling that Naruto is going to be one of those manga that took great benefit from having a long-ass run time, and that a lot of the attraction towards Naruto was the fact that, well, \"everyone else was reading it too.\" Reading Naruto was as much of a social exercise as it was a reading one, since it's mega popularity ensured that there would always\n          \n        be one or two people that you know that would be following it as well. \nAs far as the actual writing is concerned, I'd have to liken it to Harry Potter: ultimately flawed, but relatable. The themes of believing in yourself and the Power of Friendship™ have been explored numerous times before (and in a much better fashion by other manga/anime), and Naruto itself is a manga that I'm pretty sure could have been written in 200-300 chapters as opposed to the monstrous 700 that have presented over its 15 year run. Many, many, many characters are introduced, given their time in the limelight, and then thrown away because ultimately, it's all about Naruto. Kishimoto doesn't understand how to use scale to properly create climactic moments, and by the end, Naruto's supreme dominance over any of the other characters makes their attempts to seem relevant laughable and almost pitiable. The fact of the matter is, there are so many \"oh, but this isn't my final form!\" moments in the manga that reading the damn thing became a chore near the end due to the fact that Kishimoto isn't a very creative writer. \nSo why did I read all 700 chapters of what seems to be a quite mediocre effort? Well, Naruto was my first manga. Arguably, this fact combined with its existence as a social phenomenon made Naruto quite enjoyable to read (see my enjoyment score) despite its glaring flaws. It was fun to discuss the manga's weekly happenings with other people through its ups and downs--the experience was similar to that of following a sports team with other fans. \nSo, should you read Naruto? Probably not, unless you really, really like shounen's. It's a stunningly middle-of-the-road affair with little original thematic content that was made enjoyable to read due to the fact that it was mega-popular. \nStory 4, Art 5, Character 2, Enjoyment 8, Overall: 5 (4.75).  \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=150,  ["text"]="             \n    One of the best manga out there, and getting deserved praise and attention!!!\nMany people somewhat consider it overrated or point out flaws which basically, aren't flaws in my opinion, so let's get it to pieces (Review by the way follows up to chapter 571)\nStory (9/10) | Characters (10/10) from me:\nOkay naruto is a shounen manga, with basic shounen ideas, but the world naruto himself lives in, is thought out pretty well, very interesting, with it's own history and culture, political affairs etc.\nNaruto starts off about a seemingly annoying little brat who has this need to do bad stuff to get attention and honestly I didn't\n          \n        like him at first, but as the manga goes on, his past is explained, his courage and bravery is shown you start to fall in love with this character... Naruto is not a fairy tale (not a manga lol, just expression) either, it tells a story about a harsh, ignorant society, which hates something it created itself... it's a story about two lonely guys, who are complete opposites but become friends afterwords, only to turn into each others enemies due to many factors... \nbut this is not Manga just about Naruto and Sasuke, it has a lot of characters in Part I who develop and have their own stories, very interesting ones as well, so here comes the first flaw everybody is talking about - the fact that they're ignored in Part II... \nnow let's take One Piece for example (love that one as well for the record) when in One Piece they move from one island to another, they leave crap load of characters behind, who rarely appear afterwords, but nobody complains because it's an adventure... something like that happens in Naruto as well, you should consider that author has told everything he wanted about the characters in Part I, that's why he's not using them in Part II, but many people have hard time dealing with this... this after all, doesn't mean Naruto has no more good characters, but rather Kishimoto moves to another group of new complex and interesting characters, a group named Akatsuki and tells about them for a long time in Part II... for me these new characters are way more interesting... and some old ones are involved too, but not everyone, you could say by this point only 2 or 3 out of Konoha 11 have actual development and screen time... and just like that, when Kishimoto is done with most of the Akatsuki, he moves to another group of new characters (to other Kage's and his guardians, to their history and tales)... so story is progressing and offering many new characters, I think author is doing right not to stick with ones he introduced in first part. \nApart from characters, story is getting more and more complex, and darker as well, not many PG-13 shounen mangas, would dare to give one of the side-characters chance for revenge, which he will take without any kind of hesitation and destroy his enemy completely without \"Revenge is a bad thing\" type of talk (Reference to Shikamaru vs Hidan), or rarely you would see that one of the main characters (Uchiha Sasuke) which you're driven to like for first 200 chapters, turns into a villain and enemy of Naruto... in this sense Naruto is very good...\nNow the reason story doesn't get 10 is because this manga had it's own downfalls, one of them being first part of ongoing war, but apparently it's getting better with every chapter!  \nArt (9/10)\nNow one thing everybody has to give Naruto credit for, is it's art and style, everything is detailed and very believable, I love Kshimoto's drawing and the reason why it gets 9 is well because there are other mangas out there with way better art, and it's the most original one as well, good, but nothing phenomenal \nEnjoyment 10/10 for me, even with it's flaws in story telling sometimes, for me - it's always about the message author is trying to give us, and it's pretty much always smart enough... I love Naruto, it has a nice balance of humor, action, smartness or philosophy in it... you can just sit and enjoy Reading/ Watching it (though if you're gonna watch, find out about fillers first, you'll need to skip all of them, their number is too damn high) \nOverall, as one of my favorite manga alongside One Piece, it gets 10 from me, because even though it has flows, you can't expect it to be Perfect since it's way too big and long to not mistakes... it's about idea and interesting world, tactics and characters depth... Naruto is truly a titan in this industry and it deserves fanbase it has... :)\nP.S: if you're gonna read/watch it, know, you should only if you're ready for a LONG, very LONG ride... "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=138,  ["text"]="           \n    Here is my complete review of Naruto and what I feel is good an bad about the series.\nPlot - Naruto is the story of a boy who is the container for a demon responsible for destroying his village who is despised by most the village afterward despite the request by the Hokage who died to seal away the demon asking he be a hero. Its obvious from the beginning Naruto is a very lonely kid and acts out to get attention of any sort just to have his existence acknowledged by the villagers he deeply wishes would accept him, so in response to that he\n          \n        decides to aim for Hokage and become acknowledged by everyone as a great ninja.\nTheme - The show is very much themed around relationships, friends, family, and that everyone has feelings and wants to be acknowledged and respected. Its a very much similar to Dragonball in some sense which isn't a bad thing at all as in many ways its done better.\nArt - I feel the art style is shonen fitting and does its duty to the manga and always displays what is really going on quite well. I have never felt something could've been better done in terms of the art. I don't feel it is nearly as busy as One Piece or as barren as Bleach. It also doesn't do much fan service which some find annoying like Fairy Tail with the anti-gravity boob women and constant almost hentai ecchi moments.\nCharacters - The characters are all pretty interesting and each have their quirks and things about them that make them noticeable. I feel everyone has personality and points interest. Naruto is a blast to watch grow as a character because he is in many ways the underdog story while at the same time is nostalgic to anyone who grew up with Goku. However I wouldn't call the characterization and development perfect in any way as some of the \"Konoha 11\" need more time in the spotlight to be called developed such as Shino an TenTen. Alot of the side characters especially are definitely characters who I feel need alot of attention an development compared to Naruto an Sasuke which are very well done. Sasuke is a character that has fans polarized on terms of love or hate. He is also the tragic character of the series and gets a good amount of focus in Part 2 and the end of Part 1. I feel his rise to villainy has been steady and well paced with a few over the top moments where its just over done. However I would say its a minor flaw in a wonderful enjoyable tale with good characters. I also feel the handling of the demon fox has been less than perfect in many cases for a show that is about friends an relationships I felt disappointed that the fox hasn't played a much bigger role. I also found the heroine Sakura to be unimportant, bland, and basically useless which I had hoped to see change at some point. However all an all I think the characterization has been done very well and continues to improve.\nEnjoyment/Overall - I love the series alot and have found it to be one of the best mangas I've read. If you're looking for something shounen with a good plot. I'd say Naruto is for you, but its not perfect nor should you expect it to be. To me for a shounen manga this is a very well done one. Part 1 is very humorous an very much the start of the story while Part 2 really is more plot driven and mature without a few humorous moments thrown in now an then."},

I actually thought it's one of the best manga, in fact, I thought it's underrated.. \n(Review from chap 49x) - Spoiler ahead\nStory - It's true that Naruto has quite a \"normal\" plot, that's \"rescue his friend\" that has been overused in anime (I still find it nice though, lolx - exception for Bleach which used this twice..).. But it has maintained this ever since Sasuke was kidnapped.. What I meant was Naruto has never been out of the\n          \n        plot as he's been trying to bring back Sasuke to Konoha.. Yet they manage to make it interesting with sub arcs related to it.. Like beating with Sasori getting the whereabouts of Orochi.. Then learnt Futon Rasen during Hidan/Kaku's arc to beat Sasuke etc..\nArt - I'm not a person who is into art or animation.. But Naruto's art is AT LEAST good, I assure..\nCharacter - Isn't it interesting that you learn Naruto's name comes from Jiraiya's book which based on Nagato (It's like telling you Naruto isn't thaaat main character in the story)? Or maybe why Naruto is wearing orange colour shirt all this while? Isn't it cool that Itachi sacrificed so much for his brother? There's tons of character development still in the manga.. \nEnjoyment - Since the Hidan/Kaku's arc.. I have always thought Naruto's battle has become more interesting and strategic for JUMP style.. The battles are never boring then.. Then, Kishi even inserted some comedy or heart-warming stuff in between arcs.. It's also such a creative manga, like how the 1-9 tail beasts actually come from the 10-tailed.. It's truly an entertaining manga..\nOverall - 10\n        "},

This is not a simple story.  It does not just contain just a single element.  The substance of this story is made of so much.  Their is alot of Action,  some Romance, lots of comedy, and so many others.  The story is just an amazing work.  This has to be one of the greatest stories of all time.  Ever.\nTheir is so many stories branched out everywhere coming from so many characters.  Also many of those stories link\n          \n        together, and create one amazing sensation when they intersect.  What I love about it is that Naruto is not just about Naruto.  Many of the characters have their moments in this manga.  Also because this story is about ninja their is alot of secrecy, and secret plots, or decieving plots, and alot of suprises, and their are alot of introductions to new missions.\nWhat the story is about.  It is about a boy named Naruto who grows up in a ninja world, and is shunned by everyone surrounding him.  Through his presseverence, and raw determination of obtaining his dream of becoming Hokage (The leader of his village), he begins to obtain the loyalties and friendships of many ninja.  The proccess of Naruto growing up is not an easy task.  In himself he contains a demon that was sealed into him by the previous Hokage in order to save the village.  He encounters many villians, and many obstacles he must overcome, in the universe of ninja.\nArt:  The art is AMAZING.  The art concepts in them selves are phenominal.  The character design is second to none.  The backrounds are contain so many different enviroments, and are masterfully done.  Also the transitions are so fluid.  Their is not  a single moment where I had to re-look at a page to understand what is going on.\nCharacter:  The Characters are AMAZING.  The amount of characters in this manga is amazing.  Their are so many.  And the similarities, and differences between them are so distinct.  This manga contains so many personalities.  It also has to what I believe the some of the best interpritations of what heros, villians, good guys, clutzes, strong women, and so many others should be.  Here is a list of what they are.\nUltimate Hero:  Naruto\nUltimate Bad Ass: Sasuke\nUltimate Villian:  Ma?a?a\nUltimate Cool Guy: Kakashi\nUltimate Legend:  Yondy\nUltimate Character Ever:  Itachi\nand Their are so many other ultimate characters that I left out, like Shikamaru, Jiriaya, Zabuza.  The characters are just amazing\nI can explain so much on how awsome each charater is made to be, and give so much detials on them, and yet be unable to answer so many questions. \nThis manga contains so many awsome and new inventive elements in it that diversefy it so much from other mangas, stories, anything.  And it also contians other many great elements from other mangas, and stories, and everything.  To me this has to be in the top 5 Ultimate Manga.  One of the greatest ever.\nScrew you guys im helpful\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=120,  ["text"]="           \n    Naruto is an excellent series about a 12 year old boy named Naruto Uzumaki who wants to become Hokage, leader of Konaha the Hidden Leaf Village of the Fire Country. The problem for him is, first he is horrible at ninjutsu and has failed the final exam at the ninja academy 3 times which if was not bad enough he is the Jinchuriki (a human vessel), of the Kyuubi, the 9 tails demon fox, that was sealed within him at birth by Minato, who was the 4th Hokage. For this reason he is tormented by the villagers, his classmates and even his teachers. They blame\n          \n        him for the death of their beloved leader. Things change for him in the first episode after Iruka, his sensei at the ninja academy, saves him and shows that he is cared about, and to top things off makes him a ninja.\nThe first thing I'll mention first about the series is, that its long and feels like it takes forever to answer questions at times. But on a good note, at least unlike some series the many posed questions throughout the series get answered. \nThere's nothing I hate more in a series than when the characters obtain powers with no explanation. At least you do not have to worry about this in Naruto cause the powers of ninjutsu are almost all explained in the 1st season except for change of nature and elements which is focused on in the 3rd season of part 2.\nCharacter development is great for all the main and main-supports in part 1, but in part 2 it mainly focuses on Naruto and his rival and best friend  Sasuke Uchiha. In my opinion I like this in one way cause to be truthfully honest some characters are boring and will never go anywhere. But on the other side some characters I really enjoyed from part one like Neji, Lee, and Chouji are rarely shown in part 2.\nThe artwork is fairly good. It definately gets better throughout the chapters. Though sometimes I find that later on in part 2 there seems to be some inconsistency problems. The excellent writing though takes this problem away.\nOverall I really enjoy reading this manga and would reccommend it to anyone whether you're not into the genre of action or fantasy or even if you're not into manga/anime all that much, because the messages within the story are so inspirational and you can really connect with the characters.  \nI overall would give this a 9/10.\n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=119,  ["text"]="           \n    Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.\nComing up with precise numbers to essentially give a value to a series that spans 700 chapters and well over a decade in production is not an easy thing. Much has changed over the years of publication, but I guess overall I would give the series a \"very good\".\nLike many other people, the Naruto anime was my introduction to the world of anime--something that literally changed the course of my life. The storyline of a young boy who had the courage (or more like the gall) to always stay confident and continue smiling despite growing up alone in a\n          \n        community that openly detested him is heartwarming to say the least. I liked that the series also introduced a wide range of characters--Kishimoto really succeeded in creating not just a village, but an entire world within his story.\nSTORYLINE:\nAs one would expect from a 700 chapter-long series, the series has its highs and its lows. For me, the peak was pretty early in the series throughout the Chunin exam arc, so it was a little bit of a disappointment that the series never really made it back to that high later on. Then again, the main trio of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke weren't nearly my favourite characters, so maybe my problem was that I didn't care about the people who mattered the most. Having said that, the fact that I was still interested enough to keep reading should speak for the story's quality. The chapters are relatively short (compared to monthly publications) and almost all of them end with some sort of cliffhanger, so I ended up stopping at points to save up for longer reading sessions.\nCHARACTERS:\nOn the topic of characters, I would have to argue that they are far from perfect. He did a good job of creating diversity in his characters and strong, complex personalities in many, but there were many characters who were sadly quite shafted and remained static throughout the series (I'm looking at Tenten and Shino). I wouldn't say that ALL his female characters are always weak, submissive and useless, but the series is a far cry from gender-equal. In part I can accept that this is because the manga's intended audience was for young boys who probably don't care if there's gender equality and all that stuff, but still.\nART:\nThe art... is good. It's definitely improved over time from both experience and technological advancements. I like many of the character designs and I like that they change as the characters mature. Personally I cared more for the social interactions within the story than the fight scenes, so sometimes some chapters of endless fighting were a bit difficult to follow/envision.\nENDING: (contains no specific spoilers, but discussion of overall flow)\nPersonally I did not like the ending, but I didn't HATE it. When the whole shinobi war started to drag out and literally EVERY CHARACTER WHO WAS EVER SLIGHTLY SIGNIFICANT made an appearance even if they had to defy reality (AND DEATH) to do so, I started looking forward to an end. The ending I got wasn't everything that I wanted, but it was an end. I'm happy that Kishimoto had the guts to see his story to completion including establishing finality with his character relationships (rather than leaving things ambiguous and inconclusive as is the style of most Shonen manga), but I also feel like he crossed the line and forced the pairings too far. I'm also not a fan of the introduction of children (AT ALL.) to imply the relationship of the parents, but at the same time I can't imagine Kishimoto showing us the depth of their relationships in any other way (hand holding, hugging, walking together maybe. Beyond that? No, not even kissing). Regardless, I felt like I had to read the final chapter because \"OCD, I have to finish this!\" (not to mention my OTP), and did so knowing that I probably wouldn't like much of it. If you don't care for pairings or mentions of children, I'd recommend stopping at 699.\nSo there you have it, my review that took me 40 mins. I expect most people will have already tl;dr and left this massive review, but if you're still reading it, thank you =) It's a review for myself as much as for anyone else anyways because... it's done. It's over. Naruto's ended. My childhood just ended with it. Huh.\nTime to move on with life and keep telling myself that I will NOT be reading the sequel about the children. I won't do it. I won't. (...The lies... I'll cave, I know it. >_>)\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=117,  ["text"]="              \n    *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\nOkay. To start off, I've been a fan of Naruto, since I was in 5th grade. I graduated in 2013(I graduated early. I was part of the Class of 2014 group). Therefore, I've been around for most of the story, and--I can honestly say--I'm happy for it to have been a part of my life. Naruto's determination to never give up, Sasuke's determination to make things right, and Sakura's determination for love, all turned me into who I am today. I know, it sounds cheesy, but it's true. It has helped me grow as a person, and I am truly thankful for\n          \n        Kishimoto, for drawing such a wonderful manga.\nOkay, the story. It had it's ups and downs(mostly during the final Fourth Shinobi World War arc), but overall, it was enjoyable. Some plot holes exist, such as the Sage of Six Paths' brother, Hamura. The story never answered the question of what became of him, after they sealed their mother, which bothered me. Other than those, the other \"plot-holes,\" were soon explained, and resolved. The story is also known for it's huge plot-twists, and wtf moments. Sasuke and Itachi are prime examples of that.\nAs for the art, it was...well...choppy at the beginning, but it slowly began to evolve, and began to look more like the anime. I love the art, and it always makes me a little jealous, since it is really hard for me to draw that well. \nThe characters are pretty good, though they can be annoying. Sakura(yes, I realize this will generate a lot of hate), is a prime example of that. She was useless during Part I, only being useful during the Chunin Exams' fights against the Sound ninja, and Ino. During Part II, however, she slowly began to bud into a great character, even becoming kick-ass when fighting against Sasori. She had seemingly shed her school-girl crush on Sasuke, and was able to become powerful. But, once they met Sasuke again, everything went back to normal. She was crushing on him once again, and went back to her heroine-support-role. Even after everything(I won't spoil), she still loves him. Hinata, with Naruto, as much as I like her, is another example of this. \nOverall, it's pretty good. If you like long, shonen manga, I'd suggest checking it out. :) It also has a host of games for GameCube, Gameboy, DS, 3DS, PS2, PS3, PSP, and Wii, and also has a bunch of movies out. Shippuden movie 7, \"The Last,\" is coming out this year, and is canon to the storyline. \n        "},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=114,  ["text"]="            \n    I'm going to be honest, no matter how it would of ended I would probably still have given it a 10. Naruto was one of the manga I grew up with (literally, I was a kid when he was a kid. Now we're both older). I enjoyed Naruto himself developing and learning new jutsus along with his style of combat and way of thinking. He went from being the number 1 hyperactive knucklehead ninja to someone everyone in the village(and soon world) learns to respect. \nAside from the main character himself, the manga greatly focuses on character development from both sides of each battle. I'll\n          \n        gladly give credit to Kishimoto for setting the tension so well for the last battle and after seeing the outcome, I can understand the ending.\nYes I will admit that the story did decrease in value some but I think some of that is physiological (the more we get into something to better we want it to be and there is a point where it can't get any better). Some of the plot-holes near the end were annoying but didn't impact my view on Naruto too much. \nI give the story an 8 for always getting me hyped for each battle. \nI give the art a 7 (it was better at the start i will say)\nCharacter will get a 7 (the plot twists were great: Sasuke, Tobi, ect) but some were a little too predictable. \nEnjoyment will be a 10 no matter what. No matter what I thought of Naruto at the time of each release I was always excited to save my money to get the newest book/wait for each chapter to come out online. \nOverall Naruto gets a 10 for growing up along with me.\nBelieve it! \n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=113,  ["text"]="          \n    Naruto gets a bad rap a lot just because it's popular but I've loved it. The story is inthralling and the characters are entertaining, even though I really don't like some of them. But that's what makes it great! I love some characters and \"dislike\" others! That's a great thing in a manga when you come to have distinct feelings to each character. As you read, the story will have its ups and downs but don't give up! It keeps getting better and it'll have you guessing around every chapter turn!\n"},
		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=109,  ["text"]="               \n    It’s me again. It has been a while since my last review. Naruto, if you even don’t know about this one then go home. I’m sure you’re already drunk. Kidding. But, seriously, I so doubt you have watched anime if you never look at this story. So, today I wanna tell you about one of the most precious Japanese manga ever.\nBasically, Naruto is inspired by previous legend battle manga titled Dragon Ball. The word of \"inspired\" really has different meaning with \"plagiarism\". Both of them are about copying something but \"inspired\" is original. Hey, that’s obvious. Fine, it means you have understood it well. I\n          \n        should say it since if you’re Naruto’s big fans like me I’m certain occasionally you have forgotten that this story is based on Dragon Ball. Why? Because it’s hundred times greater than its predecessor I think.\nI would like to start some sort synopsis here. It’s all about the story of ninja. Surprisingly, Naruto begins in a normal mainstream story. Naruto’s complete name is Uzumaki Naruto. He lives in a certain ninja village named Konoha-gakurei. It means \"hidden leaf village\" in English. It’s located in fire nations. In Naruto’s era, ninjas aren’t longer grouped based on family names. They already formed organizations and stay there like the other normal people. They have family, house, school, job, and friend like ordinary villagers. There’s no secret identity anymore in ninja’s life. Even they don’t need a mask and they also can walk freely in vicinity of village everyday as they want. Ninjas use a specific power named Chakra. Using chakra allows you to do something incredible like walking on the wall or water, detecting someone’s presence, healing some wounds, even annihilating enemy. Chakra users are categorized into several levels. The first stage of chakra user, usually beginner ninja, is named Genin. The second stage is named Chuunin. If they want to be a chuunin they have to pass an extreme hard exam. But sometimes there are talented kid ninjas that be able to surpass the exam easily even they can beat chuunin effortlessly. Ninja’s villages develop their economic growth with funds from several jobs called mission. Ninjas have to accomplish certain missions which are given by someone or something and then earn money. Ninja’s missions are also leveled into some stages which start from easy until hard and very hard. During the missions, ninjas usually have confrontation with the other ninjas from different village. And they also often lose their soul because of that. Village’s head ninja is called bla-bla-bla-\"kage\". I mean, it depends on where the nation is. There are five nations. Each nation is named based on the style of chakra. There are only five kinds of chakra : fire \"katon\", water \"suiton\", earth \"doton\", wind \"fuuton\" and the last one is thunder \"ration\". But high level chakra users can combine several kinds of those cahakras and then use them at the same time. They’re called \"kekkai genkai\" It produces new techniques like wood style \"mokuton\", particle style \"jinton\", etc.\nSo, when Naruto was a child he was a troublesome kid. He did a lot of prank to other villager. Many villagers hated him because of his attitude. Actually the cause of villager hatred isn’t merely about his impolite behavior. The Demon Fox a.k.a Kyuubi. Kyuubi is one of the nine tailed beast \"bijuu\" that had served a lot of disaster in the village for long time ago. He killed many villager and Konoha’s ninja who wanted to stop him. Tailed beast is like sacred animal which could produce a huge mass of chakra. It inhuman power can annihilate a city only in a sec. Several ninjas managed a plan for muffling bijuu’s anger. They developed a special ninja technique which can seal these mystical beasts into human body. Humans who have sealed bijuu in their body are named Jiinchuriki. They can obtain an infinity amount of cakra because of the sealed bijuu. Naruto is the Jinchuriki of the strongest bijuu, Kyuubi. Naruto always has a dream to be a Hokage. He will do everything to keep his dream. But unfortunately he is slow to learn about some ninja techniques. He had a rival named Sasuke Uchiha who always pisses him off. Sasuke is the genius pupil. He is from elegant family which ever exist in Konoha called Uchiha. Every Uchiha inherits a rare ninja ocular technique Sharigan. With this Sharigan things they can perform godlike ninja techniques like copying an opponent tech, identifying enemy movement and making an illusion \"genjutsu\". Sasuke is the kind of person who’s always seeking for greater and greater power. He never satisfies about what he has had. Sasuke betrayed his village and then decided to follow previous Konoha’s traitor ninja named Orochimaru. In fact, Naruto was being chased by a dark ninja organization named Akatsuki. Their objective was collecting all of bijuu’s power. He knew that he was targeted. But Naruto never holds back. He and other Konoha’s ninja were ready to hunt Akatsuki. That was not easy because all of Akatsuki member have demonic power and forbidden ninja technique. Naruto lost several comrades during the battle with Akatsuki.\nMy opinion :\nPlus :\n-	This story serves two big moral values. There are determination and idealism. To be honest, Naruto is the kind of hopeless person who is slow to learn about something. He’s really different with Sasuke who can repeat a lesson flawlessly with a single glance. But that weakness can be overcome with determination and keep trying. There was an arc when he almost died because of training methods. In the end he can’t master it correctly but he found other method to use that tech. Well, \"Going my way\" is the one of Naruto’s motto. Naruto is a person with high idealism too. You know, when people have idealism, usually their idealism will be getting faded if they face a huge hindrance. They will start thinking that their first goal is impossible. But Naruto is not like that. He faced a painful fact that his beloved person was killed. He also knew the gap between his power and enemy’s power is intolerable. Instead of giving up, he just kept struggling with a smile in his face. His idealism will never be faded.\n-	Just an ordinary people. Seriously, I’m getting tired when I read a manga which serves a perfect protagonist. They always have a victory in every match. Even they often defeat their enemy with a single blow. But for Naruto, being defeated by enemy is a common. I counted there were several battles when Naruto should totally accept his loses. One of them is first battle with Sasuke. Sasuke might kill him whenever he wants.\n-	Epic drama. This is story with the best drama I ever read. Naruto isn’t only hero here. Several characters in this story are even more heroic than Naruto, according to me. Say it like Uchiha Itachi, Namikaze Minato, Jiraya, etc. Their life, dream, purpose are wonderful. You should find it by yourself. I don’t wanna make some spoiler here.\n-	Badass villain. Ow men, I have already seen a bunch of villain at the other manga. But the guy named Tobi in this story is special. Tobi is skillful in both of techniques and strategies. He is the biggest troller in the world of manga. You should check that out. He said \"Hey world…I’m Madara….I’m alive…Hello…Greeting from hell\". And several moments after that \"Problem world? You got trolled…Madara is already being a zombie there…\". Owww, that was the most epic troll. And you also have to see someone named Madara Uchiha. Here  is little bit his ability for you all : he can alter a map.\n-	Unpredictable stories. The best story is story that you can’t predict about the problem solving when the climax is happening. It makes you wanna continue reading it more and more even though you need to wait every week.\nMinus :\nNo minus in this story. It is masterpiece. It is legend. It is fabulous. It is a story that appears once in a hundred year. I give 10 without any hesitating."},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=109,  ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is finally over, its had its ups and downs, including a very long list of problems, but is it bad or good? In a sense, it's kind of both:\nNaruto had undoubtedly had a great influence on the manga culture, helping spread anime/manga to the west after Dragonball Z and setting up a new generation of readers. 15 years later, it finally finishes. But I've noticed one trend I wished would end already, is it bad because it's too popular? Its a shounen on shounen jump that practically uses shounen elements religiously. Being one of the \"big three\" its going to get flak for being\n          \n        \"too popular\" or \"overhyped\", but I will ignore that and look at it more objectively, or at least, as much as possible. \nThe Story - 5 \nThe story, progressively, started getting worse. There was too much set up with little to forced pay off. Many plot elements got changed over time, such as Shikaku being the soul of a priest rather than the one tail, so nearing the end of the series, these inconsistencies made the story very hard to follow. The rapid change of main villains also didn't help and ruined the flow of the series. However, in certain arcs, when the pace and flow of the series really got rolling, things were good; but these moments, especially in Shippuden, were easily broken down by flashbacks and exposition periods. There may have been good moments, but the constant changing of lore and plot devices, really screwed the overarching story. Although the ending was satisfactory, to a degree. \nArt- 7\nThe art is probably the best thing going for the series...kind of. There are some inconsistencies; a lot of times, especially late in the series, there are noticeable errors and improper face designs. But the improvement of the art style, when done right, is noteworthy, but stagnated quite a bit about half-way through Shippuden.\nCharacters-4\nThis was probably Kishimoto's weakest point, once again, especially in Shippuden. The characters were set up really well in the original series, somethng I noticed when re-reading. They all had their relationships and pasts integrated very well in to their character and the growth was apparent. But, trying to make them mature, was very hard for Kishimoto, especially female characters. Not only that, but with such great build-up, Kishimoto also wasted characters in Shippuden, to the point where no one else mattered besides Naruto and Sasuke. There are a few noteworthy characters: Jiraya, Tsunade, Itachi, Pain, Gaara, etc. but most others were just shounen tropes personified in Shippuden, even more so than in the original series. This also leads to his rushed villains problem and how the main characters change depending on which one their fighting. It's kind of disappointing, because Kishimoto is very good at setting things up but just as infamous in failing the execution. \nEnjoyment-8\nThis is where Naruto shines the most, but only to those knowing what they're getting into. If you know this is a shounen, especially one in Weekly Shounen Jump, then you better expect friendship power-ups and believe in yourself's galore. But just because these elements have been overdone, does not immediately make them bad. You take what you get, this series wasn't fooling you, it practically advertised it. In terms of generating hype for battles, well most of them, Kishimoto is not so bad. Like I said earlier, although there are flashbacks and calm periods, when the pacing gets going, so does the hype. The one thing that many have a problem is that it changed styles and themes when transitioning to Shippuden. It went from being about ninjas to being more about Jesus saving the world things. But even that isn't too bad. They give a decent excuse for it and all things considered, a mangaka can interpret things however they please. If you don't like shounens like this, you'll probably not enjoy this series so well, but I have to say, you NEED to know what you're getting yourself into. I do not recommend it to anyone looking for something different in a shounen, such as FMA or Trigun, this is the Dragonball Z type of shounen with higher trope power levels, and this is what you should be expecting going in. \nOverall - 6.5\nWhen I first read Naruto and got to Shippuden, I actually dropped the series. I didn't give it a chance. I also kinda became a Naruto hater, mainly because I so loved One Piece. But after a friend, a Naruto-fanboy, begged me to give it a chance. I took it. Of course, throughout the experience, I noticed all the problems all the things and I constantly complained..yet I still continued to read. It was something about it that kept me hooked and I didn't know why. But one day, upon re-reading the series again, I had a realization. It was interesting. I wanted to see what Kishimoto would do, I wanted to see his silly plot changes, his uber-shounen-believe it fights, I wanted to complain about his mistakes, hating on Sakura or other characters, the world, the jutsus and different forms. It had a certain charm that made you want to criticize it, dared you to. If you've read a shounen it practically begged you to compare it. This perplexed me in such a way I didn't understand. The series is a mess, but a fun mess for any shounen reader. That is why if you read shounens, you should give Naruto a try. But if you're looking for a masterpiece or something great, look elsewhere. \n        "},

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=104,  ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is currently one of the most popular shounen beasts in the manga market today, and since I have verbally abused its companions I believe its Naruto's turn to be reviwed.\nSTORY: 6/10\nI'm not going to pretend that anybody reading this review doesn't already know the basic story of Naruto so no summary this time. The length is a turn off. Some of the fights tend to drag on a little bit further then what seems realalistic. I call this the Bleach effect. While the fights in Naruto don't drag on nearly as long as the Bleach fights, they do show the symptoms. The plot is\n          \n        extremely standard with a fair amount of plot twists thrown in here and there. It just barely crawls out of mediocrity.\nART: 9/10\nIt has the same quality of art as One Piece without the absurdly stupid looking designs. Backgrounds exist in Naruto so its mountains better than Bleach's sorry excuse for art. There is a large amount of detail put into almost every aspect of every panel. it truely is something to marvel at, at times. Although i have caught a few absolutely terrible backgrounds thrown in there. I mean a 4 year old could litteraly draw them. Heck the mangaka of Bleach could probably draw them...nah, thats unfair to the 4 year olds. But there have only been one or two random terrible backgrounds, and overall the art is simply great.\nCHARACTER: 8/10\nTo start off there are about fifty of them, maybe more. They all have names, faces, most have a back story (tenten?), and they're all uniquely drawn. I do hate a large amount of the characters, and characters would recieve a fairly low grade if it wasn't for Shikimaru. He is like a genious gem in a sea of stupid coal. I have also found out, that Tenten has become one of my favorite characters. Why? you ask. Well, she is so obviously hated by the mangaka. She fought two times. In her first fight she got knocked unconcious before she could even touch her opponent. And her second fight was a draw...because she was fighting a clone of herself. She is halariously left out of every major event that ever happens. Hell, its possible she could have been dead for the past 100 chapters, and the other characters didn't even notice. She contributes nothing to the characters, but i just thought i would mention her because it entertains me.\n*cough* Back on track. Shikimaru alone, saves the characters from getting a failing grade. Shikimaru puts the characters on his back and wins them an 8. Good job Shikimaru. Now go teach Tenten how to make cookies. Maybe then she'll  be a bit more useful.\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\nAside from the enjoyment i get from mocking Tenten, the fights are actually pretty well done...most of the time. Recently they've begun to show signs of the Bleach effect. The first half was all solid fight scenes all the time. But I think when Shippuuden started Bleach became contagious, and Naruto caught some of the bad. It's a good thing Shikimaru has some really good fight scenes (Zombie v Shikimaru = smile), and once again he saves the enjoyment from getting a lower score then it would have without him. So for enjoyment i give Shikimaru a 9. You can give that to your friends Shikimaru.\nOVERALL: 8/10\nA meh story, great art, bad charact-SHIKIMARU, and Decent enjo-SHIKIMARU!!!, gives Naruto an okay 6...but Shikimaru alone boots the manga to an 8! woah. First time i've ever done that. If this manga was called Shikimaru, and was focused on Shikimaru all the time, it would probably be even higher, but sadly Naruto is the main character in Naruto so its an 8. \n*bites cookie* GAH! GO TO HELL TENTEN, YOU BURNT MY COOKIES!!!\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=102,  ["text"]="          \n    I'm going to say it: this manga is bad. Shots fired. I'm undoubtedly a minority, seeing as how most people enjoy Naruto a lot, but I stand firmly by my opinion. Let's start from the beginning.\nSurprisingly enough, the manga starts out very good. It has an interesting set of characters (with the exception of Sasuke), mixes comedy and drama well, and has an enticing storyline. This manga truly had a lot of potential. This all applies for the first part of the manga. Afterwards, it falls flat on it's a$$. Naruto, perfectly demonstrates the problem with manga that overstay their welcome. It starts resorting to\n          \n        clichéd villains, simplified characters, weak motivation and over-the-top action. What happened? I think the answer is simple: it got crushed under it's own weight. It became too big to handle. Naruto tried to expand it's world but the sheer size of it all became it's own cause for mediocrity. But what really suffered the most was the characters:\nSPOILER.\nNaruto, who was originally a likable kid, misunderstood by society becomes an obnoxious, preachy brat who grows into a sort of messiah. Gaara, who was one of the most complex and interesting characters in the manga became a bland clone of Sasuke (who in turn became even more bland and pathetic). Kakashi, who was an interesting teacher and badass became a mopey idiot guilt-tripped by Obito. Madara and Obito are the worst, following some half-a$$ed idea that the world sucks just because some person they were close too died. It's not like death happens or anything. But I think the worst part of the manga is the preaching they do while they fight, especially between Naruto/Kakashi and Obito/Madara. It's basically \"This world sucks and I hate everything\" - \"No, it doesn't\" - \"Yes it does, you'll think like me in the future\" - \"No, because I have FRIENDS \n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=99,   ["text"]="             \n    Naruto was the first manga I read and I took to it instantly. The great thing about Naruto is that everyone has a reason for what they do. There is a background story; an explanation for why every character is acting the way he is. This is what is so unique about Naruto: it blurs the distinction between a protagonist: always the ideal person doing things for the good of all; and the antagonist: who enjoys doing bad things just for the fun of it. You feel pity and sympathy even for the antagonists and can relate with them.\nSo moving on to the ratings\nStory: The\n          \n        story moves along and develops quite well. The only problem is the length of the story. There are also lots of twists and turns and it never really leaves you bored.\nArt: Nothing to complain about. The characters are well drawn and one can clearly understand what is going on even during fights.\nCharacter: This is where Naruto really shines. As I said above the characters are really well developed and almost each of them have a solid background story, which explains pretty much how the character is and why. Also, the reactions of the characters and the way they evolve through the series is a treat to watch. It deserves more than 10/10 in this regard.\nEnjoyment: There is a lot of enjoyment and at the same time many things that one can learn from the characters: Naruto's never-say-die attitude for one thing, and there are many more. At the same time, there is no place where one may feel bored. The end of almost every chapter leaves you gasping.\nWhat I liked about it:\n- The portrayal of the characters\n-  The really strategic and tactical battles (especially the ones of Shikamaru): Almost all fights are decided by the brain as much as by brawn. \n- The storyline.\nWhat I did not like:\n- A bit long winded.\n-The background stories of characters and flashbacks can get a bit repetitive.\n        "},

		{["score"]=10, ["helpful"]=94,   ["text"]="               \n    I gotta say, I've been a fan of ninjas for a really long time.  When I stumbled on Naruto I was extremely happy.  This is one of those stories that develops over the course of many many issues.  So if you're interested, make sure you've got the time (617 manga issues currently).\nSummary: It's about a boy who is shunned by society and is trying to find his place in the ninja world.  It's about his struggles and triumphs in his journey to \"make everyone acknowledge him\".  Through the course of his journey he learns about life, love, and pain, but\n          \n        most of all, friendship.\nArt: The artwork is simply amazing. His style really gets you involved in the action in just the right ways.  I love the way action is portrayed, built up, and executed.  The pictures are so well drawn that many have taken to coloring them for the www in high res, beautiful pictures.\nCharacter: The depth of each character is so well thought out.  You really don't understand until you watch a rather large chunk of the show, and, other than the many filler episodes in season 1, it moves at a respectable rate with good development in each episode for at least one of the cast.\nEnjoyment: I cant begin to describe how awesome this will be for ninja fans.  The jutsu are fun, the combat is fun, the humor is great.  There are very few episodes or issues read that did not have me feeling the emotion or laughing at something that happened.  They did happen, but those usually were setting up a necessary situation for the next issues. \nOverall: Certainly you probably read what you expected from someone who gave it all 10's, however I hope that I've been able to give you reasons for each of my ratings while also giving you a glimpse of why I thought as much.  I tried not to be too much of a fan-boy when writing this.  I feel that it's a jewel and if you have the time, a real treat to watch. \nEnjoy!\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=87,   ["text"]="           \n    As Naruto as ended, I have decided to give my final thoughts on it before I try to move on. There have been minor flaws throughout this series, not just in the war arc. I actually enjoyed the war arc the most out of all the other arcs. I did find the pacing horrible a few chapters after obitos big reveal. Apart from that I will analysis this series from the beginning to the end and give my opinion on it. \nI started reading or watching this manga/anime way back in 2010. For me it was literally the best anime/manga ever. Especially what Kishimoto did\n          \n        to make his characters stand out (especially Naruto and Sasuke). Every character throughout this series has some sort of development and even then I learnt to sympathize with these characters. The first time I watched this anime I immediately fell in love with it. It dragged me in with Naruto's character and made me hate sasuke's character. In all honesty, I found part one (before the timeskip) before the massive sasuke vs Naruto fight to be completely childish, but I saw it as a means to help us gain a connection with various characters. What separates Naruto from other long running series however is the talking to the villain to see what motivates them to perform such schemes. There where times I liked the method, but times I didn't. However, this manga has taught me that sometimes a villain will have some motivation that caused them to kill or do evil deeds in general.\nNaruto is all about some underdog kid who wanted to be acknowledged by everyone in his village and to become hokage. What inspires me about this kid is that no matter how much shit he was given, he never went rogue. Instead he just kept trying. Eventually getting the village and the world to acknowledge him. \nWhat I like about kishimoto is that he is more to the point and does not drag his arcs if compared to other anime. He does have that flashback flaw, but I guess that would only apply to the scenes that repeat themselves over and over. I like the way that every villain we encounter is someone that we can understand, not to mention we can also get what caused them to become evil. This manga as also brought me to tears several times, however the anime seems to go over and beyond and make me understand the characters better. Seeing minato and kushina, seeing the deaths of jiraiya, zabuza, neji, the third hokage and even pein where tear jerking. I was not a big fan of obito in the manga, but the anime literally gives him some justice.\nIn this series, I'd say that we have a range of understandable characters. I do hate sakura out these characters merely because of her attachment to sasuke and the fact that this series has ended and kakashi still has his bloody mask on his face LOL. Naruto never giving up is what motivates me and Sasuke not understanding Naruto until the last few chapters. Even after all he has done, I guess I can understand why he turned out like this.sometimes I think kishimoto should have expanded further on konoha 11, but I guess he has written about them enough. \nThe art is beautiful and literally is the best out of the three. Okay maybe I am over exaggerating because bleach is pretty good. Naruto is detailed and the art helps me understand the characters a bit more. After 700 chapters, I literally felt torn apart at this manga's ending. The ups where Naruto fulfilling his goals and the downs where the damned pairings. Bloody hell, I did not gt the choji pairing and that sai pairing, but I guess that is kishimoto's weakness in the manga. \nOverall, I love this manga. What it has done for me and how it has improved my life is because of the way it was written. This series will always be my favorite long running series even though it has its flaws. \n        "},

I've fallen a bit behind in the chapters but I still think it's a really good shounen manga.  I do think it was much stronger in the first 15 volumes or so with Naruto and his classmates training to take the entrance exam and all those friendships and fighting skills that are forged then.  Vols 3-4 with the Haku arc actually made me cry ;__;.  And I don't care what anyone says about him being a crazy person running around in a prison suit, I LOVE Naruto.

I'm a big fan of Kakashi, Rock Lee, Shikamaru, Gaara, etc.  The fight scenes can go on and on for volumes which may be a turn off for some people but Kishimoto can really draw those fight scenes and most of them are enjoyable (especially in the earlier volumes where they actually had really good fights rather than people just owning each other).  \nStill great.  9/10!\n        "},

		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=77,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is one of the three shonen titans. And one of the two that failed miserably. The story (if there is any at all) revolves around an annoying young pariah who dreams of being the most powerful (and most respected) man in the village: the Kage. Now, for reasons unknown to the readers, Naruto wants to become the leader of his village and its people even though they treated him as if he were less than a dog.\nThe art was fairly decent in the beginning, but as time passed by, it got progressively worse and more confusing. In addition, it seems that the mangaka is\n          \n        losing interest in this story, so the art has become less refined and more simple.\nThe characters and their development are terrible. S-rank ninjas (the strongest) seemingly lose to genins (bottom of the ladder ninjas). To top it all off, each character is stupidly annoying and has a repertoire of spells reaching approximately 3. Inconsistency seems to be the mangaka's favorite plot device as he literally destroys everyone and rebirths them into some new shape.\nHowever, I do get some kicks from this story. I believe that the only reason I've been reading it for the past several months is to see how much !@#$ the mangaka can pull out of his arse.\nI advise reading until the end of the Zab arc, or, if your interest has been piqued after reading said arc, until the end of the Sound5 arc.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=76,   ["text"]="          \n    *Disclaimer: Before I get on with my review, let me first say, that I never finished reading this series. SPOILERS BELOW. The TLDR is at the bottom.*\n\nNow there will be no confusion over my perspective as a reader. I tried reading Naruto. I got about two thirds of the way through the series before I lost interest completely. Still, I struggled on for another couple dozen chapters before my efforts as a fan, and a completionist, were not enough to get me through the rest. Ultimately, I gave up. At the time, the manga was still ongoing, and with no end in sight, I\n          \n        was completely unmotivated to finish a shonen that had disappointed me so much. \nSo, why am I writing this review? I never finished the series, I don't have a complete perspective on this shonen as a whole. I don't know everything there is to know about the Naruto universe. I don't know all the characters or plot twists. I know that. I can't offer anyone a review based on that information. What I can offer, however, is my perspective as a fan and long-time reader, as well as my reasons for abandoning the series so late in its run.\nIf you're a reader and lover of manga, Naruto is absolutely worth the time and effort to read. At least, that's what I used to tell people. I still feel that way, to a degree. If you're confused, that's completely understandable. If you're not, you've likely read the series, at least partially. Allow me to explain. \nNaruto is broken into two parts: Naruto (or Naruto Beginnings) and Naruto (Shippuuden). Why? Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto's creator and mangaka) started the series as a light-hearted, action-packed shonen aimed towards a younger audience. Naruto, the character, starts out as a twelve-year-old shinobi (ninja). The reader follows Naruto and his ninja team as they overcome trials as they discover their hidden power as young ninja. The beginnings of Naruto are summarized in 27 volumes, and conclude nicely as its own story. \nAfter Naruto beginnings, there is a significant time jump into Shippuuden. Naruto and his peers have aged three years, and the series as a whole has a darker atmosphere. Within the first arc, Kishimoto kills off several characters, some minor, some major. This theme continues throughout the series. Shippuuden starts out promising. It promises maturity, loss, character development, suffering, difficult choices and hard goodbyes. It does a good job of continuing and delivering on this promise for the next couple arcs. Naruto remains interesting and coherent for many chapters.\nThat being said, there was definitely something missing. In Naruto (beginnings), the story's young protagonist has a clear goal: to become Hokage (the ninja leader of his village) and be respected and loved by his community. The story is simple and fluid. It offers development and insight into the lives of many characters and it shows their separate struggles and desires. There are believable and achievable landmarks within the first block (the Chunin exams, the five man squad, training with Jiraiya, etc). Everything makes sense and feels natural. The same cannot be said of Shippuuden. \nAfter the time jump, Naruto's goals are blurry. It's unclear to the reader if his goal is to become Hokage, or not. He becomes obsessed with finding Sasuke (his former teammate who disappeared at the end of Naruto beginnings). This shift in his goals seem less organic than I would have liked. Naruto makes poor decisions, and allowances in areas where Sasuke is concerned. Other characters also, without motivation, do the same. Characters that had been shown in the beginning of the story to be level-headed, morally guided, logical characters, ignore Sasuke's crimes (which include sabotage, assault, thievery, terrorism and even murder). \nAt this point in the series, it becomes apparent that the story's focus is no longer what it used to be. The story's focus is entirely centered on Sasuke's redemption. This is where the manga started to lose me. For me, it was completely unbelievable that any character would be forgiven, especially by strangers, for the crimes Sasuke commits over the course of the series. Here, is where Kishimoto starts to have main character bias (a bias that authors and mangaka fall into that provides protection to a character, simply because they are a main character). \nFrom this point on, the manga loses its original charm. It loses its original simplicity. It loses its original focus. Now, that's not to say that characters and stories have to remain fixed. That's not to say that stories or characters have to keep their original goals. I understand growth is to be expected in any decent story. Characters change. Directions change. That's normal. What isn't normal, is for characters to do or act in ways that go against their development. When a character acts out of character to move the plot forward, the story loses its believability. In Shippuuden, characters slip constantly.\nI got through the first third or half of Shippuuden before I could no longer forgive its plot holes and tiresome character slips. I stopped reading at this point, and can now only comment on the series, from this point forward, as an outsider. Like I said earlier, I didn't finish. I didn't finish, but I did check in once in a while to see how the series was developing. I'd read a chapter here or there, and whenever I did, it would only confirm my disappointment. I had always hoped there would be a chapter so interesting, I'd be compelled to pick up the series from where I left off. \nThat never happened. Whenever I checked in, it was only a sad reminder of why I dropped the series in the first place. Naruto had turned into a collection of power-ups, end-game villains and explosions. It was suffering from all the shonen pitfalls imaginable. Character development was non-existent, and had been replaced with pointless, visually boring battles. I started wondering if Kishimoto was simply making it up as he went along. It certainly felt that way. I certainly didn't think it would end. So, when I had heard that it finally ended, I had to check in for a final time to say goodbye and give the manga I once loved, a last chance to draw me in.  \nIt would be an understatement to call the series' end \"disappointing\". Naruto ended in the messiest, laziest, most hurried (somehow) way imaginable. I won't go into any details, in case some of you are still interested in reading the series (I strongly caution against it). As endings go, it was almost insulting. As a former fan of the series, it felt like a huge insult to the time and energy I dedicated to Kishimoto as a storyteller. \nAny reader of this series, former or otherwise, will have to admit that the Naruto universe is devoid of relationship development in any way. Any development between any two characters is often done off-page. Masashi Kishimoto had even said in past interviews that he wasn't comfortable drawing or writing about romantic relationships. This is one of the major failings of the series. I don't believe for one second that an entire universe would remain platonic and sexless. This complaint is, however, a simple annoyance, rather than an outright write-off of the series as a whole. I can accept that a writer would wish to avoid focusing on romantic development. I can accept that a person would be uncomfortable writing romantic interactions. I can accept that the story is about friendship and personal growth, not romantic interest. I get that. \nAs a reader, I pretty much gave up on romantic development being a possibility within the story a long time ago. There was very little, if any, development on page for any characters. I had already come to terms with the probability of Naruto ending without any resolution in this regard. That's why I was completely shocked that the last chapter of Naruto (chapter 700) focused entirely on the aftermath of the off-page romantic development of Konaha's (Naruto's home village) ninja. \nKishimoto ended the series by indiscriminately pairing his characters together, without any development or chemistry at all. I would have accepted an ending that left the relationship development up to interpretation. I would have respected the ending, and Kishimoto more for an open-ended finale. Instead, he threw characters together for the sake of appeasing his fans. He went with popular pairings that had absolutely no chemistry or development whatsoever, simply to appeal to the crowd. I am convinced that he did this as a last-ditch effort to remain popular with the most number of people within his fan base as possible. This rushed, forced ending left me feeling what can only be described as \"anticipointment\":  disappointment from something you eagerly anticipated.\nWith that, this review, like Naruto, is finally over. I have nothing else to say about the series. \nTLDR:\nStory -3\nArt -6\nCharacter -3\nEnjoyment -4\nOverall -4\n"},

What really keeps you going is the development of the characters, and it is very fun to see how the characters slowly grow and get stronger.\nMost of the plot is action, but there is a comfortable amount of drama and a tiny bit of romance added in\n          \n        so that you can stay on your toes.  That fact proves that Naruto is not only the ideal manga for action-loving guys, but it is also a great pick for girls.\nOverall, Naruto is a fun, interesting manga that will make you laugh, cry, and sit on the edge of your seat, all in the same book.  Once you get going it is hard to stop, and if you don't like it at first, just keep going, because it does get better!

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=59,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is a work that creates a lot of hysteria both ways due to its popularity. Whether people like or dislike it, they all feel compelled to talk about it. While I think a lot of people can come to the casual, and really accurate conclusion, that the manga started out as a much more fun work than it has come to be, I do not think a lot of people understand exactly why, which is what I want to address. Some spoilers of course, since I cannot really talk about the problems of this manga without talking about Pain.\nI felt like this was an\n          \n        8/10 manga at the start (add in the 4/10 it has been for the last 200 chapters, and a 4/10). While there were MOUNDS of angst, a fairly typical \"training arc\" layout, and a fairly typical foundation for the type of cool characters (ninjas), there were a lot of positive factors that more than made up for any of those problems. Kakashi taunting his students with his erotic book and the exaggerated responses that come in return (ch.5 p.5) are a good example of the fun spirited nature at the beginning of this work. The aspiration that was evident for Naruto helped keep the story very lighthearted despite Naruto being a brat, Sasuke being a grim angsty boy, and Sakura being a typically feckless cling-on girl character. When you replace that aspiration with \"I have to save my friends! Everything is so terrible!\", the manga loses a certain amount of its fun spiritedness, and I think the people involved with making this never really thought that out properly.\nNow I am not saying the start was perfect, for instance the lack of backgrounds all over the place (just look at say practically any page in chapter 23), but the side characters all have real personalities, the powers are mostly very well thought out, and the battle action is very cool indeed. Things that were lost in the anime like how striking Naruto looks when the nine-tails starts taking control are completely impressive and one of the reasons that reading this manga was so fun. The tournament was completely mainline shounen battle manga fun, and while it is not the most original storyline or even action ever, it was just as fun as any of those has ever been, a definite high point for the manga. There are certainly still good storylines and fights afterward, for instance I would say the puppet master fight is a relative high point, but a lot of problems started to become endemic.\nI think it is pretty obvious that a lot of the reasons for the changes in Narutos were the trappings of its immense popularity. With pressure and popularity comes a need to make every character cooler, to appeal to broader audiences, and to simplify plot aspects. In this case it is also pretty evident that there became a real sense of needing to be taken seriously, so we get to slog through a lot of grim angst rather than fun spirited adventure or expressiveness, and it has been that way for something around 200 chapters. While there certainly are works that are grim and work, the people involved in Naruto unfortunately do not have the aptitude to write that sort of dialogue or draw that sort of art. As the villains had to become more powerful and the plot \"more epic\", the art simplified in shading and character forms, which has been a big disappointment for me. The overall construction of arcs weakened too, and the humor has been just basically completely lost (with the Bee and Naruto's interactions being a great example of just terribly executed gags). \nNone of the above was really enough of a breaking point for me to stop reading the manga, but Pain was. When you implement a plot copout like killing off a large portion of the characters that we are supposed to care about and then revive all of them, you have cheapened the plot in a way that a work can never really recover from. Pain's transformation to senseless hate to incredible generosity happens in such a short span of time that it is not really very compelling anyway. Even then I picked the manga back up, but what was enough to drop it for good was the recent spate of grim faced unhappiness (personified by Sai), overbold art style (a la Bleach too much ink), or bad attempts at introducing mind game oneupmanship (Danzou) wearing on me to the point that this manga just was not a fun read anymore. It has lost all the fun, and if you are attached enough to the characters then I guess it might still be worth a read, but I would honestly recommend that the end of the fights with Orochimaru is probably the best place to drop this manga if you start to feel like you have had enough. Feel free to stick with Naruto and Sakura trying to prove how adult they are while sobbing about Sasuke a lot though.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=54,   ["text"]="          \n    (May contain Spoilers) -----  IF Review is too long, skip to 'TLDR' at the bottom. \n\nNaruto one of the legendary BIG 3 of it's era ( one piece, bleach, naruto), obviously with better shounens such as kuroko no basuke, magi, jojo's bizzare adventures , attack on titan,  akame ga kill etc;\nThe KINGS of shounen weekly were soon to be surpassed with really 'One Piece' posing any real competition within the market. However, Naruto has definitely influenced millions of people globally and is arguably one of if not the most popular western shounen anime/manga in the history of it's conception. Which opened large\n          \n        windows of exposure for the anime/manga industry in general. \nRegardless of this fact, my criteria for what is good and bad follows the CORE PHILOSOPHY that must always be pursued when undergoing any objective analysis of any form of media as a GOLDEN RULE. This is: \nPopularity != Quality \nIf this rule did not apply, than by any logical standard Justin bieber would be considered one of the best artist's in the world. This obviously will never be true to anyone with ears but the example is there to establish my point as a CORE foundation within my criteria for analysis over any form media. \nWith that said, Naruto stems from the world of shounen orchestrated by the era of  >>Yu Yu Hakusho >>  hxh >>DBZ >> Naruto.  (Big 3 ).\nThe predefined parameters that exist within each of these  manga are ; \nProtagonist has goal ( hokage) >>> meets motivator ( rivalry) >>>(sasuke )>>> ( sole purpose of this device is to establish power levels and strength disparity) >>> meets antagonist ( OP ) >>> Protagonist gets the dog shit beaten out of him with the first couple of confrontations>>> enters  'tsuyoku naritai' phase ( I want to get stronger) >>>> Gains new ability ( usually out of the ass i.e deus ex machina) >>> Protagonist  beats antagonist >>> end of arc. \nThis is essentially the bread and butter of naruto except with a lot more plot holes, poor character development and execution. \nNow because I do not want this review to exceed more than 500,000 words listing and going in depth about each contradiction within this series, I'll instead underline the major flaws within this manga.\n1: Power levels within relation to context and timing\n2: Lack of character development \n3: And poor plot \n\nEg; This example ties in to both the 1st and 3rd flaw and we don't have to look too far for one, THE FIRST CHAPTER! Here the plot establishes Naruto as kid that isn't all that bright seeing as he has failed his graduation from the ninja academy due to not being able to perform the -- (bunshin no jutsu /clone technique) accurately as a final test  , thus not able to receive the head band which signifies that 'x' student has finally become a shinobi .\nHe has also experienced large psychological and emotional scars from the village due to the obvious reason of a 9 tailed demon fox sealed within him. He is so psychologically fuked, that he hungers for attention and acknowledgement for his abilities that he's taken a habit of pranking the entire village to satisfy his craving.\nAfter failing the graduation a 3rd time in a row, he is confronted with a known 'sensei' who asks him to steal a forbidden scroll in compensation for a graduation head band (obvious lie as he plans to take the scroll and kill naruto) . BUT \nNOT ONLY does Naruto steal the scroll, he self teaches himself an advanced version of the technique he repetitively failed at executing >>> (kage-bunshin no jutsu / shadow clone jutsu) >>> due to the vast amount of 'chakra' ( energy)  consumption this technique utilises it was written of as forbidden.  However this kid not only manages to SELF TEACH himself the technique, he is able to replicate at least 50 within his first execution.  ( I assume due to Naruto having an innate amount of chakra + Kyuubi (nine tails). \nNow 2 things can be derived from this, either the teachers at the academy were dog shit and naruto is a ninja genius god OR Kishimotto is shit at constructing proper power levels. I'll side with the latter. \nAs we progress throughout the series, there is further evidence to suggest that I'm right! Why?  Naruto wants to learn new techniques !? So instead of going back and self teaching himself 30 other techniques >> the story follows 100+ ch of him finding a perverted sage ( jiriya) who teaches him 2 techniques i.e(summoning tech and resengan)...\n\nTHIS example should spell that this series isn't built to last plot-wise . >> ( 1,3 flaw) \n\nNow another eg of poor plot and character development is well... the main antagonist, ok so this character makes literally 0 sense and due to the nature of this character and how integral he is to the overall plot... saying one thing would essentially spoil the uhh....'story'.... \nbut ye... to summarise, the main antagonist was pull right out of kishi's ass! PURE BULLSHIT! \nTo conclude, THIS SERIES IS BAD terrible cliche' plot, a lot of inconsistencies in power levels, death doesn't really mean shit in this universe and relationships between characters are transparent and redundant. I appreciate it's impact on the industry and that it's has made a lot of emotional ties between a large base BUT as a series... it is HORSE SHIT !\n3/10  \n\nTldr; Naruto is an overrated piece of garbage due to mediocre characters, terrible plot and inconsistency in character power levels  . Unless you know that this manga is really just a makeshift dbz with ninjas DONT READ/WATCH  IT!  \n        "},

		{["score"]=2,  ["helpful"]=48,   ["text"]="          \n    Let me just say I'm not a fan of Naruto, during the time it came out I was reading Ranma 1/2. When I got to read it about 50 chapters out of boredom I just stopped, never thinking that this was going to be well-known. Sadly, I was wrong  Naturo had become a hugely favorite manga in the US of A, and i still can't see how. To me, the people reading Naruto are either Young Boys, Teenage boys who have yet to hit puberty or have totally skipped it and teenage girls who all their care about is Sasuke. And that leads me\n          \n        to the characters; The three main characters are unlikable in different ways and intensities. Naruto, is Obnoxious, Rude, and overly unlikeable. Some people would want to defend him about that other village people hate him because he holds a demon in him.  People can't hold a grudge about him for that long. No-one feels pity which makes the whole common village people unlikable. And second, what the hell is on his face? they are like cat whiskers or something. The next character on the hate list is Sasuke. The manga and all the fan-boys and fan-girls call him a cool person? What is cool about him? Al he does is stay silent and hold a grudge for killing his family, all the while not showing emotion and dedicating his life to hate. Sakura is ok, for an obsessed and hopeless lover can be. \nAfter reading the first Tankobon. Naruto keeps on turning himself into a naked girl and makes some of the adult's nose bleed. It's like they forgot it is Naruto transforming himself into the girl, Which makes almost all the guys that all for it completely stupid. At one point there is a Fat ninja, which is a complete oxymoron. First, Ninjas in the Naruto world have to be fit for it, then if you are obese you would  get forced into training because these ninjas \"hide in the shadows\". For a bit of reality, Ninjas were peasants and farmers who didn't like the Shogun's rule and their weapons were mainly farming weapons, they did have the stars but theyi were ill-fit for throwing stuff like needles. \nThe last thing to point out is the character development. Crap, complete and utter crap. Do you know why? The mangaka made a time skip. Making all the characters change. How the hell did they change. Like for instance, Naruto becomes a little more hardworking and a little less obnoxious. How? did he get attacked by the Naruto + Sasuke Yoai Fan-girls and fan-boys? We don't know. basically, the Mangaka ran out of ideas and had no imagination for character development. \nIn the end there are a couple nice things about it. The artwork is sorta nice, and the Plot line could've been good but only if they actually had different characters than the dull ones now it could've been enjoyable. I'd say read it when your young (like 7-12) than just move on and don't get into the over-hype by the vast amount of stupidity\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=47,   ["text"]="          \n    Regardless of how you view Naruto as a series, one can't deny that it has left an enormous impact upon the culture and for many, acted as a gateway into manga and anime. Unfortunately, this also means nostalgia can cloud the minds of those that have followed the series since it's earlier years. Personally, I only started reading this series a few weeks ago. Prior to that, my experience with the series was the first 130 or so episodes of the original anime, before I lost interest in it and dropped it. After trying to watch the series again, I always inevitably dropped it around\n          \n        that 130 episode mark. So once Naruto's manga had finished, I knew it was time for me to experience the series in it's original form.\nNaruto frustrates me in the sense that it attempts to create so much, only to have it mean naught in the end. I'll elaborate on this further throughout my review.\nThe story of Naruto starts off pretty well. He's a young boy who grew up as an outcast due to the fact that he acts as a container for the 'Nine Tails', essentially a giant fox that attempted to destroy Konoha and kill its residents  12 years before the series begins. Naruto's dream is to become the Hokage (the leader of the village), and the series follows him on his journey to do so. Whilst its not exactly an amazing premise, it definitely sets things in motion nicely and for the first 200 chapters or so the story is decent. But ultimately, its the timeskip that kills this series. Naruto starts a lot of things, but by the end of the story, is unable to finish them. For example, a key focus of the series is chakra and having to manage and use chakra efficiently in order to survive in the battles. This was a good system, it made the battles more strategic and definitely gave a sense of impending doom when a character began to run low on chakra (unfortunately this effect would be ruined  as a friendly ninja would often show up to save them). By the end of the series, chakra conservation is far less important, and some of the final battles last longer than some of the series' most iconic battles combined. This lack of respect for one’s own worldbuilding is indicative of how the series progressed throughout the years.\n The flow of the story was decent but during the later chapters it definitely reached a pace that was far too slow and stretched. The final arc didn't need the amount of chapters it had, and felt almost twice as long as it really needed to be. Most of the plot twists were fairly predictable, but there are definitely a few that were very well done. Its a real shame as the childhood arc of the series (roughly the first 220 chapters) were rather good, and if I were judging the series overall from just those chapters, the rating would be about a 7. Unfortunately the story fails to hold on to the charm of the beginning of the series, and is ultimately ruined by the introduction of ridiculous jutsus and the reversal of some major events in the series, only to have them mean nothing in the end. And that's probably my biggest gripe with the series; the ending. For some reason, the mangaka chose to display the ending to the series in the final chapter in 25 colored pages. He could easily have shaved 5 or so chapters off of the stretched final arc and used those to set up a far more satisfying, gradual ending. It is currently assumed that the mangaka will explain the ending in more detail in his miniseries  that he plans to begin next year, but despite what information is revealed in these, it will not affect the fact that this ending felt very rushed. It was highly apparent that he paired characters together in the ending in a last ditch attempt to appeal to his fans, but his choices made little sense and some of the pairings had zero development throughout the series. If you're looking for a satisfying, meaningful end to this 700 chapter behemoth, you're going to be disappointed.\nThe art for the series is fairly good. The childhood arcs of the series definitely display a more 'cartoon'-ish feel whilst still keeping the series relatively realistic. As the series progressed, the art adopts a darker tone to match the attempt at creating a more serious story. I don't have much to say about the art to be honest. There were very few moments when I was truly awed by the artwork on a page, but there are definitely some standout panels (mainly from the final fight of the childhood chapters). I felt the mangaka was able to accurately convey what he needed to on a page, and on occasion he could really pull off some terrific backgrounds. The panels flowed well and fights are easy to follow which is one of the most important things in a manga that has them in such focus. The character's designs were also good, and the designs of the tailed beasts I found especially impressive. \nNow we move to the worst part of the experience; the characters. The childhood arcs introduce some decent characters such as Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga, Shikamaru Nara and Gaara. Whilst they're developed well, nearly all of the important characters introduced in the first part of the manga are pushed to the side. Most of the characters you’re introduced to in the childhood arcs serve little to no purpose in the overall story. After the timeskip, the series chooses to focus on the journey of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. The characters outside of these fail to receive much development apart from a small few, meaning that characters that you've been shown and seen develop are just ignored. By the end of it, the characters have developed in a highly unsatisfying way. The antagonists have a very superficial reasoning behind their actions and one of them in particular is supposed to achieve a sort of redemption at the end, and readers are expected to sympathize with him. But considering all of his bad deeds that he's performed throughout the story, it is difficult to pity someone whose motivations were so trivial to begin with. By far, one of the biggest flaws with the mangaka's characters is his complete inability to create a compelling, independent female character. Almost every female character in the series relies on a male character for their development, and its a real shame. I wanted to like some of them such as Sakura, but the mangaka continuously makes her weaker than the other members of her squad, and her obsession with Sasuke throughout the story is unhealthy and delves into ridiculous territories at certain points. But as I've said already, the majority of characters in this series are developed poorly, not just the females. \nMy enjoyment of the series confuses me. On one hand, I can point out a great number of flaws that the series that seriously hinder it. On the other, I didn't have any trouble reading through the series. It was only in the final arc that I began to get bored with the series, and I ended up powering through those chapters to finish the series more quickly, which is never a good sign. This is an entry-level series that many anime and manga fans are familiar with, but it'll do little to sway someone who has already read similar works. The series has no parts that serve as a shining example of its perfection, all of its parts are noticeably flawed. Once you've finished, unless you're somehow a die-hard fan (living off nostalgia), you'll probably be done with it.\nNaruto is a series that attempts to create an enormous world populated mostly with one-dimensional characters, but ends up collapsing under its own weight and reverting to standard shonen development. Everything in this manga can be done better by other works, and you should seek those out if you're looking for something specific in your reading. The series would've benefited from ending just before the timeskip. Instead the timeskip transforms the series into a darker, more focused plot that ultimately fails due to the simplistic design of many of the characters, lack of respect for the world created and the introduction of absurd powers that serve only to lengthen the series and attempt to create intimidating antagonists."},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=43,   ["text"]="          \n    Note - This is an instant and impulsive review. As this wasn't pre planned or anything, please try to ignore or just point out the typos in it. Sorry for the trouble! Do inform me if you liked/hated my review for what so ever reason! :D\n\nAh! Naruto, how I look back fondly and remember all the great memories I shared with this manga. This was my first manga and it used to be very dear to me. Before Kishi went insane and ruined it b dragging it till the infinity and beyond! \nThe Begining - \nNaruto started out as a shounen with a potential of\n          \n        being something special. It fulfiled it's potential in the initial arcs, by introducing host of interesting characters, even though the main 4 could be classified in the cliched shounen character type but they were building along well. Setting a benchmark in shounen industry with some nice fights between nice characters with nice powers and appropriate power ups, Naruto was going along well. Why? Because, A - the setting was good, a ninja trying to become hokage is as classy (some might call it stereotyped but  oh! WTH) a setting as you'll get. His lonelyness and detachment did create an emotional attachment with many users, the nakama factor was well used at times, and Naruto's way of ninja was an inspiring thing for young readers (me included). Besides all the emotional exaggeration. The main character in itself was a treat to the eyes, right mix of stupidity and rashness. The number one surprising ninja of Konoha, always did something unthinkably stupid that would make you smile and keep your interest in the series. The mysterious sensei was a good card that Kishi played. Kakashi was one of the inspiring figures and turned out to be a fun read. And the other two main charactes even though bit archtyped provided few more dimensions to the team. Specialy the Naruto - Sasuke relationship which later became the main fulcrum of the series was a predictable, but good addition. \nThen comes the side characters. Holy Jesus! The side characters! From Haku, Zabuza to Itachi, Jiraiya to Gaara, Lee and Shikamaru. Each character was well crafted and piqued my interest, their personality was such that you'd genuinely like to know more about them, to discover them and love/hate/appreciate them. Their powers were varying and interesting and provided for different tactical battles which often became quite interesting. These characters initial development didn't disapoint at all. In fact, one could wonder if these characters would have been properly explored.\nThe universe of Naruto, was also a huge plus point in the series. It provided great scope of world building as the main countries were fire, wind, thunder, water and earth countries with the hidden leaf, sand, cloud, mist and rock villages, imagination could have easily run wild on them and there was a lot to built. Even Konoha which was the home town of our protaganist was architectured well. With a hill showing faces of all previous and current village leaders standing tall upon a bit modern village provided a picturesque scenery. Even the head bands and symbols and costumes had and proved to be a great area for merchandizing with much too sale, not only the figurines.\nThe battles though weren't as tactical as maybe in LoGH but were still more mind consuming than battles in YYH or DB. The tactical play that ninja uses, manipulating environment into shinobi's own benefit provided huge space for creating interesting battles. Which did happen in the first half of manga's tenure (since it's still ongoin it is quite possible to say less than the first half). My favourite ones were between Gaara and Rock Lee ( a fast paced and exciting one) and Shikamaru vs Hidan (more tactical and fun). The battles kept up your attention since they rarely got reptitive, yes the nakama talk was there but it didn't become that forced initialy. \nNow -\nNow, Naruto is a huge pile of mess. Just a former shadow of it's glorious self. The two protaganist turned into emo douchenozzles with endless rants you'll find in any mediocre emo-punk band. The main fulcrum of the story i.e. relationship between two protaganists became streched out and wiery. In fact, it was turned into a huge pile of turd that completely over shadowed any chance of anything else happening on the side. The pacing became horrendous, good parts being rushed, bad parts are being enlongated to the extent of being cumbersome and mundane. In fact, now I have to force myself to complete one chapter. The pannels are wasted and something out of the blue and completely senseless keeps on happening. The characters death are given either too much time or no time at all that the impact completely vanishes.\nThe array of side characters (now including Kakashi and Sakura) lie forgotten in deep dark corners of Kishi's mind. The strenuous Naruto-Sasukke relationship has left little time for anything else to be centred around anyone but them or maybe the new baddy of the new arc. Side characters which could have become more supportive and intruging have only become extras in the manga with a rare chapter or two thrown at them in which microscopic level of characterization takes place. Even the two main guys are no good. Naruto who was an unpredictably fun and stupid ninja has become an all time bore, with billions of heart to heart talk and pseudo emotional crap. Sasuke on the other hand has garnered a rather apt treputation for being an all time whiner and ass. Most of the time these characters rant about their nakama or anti-nakam policy. The manga has turned from a battle shounen to a political debate between two very pathetic (in an i-have-got-nothing-new-to-say manner) and extremely stupid parties.\nThe battles. Oh My God them horrendous battles! They go out in one way and one way only now. Lots of DBZ like, landscape changing action where the super over powered villain fights over powered super heroes. At the end, Naruto, the messiah, sprinkles his few heartbraking ( rather heart-attacking) words of wisdom and the baddy's hear melt and he ends in giving up or killing himself. The tactical foray that Naruto (the manga), used to have scope for, lays all forgotten and dusted along the side of side characters. \nThe narutoverse, which as I previously explained, had great scope of world building. However, it has been utterly ignored by Kishi. (surprise! surprise!) Besides, since now Naruto paces everything up but battles, and battles of DBZ proportion mind you, the only thing left of the battle ground is barren wasteland. Any attempts to use ground for advantage, even thinking about it seems laughable. \nSummarizing - \nNaruto started as a great manga with lot of potential, which it fulfiled initialy. However it ended being a money generating machine for WSJ whose expiry date is long overdue but still WSJ is squeezing money out of it. Adios.\n        "},

What started of as a promising, yet cliche, shonen manga has since become a horrid Beast of terrible plot devices and unnecessary arcs, whose purpose isto keep the dying monster's heart moving.  Oh, how you maintain your popularity through keeping people in wait, promising that the story will carry on, only to decieve them and continue on pointlessly.  \nAs one can tell, I am no fan of this series.  Once, I was someone who refused to read this manga, as my only justification was \"It's popular, so it can't be good!\"  However,\n          \n        I quickly realized how foolish that was, and forced myself to read this gigantic piece of pop-culture.  Initially, I was suprised at the depth that the manga could posess, developing many well-rounded, albiet, cliche, characters.  However, it quickly became clear to me that this manga is just like every other shonen action/adventure, neverending.  Yes, Naruto will most certaintly end, but expect a terribly executed, ambiguous ending where nothing's really solved, the characters remain the same, and you're no better off reading this manga than not.  As you can see, I really dislike the story, and I give it a 3, for being cliche heavy and weighed down by pointless plot points and story archs.\nThere has, however, been a lot of work put into the art, which is good for an action-heavy shonen manga.  The battles are clear, the characters are unique, and you can tell how the world progresses (or how it would progress, as the story does not).  I gavbe it an 8.\nThe characters are cleverly disguised cliches, and have all been done before.  A 4.\nInitially, I really liked this manga, and had it at a 7, but now, the enjoyment is gone, so I'll settle with a 5.\nOverall, this manga is mediocre.  That is the perfect word to describe Naruto. Mediocre.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=41,   ["text"]="          \n    I think before we can judge Naruto, we need to ask ourselves one question: why did we ever start reading it? The answer is simple: it was a show about ninjas and cool fighting scenes. But that is why we started reading it, not why we kept reading it every week.\nNaruto started with a very solid foundation, upon several intriguing characters and their past. It was really interesting seeing a rejected kid try hard to be accepted into society, to find a home, to find someone who deeply cares about him. And this wasn't only exclusive to Naruto himself, but also Sasuke and to some\n          \n        extent, Kakashi. Sure, the first chapters were goofs and jokes but the manga started to build a momentum toward a grand adventure, a journey filled with eclectic imagination of Masashi Kishimoto. I applaud Kishimoto for this grand tale of the Legendary ninja. Not only that the setting was well done, it was convincing and quite fitting to the themes of the story. But it gets quite difficult after that. Naruto made a bold statement in its infancy yet somewhere along its deacde long publication, it lost the values and its themes scattered. It's difficult to judge this 15 years of work as a whole because the content fluctuates greatly where it can be said that different authors wrote the manga. Sad, but the truth is this beloved series couldn't be distinguished anymore from other shounen mangas.  You know, the main character continues a legacy while making friends and enemies and attains power to combat evil yet loses precious people in the process but through effort, triumphs the dark in the end. And in the latter chapters, if it wasn't for the setting, I wouldn't be able to tell if I was reading Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail or some other generic shounen. Yet the manga did have its moments, mainly the Pain Arc where the manga showed off the characters' maturity and importance. It was one of the very few arcs that highlighted what Naruto is: a tale about a gutsy ninja who desires to change the world for better and become the leader, the Hokage. And it was splendid how Kishimoto portrayed the strong bond between the characters and how some of their deaths influenced others.\nSomething else to note about the story is how philosophical it became over the years. Especially near the end, Naruto was tackling some of the biggest topics such as death, pain, suffering, human nature, and friendship. While it sounds grand, the author didn't provide much logic and effort to execute the probable ideas. It's sad how much potential turned to waste. Near the end, the characters' actions were justified by nonsense reasoning, their rage by incomplete monologues and the biggest questions of the series were answered in a rush.\nAs I stated earlier, Naruto built itself on its characters and their backgrounds. Naruto's loneliness due to the Fox,  Sasuke's family tragedy, Kakashi's father's death, and Orochimaru's long past gave Naruto a great variety of characters. However, when we step out of past, Naruto characters are embodiment of most other shounen characters. You know, the rival, the girl, the sensei, the perverted old man, the weird guy, the powerful drunk lady, that villain and such. But it is worth mentioning that characters in Naruto mature and they develop to establish very memorable traits. And what I find amazing is Naruto maintaining his role throughout the series. Sometimes it was redundant, sometimes annoying but in the end, Naruto being himself, the determined and strong willed boy,  kept the series together and preached some very thoughtful messages. The series had some characters, like Jiraiya and Itachi, who truly left a legacy and voice in the manga medium. Other characters, like Obito or even Sasuke, are example of how the series failed to establish solid resolutions for its characters. These characters' roles fluctuated greatly over the years. The rival of the series, Sasuke, could have become a grand villain or an eccentric anti-hero but the author took the shounen route and tried a happy ending for everyone. While it was satisfying as a Naruto fan, it did disappoint me to some extent.  \nAs for art, it was quite good. Naruto's art was simpler than other mangas yet detailed. The style quite fits the story and the attacks are decently drawn. Sometimes the panels were bit messy and some character design were absurd, but, Naruto's characters (mainly women) were drawn more modestly than many other series. And I appreciate that aspect.\nIt's sad how long the story was dragged out, how redundant the messages were, how ridiculous the reasoning of characters became and how much potential the series ruined near the end. Some months, Naruto was plain boring and it wasn't enjoyable anymore. But when I read the last chapter, it was finally a relief that after over a decade, Naruto achieved his dreams and the story of the Legendary ninja came to end. The 700 chapter journey was a burden near the end but thankfully, it concluded half decently. \nMost of us started to read Naruto because it seemed cool. But what kept many readers, including myself, to keep reading was to see Naruto succeed. The ninja raised his voice to change the world and despite his cursed fate, he brought himself to become a hero. Naruto is an inspiration, the mascot of Shounen Jump's motto \"friendship, effort, victory.\"\nAlthough the Naruto manga doesn't tell a great story, it does tell a tale about a great character, Naruto Uzumaki. \n        "},

So now the story has to force you in watching every inch of progression that naruto makes and to force characters around this moron like he is a messiah?, \nThe point is kishimoto's writing had changed drastically towards naruto being blessed like this saviour crap which gives the story no real meaning behind the actions of characters aka Ninjas in this story. \nThe only thing that is demonstrated here is severing bonds and repairing bonds again and again and again and again and again with many characters and not just the main and supporting characters but also villains too featuring a entire army of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks and so forth.\nArt - 7\npretty good, its the only saving grace. fights look good but at times it looks too much like a Michael Bay movie. Flashy explosions here and there For fuck sake they are ninjas not fucking fireworks!!\nCharacters - 3\nStereotypical for the most part, Apart from mainly a noteworthy few like Pain, Gaara and Jaraiya are the only really good ones in the entirety of the story and the others are just stereotypical and predictable not to mention lazily written most of the time.\nmany new characters get introduce later on but are hardly noteworthy or memorable in any way. \nNow for the main characters brief description\nNaruto was written well at first glance despite him being irritating at times\nand became more of a hypocrite of a character instead of having this so called hard working young ninja resented by his own village to strive up the ninja rankings to becoming Hokage (the village's top ninja which hilariously is still a genin up until the very last chapter) \nbut then again at the same time I can't say he is a hard working ninja considering his power mostly comes from the nine-tail fox beast that gives him 80% of his chakra and not to mention at the very beginning he cheated on learning his most well known jutsu the shadow clone jutsu which he learn by reading a forbidden scroll ask yourself this whoever is reading is that really the essence of hard work?\nthen when things couldn't get more dumber Naruto then turned into NARUJESUS the saviour from a long line of boy love and hate Bullshit \nHuh????........Is this writing for real????.\nSasuke is a typical tragic anti hero with a confused ambition most of the time that gets power ups every time up the wazoo did I mention that he also wanted to be hokage at one point? ummm....... Naay?.\nSakura is Sakura. (LAMEST FEMALE CHARACTER IN SHOUNEN PERIOD.)\nand don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\nKakashi was cool at first but then sucked big time as the story went on.\nNow there are quite a lot of female characters (kunoichi) in the series but kishimoto's writing shows very little respect for them in the way they are presented as there own person in their own progression since kishi cannot write female characters to save his life and unfortunately a lot can be said with loads of the other characters in his story who suddenly just fade into the background.\nSo I'm wondering to myself should I care now up to this point when reading the story with this amount of lazy half ass writing??\nEnjoyment - 1\nJust peachy :) \nYaaayyy!! cannot wait for more milk products on offer.\n\nOverall / Final Rating - 2.5\nIf i were to review this any further there would be a lot of people crying and also feeling dishearten for what I've mentioned and I do not want that because I know many people will think my review of is just a rant/outburst or just some personal hate speech lol, which I can honestly assure you it isn't.\nwhy did I drop something I didn't like to the end? \nwell my friends because Idiocy is who I am and idiocy can lead to \nsome really cool conclusions along the journey am i wrong?\nBut unfortunately I've explained why in this review that it isn't the case. that doesn't mean this franchise as a whole is bad, I'm saying it lacked a lot of quality in terms of an objective writing standpoint and characterisation. \nSo if you think I'm trolling or hating your sadly mistaken if you feel that way about my review and opinion.\nFinal thought\nWell there you go, I've pretty much summarised the Naruto manga for what it is and If you still like it more power to you, but to me its wasted too much of my time, joy, patience and can thankfully be laid to rest \nso more power to me, \nand for others more milk to you.\n        "},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=41,   ["text"]="          \n    This manga is one of the most popular manga series ever, and it's obvious why. It's because the main character always does the right thing. It's always about Naruto: he can do the impossible, and no other character in the story has the right to be better. This is what the reader should believe.\nI began watching the anime when I was ten, dropped it after moving to a different country and losing the access to a cable TV in a language I understand, but three years ago I started reading the manga. What I really liked about it is the variety of characters. The main\n          \n        one, Naruto, is the just neutral because nobody wonders what he'll do next (it will be the right thing to do, anyway!), but there are plenty of wonderful secondary characters you can write fanfics about!\nIn the beginning, the manga has no plot. Nope, none at all. And then it begins about thirty chapters too late, and is nothing special. By now the Naruto sank to the same place where most of the shounen manga series end et at some point: a collection of useless scenes without a real plot, pointless battles and a villain who decided to wait until fiftieth volume to reveal his plans of taking over the world. The author ran out of ideas, and now even the humor is gone.\nAs for the art... IT SUCKS. Seriously. The battle scenes aren't clear enough, and there are always ink splashes everywhere. The character design is very basic, and the backgrounds rarely include anything more complicated than tree silhouettes. If it was a random fan-work on the internet I would've said that it's awesome, but for a professional work it's just lame.\nSo why do I keep reading it? Because some of my friends write wonderful fanfiction stories for Naruto, so I have to stay up to date.\n        "},
		{["score"]=1,  ["helpful"]=40,   ["text"]="          \n    It sucks. Really, I meant it, it sucks. Naruto is by far the most over-the-top manga I ever read, it's the best example of how to stretch a 12-volume plot into something the author dragged for years like a dead body up a hill.\nThe first thing that might annoy you on Naruto is the lack of character design, we have Naruto, the lame protagonist that has incredible powers, Sasuke, the bland tough-looking friend of the protagonist and Sakura, the girl.\nI wish I could say more about the characters but there's nothing to say, on exactly 700 chapters they never change, it kinda baffles me this\n          \n        fact because there's no character development, if you read the first chapter, then you know what these 3 will be doing on the rest of the manga, not only these 3, but everybody. As it has absolutely no character development, I can't say the author knew what he was doing and it's enough to say \"hey, I think this manga is worth nothing\" but there's still bad things to say about it.\nThe silly plot. As having the worst characters ever, the plot isn't good either, it's a neverending road to do only one thing: save Sasuke, and this is something really weird considering Sasuke is a cold-blooded murderer which certainly has Naruto and Sakura into a stockholm syndrome of some kind because it makes no sense. There were wars, ancient evils, threats to the whole world, and what's the focus here? Save a bastard. Nice one author, you almost made me believe that the whole thing had a point.\nAfter all what this manga tries to do and fails so hard? It has a point or at least tries to. I think the author tried to show us that the bad guys only need compassion and this could be something good, could have teached us how to be better people maybe, but instead we only had 700 bloody chapters of pointless fights.\nJust to point out how inconsistent things are: ninja rankings mean nothing at all, Naruto was the most powerful genin ever, nice one creating gimmicks to expose more of the universe inside the manga and simply forgetting about it right after. Kekkei genkai becomes meaningless as pretty much everybody has one and as it's so common, why people don't have multiple kekkei genkai abilities? Wasn't it supposed to be genetic? In the whole world people marry their cousins or something? It begs for an answer.\nBottom line: this was wrote for kids and kids only, it's bland, undeveloped, has plot holes and the deus ex machina happens all the time, not only on the protagonist which is the only one with an excuse to summon the deus ex machina, but with everybody.\nSome people seemed a little confused with \"deus ex machina\" so I'll care to explain, it basically a synonym to lazy writing, when you think all hopes are lost, Naruto will die (or any of the \"good guys\") and simply everything is going wrong, the author calls the deus ex machina and all problems are solved. How is deus ex machina in Naruto? Kyuubi. After Naruto discovering this bloody fox inside of him, there was absolutely nothing to worry about because as long as he can just call the fox, he can win anything, and look how convenient, the fox has 9 tails to be unlocked, so as the difficulty of battles increase, he can always get stronger! How clever!\nOne last disclaimer: I used to like Naruto, when I was 10. \n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=39,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is good but for me it has no consistency whatsoever. I don't even know now what plot it wants to follow. For me I think the mangaka is just getting random idea as to what he should do next about his manga. I think its the reason why some of its readers have slow down reading if not totally stop from doing so. If you think I'm wrong then you should try it yourself.\nStory 6\nAll this time I believe Naruto(the main protagonist) is striving to become thier village Hokage. To be respected by the people of his own village. On the first part, it\n          \n        was clear that Naruto will surely succeed in doing so, but after the skip, meh, things just get so confusing. The story suddenly start focusing on Sasuke, a boy whose clan was murdered by his own brother. Chapters and chapters dedicated to this revenge loving maniac. And then what happens? Sasuke killed his brother only to find out that his brother is good. That his brothers action were under the orders of konoha. So now he's out to take revenge(again) on Konoha that his brother tried so hard to protect( at the cost of annihilating his own clan..another psycho.) What annoy is me Narutos' undying will to take back Sasuke, always saying about how can he become hokage if he cant even save a single friend. Sasuke do not even care anymore. He even tried to kill Sakura. And now Naruto is saying that in order to save Sasuke from the grasp of darkness. he's willing to give up his life. (what a joke) How can he become a hokage if he died? Why give up on your dream just to save someone whose trying to destroy the very village you want to protect? For me that's just plain stupid. So story wise I think it's just fair.\nArt\nMany says the art is great. I cant tell why though. For me, the  backgrounds were too much. So many ink go to waste. With character that looking all the same except for their hair and eyes. I think it's just good. Just good. So it's 7\nCharacter\nI don't think the character on this one received the right amount attention. In fact I think Sasuke is the only one who's got all of it. Since Shippuden starts, the other character seldom appears. Lack of development. So again just good\nEnjoyment\nThe most enjoying aspect of Naruto is when it comes to battle. With so many techniques to see,and so many strategy to make you feel awe. Aside from that, I think nothing much. There's no more comedy in it unlike before.\nOverall.\nI'll give it a six. Start out great but then couldn't keep it up. Well, Its not like it's over so it still has a chance to bet back where it was once, that being a great manga.\n        "},

The second part was for the most part pretty good, though not at the same level anymore. Problems were already starting at the beginning when the writer: Masashi Kishimoto started ignoring almost all his characters to focus on the main team which consists of Naruto, Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura, which btw isnt a smart move since all the main characters aint likeable at all, but the side characters are. He started ignoring the entire Hyuuga clan and gave insane boosts to the\n          \n        rival dojutsu clan: the Uchiha clan. Then in the final arc the writer made stupid decision after stupid decision. ***SPOILERS****  After Sasuke started becoming a goodguy for some stupid reason after naruto ran after him for the entire series, and the new main villain only keeps on crying it got worse and worse. The entire war people got bullshit powerups and as always everyone besides our main team suddenly couldnt do anything besides stare at the main guys.******/spoilers          The main problem overall is focusing on the worst characters of the series while he has such awesome characters in it."},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=38,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto Review (warning: contain some spoilers)\nI still remember the time I first encounter when it was airing back on cartoon network. I was 5 then and I had no idea what anime was at the time. When I first started watching naruto, it completely blew my 5 year old mind. It had everything I wanted as a 5 year old. Action, adventure, drama, demons, ninjas, Naruto had it all. However, I am no longe 5 years old. My tastes in anime/manga have considerably change over the years and my interests have dwindle over the past few 300 or so chapters. Now that the series have\n          \n        ended, I want to at least leave my final thoughts since this was a big part of my childhood. \nStory\nNaruto starts off big and epic, but become more cliched and contrived as it drags on. Here’s a brief overlook of the major arcs. If you want to know about any specifics, leave a comment on my profile page.\nWave Country: In this arc, we get to learn a bit more about our main characters. Its also the arc we learn about the basics of the Ninja Villages and how cruel the strong can be to the weak.It also featured Haku and Zabuza, 2 relatively interesting villains, who don’t ecome allies or recurring opponents, which is a nice change from the usual shonen anime. It also have some good drama and twists to keep you invested. Overall, a good arc. Score: 8\nChuunin exams: This arc introduce us to the secondary cast. It also shows us the secondary villages and how frail the peace is between them. There is also a conspiracy that threatens the village, which lead to a major character death. there’s are a lot of minor battles that don’t affect the plot that much, but does a good job of fleshing out the secondary characters. The only gist with this arc is that it drags on for a bit too long, but other than that, another good arc. Score: 7\nSasuke retrieval: In this arc, we get to know more about the Uchiha and their demise. Sasuke goes rogue and out protagonists try get him back. There are some interesting info concerning the Akatsuki, but other than that its pretty boring. This arc last too long for its own good. And the new villains, the Akatsuki, are not dealt with and the secondary villains, the 5 Sounds, weren’t very interesting villains. Rather dry in comparison with the previous arcs. Score: 5\nAfter a 3 year timeskip…..\nGarra Retrieval: In this arc, we are reintroduced to our characters, now older, as they go out to rescue an old rival. This arc did fleshed out the sand village a bit more. However, the plot drags on too long and there isn’t that much to talk about this arc. The objective is pretty much the same as the last arc and there aren’t any major deaths. Score: 5\nIntroduction to Sai: In this arc, they introduced a new character into Naruto’s Team named Sai. Nothing much happens in this arc and Sai is a pretty boring character. Score:3\nAzuma Avenge: In this arc we get to see Naruto learning a new improved rasengan and an important character needs to be avenged. It was nice how they fleshed out Shikamaru and team 10. But other than that, not too much to say about this arc. Score: 6\nPein Attack: This is where I think Naruto started to fall apart. The leader of the Akatsuki invades the Leaf and kills a bunch of people. Naruto beat villain and he resurrects everyone. Good job ruining all the drama for the entire arc. And also we learn that Naruto is the bloody messiha and that he will be humanity salvation. God damn it Naruto, this isn’t the bible. In the beginning, we were suppose to believe that Naruto got to where he is by his own strength, not some stupid prophecy. If Naruto remained a normal bloke and the people remain dead, this could of been a great finale. Guess I expected too much. Score: 4\nDanzo Assassination: Sasuke finds out that some more people were involved of the killing of the Uchiha and set out kill people. Then he kills people….. thats it. Pretty much nothing else happens other than that. Score: 3\n The 3rd ninja war:  This is where Naruto completely fall apart. First of all, this ridiculously long war that drags out way too long. There are too many minor battles and flashbacks that don’t anything to the main plot. And the war doesn’t even feel like a war. It more like a bunch of skirmishes that are loosely tied together. And basically only one major character died in this huge war that lasted like 200 chapters. The villains for this arc are Obito, Madara, and Kagura. Obito is a lame villain and his motive basically boiled to him destroying the world because he got friendzoned. Mardara is a fun villain even though he is obviously one dimensional, he has enough camp to keep you entertained. Kagura is, though, a boring villain. He powers are pretty boring and lame. Teleporting portal holes in a universe where almost everyone can teleport? Really? Other dimensions? When did Naruto become Dr.Who? The conclusion is forced and pretty unnecessary if you think about it. Pretty bad arc. Score:2\nOverall, story gets a 3.\n\nCharacters:\nThis manga has 2 main character. One of them is Naruto. He’s mostly your stereotypical shonen protagonist who \"wants to be the best\" and when he faces enemies, he throws out cheesy friendship speeches. At first I like him for his character motivation. He suppose to be an outcast and tries to gain acceptance from his peers, a motive anyone can relate to. But then halfway through, his character motive changed from being hokage to saving Sasuke, which makes less sense the more I think about how Naruto only knew him for a few weeks. And then he becomes the bloody messiah which is total BS. In the end, he degrade into another \"chosen one\" stereotype.\nSasuke is the other main character. He’s mostly a duck head, emo brute who like want to get to get revenge on his evil big brother and killing people…. a lot of people. At first it was ok since he had reasons for being dick he was since he did experience a mass genocide of his own clan by his own brother. But after a while it get quite tiresome and   his character get stagnate after a while. And he is still being a bruting emo even after the war end and all the bad guys are dead. Sasuke, lay off all the revenge crap already and get a life.\nThe rest of the cast is a rather mixed bag. Some characters are really cool and interesting like Orochimaru, Jiraiya and Shikamaru. Others have almost complete rehashes of other characters like Sai and Obito. And others seems to have been victimised by the Piccolo effect and become mostly background characters (approximately half the secondary characters like .For the most part is mostly your standard shonen cast.\nArtwork:\nThe artwork in Naruto is good to say the least. Its doesn’t have the attention to detail like Berserk, were every single detail can be seen, but its still good for a battle shonen. There is a lot of emphasis on making it look cool and unique, from the villages to the handsigns. The battles are nice and tactful since they implied basic tactics, well, for the most part. The problem mostly comes in the latter part in the series where try to make it look \"flashy\". It degrade the battles into who could shoot the larger lazerbeam or bigger explosion. \nConclusion\nNaruto is a shounen battle series that sometimes break the mold, but sadly falls apart like most other series. Its not a bad shonen by any extent, but it sure not a great one like many people claim. \nScores:\nStory:3 ( starts out great but falls apart and become a total trainwreck)\nCharacters:5 ( mostly your typical shonen cast)\nArt: 7( good but nothing impressive)\nEnjoyment: 5 ( starts out loving it, but my interest diminished over time)\nScore: 4/10\nRecommendations:\nFMA, Soul Eater, HxH, Rurouni Kenshin, Yu Yu Hakusho \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=37,   ["text"]="          \n    First and foremost, I would like to mention that I first discovered and followed Naruto by watching the anime during my school years. It seemed so different and mature and energetic compared to the usual animes that were being televised in 2003-2004 (Pokemon, Digimon, Escalfowne, Beyblade, etc). And begun the start of my anime dvd collection. \nI am not going to lie that I momentarily dropped it once before Shippuden and during Shippuden for at least 2yrs, collectively. \nIt just lacked the necessary build up that was clearly there but not advanced upon. It became predicable with each filler – they are assigned a mission\n          \n        which involved \"A\" fights scene that wound dragged to cover multiple episodes that are mainly filled with scenes previously used. \nAfter the war begun being addressed in the manga and the excitement from the readers together with the tensing of the war inbetween fillers in the anime; I stopped with the anime and began the manga (which I do not regret).  Yes, at times I did enjoy the fights in the anime but in honesty I can only recall two from the Naruto anime – Rock Lee vs Gaara and the episodes with Haku after years of dedication. And even then, they do not compare to the fun and enjoyment I felt each week from reading the war segment.\nWith the completion of the manga am very happy it is ended for truly it was way over dragged. Am just pleased that the war segment helped in shutting down the build-up of regret of years of dedication wasted on the anime; bringing forth the ever longed excitement that I had long lost from my childhood. Now I just have to catch up with the anime episodes and hope and pray that they portray the war as shown in the manga.\n\nREFERENCE FOR THE WAR SEGMENT (MANGA ONLY):\nStoryline – 7\nArt work – 5\nCharacters:\n-	Favourites – Rock Lee, Gaara, Orochimaru and Itachi Uchiha \n-	Less favourite – SAKURA & Sasuke a bit for I feel they played around with his storyline too much, which in-turn belittled his character.\n-	Naruto himself – 6\nEnjoyment – 7\nOverall – 8\n\nPs they should have ended it at the last page of the 699 chapter "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=35,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto was one of the first anime I ever watched, (I picked up the manga later) however it failed to take a place in my heart.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=28,   ["text"]="          \n    Today I will be reviewing the longest yaoi ever created. \nCharacter:\nDon't you love reused bull? Well seeing as though I loved Bleach, which is a testament that I love my reused bull! Now, I for the first few volumes the story was very good, refreshing even. The shounen genre suffers from a plethora of bad storytelling. But the first few volumes of Naruto shove a giant purple dildo in the face of its entire genre by showing a more sentimental, and human, approach to it's characters.\nThat is for the first few volumes. See, Naruto falls short where some other shounens did as well. I can't\n          \n        say the names of these shows, but one of them rhymes with detergent. And where it fell short is that once it found a formula that worked they stuck to it and subsequently beat it to death! \"Well, if it's broke why fix it?\"  says Naruto. \"Because that is literary suicide.\" says the ambiguous sage in the corner smoking a Cuban cigar!\n\"Okay Callacas, what is this formula the infallible Naruto beats to death?\" You ask. I am not trying to bash the manga when I say this but, whenever any character in the manga (any, of them) needs characterization, all the manga does is make a flashback to their childhood. Showcasing their \"struggle\" to put it informally. It wouldn't be half bad if it all didn't boil down to the same general information, \"X had a hard childhood, and because of it grew up into the person he is today.\" That kind of thing. Again, I did not mind the flashback, at the beginning. But having them told over and over and over again makes it lose its intended affect and comes off as melodramatic. Which is the opposite affect. \nAlso, another problem of this is that the flashbacks are the only use of characterization. Tell me this, those of you who have seen anything Naruto, take out the flashbacks and what are you left with? A generic shounen. \nActually, let me ask you a better question, take out the flashbacks and try to describe the characters in as many words as possible. Let me tell you now, you are not going to get past one or two. And that is almost as bad as Bleach. 4/10\nStory:\nThe story starts before the time when Naruto and his best friend Sausuke wanted to take off their shirts and kiss. It begins in their early tween/teenage years. The story begins with a love triangle between the all important main character Naruto who has fallen in love with a girl in his class Sakura. Sakura, on the other hand loves the most popular boy in school, Sausuke. While Sausuke secretly loves Naruto. Oh, we have come full circle have we? \nNow, Naruto and Sakura and Sasuke are all ninja. In a land of ninja. In a world of ninja. In a universe of ninja. Which is hopefully in a taco or something, damn I'm hungry.... Where was I? Oh, yeah. Ninjas. \nNaruto as the main plot continues Naruto and his triangle buddies find themselves all on the same ninja team conveniently enough. And they all go on adventures with their instructor and from there the tale unfolds. \nThe plot itself is nothing to write home about. It is essentially an epic retelling of the classic Japanese piece of Literature, \"A Tale of a Gutsy Ninja Jiraiya\" that is about a ninja Jiraiya who summons magic from toads going on adventures trying to win over his love Tsunade, who is a kunoichi who summons magic from slugs, all the while fighting with his arch rival Orochimaru, who is a ninja who summons magic from snakes. \nAgain, it's nothing to write home about. Generic shounen stuff. 5/10\nArt:\nI'll be the first to say this, I don't like the artist's designs. Yeah, the clothes are cool and all, but the character designs are just god-awful and just plain boring. With uninteresting faces, or in the case of some characters, no faces at all. Hmm, I wonder how much time that saved the artist when trying to rush the chapters out of the door?\nThe environments get much better as the series begins to close, but nothing jumps out of the page at you. It just seems like the environments were just shoved to the back of the author's mind. Furthermore, the author seems to love the ever loving troll face out of surrealist artwork. Which depicts strange and sometimes disturbing pictures. I cannot recommend this for too young of an audience. \nEnjoyment:\nBelieve it! I was certainly not board reading this manga that is for sure. Just like i cannot describe the Xbox One past box; I cannot describe this manga past the word fun. It was a genuinely fun read. But I am not sure if it is good enough for a second read through. It is LONG! 7/10\nOverall:\nLike every long running shounen out there, it has it's flaws. What is bothersome is that it is not aware of its flaws, and that is Naruto's greatest weakness. 6/10\nEDIT: Wait a second! I forgot to include the secret criteria! Action!\nAction:\nI have not seen One Piece yet so I cannot compare it to that. But I have seen Bleach as you no doubt know by now. So, I will compare it to Bleach. The action in Naruto is much slower paced than Bleach. But it gets the job done very well. The action makes sense and all of the enemies actually feel like they are legitimate threats. Also, the fights are long and drawn out, which I like by the way. So that is fine. 7/10\nso this bumps my final score up to a...6/10.... Well that was anticlimactic. \n        "},

The series is very repetitive and there is very little change, there is big bad villain and he comes along and wrecks shit and Naruto changes him with friendship, rinse and\n          \n        repeat and increase the scale a little bit for each arc. I might have given the story a 7-8 but god damn the last arc was so bad it just blew me away so I had to drop it down. Naruto has the problem any long Manga has, lack of direction. The series just kept going on and on and on and there just wasn't a central plot, no big bad guy to kill untill the end where they basically played whack-a-mole with big bad OP villains, kill one and another pops up. Orochimaru could have been the perfect villain but god damn they had to turn him into some useless character at the end and have a completely new character be the final boss, just lame. Also the last chapter practically gave me cancer with all the fail ships, sorry stalker love isn't romantic to me and characters who don't even know each other in the main series being married with children at the end... What a joke. 6/10 and that's being generous.\nArt:\nThe art is solid, pretty consistent throughout the series, it's not amazing art by any means and I thought the generous usage of black at the end was pretty annoying but the rest was solid 8/10.\nCharacter:\nAll the interesting character get killed off and the main character is basically worthless post time skip. 4/10\nEnjoyment:\nI give it a 3 because I loved this series and it turned to shit so I basically went from like 9 to -6 which evens out to a 3.\nOverall:\nIt gets a 6. Basically the series stole a template from HxH for the majority of the first half and the more it tried to deva-ate from the path it just got worse and worse. The original was good but it peaked at the chunin exams. I think that a 6 is honestly being generous for this big of a train wreck and I think less of anybody who gave it an 8 or higher.\n"},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=26,   ["text"]="          \n    I got hooked on this manga when I was 10. It had been recomended to me by some of my friends who liked it alot. Anyways, I thought that it was very detailed for a manga(it isnt really, BTW) I loved it when I first saw it. I was obsessed with it. I mean, I had never seen any kind of anime or manga before, so it was so great and original to me. I loved the series until I was around 12 and a half. Since then, I have been begining to discover that Naruto isnt all that great and many manga and anime\n          \n        have all that it has and more, and am only now begining to read different ones. Anyways, The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world where ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, a ninja in training who carries the Kyuubi and hopes to earn the respect of the villagers some day. It was a concept that interested me, alot. But...the story wasent really as great as the concept. Sure, I felt for some of the characters, some of them had some really sad and well thought out backgrounds. But that started to annoy me when they kept repeated it over and over(like with Sasuke and his dream to kill Itachi). And then they didnt know what to do to keep the series going, so we were introduced to the world of filler. And they were the most ridiculous fillers. I mean, some animes can have good fillers but these were just stupid and pointless. And by now, Im starting to get a little disapointed.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=25,   ["text"]="          \n    Holy shit, it's finally over.\nSo, Naruto. One of the Big Three (joined by Bleach and One Piece), unless their status has changed. No matter, though. Anyway, I did use the word \"finally,\" indicating that it's something I've waited for for some time now. It's true. Somewhere along the line, the sheer length and meandering pace got me turned off of Naruto, so it was a happy moment when I noticed that it had ended, since I'd give me a reason to pick it up again. Like running, it's easier to read when you have a goal. So, what about this ninja story, 15 years in\n          \n        the making?\nNaruto is a good manga. \nThis'll have two parts - one with no to minimal spoilers, and a second, spoiler-filled part. First is intended for new readers and second for those who have completed the entire thing.\nHaving its start way back in 1999, Naruto is one of the modern successors of Dragon Ball, in the way it places its values and builds its story. Like Goku, Naruto starts out virtually alone. Naruto, though, is alone because of the fear the other villagers holds for him. You see, inside Naruto dwells a monster - A monstrous nine-tailed fox that nearly levelled the village before it was sealed into Naruto. Despite his social seclusion, Naruto has a dream: To become Hokage, recognised as the most powerful ninja in the village. And so starts the trials and tribulations of Naruto. He's quickly placed in a team with Sakura, a girl he's liked from a distance for a time; Sasuke, the sole surviving member in the village of the incredibly powerful ninja clan Uchiha; and Kakashi, a world-renowned ninja with an unorthodox teaching style. Together, they form Team 7 and go on missions and adventures together.\nIt's kind of hard to judge the story of Naruto at first, because it's kind of aimlessly chronicling the growth of Naruto into a more mature young man (he's not even a teenager when the manga starts). It's an interesting set-up for a shounen manga, considering it puts the characters in situations where they have to kill as they are just children. But the ninja world has not a care for your age, just your capability- is what I'd like to say, but good luck pushing out 700 chapters of a bleak, survivalist manga through Weekly Shounen Jump. Naruto instead falls into its oft-criticised \"befriend them to death\"-formula, where Naruto's sheer perseverance and good-heartedness lights a path to victory. Maybe it sounds like I'm dissing it, but I really like it - to a point. The first part is a very strong manga, thanks to some great character work and rather brave story-telling that you don't normally see in straight shounens.\nTo the characters, then. Surely the most important aspect of a long manga. Does Naruto succeed in creating memorable characters that keep you coming back? The answer is obviously yes, due to its enormous popularity, but in a very limited way. Hardly any characters except for the main quartet gets any real development, and one in the quartet itself is so poorly written it feels like an affront to manga in general.\n\"How's Naruto, then? Surely the main character is well written?\" Yeah, I'd say so, and I'd say that Kishimoto succeeds in having the story led by Naruto's motivations and actions, rather than Naruto always being led around the nose. That said, he's uncompromising in a way that is endearing at first, but becomes ridiculous naïvety as the manga grows older. Like with almost all other aspects of the story, Naruto's growth through the story doesn't work with the growth of the readers. Say you were 15 when Naruto started. You're 30 now. Still, the tone of the manga and the characters have hardly moved an inch. It's weird. I'm an adult now, but Naruto's still a kid with training-wheels. Harsh, yes, but so was reading the final act.\nA lot of that can be simply attributed to the fact that Naruto is just a young man throughout the manga, even if he does grow up, to an extent. But his growth is made nearly void at times, with other characters having become leaps and bounds more mature and responsible. While he's still young, a lot of the focus of the manga is pointed at young ninjas having to grow up quick or die.\nAs far as the character itself, Naruto can be looked at quickly and have you say \"he's just another stupid, strong lead character.\" Thing is, Naruto is about as far from that trope as you'll get in shounen manga, while still being forced into its trenches. He's brash, crude and very rash, yes, but he's also very intelligent and compassionate. He can both plan ahead and come up with tactics in a hurry, given him being very flexible. That's what makes it even more frustrating when Kishimoto makes him into a staunch redeemer who basically befriends people to death. Where's the Naruto that makes tough calls for the greater good (the greater good)? He sure isn't in this manga. Having been possessed by the Kyuubi since birth, you'd expect Naruto to be more pessimistic at least some of the time, and make some bad decisions out of old hatred. But we can't have darker character development, can we, Kishimoto? That's not to say that Naruto doesn't have his share of dark moments, but I feel it's an area that was sorely unexplored.\nAs for the other main characters:\nKakashi is the team leader, and the adult of the group. Having become a high-level ninja at a young age, he knows how to make tough decisions and has no great qualms about killing. As a teacher, he is strict, but loving, and comes to see his three trainees as children with time. He's calm and collected, nearly always finding time in battle to come up with a plan to strike. He's also obsessed with reading a certain romantic series that later becomes embraced as a running gag and story development. He's also got a special tool - one of his eyes house a special eye (kind of hard to explain, but special eyes basically make you able to use better ninja-techniques) that allows him to easily see his opponents' moves and intercept them with incredible speed. Being a high-level ninja, Kakashi is proficient in every sort of jutsu (technique, as in \"ninjutsu\" = ninja technique) around, and he seems to have virtually no weaknesses.\nSasuke is a pretty standard shounen cool-guy character. He's handsome, calm and collected, and of course he's incredibly talented. He's also got a bloodline limit (aka a power limited to those who share a specific bloodline) that is ridiculously powerful, and whose evolution throughout the series becomes even more and more far-fetched. I went from initially hating Sasuke, to actually kind of accepting him, and then hating him again. What's frustrating with Sasuke is that, like many other characters in the series, his rationale and actions are haphazardly altered to fit the story. This leads to some awful reasons for his actions and his constant switching between good and evil, which grows extremely tiresome. It's also hilariously predictable to see where he's going to end up, so most of his scenes become a drag.\nOnto Sakura, the most frustrating part of the main cast. Is it because Sakura is a bad character? Well, duh. Sakura is this series' damsel in distress. That's not to say that she's absolutely useless, or that she doesn't have any redeeming qualities, because she does have some good moments. But it's all brought down due to her basically being a love-slave to Sasuke. Whether he tries to off her or is just being a standoffish douche-hat, Sakura is perpetually enamoured with him. Even as she grows up to be a (supposedly) more mature young lady, she still clings to this saddening pretence of what love's supposed to be. The subject of love in manga/anime is almost always a source of vitriol for me, as it's almost always written abominably bad. The Sakura-Sakuke dynamic is another one of those. At least the series' other major (major being arguable) romantic angle, Hinata being into Naruto, has some legs to stand on (despite how rarely Hinata has any meaningful part in the plot) as she actually gives reasons for being in love with our goofy lead man. Sakura's like a programmed woman, designed to submit herself whenever Sasuke shows up. It's kind of a slap in the face where Sakura ends up after having been given no deeper explanation during the series' 700 effin' chapter run. I think ladies reading Naruto will feel insulted, and with good reason. I'm not saying Kishimoto hates women, but I do think he's clueless as to how to write them.\nMost of the supporting cast are what they need to be and are playing their simple roles. There's the gutsy ones, the comedy relief ones, the cool ones, the smart ones, and so on. It's very standard fare for shounen manga. \nFinishing up with art: It's nice. Sorry, I'm not an artist. The initial art starts out very so-so, as Kishimoto is finding his style, and moves on to be quite sleek and very pretty. The backgrounds can be quite lazy, but it's not my biggest complaint, so no bother.\nFinishing up the spoiler-free part, Naruto isn't really something I'd recommend for anyone else but someone who wants to read a big shounen adventure. Naruto might be right up your alley, or you might absolutely hate it. I've learned to tolerate it, and think there are enough redeeming qualities in it (I mean, I finished 700 chapters of this saga) to warrant a passing grade. Naruto uses a lot of build-up that ends up going nowhere and/or being shafted for more \"acceptable\" reading. I get the reasoning, but it's not for me any longer.\nAlright, lads. Spoilers are on from now. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.\nNaruto's main problem to me is the lack of a focus, as it just leads to five different plots at once. Naruto going off on his own and other characters given time as well. The second part of Naruto is the glaring example of this. After the time-skip, characters just haven't changed in general, which makes it pretty fucking meaningless.\nMost arcs after the time-skip are sooooooo looooong, and the ninja war being the biggest offender. Everybody gets a mega level-up and are epic-ing their faces off at everything moving and it's just become so blasé at this point. The Akatsuki arc has a promising start, but loses traction very early and just spins it's wheels until Naruto shows up to pummel it to dust, with kindness. Sigh. Technically it lasts until the end, but nobody really thought of the ending as Naruto vs Akatsuki, did they? Thought so.\nAlso, how many training arcs are there? Man, Naruto stood on its own legs for a while, and then went complete Dragon ball with the characters' developments.\nThe final pairings are also a complete joke in some aspects. Sasuke and Sakura being married has to be the most abusive relationship ever. I'm okay with Kakashi being named Hokage, even if it didn't seem like a role he'd ever want to have. Others are just paired together due to fan demand, which I guess works.\nLike many people, I think the series lost its way somewhere after the time-skip (even if the final arc before that was hilariously bad). The battles grew longer, and the characters became caricatures of themselves. The villains became dumber and dumber until the final big bad shows up for a trans-dimensional tour.\nAlright, thanks for reading. Want to ask me something or just cuss at me? Hit me up.

Want to let people know that you are someone they can share that interest with?  You are stuck with Naruto.

I hate it for all the generic reasons I could parrot at you that I am supposed to hate it.  I am a One Piece fanboy.  I wait for jump to come out every week so I can read that and Beelzebub.  I naturally love Hunter X Hunter, too.  I am the shonen-reading adult male american snob stereotype, excluding everything that is naturally accessible to normal westerners, to young children.\nI read Naruto just about every week, too.  It isn't really more than a couple minutes out of my day, killing time; and then I can try and have a conversation later with all the people who show some little smidgen of interest in what interests me.

If you think Chipotle is \"authentic\", if you don't know who Edward Said is or why I am mentioning him here, if you think professional wrestling is real, if you like Evanescence or System of a Down, if you are reading this through a time machine from ten years ago, somewhere in the culturally deprived breadbasket of the USA: Naruto might be a good fit for you.\nOh well, it beats making smalltalk about football when I lost the ability to care about that entirely 15 years ago, or sports in general, or celebrity news.

		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=24,   ["text"]="           \n    Years and years ago a magazine called Shounen Jump came out in America. A lot of kids went wild over so many manga in one place, it was like a dream of sorts. Many interesting manga were in Shounen Jump like Yu-Gi-Oh and Dragon Ball Z which was put on air in America so there was some familiar faces and hopefully more to add to the memories. One manga that caught my eye was a little manga by the name of Naruto.\nAt first Naruto seemed like a very interesting manga. I mean what more could you want? It's got Ninjas! But as the story progressed\n          \n        I realized that not even ninjas could save a dieing storyline.\nIn the beginning Naruto had some promise of an interesting story. An ambitious ninja who wanted nothing more then to be the head of the village. It would be no easy walk in the park so he would have to train hard and learn lots of new moves to be on top of the game. \nAs the story progressed I noticed that the protagonist had really only learned a few basic moves after long periods of training. I also noticed that there were far more interesting characters who deserved spotlight. Rock Lee: A determined young martial artist who trained day in and out trying to keep up with a natural born genius of the Hyuuga clan who fought against what potently are magicians with his bare hands. How cool is that! Nara Shikamaru: A overall pure genius that is to lazy to give a damn that he is a genius. Aburame Shino: A mysterious young man who uses bugs to fight.\nJust like in the manga and I quote \"Your not the kind of person that could be the main character in a manga Naruto\". They should have stuck with that in the rough draft of the story.\nIn my eyes story of Naruto tries to tell us to stay determined and if we work hard enough we can achieve anything. I do believe that is a good message, but all I have learned from the character Naruto is that if I tap into my dark side I won't have to do any real work. \nThe manga itself was good up until the naruto shippuden where things just started to get worse. \nNot that I care for looks but the artwork did get somewhat less detailed later on in the story. To some this is a critical aspect of the manga.\nThe storyline from there only started to got sillier as the manga revolved around Naruto and Naruto alone.\nI would like to say more but I want to make this a quick little review with as little spoilers as possible.

		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=23,   ["text"]="          \n    Introduction:\nHello, and welcome! This is my very first Review, and the first installment of my three hundred part series: Review Rants for Smart People who Read Really Really Fast. I decided to go with the manga Naruto because it was my first exposure to manga ever. This was back in middle school. I had just finished the second season of Naruto (arguably it's best season) and I didn't want to wait to find out what happened next. So I picked up a copy of the latest Naruto manga. \nFor a kid who's only exposure to comics were Batman and Garfield, Naruto completely blew my mind.\n          \n        It wasn't until many many years later, after becoming more familiar with anime and manga, that I realize Naruto is actually a very bad manga. Why? Well to put it simply, Kishimoto, the author of Naruto, sold out, bad. As the manga progressed, especially past the time skip, Kishi's artwork became lazy, his characters left undeveloped and forgotten, his plots overindulgent, his storyline practically non-existent, and his world left contradicting itself over and over again. \n(Warning: Spoilers ahead)\nCharacters: 6 (Fair)\nLet's start with the good. Before the time jump, Naruto's strongest feature was its undeniably charming character development. From Shikamaru to Zabuzza, each of the characters were given unique personalities and trials to face. The best example of this is Rock Lee. Rock Lee is a recurring character in Naruto. However, unlike the rest of his peers, Rock Lee is the only character who cannot use ninjutsu or genjutsu, essentially magic attacks. Thus, Rock Lee spent every minute of life devoted to honing his physical abilities, to the point where he could go toe to toe with some of the strongest characters in the story. However, a mere 50 chapters later, Rock faced an opponent so strong that despite his best efforts, he was crippled by his opponent's attacks, never able to use his physical prowess again. This concept of losing the only gift you were born with, something you spent your entire life honing, was exactly the type of risk-taking plot-line that made this manga so captivating and endearing. Prior to the time skip, Naruto was chalk full of characters and side-stories like Rock's. \nNow for the bad. Despite it's plethora of interesting characters prior to the time skip, after the time skip, the story focused only on 2 characters - Naruto and Sasuke, arguably the two worst characters of the story. Let's start with our Heroine. Naruto is your typical wild-child main character, which is fine. But the thing I hate the most about Naruto is that his life makes absolutely no sense. His goal in life is to become the Hokage (sort of like a prime minister). Of course, since it's a shōnen, everyone has to make fun of him for it and claim he's not good enough - prompting the proverbial \"I'll show you!\" from Naruto. Well, it's not until later in the story that it's revealed that Naruto is the son of the previous Hokage. Now, let me ask you - have you ever heard of a celebrity's kid who wasn't overhyped? Basketball fans, do you remember how everyone was saying Michael Jordan's kids were going to be the next MJ? As it turns out, they weren't even good enough to play basketball at the college level. That's what happens in real life. Celebrity kids fail to live up to expectations. Naruto is the complete opposite. Naruto has no expectations from anyone to the point of being downright disrespected as a person. This make absolutely no sense, yet it's a pivotal aspect of the story that is touched upon over and over and over and over again. Similarly, everyone starts off hating Naruto because he has the power of the Fox. However, later in the story, it's revealed that Naruto's father saved the village by preserving the powers of the fox in Naruto's body - another point that makes no sense in retrospect. Would you hate the kid who who's protecting you and your family from a giant fox monster, who's only crime was occasional vandalism? Let's move on. Sasuke is the prototypical \"genius\" character. However he's only a genius in the sense that Kishi is constantly reminding us that Sasuke is a genius through the thought bubbles of his other characters - namely Kakashi-sensei. In actuality, Sasuke is nothing more than a very serious idiot. For example, in the most recent arc (which is the fight between Naruto/Sasuke and Kaguya, the mother of ninjutsu), Sasuke's only notable contribution to the battle was running into a sword, which would have killed him had it not been for Kishi pulling the old deux ex machina switcheroo on us, promptly reviving him for no reason. The rampant use of deux ex machina completely kills the the sense of urgency that's necessary for reasonable character development in the second half of the manga. Characters need to develop with time and care, learning from their mistakes for better or for worse, not randomly just to meet the writer's goal of ending the manga at a cool 700 chapters. Along those lines, my biggest pet peeve in anime is being told that a character is smart rather than shown that a character is smart. Naruto is all about telling, not showing when it comes to its main characters.\nArt: 8 (Very Good)\nThe art, for the most part, was good. It's not Berserk, in that, the art isn't at the level of detailing every stick-bug on every tree. But the character designs are very original - based on a unique blend of modern and Sengoku styles. The fighting was especially ahead of it's time. From the character running with their arms behind their back to the use of hand seals, there were a lot of elements to Naruto's artwork that has been reshaped and regurgitated all over the anime/manga-verse. For example, it's not a stretch to think that without Naruto's implementation of hand seals, we wouldn't have the clap used by Alphonse Elrik, of Fullmetal Alchemist, every time he uses of Alchemy. (But of course some people might point out that Cloud's spell animation in 1997's Final Fantasy VII actually came first) Regardless, Naruto's art style became a lynchpin in modern anime in a lot of ways. However, as the manga progressed, especially after the midway mark, the art simply took a nosedive. While the art became more clearly drawn, and fancier, Kishimoto lost a lot of the charming creativity that made him so captivating in the first place. Taking a look at the fight scenes, one could say that Kishi just got lazier and lazier. In the past, he made it so that each of his character fought with a unique style that fit their personality. For example, Sasuke, the \"genius\" used a move called the Lion's combo, that required a handful of acrobatic moves performed in midair. The Lion's combo didn't do as much damages as Rock Lee's Reverse Lotus, or Naruto's physical attack, the Naruto Combo. But unlike Rock's attack, the Lions combo didn't hurt the user, and unlike Naruto's attack, the Lions combo didn't cost any chakra (inner energy). It was a move that made sense for a genius to do. Since the time skip, the fight scenes have essentially become who's energy beam is bigger, and what kind of cool animal shape your energy blast can it take on. Basically, Naruto became Dragon Ball Z, but with a worse story. \nStory: 1 (Pathetic)\nSpeaking of story, Naruto's main plot is one of the dumbest things you'll ever hear. To sum it up, it's - Naruto is a ninja kid that no one likes. He strives to become the Hokage by beating up people who want to take over the world, and making them change their point of view by teaching them the power of friendship. That is some kindergarten material right there. As I mentioned above, Naruto's story makes no sense, on top of the fact that it goes nowhere. The only thing that allows the story to progress is Sasuke, Naruto's best friend, who wants to leave the village to seek his own destiny of hunting down a wanted criminal, which sounds perfectly fine to me. But Naruto and friends seem to take extreme offense to this act of betrayal(?) and they try to hunt him down and bring him back for the high treason crime of deserting the village. Ok... So essentially the the village is a military base? Well, not quite, because Naruto was actually AWOL for practically the same amount of time that Sasuke was. In fact, he seems to leave the village whenever he wants, often visiting other towns with his perverted teacher, Jiraiya, for the sole purpose of spying on naked girls taking baths. The side stories are significantly better than the main story. In particular, the Shikamaru v. Hidan arc was very well done. The aforementioned Gaara v. Rock Lee arc was very well done. The Kakashi & Obito backstory was pretty good. The Haku & Zabuzza story concluded very well. And the Naruto & Sasuke rivalry at the beginning of the story was not bad, and the way in which it ended made sense. In general, most of the storylines (outside of the main plot) prior to the second half of the manga were very good. However, afterwards, like I mentioned before, Kishi sold out. What do I mean? Basically, he stopped taking risks. Let's take the Haku and & Zabuzza arc for example. There's no way Kishimoto would ever write another arc like that again. Simply put, the Zabuzza arc was violent, it was blood-thirsty, it was gritty, it was cold, it was heartfelt, it was edge of your seat action, it was friendship, it was love, it was loss, it was despair, it was hatred, it took us out of our world, Kishi even touched a little upon homosexuality (but not Yaoi) that was everpresent during the Sengoku period, especially amongst ninja clans. Nowadays, Naruto is all about Naruto changing the world by punching people until they understand the power of friendship. If that's not selling out to the mainstream, I don't know what is. Because of this extreme example of selling out, I'm going to negate all the good traits Naruto ever had, and leave it's story with a score of 1, aka straight up Pathetic.\n(EDIT) I reread the manga following Kishi's conclusion to Naruto in Chapter 700, and I was able to pinpoint Chapter 401 (a mere 50 chapters past the mid-way mark) as the exact moment Naruto turned to complete and utter garbage. At this point in time, Kishi could have easily wrapped up the manga and done the world a HUGE favor because Chapters 402-693 are completely worthless. By the time Kishi got to Chapter 401, all of the prior major story-lines wrapped up in a meaningful way except one - Naruto and Sasuke. Coincidentally, between Chapters 400-700, the only meaningful thing that happened was Naruto's final battle with Sasuke which started on chapter 694. Everything else was completely irrelevant and unnecessary manga filler. In fact, for the sake of your own enjoyment (and sanity), I highly recommend to anyone reading Naruto for the first time to read from chapters 1 to 401, then skip all the way to chapter 694 and read to the end (chapter 700). The characters will gain a few new attacks and abilities, but you won't have missed any meaningful story progression whatsoever. If anything, you've saved yourself a lot of time and headaches, and by doing so Kishi will actually seem like somewhat of a genius, as opposed to an idiot to all of us, who's memory of chapters 402-693 is still fresh in our minds. I'll even go as far as to say that skipping those chapters would raise the \"Story\" score from a 1 to a very respectable 7. That's how bad those 292 chapters were (yet they take up nearly half the manga). As for the conclusion of the manga, I think that its best not to give away any hard spoilers because it's one of those things that's most enjoyable the first time you see it. However, I'll tell you that it was something that Kishi had been planning for a long long time, and therefore, there's a very noticeable change in quality between chapters 402-693 and chapters 694-700. Because it wasn't what I call \"manga filler,\" it contained a lot of what we love about Kishi and Naruto. It becomes immediately obvious starting from the first page of chapter 694 the old (non-sellout) Kishi was back. From the art style, to the story, to the carefully crafted dialogue, everything was fulfilling. Even the resolution was pretty fun and entertaining. It doesn't make up for the ~300 chapters of absolute garbage that proceeded it, but it was a nice consolation prize at the end of a long long marathon. If you're ever interested in discussing the ending of Naruto, feel free to shoot me a message.  \nEnjoyment: 7 (Good)\nAs far as enjoyment goes, Naruto is a very easy story to begin, very hard to continue because the story just gets worse and worse. After a while, the characters even start blending together until they all become one big blob, and you have trouble telling them apart. Sasuke's the best example of this (Gaara's another example) - with his transition from genius to borderline mental patient - and now he wants to become the Hokage too. Anyways, despite essentially becoming DBZ, Naruto still has very unique artwork, and is wildly popular. So by following it, it can enhance your enjoyment of other mediums that carry the Naruto name. For example, video games. There are a lot of Naruto video games that are probably more fun if you actually read or watch the manga/anime. Sasuke in Jump Ultimate Stars is pretty good, for example, lol. \nComparison to the anime:\nThe first three or four seasons of the anime are very good, and you should watch it, if not just for the music. It boasts some of the best opening and closing scores out there, including Wind by Akeboshi, the first closing song that matches perfectly with the theme of the story, Go! by Flow, which was the best Naruto opening in my opinion, and Haruka Kanata, the song that really put Asian Kungfu Generation on the international scene. The story of the anime follows the manga up to that point. Afterwards, I would quit the anime entirely and switch to the manga. Naruto is not good enough of a show to warrant spending all that time watching. It's faster to read manga, and most importantly, there are no fillers. The Naruto fillers are even worse than trash. (nerd laugh)\nComparisons to similar anime:\nI'm going to compare Naruto to One Piece here, since they're alike in a lot of ways, with One Piece being about pirates and Naruto being about ninjas. However, the most important reason I wanted to compare Naruto to One Piece is to contrast each of the author's overindulgence in their own story. Naruto, especially after the time skip, falls into the cliche of stories that over-indulge in themselves. It's always about this guy trying to destroy the world, or this guy trying to enslave everyone, or this genius and that genius. Everything is way too hyped up, yet always end the same way - with Naruto beating them up. Naruto started out as a show about ninjas (ninjai?) and eventually turned into DBZ. You would think that a show about ninjas would show more discretion than to turn every scenario into a gaudy battle. One Piece on the other hand, despite being more more wild and unincumbered in what they can show because of their unrefined style, tempers it's readers interest by touching upon things that people can actually relate to. Luffy, the main character of One Piece, is out to make friends. He values freedom above all else. And even though he wants to become the Pirate King, he's not constantly out to save the world - he merely conquers it one island at a time. Saving the world is overdone and not cool. Freedom - that's cool. \nConclusion: 6/10 (Fair)\nNaruto is an alright manga that is meteorically popular. You should read it if you have the chance. The artwork is good and the side stories can be pretty interesting. And that sums it up folks. I know, I know, I'm awesome. Becoming a great reviewer doesn't happen overnight, you know. I had to kill my best friend in order to gain this power of awesome ranting. Muahaha! Ahem...er thanks for reading.\n        "},
		{["score"]=4,  ["helpful"]=16,   ["text"]="          \n    Naruto's success comes as no real surprise; the manga found many fans with its interesting characters, complex (but initially well presented) themes and a cliche but overall decent storyline, with many viewers and readers alike using it as their gateway to the greater world of anime and manga. This certainly doesn't come as a shock, since there's something in Naruto for readers from all ages; the cool techniques to captivate the kids and teenagers, the various aspects and popular elements mixed together in the manga, from romance to the cold war struggle throughout the manga between the villages to the morally ambiguous villains as well\n          \n        as discussing what brings people to hating one another for so long.\nThe manga's popularity isn't exactly a secret or something that's difficult to understand. What is difficult for many to understand, however, is the religious like following it has gained from fans around. I'm not talking about popularity here, I'm talking how whenever you find a Naruto fan, they legitimately tell you about how the manga is so perfect and how the anime ruined the manga, seemingly unaware of the manga's flaws or problems.\nThe problems start with the story; it's nothing we haven't particularly seen before (person wanting to become a leader), only here we have the themes of wanted to be accepted and acknowledged by society and fight discrimination both on a local and eventually on a more worldwide scale, which is pretty epic in scale once you think about it.\nThe themes aren't bad in themselves, but they dominate the manga and make the characters so defined by those themes that all their other, more interesting personality traits are completely shoved into the background or ignored. This is particularly shown in how the show sets up rivals to Naruto who always have some kind of contrast to Team 7, which gets incredibly repetitive and overblown after a while and takes away from whatever merits the story has.\nThis is problematic the closer the manga edges to its conclusion, since it then becomes clear that the writer had no idea what to do with the themes present in the story and ends up contradicting each and every single one of them. What we're instead left with is a broken mess narratively speaking, since the manga up until the early post-timeskip arcs feels nothing like how it becomes later on.\nThe power-levels are also broken to hell and back, since the show is willing to contradict its own logic and add aspects or themes that simply didn't exist earlier on in the show. This is especially grating near the end of the manga, where many plot elements that were unique and only slightly relevant completely take control of the show (the Sharingan being an excellent example of this).\nCharacter dynamics largely revolve around Naruto, who admittedly is a well-developed and increasingly more mature character the longer the manga progresses. The problem is that literally every character in the show is some kind of contrast to him, and they're so defined by him that later on in the manga, you have a better chance of seeing a character mentioning Naruto than you do of them mentioning themselves. Everyone compares themselves to Naruto, even earlier on in the manga. This becomes incredibly problematic when the themes start contradicting themselves later on in the manga, since so many of the characters are defined by the themes yet none of them ever point out Naruto's hypocrisy in believing in what he did at that point.\nSpeaking of Naruto's cast, this brings us to yet another problem that plagues almost aspect of this manga; balance.\nNaruto is easily one of the most unbalanced manga series I've ever read (especially as far as characters are concerned), with certain characters receiving a ridiculous amount of attention (Shikamaru and Kakashi stand out as particularly well-developed characters until the final arc) while others receive next to no attention outside of the arcs where they're introduced or focused on.\nOthers are clearly only present as a contrast of Naruto or Team 7, leaving us with them suffering as well when Naruto changes focus and contradicts himself; nobody points out the contradictions, everyone keeps hailing him as a savior, and the dynamics are completely ruined.\nThe artwork is generally pleasant but also has a nasty habit of ink being sprawled all over the place when their are action scenes, making it hard to follow up (especially near the end of the manga, probably due to the artist being tired or drawing so many continuous action scenes again and again). \nThe character designs have clear distinctions and identities of their own, which is a massive positive and makes it easier to remember the manga's enormous cast of characters.\nNaruto is a manga that ultimately is carried simply by nostalgia alone and becomes increasingly inconsistent as it progresses.\nThis isn't a bad thing, but the flaws become larger and more difficult to swallow the longer it lasts, leaving a bad taste in most readers' who have read the manga to the end.\nIt has some exceptional qualities, but those are hampered by the contradictory development that takes place later in the manga, meaning that an otherwise decent manga slides into being below average and increasingly forgettable.\nIn other words, it's a complete disappointment that leaves a bad taste in the average reader's mouth and is ultimately a product of a bygone era of anime and manga that simply didn't stand the test of time as far as quality is concerned.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=20,   ["text"]="          \n    My first manga review, and I've decided to base it on a franchise which I've followed for many years: Naruto/Naruto Shippuden. The Naruto anime was one of the very first I watched, and definitely played a big part in making me the anime/manga fan that I am today. The sheer number of filler episodes, however, caused me to end up putting it on hold/dropping it and now I just read the manga.\nFirst off, the story. For a number of years I loved the story and world of Naruto. By reading the manga (and watching the anime before that) I was introduced to a hugely imaginative\n          \n        and colourful world full of ninjas and their cool ninjutsu. I liked various ideas such as the different levels of ninja which existed: genin, chuunin, jounin, hokage; the need for sufficient amounts of chakra in order to perform ninja skills; the many hidden ninja villages which supported their countries and ruling lords as well as the tensions between them; the presence of organizations made up of outcast ninja who wanted nothing but to cause trouble. There were many other positive signs of Naruto becoming an engaging tale full of adventure and plot twists.\nOver 500 chapters later and I must admit I'm no longer sure about this. Around chapter 208, Naruto takes a time-skip of roughly two years and the anime marks this as the point it becomes Naruto Shippuden. The majority of Naruto before the time-skip, as well as the first few arcs of Shippuden, were pretty consistent in quality. Consistently good. There was plenty of story going on which included ninja exams, evil conspiracies, revenge and betrayal, organizations with complicated schemes, etc. You got the feeling that the main plot was moving along nicely (even if it sometimes felt a little slow and unevenly paced), with the side plots serving to flesh out the world of Naruto and its characters a smaller, but no less important, priority. \nHowever, a few hundred chapters into Naruto things start to go wrong, horribly wrong, and it becomes painfully clear (at least to me) that the manga should end with a fitting conclusion rather than drag it out any longer. One problem that's related to the story is the addition of new side plots which seem to either slow down the main storyline so much that it's easy forget what it originally was, or are used as a sole excuse for one of the characters to learn new skills and grow stronger (not much of a problem early on, but now it just seems repetitive and boring). Loose ends start taking way too many chapters to sort out and evil characters too long to deal with. Recent plot revelations disrupt the flow of events and makes me wonder why they weren’t revealed much sooner (other than just to extend the story); I don’t see why it’s necessary to wait hundreds of chapters before being shown Naruto’s full background or to found out more about the history of the nine-tailed fox.\nThe characters of Naruto play a large part in why I think this series is not as good as it once was, and it's an aspect which is hugely frustrating. It's obvious that for a long-running manga like Naruto there are a lot of characters, but Team 7 (consisting of Naruto, his closest friends Sasuke and Sakura, and their teacher Kakashi) and a few others introduced later get the most focus and development. Naruto’s fellow teenage ninjas all get their moments in the story, but for the most part they are there just to lend a helping hand to the main characters during battles. This isn’t a huge problem initially as Naruto himself is a likeable lead, with bags of optimism and personality which sees him overcome the prejudice everyone has towards him, as well as interesting team-mates with whom he gradually develops strong bonds with. Throughout the first half of Naruto the members of Team 7 each develop at a realistic pace as they gain new experiences through missions for their ninja village as well as encounters with their enemies. After the time skip these characters in particular seem to have matured a lot and are no longer the indecisive or fledgling ninjas who they once were. \nAt least this is what it seemed.\nWhen the major story events start occurring during Naruto Shippuden, certain characters (without naming anyone) revert back to who they were for no particular reason. The newfound toughness and maturity shown in previous arcs are replaced by actions which portray them as weak or just plain mad, with motives which don’t make sense; this leads to characters which, previously likeable, are now easy to hate. Female ninjas seem to suffer the most though, with most of them made to appear useless in terms of the storyline, or just completely forgotten about; other characters, too, just start disappearing from the story only to turn up again much later. Any character development up until now seems pointless, with much of the more important characters acting the same as they did two years earlier.\nAnother one of the things I used to appreciate about Naruto was how characters became stronger, built up their chakra levels and learnt new techniques as their ninja training progressed, while there were limits to their improvement. The world of Naruto initially contained certain rules, such as the concept of chakra and self-damaging high-level techniques, which prevented characters from becoming too powerful and no stronger than they ought to be. Shippuden does a good job of ignoring these rules; ideas and reasons which aren’t fully explained allow people to become as strong as they want to be as long as it is convenient for the increasingly muddled storyline. The ninjas in Naruto have special abilities, but they are still human, and therefore should not be having infinite potential/chakra levels. New villains introduced at this point are far more powerful than the recognised heavyweights of the ninja world, using ridiculous attacks several times. Even the title of Hokage, the strongest ninja of a village, doesn’t seem so grand anymore as too many characters surpass most of the existing hokages both in strength and abilities.\nThe art in Naruto is pretty good and I have few complaints. The main characters, as well as most of the supporting cast, have unique designs which makes it easy to tell them apart. There are numerous fights in this manga, and the majority are well-drawn with a large variety of ninja techniques on display which make them exciting to read. Locations such as the Hidden Leaf Village are quite detailed, and the addition of animals through the use of summoning techniques help to make the world of Naruto even more diverse.\nNaruto started off as a very good shounen series, even if a little clichéd, and was immensely enjoyable when it peaked at several points before the time-skip as well as during some of the Shippuden arcs. These moments are memorable and full of epic battles between multiple ninjas, and there are quite a few emotionally moving scenes/dialogue too. Unfortunately, this just makes it feel so much more tragic when much of what was great about Naruto is utterly destroyed by the last hundred or so chapters. It makes it seem as though the creator of this manga has grown complacent over his success, and is now allowing the series to run on its reputation alone. There are still stand-out moments in some chapters which mirror the greatness found in the earlier parts of the manga, but these are too few and are far outweighed by the amount of bad characterization, plot holes and slow plot pacing that have taken hold of Naruto since the time-skip.\n        "},

I heard aobut Naruto from my friend, and I first started watching anime. When I catched up with anime (that was about 60th episode of Shippuuden at that moment), I've read all of the manga in just few days, and now I'm up to date with  manga wince chapter 400 or something.\n--- Story --- 7 ---\nThe main story, all the thing about Jinchuuriki, Bijus, Akatuski, is pretty decent story itself. However, looks like Kishimoto (the writer of the Naruto manga) felt\n          \n        the glory of hving the most popular manga in the world, and now he doesn't want to end the story, he keeps more and more complicated things coming, more enemies, more plot twists... Which isn't the best idea. 460+ chapters is way too much for anybody. To be honest, I'm not really fan of Naruto anymore, but I'd simply feel bad dropping Naruto because I've watched and read so much that if I dropped it, then my effort to read so much would be meaningless. Naruto is dragging away from the story and I don't like it. But, as I said, it's good concept, so I'm giving it seven outta ten.\n--- Art --- 10 ---\nKishimoto's done some pretty good job with art, I must tell that. Though it was kinda crappy at some chapters, it's pretty good. Though I'd give him advice to draw fighing scenes and action scenes a bit better, too much actionish likes all arond the frame and all over the characters are making it be kinda fussy, and, to be honest, I never really understand the fighting scenes all that well, but it's not much to pay attention, right?\n--- Character --- 7 ---\nToo. Much. Charactes. I guess Characters and Story are pretty linked with each other and I can't separate them. Longer story is, more characters there are and it's hard to pay attention to each character separatelly, which means very weak character development. However, I enjoyed looking and comparing characters before and after the time skip. (Anime production screwed up with anime, separating it into two animes, \"Naruto\" and \"Naruto Shippuuden\" - it's all freakin' one anime).\n-- Enjoyment --- 6 ---\nIf Kishi could put the story in 300 chapters, I would adore the manga. 460+ chapters is a killer. How can I enjoy the manga which I m going to read as 80-year-old geezer with stick, running around the hose with Naruto's cosplay and doing Rasengans at neighbour's dog?\n--- Overall --- 6 ---\nEven if the Art was awesome, that's not increasing my opinion about the manga at all. Manga is overrated, that's for sure. The fact it's incrediblly long doesn't mean the story is awesome at all. I feel bad for telling this about pretty good manga, but if there was an end for the manga, I would adore it. \nKishimoto, end the manga already before it becoms too late.\n        "},

Some parts of the story are so rich that they could create another anime entirely on its own and still be great, even tough they would be detached from the main plot. Even so, the ending of the manga made it impossible for me to give it a 10/10, mainly due to the fact that many thing were left unanswered. It was predictable that sasuke was going to be forgiven\n          \n        and allowed back into the village, but this part felt very rushed, i think that after all this time we should have been allowed to see his forgiveness and return to his home in much more detail that what was shown to us. Chapter 700 is completely unessesary, everything in it seems utopic and covinient. \nArt: 8/10\nWhile the art improved greatly from naruto to shippuden, it still lacks in many aspects, so much that sometimes it looks like fanart (excluding all the great fanarts out there), intead of something made in a professional studio. While it does have great art at times i always felt like it needed more detail, mainly in scenes that were crucial to the plot.\nCharacter: 10/10\nThe characters from Naruto are amazing, they all have their own reasons and motives for doing what they do, even those who are considered villans have a great backstory that explains their actions in the present. Most of the character development comes, obviously, from Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura, all three of them have come a long way and changed a lot since they were kids in the beginning of the story. Sometimes their developed into something better and sometimes into something worse, but never without reason, which greatly contributes to the realism aspect of the story. The great diversity of characters in naruto also allows the viewer to fell more attached to the story, as there will certainly be a character that you will fell conected to in some way.\nEnjoyment: 10/10\nOnce you start watching it there is no way to get out of it, even tough there are some annoying plot aspects and the famous never ending fillers, this show kept me clicking next episode over and over until i could not watch anymore. Naruto has been a part of my life since i was a kid and i will surely miss watching it.\n"},
		{["score"]=3,  ["helpful"]=8,    ["text"]="          \n    An abysmal horror. Been reading Naruto since I was a kid. Near the end the story went down the toilet and everything sucked but I felt an obligation to the manga because of nostalgia. The ending was the worst and brings me pain even to think about it. There really was no resolution to the core conflict. As the story progressed the characters became less likable and diluted. And the whole \"new generation\" characters of Naruto are even more diluted than their parents.\nStill, I rated the art pretty high. When Masashi Kishimoto started out, his illustrations held a lot of emotion and love. Every time\n          \n        I went to read the Zabuza arc, I ended up crying when Haku died. Of course near the end, the art started to deteriorate (but I admit there were some very moving scenes). I felt that near the end of the series, Kishimoto was totally fed up with Naruto and wanted to end it as quickly as possible, leaving very large plot holes all over the place. And with his love of the series gone, the story became stale. Of course this sort of thing would happen after having to work on the same story for 15 years. There was probably 3% planning going in to the last arc of the manga. Also why did everyone get ugly.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=12,   ["text"]="           \n    The Naruto series gets alot of bad rep for how it went, especially after the time-skip/pain arc. I however find some people to honestly weigh too heavily on those faults.The debacle after the pain arc isn't really all that bad, especially when read from start to finish. There were some moments that were terrible and there were others that were fantastic. \nThe story is half decent, though it does have some minor bumps and hiccups that hurt the late game arcs, and over all it really does send a fairly positive message to the readers. I would have given this a 9, but after the\n          \n        war arc it just didn't seem right.\nThe art is pretty good though it starts to suffer sometime around the war. When kishi works however, he works, and I have too give him cred for his art when he does.\nThe weakness of Naruto is most present in its characters, which suffer various fates after the time skip. Many characters got thrown to the curb after the time skip, and slowly seemed to disappear. One of the biggest complaints of the war arc is that it didn't properly use its other characters. If you were not the main characters or the villain you were getting almost no screemtime. I never really cared much for the other rookies, so this didn't bother me as much as others.The villains after pain are also pretty annoying. Obito is a 5 villain, Madara is a 7 villain and she who must not be named is a 2. However, when Kishi does use other characters then team 7 and creates good villains, they do some great stuff.\nI enjoyed this series greatly and find some of the reviews on here to be a little brash and uncaring, only focusing on negative aspects of the series.This is why I wanted to share my own opinion. Though this story has many cliche shounen characteristics, it honestly doesn't ruin the story all that much, what really hurts the show is the characters and the nasty late game story arcs. I would have given this a 6 in all honesty if the series had ended at chapter 690, but it gets in 7 for a great ending(at least for me.)\nAll in all, Naruto is a good series that has some wasted potential, some great shit and some poor to fantastic characters. I would really recommend it, but if you don't like the time skip, then you should stop there or cut to the last chapter. \n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=6,    ["text"]="          \n    I honestly don't know what to say about this one that hasn't been said countless times already, but I'll give it a shot.\nDespite its anime adaptation's less than stellar reputation, this manga truly is something to marvel at. The story is incredibly well-crafted and captivating, often surprising me with revelations about their world 400+ chapters in that completely change how I view events that I've known to be a certain way for so long, and yet rarely does it ever feel forced or unnatural. Almost everything feels planned out perfectly. The only part where I feel the progression is a bit unnatural was the beginning\n          \n        of the very last story arc, since it kind of feels like Kishimoto had no idea how to defeat the main villain.\nMy only other notable complaint story-wise is the lead-up to the Fourth Great Ninja War, mostly because it introduces a barrage of new characters from all different villages a bit too quickly, and because neither Naruto nor Sasuke are present for a dozen chapters at a time to keep the character dramas pressing forward, causing the story to slow to a crawl for a bit. However, only having two complaints from 700 chapters of content more than speaks to the value of the writing.\nThe world building is absolutely fantastic as well. From the minute details of chakra (superpower life force of the week) control to the entire history of the shinobi (ninja), this world feels almost like a high fantasy in how incredibly rich and detailed it is. Any time a new piece of world building came up, I could barely tear my eyes away from the page.\nWhile the overall plot is fairly simple (save the world X number of times), it's the characters that truly drive this story forward. While sometimes too simplistic in his ideals, Naruto himself has grown to be one of my favorite shounen protagonists, will his undying will and pursuit of his dream becoming damn-near awe-inspiring in the latter chapters. He also becomes the prototypical example of an outcast youth striving to prove himself and gain the acceptance of his peers, and watching his journey from orphaned punk to savior of the world was absolutely incredible. The pain that he felt at his absolute lowest moments is so palpable that I actually cried a little bit.\nAs for Sasuke, I've gained a huge appreciation for his character by switching from the anime to the manga, as the full weight of his incredibly dark and depressing situation is much more focused and poignant. His path to revenge is one paved with hate, deceit, and breaking of bonds, and his descent into darkness is quite compelling. I actually cared when he did the wrong thing and strayed from the noble path, and, at times, I almost agreed with his actions because of his motivations, even when those actions were rather horrendous. My body shivered at the absolute dread that he experienced through his years of suffering, unwanted revelations, and growing malice towards what destroyed his once happy life.\nBecause of how exceptionally well-crafted both Naruto and Sasuke are, the way they play off each other is just a tad shy of writing genius. Their conflicting ideals and differing backgrounds shape them into perfect foils for each other to grow off of and inspire surprisingly engrossing debates of what makes a true shinobi.\nI could go on for days about the rest of the cast, but I think it will suffice to say that there isn't a single character that I adamantly dislike. I will say though that Kishimoto's genius does shine through in his foils and reflections of Squad 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) through the generations of past shinobi (The Legendary Sannin, Kakashi's squad, and Pain's group in particular), and by slightly altering the events that happen to these characters, it creates drastically different outcomes for the same character archetype and spawns a character study that almost feels like an academic study of character development at times (in a very good way).\nThe artwork, while not the most richly detailed or awe-inspiring that I've seen, still manages to be not only consistent and pleasant to view, but also decisively unique amongst its shounen peers, from the different designs of eye jutsu (techniques) to the Tailed Beasts that terrorize the ninja world. Unfortunately, once again, I must complain about a shounen manga having unclear and cluttered action scenes. It doesn't happen all the time, and when it's clear what's happening, it's extremely compelling, but when the frame gets filled to the brim with different actions and jutsu, it's almost impossible to tell what's going on.\nOverall, Naruto has been an absolutely fantastic read that I highly recommend. However, I also realize that I do have a lot of complaints about the series as a whole, and it caused me to question how high to score this series.\nThen I asked myself: do I want to go back and reread it right now?\n...\nYeah. I think I do.\n        "},
		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="          \n    This story has been a very long ride and it has had its ups and downs. I had to put the rating somewhere in the middle because of that. The story generally starts out pretty good and the characters, while a tad bit bland, had a lot of interesting concepts and had the potential to grow and become more, which was even sort of the point of the story.\nSomewhere between a third and halfway through the story, it started going down. Far down.\nSomewhere between halfway and two-thirds of the way through the story, it genuinely seemed like the author was just making things up as\n          \n        he went along. Every new plot twist and revelation felt worse than the last and every one of them felt like the writing was dropping off a cliff in terms of quality.\nSomewhere very quickly into the story, those lessons about functioning as a team and leaning how to be a ninja stopped mattering, because now everybody was just generic shounen fighting characters that you could see in most any story of the genre.\nBut where the story really seemed to come off the rails was in relation to Sasuke and his family. Their entire existence seemed like an enormous anchor that did nothing but drag the story down and force everybody to talk about how amazing they are/were no matter what they've done, without giving the audience any reason to actually think they are. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that their constant influence ended up ruining the story in the second half, because it seemed like nothing mattered unless they were involved.\nI loved the story toward the beginning, and it was sad to see how far it sank after that, but I still can't give this manga too terrible a rating based on that early run.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="an alright level. It starts out with some basic humor to capture your attention and keep you reading. The idea of a demon vessel that dreams of one day becoming the village leader. Going through different missions, suffering from a traumatic childhood, betrayal, action, drama, humor, and adventure all thrown in. It sounds decent no, but not really. \nIts more episodic in manga form. Parts of the story (side stories) were unnessacary, and took away from the main story. But it still manage to capture some interest so I continued. A little bit over after Naruto had turned older and went\n          \n        after Gaara, it started to loose its edge. Until finally it just became complete migrane to me, a few times I had to stop reading and force myself back into it. Sure the idea is good but the development of it just looses itself after awhile. \nThe art now. I have to say the mangaka's art was actually quite descent and fair to the story. It should fantastic detailing, a few that may need to be improved but good none the less. The scenary was alright in a beautiful way, though the character's images, sometimes it seemed they seemed a bit crossed eyed, marks a tad bit slanted, etc. But their bodies were actually good. I wouldn't put too much into the character as the background though. The backround though beautiful in its own right, didn't seemed as focused on as the character's were. Wether the mangaka wanted you to pay more attention to the characters rather then the background, I do not know. But I have to say it could do with a few minor improvements.\nNow time for the characters. I already complaned about the art, now their development. I have to say it wasn't as good as I would have hoped it to be. I found the character's development a bit jagged, boring, and poorly done once again. Half the time I zoned out in what they were saying while reading, okay a long story telled past becoming boring when a character tells it, not good at all. \nIf it isn't the story, characters, or art for me, then it is the plan humor in it. Though I found it a bit unlogic at times, the humor was great and provided me with a good few laughs. So my enjoyment of it was quite high over the others. \nOverall I would have to give it a six. The story may loose its edge farther along, lacking logic, and poorly written. But its fair to say it can proved good enjoyment occationly. \n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=7,    ["text"]="          \n    This is my first review here on MAL, so be nice to me. \nStory: 7 \nNaruto follows the story of Uzumaki Naruto, the son of the Fourth Hokage. Naruto, once he was born, had the Ninetales (Kyuubi) sealed in him. Wich lead to the death of his fathers, Minato and Kushina. Because of that, Naruto was rejected by the Konoha village. When he became a Genin, Naruto entered Team 7, with Sasuke and Sakura. And, the team leader, Hatake Kakashi.  \nNaruto, Sakura, Sasuke and Kakashi have a lot of battles, till the day, Sasuke left the village, in order to gain power. Sasuke trains\n          \n        with Orochimaru, Naruto with Jiraya, and Sakura trains with the fifth Hokage, Tsunade Senju. \nAfter 3 years of hard training, naruto returns to konoha, in order to defeat the Akatsuki, and make sure Sasuke returns to the village. The story goes with Naruto his friends becoming stronger, and fighting the Akatsuki. \nI don´t like it that much, there are to many deaths. And this makes them lose their natural impact. Also, in part 2 (Shippuden), the story looks the same thing, over and over. Part 1 was good, and original, but part 2, is extremely Overrated, because of the fights. I mean, the only fight, that was actually that good, was Sasuke Vs. Itachi. The others, were just, meh. Rock Lee vs Gaara, Sasuke Vs naruto in the valley, were much more crazy. \nArt: 7 \nNaruto has a good art, it´s not that bad, and not that good. I heard alot of opinions. Some people say, the original art, of Zabuza arc, and the Chuunin Shiken arc, etc. Was better that the actual Shinobi war arc art. In my opinion, it looks the same. \nCharacter: 6 \nNaruto is not very good in it´s character set. The only ones, that actually are \"good\", are Kakashi, Minato and Lee. Naruto is not a good main, imo. His friendship talk, is so annoying, and repetitive. \nEnjoyment: 7\nGood. It´s a battle shounen Manga, so why not?  \nOverall: 7\nA not that bad manga, but to Overrated. \n        "},

		{["score"]=5,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="          \n    Despite the international hype that Naruto received, it is NOT the best Shounen manga and is actually VERY POORLY written. Naruto gained enormous popularity only due to its strong opening chapters. At the beginning readers were introduced to a unique shinobi life and interesting characters, but then the publisher, blinded by the need to desperately extend the manga's fame for as long as possible, filled the series with endless fillers, repetitive flashbacks, numerous plot holes and ridiculous deus ex machina events, that ultimately ruined the series and turned away more than half its fanbase. To give the series some credit, Naruto was REALLY GOOD up\n          \n        until the Pain Arc and then the plot just took a turn for the worst. By the 400th chapter its main characters were unable to achieve any further character development and by the 600th chapter, characters suddenly ended up with abilities that were never introduced before. Having completed the manga all I recall is a naive & stubborn Naruto, a selfish Sasuke, and a pathetic Sakura. Seriously, for having managed to endlessly stretch out the series, I don't know how the writers weren't able to come up with better story lines. It's such a shame because Naruto started as an epic Shounen series and had SO MUCH POTENTIAL but ended up being one that readers were barely able to read, let alone enjoy.  Luckily I am one of the late readers of Naruto so I was I was able to quickly browse through chapters and skip the unnecessary and repetitive details. I honestly don't know how its dedicated fans stuck with this series for over 10 years. Only novice manga readers and teenagers would claim Naruto to be the best manga.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="            \n    Naruto is an amazing manga and many people, like me, have mostly continued on reading after watching the anime, which if you haven't it is definitely worth it to do both. As for my review:\nStory (9):\nThere were a few inconsistencies after a while, but that's to be expected in such a long story. What I like about this story is that underneath the whole ninja stuff, its really just about obtaining peace and for everyone to understand each other. \nArt (8):\nThe art isn't the most impressive thing in the world but its definitely worthy of such a great manga.\nCharacter (10):\nThe Characters are probably the best\n          \n        thing in this manga, especially Naruto himself. You see his growth and how he deals with villains along the way is really unique. Because this story is about everyone understanding each other, that's exactly what Naruto tries to do, understand his opponent, not just defeat them. Not to mention all of the protagonists are unique in their own way. Although if there's one thing Naruto definitely gets my praise for, its the villains. Most of them aren't just mindlessly killing because its fun. And they aren't \"evil\". They're doing what they believe is right for their own peace. \nEnjoyment (10):\nHaving said all that, the interesting story and characters along with the intense fights makes this a very enjoyable manga. There are very few times when I don't enjoy whats going on.\nOverall (9):\nEven though this is my favorite manga of all time I can't give it a perfect score if I try being really unbiased, plus nothing is perfect. Also the ending could have been a tad more detailed but all things considered its very fulfilling, you won't regret it.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="          \n    Why shouldn't I write a review regarding the manga series known as Naruto? It's basically the biggest reason why I became heavily invested into anime and manga alike. Truth be told though, I didn't read the entire series and only began doing so when, at the time, I finally watched the latest episode and, due to curiosity, have to resort to reading the manga to know what's next for the story.\nNow, six months since the end of the original series and three months since I snapped at the disbelief that Naruto ended, allow me to vent out my thoughts regarding, Naruto.\nBy now, Naruto is one\n          \n        the most overrated anime/manga series in the industry, along with the likes of One Piece and Bleach. But there's a reason why a lot of people still read and watch Naruto, because it's such a great presence in the anime/manga world that everywhere you turn you see Naruto in his orange suit, with a Rasengan in hand and a kunai at the other. Naruto is a big name, inside and outside of its origin country.\nThe story. Well, basically the story is simple on the surface, but once you get into it, the world of Naruto is vast and complex, tying Japanese culture into the mix, I mean, why not right? Despite its simple premise of the main character trying to persevere the hardships of a shinobi and eventually become the strongest, the presentation is, dare I say, top-notch. Fighting scenes are well-narrated and the plot twists are very much appreciated. Simply put, the story of Naruto is simply amazing.\nThe characters. The series has a diverse cast of characters, both heroes and villains. I can be forgiven for forgetting most of them but what really sets each character apart from one another is not the personality, but their respective jutsu and skillset. Once you get over it, you eventually see the character as a person and learn its personality and then you learn their past. Yada-yada-yada-yada, you get the point. Overall, the characters are memorable because of their skills shown and not mostly because of the personality, at least for me. I don't have a personal favorite if you're wondering.\nThe art. The best that I can describe the art of Naruto is that it's consistent, while at the same time improving on consequent chapters. Kishimoto's art style is very much recognizable and is worth of praise. The character's are well designed, backgrounds have full of detail, and the fight scenes are well presented, even in manga form. Overall, it's just good, nothing too fancy.\nVerdict. Naruto will forever remain a hallmark of manga and I really enjoyed reading it. I may not be worthy of saying that it's the best out there, but to me, Naruto made my childhood and teenage-hood a bit fuller, and that's saying something.  And now as I wait for the anime to end in a similar fashion while still watching all these fillers, I'll look forward to the next big thing that can be as good as or surpass in a series of this caliber.\n        "},

Kishimoto ruined them too and just focused on Naruto and Sasuke \"the main cause of the self destruction\"\nStory: 4 maybe 3\nas we start reading this manga it's about a boy who is out cast of his Community/Village due to circumstances that are far from his mistakes and we see him as he struggle throw his days and trying to make friends and making his village accept him.. then we have the typical Rival/Antisocial friend along with other characters some are typical in every shounen anime while others are quite unique.. but what eventually goes wrong?? the cause of the self destruct of this Manga is basically that Kishi decided to only develop Naruto and Sasuke and just forgetting the others.. and just pull new villains out of his anus hole out of no where and saying guess what?? the previous villain was not actually a villain here is the REAL villain.. and in the end who was the real villain actually?? NONE yup that's right every villain was just misunderstood and could be reasoned with eventually .. but you gotta have someone to blame in the end right?? yea will here comes the worst part.. the final villain was so poorly done it felt like a 5 year old kid righting some rubbish to his parents by saying in the end \"Yaaaaay I can make a villain in the last 50 chapters that no one ever heard about and no clues was ever said about it.. yup that would make the Manga epic right?\"\nSee what I'm trying to say here is Kishi just extended the manga soooooo faaaar from his capabilities and couldn't handle it in the end.. leading to absolute failure in the ending.\nOverall: 4\nso should someone read it ?? probably not.. why did I read it till the end?? because I couldn't just leave it and waste all of those years to nothing.\n        "},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=5,    ["text"]="           \n    Realizing that reading 15 years of Naruto doesn't really make one a ninja, I decided I wanted to make a review of Naruto, but ended up just discussing the impression it left on me.I picked up Naruto in probably, oh fuck, mid 2000s?, and pretty much got hooked from the start of the series. The whole beginning arc resonated well with me, as I could really relate with Naruto with the feelings of pain, loneliness, and wanting to be accepted by others, plus I was still in high school at the time and who didn't go through that, ya know? Plus there was this whole\n          \n        pregnancy thing that happened and trying to figure out who the baby daddy was and just lot of other shit happened, but I'm getting off topic. So yeah, I really like the opening arc to the story as I could relate to the main character and plus the side characters were interesting; by the side the characters I mean of course the rest of team 7, Kakashi, the only ninja in the entire series that conceals his fucking identity, Sakura, the bipolar ninja, and Sasuke, the heart-throb and the cause of lady (and mine) boners everywhere. I kept up with the series up to the point of the final stages of the chunin entrance exams and then sorta of fell out of it for awhile, idk, I guess i kinda lost interest. It stayed that way for awhile until I heard that it was ending, back when it was in the mid-600 chapters and I marathoned my way through until I had finally caught up with the most current chapter, the beginning of the fourth great ninja war; after that it was same thing, wait for it to continue, rinse, repeat, yadda, yadda. Having finally finished it though, and looking back on it, it's definitely a good shounen adventure, would I go back read it again? Probably not. I like Naruto, just not a super die-hard fan of it, but then again I would rather spend my time finding something new to read. It's not just Naruto though, a lot of manga I'm the same with, I just do not have the desire to go back and read through them, unless your Claymore, and Claymore is just fucking cool, but that is beside the point. The story to Naruto, while entertaining (this is where the good part comes in) does have its moments of being just down right goddamn boring ( I'm looking at you chunin exams, pre-shippudden arc, and fourth great ninja war). The beginning of the series start off dark and depressing as your first introduced to Naruto and his story of how he is an orphan and has this monster living inside of him that causes the whole village to straight up treat him like shit, but gives him the drive to become great and have the people one day respect him, that's a good beginning. The whole Zabuza arc was really good as well as it introduced that first real major threat, and one the cooler bad guys for the series, for the team to come together and defeat, plus it has the touching ending of redemption and forgiveness at the end between Zabuza and Haku. The chunin exams is really where there story takes a nose dive for me; not only does it introduce a lot of new characters into the story, but the whole arc moves at such a slow fucking pace that it is painstaking to get through. The worst part of this arc, to me, is that it introduces one of the most down right evil villains to come from manga, and that is Orochimaru. Many of the villains in Naruto have some tragic back story and which sets them down the wrong path in order to achieve their goals, Gaara ( more on him later), Madara ( who had the same vision as his old rival the first hokage, but due to prejudice against his (Madara) clan, the uchiha, made him set out to acquire power to make everyone equal in his mind), and Pain ( who through a childhood riddled with war, strife, and the lost of a dear friend made him resent the world and set out correcting through force). Orochimaru had none of those qualities of the other villains, he was just evil. The boogeyman of the ninja world who studied black magic to prolong his life and seek out even more powerful jutsu. Throughout the story, just the mere mention of his name made the other ninjas of Konoha be one their guard for they never knew when he would strike at the village. This is where my problem comes into play for the introduction of him though, the slow ass forest death portion of the chunin selection exams. Do not misunderstand, it was awesome how he infiltrated the village, but my beef with it is that main focus of it is focused on the kids, who just have boring fucking powers and really have no fucking clue what is going on besides just trying to survive and make it to the next part of the exam; it would have been cooler to me, to have this part of the story more heavily fixed on the jonin of Konoha, and the other villages, just to see the whole political aspect of the Naruto universe. That is what the chunin election exams were mainly for, yes, it was a rite of passage for the children of each village to prove their worth of becoming a ninja, but it used by the adults to gauge each nations military strength. The presence of Orochimaru completely threw the chunin exam in chaos and it would have been cool to just all the jonin sitting around discussing their next move and planning how to counter Orochimaru and also know more about the dark dealings between the villages of sand and sound. One of the arrangements that was between the villages of sand and sound in the plans to overthrow Konoha, was the sand's secret weapon, Gaara. Gaara was played, the same way as Orochimaru, as being very mysterious and threatening, but came off as being emotionless; though later, the story shows that is not the case as he gives his back story  explaining that he is also a vessel for one of the tailed beasts, but unlike Naruto, he never had anyone that could comfort him and his life was in constant jeopardy. Through this harsh reality, he came to conclusion that he would only love himself and care only for himself. Now, the problem I have with this is that all this done through a super long flash back, but, hell, all this could have been done with a discussion between Orochimaru and the Sand Jonin, that went with Gaara and sibilings, instead of all this flash back bullshit from both the genin and jonin. Okay, I hate to do this with my so called \"first review\" of a manga, but at the time of me writing this I'm legitimately, like wrecking my brain, trying to being all analytically correct with the series, so if it becomes shit while reading, I'm sorry. So, yeah, after all that bullshit, Sasuke ends becoming cursed by Orochimaru and ends up down for the count until like the final part of the chunin exams, so its pretty much let's get rid of him for now and not really explain what is going on with him until much later on, Jiriaya is introduced and it is less than stellar, Naruto is learning how to control the nine-tails chakra without being devoured by it and also learning the power of summoning jutsu, and then there is a break thrown into the exam for the contestants to catch a break and to get ready for the final part of the exam, with, keep in mind, the konoha jonin looking for Orochimaru and turning up nothing; plus, flash backs and back story. Are fed up you with needless exposition, yet? No? Good, because here comes some more. So, like after the whole exam bullshit and the defeat of Gaara and the saving of Konoha, which barely makes it, Sasuke becomes all emo from realizing that Naruto has actually surpassed him and he has a total bitch fit and runs away to find Orochimaru to become stronger, plus that lost to Itachi only added fuel to the fire. Oh yeah, Itachi is in this as well. Now when I said Konoha barely survived, I meant it as the third Hokage gets killed from the battle with Orochimaru, and Konoha needs to find a new leader quickly, so Jiriaya takes Naruto to train with him (more training, awesome!) and also look for Tsunade, the third Sannin, to convince her to become the fifth hokage. Naturally, of course, she does not want to become Hokage as (get ready for it) another flash back shows that both her lover and younger brother both wanted the same goal and ended up getting killed for the same dream. Now, Orochimaru did not walk away from the battle with Third unscathed, as his arms were basically sealed away, which lead to constant pain and being unable to use jutsu, so he to is looking for Tsunade, as well, to get her to heal his arms, so that he can once again be able to use jutsu and destroy Konoha. This, however, leads to conflict between him and Tsunade, as she has had a change of heart because of ( you guessed it ) Naruto ( praise the Sage of the Six Paths for Naruto). Jiriaya and Naruto arrive on the battle scene and even with their efforts combined with Tsunade's they barely manage to fend off Orochimaru; with another pull-out-the-ass victory, they return to Konoha to have Tsunade become the Hokage and then Jiraiya and Naruto leave to venture around and train, which leads to the Shippuden arc. This is where the story actually picks up again for me, as before this, it just feels like needless filler. The slow pace and introduction of so many new characters just really bogs down the advancement of the plot and, truthfully, it could have probably been done in a much better way. It's like Kishimoto  has all these cool ideas and characters to introduce, but decided to just throw all of that fucking shit into your face at one time. Shippuden is, thankfully, not like that; to me, this is where the story actually picks up again and is just one big fun ride after another, until the end that is, with the fourth great ninja war. That ending arc is just one big massive shounen power-up and de-power-up fest that drags way to long. The only way I could possibly compare it to anything is by using Gurren Laggan as an example, where I just found the power-ups in that show to be show over the top goofy that I just could not help, but to be entertained by it. Anyway, I think I have been harping on this for way too long, negatively at least. The main thing is Naruto is good, with really great characters, awesome fight scenes (watch Orochimaru vs. the Third Hokage and Naruto vs. Pain, just to get started) and there many feels to be had with the series. I know it seems like I just down right hate the show, but I don't, there was just a lot about it that I felt like needed calling out. Before I keep repeating myself, it's Naruto, I enjoyed it all the way through and that is basically it. BELIEVE IT!  \n        "},

There are so many things that I like about this manga that I wouldn't be able to fit it all.  However, if I had to choose, the two things that make this an award winning manga would be the art and the characters.  The art is very artistic which brings out the charm of the manga.  The art allowed you to see what the characters were actually feeling which made it funny and enjoyable at the same time.  There were also some serious\n          \n        moments which brought out the action portion of the manga.  The characters were also very well done.  They were able to react to real life situations in a realistic way but also react to them in a comical way.  Throughout the manga the characters showed real growth and development.  Between the first and last chapter you could see that the characters changed from snot nosed kids to full grown adults.

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="           \n    This is probably the best manga ever, with the best character development ever and best storyline ever but why would you just THROW EVERYTHING WITH SUCH A BAD END?? \nThat's why I give it the 9. Because Masashi Kishimoto just seemed to feel like he was doing it too much like a masterpiece and said \"I should probably ruin this now, so it isnt as good\" why? I don't know.. or maybe he just wanted some way to continue it somehow, maybe he thought it'd be a good idea but it's just the worst idea ever. \nLeaving those awful points behind, unlike the anime adaptation\n          \n        whose art sucks, this art does complement the amazing storyline it has in a pretty decent way, I'm giving it a \"very good\" 8/10 because it lacks the abnormality of the anime.\nCharacter I give it a 10/10 being really honest, I do believe this one has the best character development ever and due to its length this goes even beyond what you usually expect from a good anime. I'd say characters are the best part from the whole series. Naruto has just too many characters and their storylines are never poor (except by sakura, this character I do feel lacks a lot, specially for being considered as a \"main character\", I'd even say she MUST be considered a \"filler character\" as she does have a role in the manga but it's a role others assign to her, her personality is nothing special and anything that can be important about her isnt really hers, won't get too much into it in order not to spoil)\nEnjoyment is a 9 out of 10 only because of the disappointment you feel when you get to the last chapter because apart from that I read first 400 chapters in like a couple of weeks out of nothing but excitement. It's a really long manga but that makes it even better. I hate anime/manga when they are too long and I'm not fond of manga, I'm more an anime person but this manga was amazing to me. I bought 56 out of their 70 volumes in real life paper and treasure them all. 100% recommend reading, maybe you even do like the ending I hated so much.\n        "},

		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=2,    ["text"]="            \n    Naruto is one of the longest-running series of all time, yet it has finally come to an end. If you're reading this, it's likely because you want to know if this manga is even worth your time. Unfortunately, that's not a simple or easy question to answer. However, I have ventured to attempt such an explanation!\n(If you're just curious about what happens at the end of the story, I’ll include a link to a \"spoilers\" version at the end of the review)\nAlright, let’s get something out of the way right off the bat: this thing is LONG! Weighing in at 700 chapters, starting this manga\n          \n        is no simple task, nor a small commitment. You could read a chapter of this series every single day, and it would STILL take you over two years to finish! If that idea scares you, you might as well stop reading right now and give up on Naruto. Trust me, it’s good, but it’s not THAT good.\nNaruto is so long and so complex, that summarizing the story is virtually impossible. To make it as simple as I can, I’ll begin by explaining the setting of the story. Naruto is the name of the titular character, a young, mischievous boy who lives in a village populated almost exclusively by ninjas, but not the sort of ninjas you might expect. A \"ninja\" in this series could basically be interchanged with \"warrior\". Masashi Kishimoto’s version of a ninja is heavily stylized, having more to do with supernatural abilities and imaginative costumes than anything grounded in reality.\nNaruto aspires to become a ninja himself, and has the lofty dream of one day becoming \"hokage\" (the leader of the village). Naruto learns early on that he is different, and that part of the reason he is estranged by many of the villagers is because of events that took place in the village when he was born. Naruto really isn’t very good at ninja-ing at the outset, perhaps making his eventual rise to prominence all the more interesting, but also subjecting us to his childish and irritating sense of humor. Is it entertaining? Perhaps, but definitely not something that’s going to tickle everyone’s funny bone.\nIt turns out that this \"curse\" Naruto has been afflicted with is more complex than he realizes, and Naruto spends much of his journey learning to control the ailment that he suffers from. This series essentially just follows Naruto over the course of several years as he learns more about how to become a ninja, and control the many unique, seemingly magical abilities that ninjas have access to. Seeing as we have seven hundred chapters to work with, we see a LOT of Naruto’s story as he grows more and more powerful over the course of time.\nA series this long could have the potential to drag, but I really never felt that way in this case. I almost felt the opposite—that there was so much story packed into those chapters that I almost had to pause and take a break once in a while. Again, this sort of pacing is not for everyone, as some people prefer a slower pace or perhaps a plot that it less action-driven (which this series most certainly IS).\nAs for the action-driven nature of the show, well, it’s actually quite good. Normally a story with too much action simply feels cheap and shallow, but \"Naruto\" knows how to toe the line to avoid this feeling. Being exclusively about ninjas, we were bound to get a lot of action. In fact, this series focuses so heavily on combat, that there’s really no reason to pick up the series if it’s not something you enjoy. \nCombat in this series is very well depicted, if perhaps drawn out a bit much at times. Usually, a fight is resolved when a character manages to outsmart or trap his or her opponent, rather than one character simply breaking out his super-special-secret attack. This makes for a much more cerebral and calculated experience than one might expect from a shounen, which is something I found to be very refreshing. It’s somewhat ironic that Naruto himself is such a knucklehead in a world where brain usually beats brawn, but through sheer willpower and determination, Naruto manages to keep moving forward and winning one hard-fought battle after another.\nNow, seeing as ninjas in this series basically have magical powers, it would be very easy for this show to succumb to what I like to call \"Dragonball Z Syndrome\". What is DBZ syndrome? Well, to put it simply, in the tenth episode of the show, a villain blows up an entire planet using only one finger. Needless to say, this leads to other combat sequences in the show feeling pretty pointless and the sense of scale is lost very early on. Thankfully, \"Naruto\" displays a lot of restraint in this area, and the godlike abilities are reserved for the very end of the series, where that sort of thing feels more appropriate.\nFight scenes, although well-choreographed, were sometimes difficult to follow. When all you have to work with is black and white lines, it can be difficult to tell what’s going on sometimes, and I think this is perhaps one of the biggest stumbling blocks for this series. I sometimes found myself staring at a frame for a minute or more before I could actually tell what it was depicting. I know that due to the nature of manga, using color is just too expensive and impractical, but I certainly found myself wishing for it a few times, if for no other reason than to distinguish the blurry characters from the exploding rock they were leaping from.\nSpeaking of characters, the cast is certainly worth a mention. The cast of \"Naruto\" is well…staggeringly large. I honestly don’t even know how many characters one could consider \"significant\" in this series. There are, of course, characters who see more development than others, but Kishimoto attempts to develop SO many characters that it can be difficult to keep track of everyone. The initial cast of thirty-something characters consists of a number of recruits similar to Naruto, each of which gets some measure of time devoted to learning who they are and why they want to be a ninja. \nAs refreshing as it is to have an action-focused series spend time on character development, it’s not always handled in the smoothest fashion. Kishimoto usually chooses to teach the reader about a character through the use of flashbacks. This wouldn’t always be a problem if there weren’t SO many flashbacks! With most other series, character development is done through the use of dialogue, or perhaps a character being placed in a situation where their reaction tells us about their past. However, Kishimoto’s attempts come across as rather ham-fisted. The series will introduce a new character, and as we get to know them, the default method is \"let’s have a flashback about something sad that happened to them as a child\". While this information is useful, and at times necessary for the plot, there’s virtually no subtlety to it at all. While \"Naruto\" was never intended to be the most \"subtle\" of stories to begin with, the flashbacks to start to get annoying after a while, especially when the series flashes back to something that happened just a few chapters ago.\nUltimately, when the cast is so massive, it certainly does give a lot of life and depth to the series, but also can be rather daunting to keep track of. Many characters are related to others, and other have ancestors who feature prominently in the series, meaning it’s actually quite important to keep tabs on everyone. This is fairly easy for the main cast, but remembering some of the more obscure characters can be rather difficult. This is perhaps one of the advantages the anime has, as seeing a character move and hearing their voice can make it easier to remember them.\nThe core group of characters mostly focuses on Naruto and his two friends, Sasuke and Sakura, plus their teacher/mentor, Kakashi. This group’s relationship remains a central theme throughout the entire series, and is fraught with plenty of drama and love triangles. \"Friendship\" is a theme so oft repeated that it may feel like you’re being bashed over the head with it, especially since Naruto has a tendency to attempt to \"friendship speech\" a lot of the villains he meets. At times, it’s pretty interesting, and Naruto manages to redeem a character thought to be rotten to the core. Other times, it just gets annoying. However, the idea of redemption is revisited rather often, and it’s worth dedicating some time to discussion.\n\"Naruto\" could have simply been a story about a ninja fighting his way to the top, defeating opponent after opponent as he does so. However, the series eventually starts to tackle some surprisingly deep and philosophical questions that are rather uncommon in a shounen. Naruto is faced with questions like \"How can you justify killing an enemy when it will only stir more hatred in the hearts of his loved ones?\" or \"what does it mean to be a ninja?\". Naruto is faced with an identity crisis at a crucial point in the series that added some very powerful depth to the series.\nOverall, the plot is incredibly engaging, and is likely the strongest part of the entire series. As Naruto grows in strength, he starts meeting enemies with bigger and bigger plans, until he starts to unravel a plot that is more dangerous than anything he’d ever imagined. With a series that goes on as long as this one, the stakes are pretty high by the time we reach the climax of the series. I think that’s why I grew to love this story so much over the years. There’s much more to it than punches and testosterone, and the series takes time to ask and answer some important questions about the world of ninjas along the way.\nNow, having said all of this, is the series really worth it in the end? Well, that’s hard to answer. The series does lose a bit of steam at the end, and I wasn’t particularly happy with the way the climax was handled. Everything is wrapped up story-wise, but I felt as though there were a few too many \"fake out\" moments. I lost track of how many times there was a series of events that went something like \"Oh, you thought this guy was the villain? Well…it turns out this OTHER guy was behind it the whole time!\" \nIt’s not uncommon for fans to feel a bit of dissatisfaction at the way a lengthy series ends, but I think this one had perhaps a few more unhappy fans than usual. Some of the character romances are handled a bit awkwardly, and the series started to get into some strange questions that never even needed answers. For example, Kishimoto attempts to explain where ninjas got their supernatural powers from in a rather convoluted series of flashbacks and long conversations between Naruto and others. Personally, I never really cared. I was just satisfied that ninja’s simply had magical powers in this world, and I never really questioned why.\nFrom my conversations with other fans, it sounds like everyone has at least SOME problems with the ending. That’s not to say it was utterly terrible, but it did seem like it lost sight of what actually made the series good for so many years. For many people, that sort of thing is a deal-breaker, and considering how long this series is, I honestly can’t blame them for feeling that way.\nFor me, however, it was still worth the journey. I started my journey with this series watching reruns of the anime on Cartoon Network, and after catching up to that, I started watching it online in Japanese. Then, after catching up to the Japanese subs, I started reading the manga. Then after THAT, I had to wait, week-to-week, for the next chapter to come out. There were spells where I didn’t read for a few months, but I always picked it back up again. If a series can hold my interest for that many episodes/ chapters (and even some filler in the anime), then there’s got to be something to it. No, I didn’t love the ending, but for me, the journey there was so enjoyable that I really don’t feel like I wasted my time.\nReally the best metric of whether or not you’ll enjoy this series is to simply read through the first arc of it. The first real arc of the series is 33 chapters long, which shouldn’t take all that long to read. This small chunk of the series is a pretty good representation of what the rest of the series is like, so if you get through it and STILL don’t enjoy it, then this series isn’t for you.\nI suppose that’s what you have to decide when you look at starting this series. Will I enjoy the journey enough to overlook its flaws and appreciate it for what it is? For many of you, that answer will be a definitive \"no\". But for others, I really do think you’ll enjoy this series as much as I did. Is it a masterpiece? Certainly not, but if you like shounens, you should at least consider giving this one a shot!\nNow, for those of you who are curious about the ending—whether you just want to know to sate your own curiosity OR because you want to know if the end makes the rest of the series not worthwhile—I’m including a \"spoilers\" section below, where I will discuss my thoughts on the ending. Read on if you wish, otherwise, thanks for taking the time to hear my thoughts!\nIf you’d like to read my analysis on the ending, you can follow this link (BE WARNED, THE LINK CONTAINS SEVERE SPOILERS):\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYAm2X2XRZ33LV1NKJesgWWFq1o3BYFEa9-UsI7zzPk"},

It was a long journey but I was quite satisfied with the manga, I also bought already 56 volumes and I´m definitely buying all of them. (SPOILERS)\nStory: [7]\nThe main plot of the story is the relationship of Naruto and Sasuke, and the main character Naruto. It is a typcial shounen manga, young *weak* boy trying to become strong, sad background story, creating all of sorts of friendships with \"bad\" and \"good\" guys. The whole story is very interesting, the tailed beasts, Akatsuki, Uchiha-Clan... I enjoyed it most of the time. But 700 chapters to get\n          \n        Sasuke back to the village is exaggerating. There were some times where I thought....wow thats boring. Plot twists were pretty weak. The biggest problem is that Kishimoto should have made it shorter, so that it would become more intense,exciting. Because towards the end it gets really messy, Akatsuki, Tobi, Madara, Kaguya.... too many power-ups and oponents in the end. But most of the arcs/story were/was still satisfying. \nArt: [8]\nI really like Kishimotos art, he even gets better and better, just compare vol 1 to vol 50. His style is unique and also has an emotional touch. I sometimes felt the sadness, rage, sorrow...in his art. The battle scenes are intense and exciting (Gaara:Lee / Naruto:Pain...), the sad scenes (Itachi saying to Sasuke: I will always love you)...damn that feels... \nCharacter: [8]\nI really like how he created the characters, it´s easy to remember them and to build a relationship to them. Kakashi the copy ninja, who the hell doesn´t like this badass. Naruto gets a little bit annoying with his attitude that he can protect the whole world, well the main charaacter has to be the dreamer, who never gives up. But to read every 10 chapter: I will be Hokage!....that´s also the reason why he isn´t my favorite person in the manga. Sasuke, the genius, the badass, the rival of Naruto also got some real problems... vengeance, vengeance, vengeance, oh my god 700 chapters for his damn revenge.... grow up! Besides Naruto and Sasuke, I never had a complain about the other characters. The problem is just that the growth of Sasuke and Naruto isn´t really existing. Yes, they get stronger, but there was no real depth in 700 chapters of the manga. \nEnjoyment/Overall: [8]\nNaruto is still one of my favorite mangas of all time. Kishimoto made a manga popular all around the world. Yes, Naruto and Sasuke are some kind of weak characters, the story got pretty messy towards the end, but all in all it´s still a wonderful journey of 700 chapters. If you like shonen, intense battle scenes, background stories, fascinating characters, a friendship of two ninjas who follow different paths of love and hate. Read it!\n        "},

Hope it helps!(As you can see, I am not very \"majestic\" with words)\nStory:6.5\nIt's one of those typical \"I want to become stronger to prove my worth\" stories with a bunch of other familiar ones like \"growing apart from childhood friends and eventually going against each other\". But it was executed okay. In my opinion, the earlier chapters were pretty good. And although it was nice to see Naruto and everyone grow up and develop, I was sort of bored of it at most bits after that. Occasionally there was a really good event in the story, and then\n          \n        it was \"meh\" again. The pacing is bad at some places and good at others. Some bits(like the big battle with obito, madara etc) just dragged on and on but I still read it because I've already come this far into the series. Overall it was okay: some bits were really good and others were really boring or dragged. It was also very detailed. Naruto, the series, has a lot of background history. You can basically write 10 essays on the history of Naruto.(just look at the wiki!)\nArt:8\nThe art is nothing special but it's still fairly good. Sometimes you can't see what's going on but it's better than some of the busy manga out there.\nCharacters:9\nI think the characters are Naruto's strongest point. All of them are unique and awesome in their own way and I always enjoy their interactions. There were a couple that annoyed me but the rest of the characters made up for it. It's a shame that some of the characters don't get as much screen time or get none at all(like what happened to yamato?!?) and the only problem I have is that some characters should get more screen time when it's APPROPRIATE. I kind of found in the chapters of the big battle with obito and madara, a page was taken up with just a flash of the other characters saying a bit of what they thought. That was pointless really. They didn't really contribute after that.\nEnjoyment: 6\nAlthough I pretty much rushed the start because it was so interesting, as the chapters went on I slowly became uninterested in the world of Naruto and reading each chapter became a chore. But of course there were some bits where it picked up again.\nOverall:7\nThe story starts to lose it's charm after so many chapters. The strongest part of the manga are the characters. You'll find at least one character to like in Naruto.\n        "},

At first, the art was crude, but full of life. After it became refined without losing in quality. Then, Kishimoto's drawings began to resemble the pitiful animated adaptation. It's final artstyle isn't bad per se, but it pales in comparison with, let's say, end of Part I.\nThe story? Well, the story began well. Naruto isn't exactly the most interest...No, write it off, he's not interesting. The supporting cast makes Naruto. Or break it.\nAnd god, it broke.\n          \n        Hard.\nMind you, the first two third of the series were good, sometimes excellent, sometimes mediocre, sometimes so bad you wanted to hit your head in the wall. But then, after 95% of antagonists are killed, we spend the rest of the series fighting two,three guys, with an army of mooks who can't even compare to the other guys, even with the other guys being part of it!\nIt is a long, endless conflict, that keeps dragging on, and on, and on, with \"twists\" that barely will make raise your eyebrow, our heroes don't even blinking at a suggestion of brainwashing, and the most stupid Deus and Diabolus Ex Machinas so our heroes and villains can keep fighting and feeding Kishimoto and Shueisha money. \nAlso, gotta sell that Naruto/Sasuke rivalry. Because that's what I came for in Naruto:  Naruto and his Bishonen Rival. And not only that, oh no! If you didnt like that only Naruto/Sasuke exist, we have made xerox copies of their rivalry all around! Hell, let's finish this manga with Naruto fighting one Evil Counterpart after another!

This series would deserve a 1 for the Final Third, we should rename \"The Thing That Never Ends when it could\". I saw bad mangas before, but I never saw the same writer go from somewhat good like Kishimoto to utterly catastrophic.\nAnd the end? The end don't matters really. It just a poorly disguised pilot for a Naruto GT.  It's not even a real conclusion. Hell, they already released the sequel, why care about a well-made ending? Hell, why we should expect it after such a poorly made final arc?\n\n"},
		{["score"]=9,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    Oh how do I post a fair review of this thing? This was the first manga I ever read, years before ever watching a single anime. So, I probably have some residual nostalgia leftover. But after looking back on it I think I have a better clue of what to make of it.\nSo, Naruto has a pretty simple premise. Uzumaki Naruto is a trouble-maker who wants to become the Hokage, but he can’t because spoiler reasons! I mean, you’ve heard this story before, most likely.\nThe best strength is the characters, no doubt. Naruto himself is likeable, but almost [key word \"almost\"] every supporting protagonist is\n          \n        memorable and all have distinct moves (something that Dragon Ball failed in). A lot of the battles are about planning and strategy, although that would slowly get kiboshed by more traditional Shounen stuff later on. The villains are pretty okay, at least some of the early ones.\nNow there are some things about it that, even back when I had \"first manga ever fanboy filter\" turned on, seemed strange. The most notable thing is the secondary male protagonist, Uchiha Sasuke. He’s a solid character (arguably). There were some early lines that genuinely made me want to know more about him, and he has some of the best fights and character interactions. However...\nI guess this is a spoiler, but a vast majority of plot developments can be traced to Sasuke and his clan. A lot of Naruto and Sakura’s character arcs involve not being able to last five seconds without knowing exactly what Sasuke’s status is at any given time. This gets annoying to say the least.\nOverall, I recommend you at least read the early parts of Naruto, and only press onward through if you like the characters enough from the early parts.\n        "},

And now that it's over...that's it's actually over and I'm overcome with such strange emotions...I just want to say: Naruto had something really great about it, it really did, I truly feel that way deep in my heart, and I don't know maybe is my younger self that fell in love with the first half of the story, but...I just wanna say it out loud. NARUTO HAD SOMETHING AMAZING ABOUT IT! IT DID!\nBut...it's gone, it died, it left, it tried too hard; hell, I don't know. I just know that I felt so underwhelmed with such strong imagery at the ending of  #698, Sasuke and Naruto lying on the floor with both their arms chopped off...crying and laughing! THE TWO OF THEM! My younger self would have been flooded with emotion.  I expected that my current persona would at least feel one third of what I would have felt years ago, but that didn't happen. I felt...barely anything, I felt myself forcing to care, my emotions felt so mechanic, and the moment I laid eyes on the stupid Boruto on the last number...I broke, something in me broke, I had to accept that the work of art I wanted to rate as a 10 when I was fourteen, had turned into a manga I could not allow myself to give an 8 at twenty...I mean, I guess it doesn't really matter, but it kinda does. I'm just trying to figure it out...how? How do you manage to get me so invested for then developing an ending with such strong imagery carved into it...for ultimately losing me entirely? How did you manage that Kishimoto? In this review I'm gonna try to figure that out.\nFirstly...too long, darn too friggin long. I'd said you had it going for you all over the place when they were young, everything that happened felt awesome, I loved the chunning exams, I loved the last fight between Naruto and Sasuke to a point I can't even explain...but Shippuden, let's talk about Shippuden, what a mess, what a strange fucking beast you created, there are legit great things to Shippuden, I loved Jiraya’s death, I really liked the whole questioning war and peace while making light of the irony of it (great thought provoker) and Sasuke's and Itachi's last battle (when they were both alive...stupid zombies). But I doubt that even reaches 150 issues all together, but somehow you milked that cow for 555 issues! You made something really valuable (at least to me) in 244 issues, and made something really forgettable, messy and tiring in 555 numbers, of which I only consider worth reading like...163, and I'm being generous.\nI think the problem was on how much stuff you tried to tackle, Mr. Naruto Man, you messed up, you wanted to cover everything, you wanted to give everyone an honorable ending, even that salamander guy that betrayed Nagato, and let me tell you I didn't care about him while he was alive, I CARE LESS WHEN HE'S A GODDAM ZOMBIE, why do you gotta do this to me?! I get that you love your characters and you think they’re all deserving of greatness and forgiveness for being the victims of the cruel ninja world they live in, but you know what? That cruel ninja world is based on our cruel world, and in our world not everyone gets to be revived and atone for their sins, or who knows, maybe one every 1000 years, but not every single one of them in the middle of a fucking shinobi war! But hey, maybe that's just me, maybe I'm making too much of a fuss about it, I’mma go to the cemetery get my grandmother's ashes and I'll pretend she's alive again, I'll make a great speech and I'll tell her that her sweet will of fire is all mine now, I’m sure that will suffice for EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IN YOUR GODDAM MANGA. Oh wait…it did, it WAS enough, you sick playboy. Talking about playboys getting it, screw every single couple of Boruto, I say it wholeheartedly; every single one of them made me cringe and regret ever laying eyes on a female. It felt like the Naruto fan club got a hold of that shinobi pen of yours and drew what they wanted to see, the difference was that instead of a shitty montage on youtube it was on the same pages were you drew those sexy jutsus you seem to like so much, it was like shitty fan service that one asked for, you serviced nobody by giving me INO AND FUCKING SAI, INO.AND.FUCKING.SAI. WE NEVER SAW THEM TALKING, I FELT NO QUIMESTRY, EVEN WHEN THEY ALREADY HAD A CHILD IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE IN A FUCKING WALMART AND THEY JUST BUMPED CARS BY ACCIDENT....okay, that's out of my system. But still, fuck your SasuSaku, your NaruHina and every concept of romance you hold in your brain.\nThat was rude, I apologize, but just promise me you won't ever write a romance centered anything, e-v-e-r.\nAnother trauma I have is the many traumas I feel you have, Mr. Kishimoto. Your traumas with brothers, wars were nobody fucking dies, and Furries. Who hurt you? I know your brother does manga, is that it? Did he do you wrong? Did he differ from your way of thinking so you chased him through life until 700 issues later you both lost your arms and could finally be honest and vulnerable with each other? Which was probably his fault, cause your ninja way is never giving up and his isn't? Am I on the right lead? Honestly, I don't know anymore, I'm just letting out steam to a mangaka that's never going to read this, so allow me to let out something that's not steam.\nI like the art, somethings are kind of messy, because he puts this rumbling effects that confuse the fuck out of me at fights, but I liked a lot of the art style, the way characters, the look of imageries, AND THE FUCKING FISTBUMP, holy fuck I just remembered that was a thing, another one of your traumas comes to haunt me. Who didn't give you a brofist? Was it pewdiepie? You probably could have used it to learn a few things about them, like the fact that they are not a mirror into another person’s soul.  that they miss sometimes, that they don't always look cool and people tend to be left hanging with them, if you wanted to brofist someone you just had to ask, dude. I mean it. Ups, I did it again, sorry, I'm going to get back to the good stuff.\nFights, some are alright, I hated all the fights after Naruto and the nine tails became tomodachis, but this is a sin many Shonen mangas tend to suffer from, when the characters become strong to the point when they are able to destroy the entire planet so every single thing they do feels so underwhelming cause you know what they are actually capable of...but whatever, maybe that's just between me and Shonen. \nOkay, I don't know dude, I liked some stuff, but I didn't really come here to talk about that, the good stuff feels like it happened in another show, with another me, the current me is so pissed at the way you ended it, the way I felt so disappointed to the point where I was forcing myself to FEEL something. 15 years of your life are gone; you created something that felt like a rushed adventure that lasted 700 issues during 15 years.  How you managed that? Pure talent, it just slipped through your fingers, tried to grab too much, you are the same criminal as Sasuke actually, you tried to teach us everything by yourself and your Naruto, because let me tell you another thing that bothered me, THE WORLD SHOULD NOT REVOVLE AROUND NARUTO, it shouldn't, that's the truth; at the beginning I dug it, it was a confined personal story about a boy, but then the story becomes about the world and your pursue to be the teacher at EVERYTHING for future generations; I didn't come for that man, I came here because of a struggle that I identified with, that felt personal, that felt like home to me, and I liked to experience that, see it through someone's eyes, and in the end I felt like your goddam ugly stupid shouldn't-have-been-born-kid Boruto; ignored by Daddy Naruto that had transformed into something that it didn’t need be, a God too busy being everyone's teacher by being nice, prefect and the center of the universe. At the end of Naruto I felt so detached to him...that now I realize that maybe I'm actually sad, not angry, that I lost a character I really used to care about. But, all things said, it is and it was your story, I don't know if you accomplished what you set out to accomplish, I don't know if you dragged it on so long just because you wanted to keep your space at Shonen as long as you could, I don't know how much you and your goals changed throughout the curse of Naruto...but I just want to say this for myself: it was worth it. It was more than worth it for the younger me that needed someone to inspire him, to fill him with a desire to keep growing and not to give in to loneliness and self-hatred, I needed someone to yell at my face \"YES YOU CAN!\" and I found it, and it moved me, it gave me a figure I needed at the moment, that's why I committed to finishing this, and that's why I did, I mean...I knew it wasn't going to be one third as good as I wanted to be, but...it ended up hurting more than I expected. I know a younger me felt it, and felt it hard once he saw the two loners laying without arms next to each other, embracing the silent love and care they both shared...but today I have to say goodbye to Naruto, not the way I wanted, not the way I ever intended to do, but the way I must: really pissed that it ended the way it did, knowing that I'm being selfish for asking you to fulfill MY expectations, and sad for having to say goodbye to something that meant so much to me at probably the lowest point in my life, Naruto, Masashi, you mattered, for a while you did, and then you went another way, you strayed from the path I was walking towards, but I'd like to think even now...you wouldn't mind, because the most valuable point Naruto was trying to get across is the importance of knowing you want something with your whole heart and are willing to work with yourself through thick and think to get as close as you possibly can to that goal, while never walking over others, but rather offering a helping hand to whoever you come across, and I don't know how I must look like in your eyes after the baby hate attack that I just had, but I just want to say from the bottom of my heart that I embrace those values to this day and keep trying to learn from a little someone that would have died before letting go of them, just because that was his dumb and stubborn ninja way. \n        "},
		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    I could try to give an \"objective\" review of Naruto based on the carefully analyzed qualities of story, art, characters, and overall enjoyment, but no, I really can't. I didn't read Naruto. A generation of weebs didn't read Naruto. We LIVED Naruto, through its highs and its lows, from the greatness of the Chunin Exams to the bloat of the Great Ninja War. Naruto isn't a manga. Naruto is puberty.\nIt started out all fun and games. I was in middle school, and this cartoon about super ninjas debuted on Cartoon Network. It had a guy who could use his hidden, red eye to copy his\n          \n        opponents. There was a mercenary who could make clones of himself out of water. The hero sometimes transformed into a naked lady. This show was everything you liked about anything when you were twelve years old. So when it took a two-week hiatus on Cartoon Network, I couldn't just be patient and and wait that short amount of time to pick up on the story. I had to beg my mom to take me to our local Borders(R.I.P.), so I could pick up those backwards books and see just what happened when Naruto and friends jumped across trees in that scary forest. From that point on, I stuck with the manga. I took a brief hiatus, but reading the Sound Five arc during a family trip to one of those boring-ass outlet malls reminded me that \"yes. These cartoon ninjas are pretty great.\"\nLet's fast-forward to the present. It's been two years since blondie finally became Hokage. Everyone agrees that the series should have ended sooner. Anime reviewers talk about \"their Naruto phase\" with total distain. Someone posts their 3x3 onto a forum, and Naruto is in the center. Then, they shout \"JOKE! I AINT SUM NOOB!\" They post their actual 3x3, and 5 of the slots are Legend of the Galactic Heroes.\nAre our cynical, twenty-something-year-old selves correct? Or is Jaden Smith  correct? If babies could talk, would they be the smartest people on Earth?\nI don't believe that Naruto's mid-2000s popularity was undeserved. Sure, there are Shonen out there that didn't piss otaku off at the end of 15 years. A story called \"the Great Ninja War\" has no right to be as lame as it was, but the Chunin Exams? The Sound Five? Pain? This series had some exciting storylines. Some exciting battles. Memorable side characters who probably deserved more time, while Sasuke deserved less, but I think Naruto became a phenomenon for more reasons than just \"kids are dumb.\"\nAnd, this isn't just nostalgia speaking. I don't have much nostalgia for the last 15 or so volumes of the story, but even that pile of dung had some diamonds in it. Gaara talking to his father again was a nice way to wrap up one of the series's more emotional subplots. We get to meet the 1st Hokage, and there's more to his character than just \"I was really good at fighting.\" A villain's backstory is told beautifully in a chapter without text. And, that final battle between Naruto and Sasuke: sure, the build-up was convoluted, but in the last volume, Kishimoto shows us that he can craft a tense battle in the comics medium: one that emphasizes harsh physical impact over dialogue and super magic. That last fight felt like the final ten minutes of a great wrestling match, and it reminded me that behind the editorial meddling and over-reliance on drawing assistants, Kishimoto does know how to work his medium.\nShould a newbie jump into Naruto right now? Well, I'd certainly tell you to give the early volumes a try. You can tell that Kishimoto was losing his creative energy as the series dragged on. What the artwork gained in clarity, it lost in dynamicism. I really wish there was less Sasuke, and I would have love if Kishimoto settled on one primary antagonist. But, for everyone who is ashamed of their Naruto phase: please, don't be.\n        "},
		{["score"]=6,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    Summary (TL;DR Version): \nNaruto is a manga that showed great promise in the beginning with engaging story, smart and inventive battles that developed characters in the process. However, as the manga got lengthier, the battles became \"who has the strongest superpowered attack\" rather than skills/tactics, some characters became one note and boring and the same flashback scenes that gave context to fights turned into Naruto’s own downfall by repeating several of them ad nauseum (too many times). It has memorable, yet hit or miss characters that, like everything else, start out interesting and varied but soon become infuriating/one dimensional and quantity soon overpowered quality. The\n          \n        art is good, but doesn’t really improve much after time has gone on. Naruto is a good example of a shounen overstaying it’s welcome and a display of all that genre’s best and worst aspects.\nPros:\n+ Initial great combination of characters, narrative and fights to make readers emotionally invested\n+ Solid fights in the first half that were exciting and thrilling \n+ Respected some characters (Choji) who would otherwise be used to laugh at\nCons:\n- Fights drag on FOREVER in the second half and become exponentially tedious and boring\n- Flashbacks also become boring and downright repetitive \n- Too many characters to care about equally, so many end up forgotten or their development entirely skippable\n- Protagonists who become deplorable and unredeemable due to their actions (*cough* Sasuke *cough*)\n- Skill is no longer a factor in fights and quickly becomes a showcase of who has the most OP jutsu\n- Too many chapters and could have easily be edited down severely to increase enjoyment \n\nOverall: 6/10\n\nNaruto started out with a very strong cohesion between narrative, action and characters. What I mean is that its own narrative enriched fight scenes. The Chunin exams are a great example of this. Tournament events are commonplace in shounen manga and many in it’s genre decided to develop the characters first and then put them through extreme circumstances. Naruto took a unique and strong approach by either introducing characters in said fights and laying foundation to develop them or using effective flashbacks as a method to tie the current and previous narratives of characters. Such techniques were used before and especially after Naruto was being made, but this was a real strong point for the series as it made me care more about the narrative and characters.\nThis didn’t just give us great fight scenes, it also gave some initial great character development. One concrete example I always use is a fight between a certain mist ninja and the trio of Sasuke, Naruto and Sakura (plus Kakashi). I won’t spoil what happens in the end, but not only did the fight display a good use of tactics, skills and intelligence to fight a stronger enemy, it also made our characters mature and even the enemy in this part became more sympathetic and likeable. It had a big emotional impact on me too, even prompting some tears to be shed. After reading this part, I saw what so many Naruto fans did and started enjoying it a lot more. \nThe characters are something of a mixed bag, especially as the manga gets longer. I won’t discuss all of them, as there are so many (too many) characters in the manga. I will mainly be discussing the main three and some other notable side characters.\nNaruto himself grew on me after an initial bad impression and became a likable and strong point of the manga itself. The main problem I had with his character is that his own message to the reader is slightly contradictory. It’s clear that he is an inspiration to those who feel overwhelmed by their own shortcomings or feelings of incompetence, yet have great potential underneath. The issue here is that his own resource of power/gimmick of a ninetails puts him so far above others that it undercuts the morale his character is trying to convey. He fails tests miserably and rushes head on into fights, yet appears head and shoulders above the rest in pure power so that the exams/battle tactics eventually become meaningless because of how overpowered he is. Which means it might be harder for others to look up to him when Naruto himself has an unrealistic advantage that makes him so powerful.\nSasuke is much less likable. He started out as a good foil and great example of how Naruto could have ended up after his own traumatic past. The problem is that in terms of character, Sasuke became as interesting as beige paint drying on a wall after the first half due to being so one dimensional. Past chapter 400, his character got increasingly onenote, unsympathetic and detestable. More than ever before, Sasuke was being defined by his past and his detestable actions later in the manga don’t help. \nSakura is a character who I liked for her tsundere attitude, but increasingly was shoved to the back multiple times, even when she became useful later on in future arcs. This frustrated me a bit, because I feel like her character could add a lot to the story and events. But she is put on the sidelines and rarely show off her strengths and continue to make her cry in a corner until Naruto or someone else can fix things.\nThe other side characters are also mixed with some being good (Shikamaru, Tsunade, Jiraiya) and some not so much (Tenten, Killer Bee, Kabuto). I did appreciate and respect how characters like Choji weren’t just comedic foil because of their body size and were given ample respect. \nAs for antagonists, they were alright but got worse progressively. Orochimaru was a serviceable and interesting villain, having clear motivations and fleshed out characterization. However, future villains like Madara became like those ridiculous final bosses with several health bars and powerful attacks that are downright absurd. \nThe art is generally good, though nothing groundbreaking. It’s consistent and unlike other mangaka with longer running series, the art never takes serious nosedives and continues to be steady, even when other elements aren’t. \nNaruto is a clear example of how more is not always better. The same flashbacks and fights that were so effective early on became tedious and boring, as we get fed the same information multiple times. These 700 chapters could have easily been narrowed down to 500 refined ones without losing that much in the process. \nAdditionally, some later plot twists and developments seem incredibly forced in order for the current character motivations or plot to make sense, sometimes taking giant leaps of logic that create plotholes.\nSo how does this all end after 699 chapters of inconsistency? Badly. Again, no spoilers but everything is so hastily rushed that it's clear that they wanted it to end, even at the great expense of more plotholes. It is especially shocking because Naruto took a great length of time developing characters who will and won’t have serious consequences on the plot. This ending felt like a slap in the face to anyone who wanted to see what happened to their favourite characters by dumping a sudden timeskip with little or often no explanation of characters at all. It leaves a really sour taste in my mouth and made me feel dissapointed. \nAs for recommendations, if you are already a fan of the Shounen genre, you have likely already read this manga. But to those who are newcomers, I would probably just skip it as the hype from fans is mostly undeserved and there are better manga like this nowadays (Boku No Hero Academia is probably the best alternative I can give here).

		{["score"]=8,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is a very divisive shonen, to say the least. Whilst many 2000s kids enjoy it and have nostalgia for Naruto, it doesn't tend to go past that. I will be reviewing both halves of Naruto, even though the first half on its own would score around a 9 in each category, the second half will also be counted with it (as an average between the two).\nStory - 9\nThe story of Naruto starts very simple, but gradually builds up as it goes on. It sets a stable foundation and continues to build it safely, to a point at least. I would say the story and\n          \n        it's pacing goes at an absolute low in the last third of Naruto (The 4th Ninja War Arc). This means it can't reach a perfect score of 10, that it definitely had potential for, but couldn't live up to it.\nArt - 7\nI have to preface by saying, Naruto's art is in no ways bad, but it's lacking compared to the other big three. It doesn't have the natural quality of Bleach's art or the energy and style of One Piece, but it has something. The first half of Naruto did have both these things and had something Bleach and One Piece didn't have, characterization solely based on design. After the time-skip, the character designs became extremely simplistic and lost its quality.\nCharacter - 8\nNaruto has a very diverse cast from the gentle but awesome Hinata to the tactical genius Shikamaru. The problem isn't the lack of good characters but their lack of screentime, or in this case panel-time.\nEnjoyment - 8\nI enjoyed Naruto a lot when the pacing wasn't absolute crap. This mainly speaks for the last 1/3 where everything went downhill.\nOverall - 8 \nI recommend reading Naruto, if you have time to do so, but save your sanity and don't read it all at once.\n        "},
		{["score"]=7,  ["helpful"]=0,    ["text"]="          \n    Naruto is one of those anime's where...The story is ok. You got your boy hated by everyone trying to 'BECOME HOKAGE!' while constantly trying to be murdered by other people. Now, im going to talk about the Characters. The characters are probably the best part of the show. although, Naruto can be bland, Sasuke is annoying, and Sakura is hated for no reason, its not the main 3 i like- its the side characters. \nI found myself wanting to know the Backstory of Shino, Tenten, And more. But they were pushed under the carpet. And what REALLY made me mad was that it wouldn't even\n          \n        explain some of the VILLAINS backstory. Take Hidan for example. he killed without holding back, he's a psychopath. I wanted to know what his backstory was, but nope. (SPOILER'S: he died 4 episode's after he was introduced, and then a filler came.)\nI feel like all the interesting fights, Like the Kakuzu and Hidan vs Shikamaru Choji and Ino fight, were cut short to get back to Naruto and Sasuke yelling at each over for 20 minutes. \nOverall, its a good anime but i recomend the manga\n        "},
